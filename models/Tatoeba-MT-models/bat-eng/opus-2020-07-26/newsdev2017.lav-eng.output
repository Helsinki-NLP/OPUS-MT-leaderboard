New questions on the California water supply project
Critics and state legislator say that they want to know more about who pays for the 16 billion dollars worth of the project supported by Governor Jerry Brauna, according to a representative of the leading California Water Supply Board, saying that Brauna's administration is offering government funding to complete the construction of two huge water tunnels.
The critics claim that the government financing described by the Los Angeles metropolis water administration could run counter to the state's long-standing allegations that different local water authorities, other than California, would pay for Brauna's vision to excavat two equal 35-mile tunnels to send water south of the Sacramento river, mainly to Central and South California.
Initial expenditure on tunnel construction of USD 248 million, which still needs to be authorised by the supervising authority, has already started a federal audit investigation.
On Wednesday, the lawmakers of the state also commissioned a state audit for the construction costs of tunnels.
On Thursday, Nencia Vogela said that despite the Los Angeles metropolis water management account, the money from the general budget of the state will not be used to complete the current planning phase for twin tunnels.
However, the tunnel opponents and a group of taxpayers were critical on Thursday, and the Assembly representative Suzan Ega, one of the co-legislators of the state that stands behind this week, asked the state for clarification.
"It's a game with bribes," said David Wolf, legal director of Howard Jervis's Taxpayers' Association.
I think it is called yesterday's audit (demand): there are many more questions than answers.
The tunnel project has been approved by Braun and some politically influential water and water consumers in Central and Southern California.
The supporters claim that tunnels will benefit the environment and provide a safer water supply for the Palestinians.
The opponents claim that they are concerned that the State will use tunnels to divert too much water from the Sakrament River and the San Francisco Bay, to harm North California and to further threaten the local species.
Metropols and other water supply administrations intended to receive water from tunnels still have to commit themselves to pay for them insecurity as to whether investing huge funds will actually provide enough water to repay it.
The same water authorities announced this year also that they would not pay for the completion of the current preparatory work unless the project was first authorised by the monitoring authority.
On Thursday, the monthly report on the tunnel project published by the Los Angeles Water Management Board states that "the State has indicated that additional funding for the completion of the planning phase will be allocated from state or federal budget funds."
After all that the local water authorities have spent on the project, including USD 63 million from his water administration, "is expected" that the state will use public money to complete planning," said Bob Muir, speaker of the Los Angeles Water Management Board.
He next moved the questions to Vogel, the State Spyker.
Vogel said that the state intends to allocate money for the completion of tunnel planning from a fee for the existing half a century old water network, the Statta water project.
The opponents of tunnel construction point, however, to a regulatory framework issued in 2009, which, according to them, prevents the state from spending money on the construction of tunnels, while the water supply authorities, which will benefit from it, will not assume a payment obligation for them.
"Project contractors have promised to pay for this project, and they have used financial tricks to circumvent these commitments," said Patrija Šiferle, environmental consultant and old planned tunnel opponents.
This raises questions about where this money was found suddenly.
Business group addressing the Chinese Cybersecurity Act
The coalition of international business groups has addressed China with a request to change the proposed cybersecurity rules by warning that they will harm trade and isolate the country.
The letter to the Chinese Prime Minister, Li Kecjan, has been signed by 46 groups from the USA, Europe, Asia and Latin America, showing global concern that the rules could restrict or suspend access to the Chinese information security product market.
The signatories are the US Chamber of Commerce, the European Services Forum and groups from Japan, Korea and Mexico.
The proposed rules require suppliers to show the Chinese authorities how security products operate and how information about Chinese citizens will be stored in the country.
The last letter dated Wednesday says that this could make data stealing easier and less accessible to Chinese customers.
Chemical explosion in Tiangan: a year since tragedy
Zhang Mengfan claims that the company deserves to know what happened in Tiangin.
The Chinese leaders intend to keep a quiet memory of the first anniversary of a large-scale chemical explosion that killed 173 people, but not everyone agrees with it.
John Sadvort reports from Tiangin.
Almost anywhere else in the world, such an anniversary of a major disaster would be the moment that the nation remembers and remembers.
However, not in China.
Although the memory service of some dead firemen is held in Tajina, such memorial measures are excluded elsewhere.
The media controlled by the Communist Party have been told what they can and cannot be said, and some survivors as well as family members of the dead have been warned not to speak to the foreign press.
Yet, 23 - year - old Zhang Mengfan does not want to keep silent.
"This anniversary, the public should know something about what happened," he says to me.
I don't want silence.
On August 12, last year, Zhang was a radio operator at a military fire brigade, located just a mile from the epicentre of explosions.
"The call tonight was received at 22.53, and we started sending my teammates," he says.
At the event, they could arrive within 10 minutes.
Commands from other parts of the city also rushed to rescue the large fire in the chemical warehouse.
None of them drew attention to the fact that large quantities of volatile and toxic substances were unlawfully stored, well above the permitted quantities and without proper monitoring.
The fire started when it was permitted that a batch of nitrocellulose - a chemical used in nail varnishes - would dry and then burn in the summers.
It then spread over a huge area of 800 tonnes of ammonium nitrate fertilisers.
In the explosions windows and fire station were played, where Zhang Mengfan was waiting for news from the radio station from the location of the event.
This information was also not received.
"When I saw a mushroom cloud, I fell in despair," he tells me.
I knew what that would mean for my friends.
Of his 26 firemen who were sent to the explosion site that night, eight never came back.
Many others suffered severe burns and other injuries.
The biggest of the two major explosions was likened to an earthquake, and the explosion wave was felt many miles away.
The total loss is estimated at more than $1 billion, including over 300 damaged buildings.
Overall, 173 people lost their lives, 104 of whom were firefighters.
The remains of eight people have not been found.
The official government investigative bodies clearly blame corruption, political contacts and official secret agreements, which allowed circumvention of the rules and disregard of security systems.
First, such a warehouse should never have been built near residential houses.
More than 100 officials and company management representatives have started some form of disciplinary or criminal investigation.
Thus, while the government can point to the progress made: thousands of houses and compensation for the population, these sensitive issues are still topical.
Tradition has revealed a gap in a system where rapid economic growth is a priority and the lack of independent supervision is a fact.
Even so, the sense of courage and responsibility of the evening is undisputed, and yet, without fire as the image of the hero, it does not seem to be a very pleasant scene.
It is a firefighter as a victim sent without a background in the fight against a man - made disaster that could be prevented.
Zhang Mengfan no longer works at the fire service, but he will attend the memorial service in Tiangin.
He will send a message in his heart about the dead.
Most of all, I would like to say to them: I have visited your parents and are doing well.
Leave your parents for me.
I am now a member of your family.
I'll do your duties as sons.
Cold spring might have an impact on the shoot season of Scottish rubbers
The Scottish rubbing season will start later, as this year the number of birds has fallen due to cold weather.
The shooting has been postponed in a number of properties, as many of the young rubble have not survived in the cold spring conditions.
Noting the beginning of the season, Scotland’s Association of Gaming Actors (SGA) says that the shooting of rubles provides more work than the Edinburgh festivals.
However, the Animal Protection Charitable Fund OneKind calls for an end to the murder of wild birds.
Harry Huyton, director of the organization, said: "The work that is invested in a large number of shooting birds is a huge and undoubted amount of contentious activities."
It is no surprise that society is turning away from this so-called sport and calls on the government to ban cruel, unnecessary work that only a very small part of Scotland's population is enjoying.
The land owners, however, insist that they commit to keeping the number of birds and that the shooting of rubles is important for the development of the rural economy.
Alekss Hogs, president of the SBA, said that the industry provides 8 800 full-time jobs per year in the most remote regions and that it was a "rich labour street" at unsafe times.
He said: "In comparison with many European countries, Scotland has not been so rooted in the "hunting" culture, and part of the population does not know how the shooting season affects the country in economic terms."
Hogs said that the number of jobs provided during the shooting exceeds the number of jobs created at the Edinburgh International Festival, at the Frindge Festival, at the tattoo festival and at the Old Year's evening celebrations together.
He added: "The situation of employment in Scotland is now rather worrying, especially in the oil and gas sector, so the players and their families want to see the industry's prosperity.
We want to work with the Scottish Government to ensure that hardworking people can rely on these jobs in the future as well.
RSPB Scotland believes that at least eight golden eagles have been killed near the rubble’s habitat.
Many game operators recognize that rubbing is not generally popular, but the SGA claims that the industry "has taken important steps forward in terms of best practice."
The opening day of the rubbing season is traditionally known as "The Holy 12."
However, there are still many discussions about this type of sport, and the management of rubbing sites is linked to persecution by some environmental authorities.
On Thursday, the RSDB Scotland said that in less than five years, eight golden eagles were missing in the mountains of Monadliata, southeast of Invernesa.
According to the Nature Conservation Charity Fund, they have been illegally killed near rubble shooting sites and their satellite recordings have been destroyed.
The Scottish Minister for the Environment, Rosanna Kaningema, said that these reports were "very worrying and sad."
Mrs Caningemas instructed officials to analyse evidence of about 90 surviving and missing eagles with transmitters in order to determine whether there is a trend in criminal activities.
The Scottish Tyler Group blames the RSPB for trying to escalate the burning sensations before the beginning of the rubble season, and also mentioned that there was no clear evidence that birds would even have died in the mountainous region of Monadlita.
Rio Olympic Games 2016: British Peige The United Kingdom won silver in the trampling of the spotting
Peige, British representative, won a silver hack
Brion Piedja has become the first British woman to play with the medal in the Olympic Games for a tragic attack on the Rios, fighting silver.
Peige (25) had lost 0.425 points to gold because the Canadian representative Rosanna Mclenana had already won the second Olympic title in a row with a result of 56.465.
World champion, China's representative, Lee Dana was at bronze, while the second British finalist, Katrina Driskola, was finalized in the sixth.
I can't believe I've fought the Olympic medal.
I'm so happy," said Emotional Peige.
I had no idea that it was a medal, but I was able to show the best performance, so I was so happy that all the exercise and hard work had paid off.
I'm so glad that I could start with Ket in the finals, one representative's participation in the finals would be historic, but we were there two.
Paidge’s highest achievement in international competitions was the fifth place in the 2015 World Cup in Denmark.
The bombing of the Olympic Games was introduced in 2000, and this is the first time British women have managed to get to the finals.
The response to the medal.
The British team’s representative, Nathan Bailey, was in the exaggeration of men’s competition on Saturday.
Hanna Velana, who participates in the Olympic Games for the second time, quickly began to praise the Peedge's achievement.
Peige has obtained a bachelor in biology with excellence at Shephind University.

Fiji begins an unprecedented celebration in its history of the first Olympic gold medal
The banks closed, shops were hard and the parties took Suvas streets, danced, singing and joyd
Fiji got a gold medal, at Deodoro stadium regby-7 final with 43-7 destroying Britain.
Thousands of people in the whole island country stopped their usual work to watch the historic game.
Fiji celebrates the destruction of its first Olympic medal in its history
Many of the fellows were dressed in Fiji’s colours and looked at in shirts, bringing the national flag and encouraging the team.
When played for the end of the sweater, the embarrassed singers went on the streets, laughing and dancing.
"Some people even stopped their vehicles on the full streets of Suwa and joined the celebrations with the flags of Fiji, would not turn to the slight congestion they created," reports Fiji Times.
The celebrations will certainly continue on the weekend and next week.
Irish Prime Minister: Finn Harps 0-5 Derry City
Aaron Macenef took two first half-time punishments for a siege in Finnpark.
Derry City has risen to the second one in the Prime Minister, gaining a convincing victory with a score of 5-0 in the fight against Finn Harps.
Aaron Macenef put forward a "confessional stripe" under the leadership of successful implementation of two first half-time sentences that were granted for violations against Luke Schubert.
Nathan Boyle hit the gate at the beginning of the second half, and Shubert beats the opposer in the fourth quarter before Kitty frond's late hand in closing the opponent's crash in Finnpark.
Derry is one point ahead of Cork City, and both teams will meet in the decisive game on Monday evening in Brendivel.
It was Derry's first victory over its north-west competitors in this area, and they were interfered with me on the HARPS side.
Macenef saved the hit of the opening of the game 17 minutes after the march of C. C. C. C. C. C. C. C. C. on Schubert, even though the violation turned out to be outside of the penalty area.
There was no doubt about the second shot of punishment, the former King Strupe's cousin Barry Moloe putting Shubert down the ground and McFaef to get a result of 2-0 a minute after a break.
Boys put the exact point after Dīna Jervis's hand in the middle of the eighth minute after resuming the game.
Derry City Gatesargam Gerard Dohertie had a peaceful evening, but he managed to protect the gates perfectly by overcoming David Cally's guests in the best opening of the game.
Shoter took the ball to Cole before he ran out at 83 minutes, and soon he followed the Ward's smart face over Richard Brass, the chief guard of Harps.
It was Derry's biggest victory in the series and great preparation for the final game with Cork.
Test at the University of Invernes University of the College of Highlands and Islands (UHI)
The entire 20 student course could have failed at the UHI of the Inverness College.
Most of them were 17 and 18 - year - old students who hoped to use the mark they received in their studies to enter university.
Inverness College UHI argues that quality assurance processes are applied, adding that the Scottish Qualification Authority (SQA) investigates this case.
The SQA Press Secretary said that the country-wide assessment of the highest media in 2016 was "trusted as intended".
Twenty students signed up to the course offered and evaluated by Inverness College UHI.
Many of the students were young people living in rural areas who had been trained online, but often had to go to Invernes College from their places of residence, such as Locheiber.
One student said that after his daughter’s publications in the social media that she had not received any evaluation for her work, at least 10 also made a statement that she had not received any evaluation of her course work.
He said to the BBC News Scotland directist that about five more people who learned this course at the Invernes College last year and with whom they were able to communicate said that the same thing happened to them.
The situation means that his daughter cannot provide a place at the University of Glasgow, but she will be able to accept the offer of another university thanks to the qualifications obtained at the school.
However, her father also said that there were others who attended a media course organized by college, which was not successful and who were now "forgotten" and insecurity about whether their course work would be reviewed and evaluated with a mark so that they could join universities.
Invernes College UHI is part of the University of Elders and Islands.
Diāna Rovlinsone, UHI CEO and executive director of the Invernes College, said: "We have exam results and student success very important."
This is also demonstrated by the excellent review of the Education Inspection (HMIE) of Her Majesty's Education, as well as by improved performance levels both in continuing education and in higher education compared to recent years.
As we carry out an overview of all the results published each year, comparing them to those expected for each student.
In the case of this particular course, standard quality assurance measures were taken and the assessment body recently reported "significant improvements in the provision and management of this evaluation" and confirmed that "the assessments were in line with national standards."
SQA is currently investigating this case at our request.
The SQA Press Secretary said: "We are pleased that the evaluation of the highest media in 2016 has been as planned and that candidates had the opportunity to show their understanding of the subject."
Many candidates have shown good performance and there has been a slight increase in A-C performance compared to the same qualification last year.
It was drawn up in accordance with previous and model documents and with our course and evaluation specifications.
Brothers put in prison for samurai sword "asinpirts" in Kilmarnok
Jason Braiden was attacked with samurai sword, knife and nunch
Two brothers in prison for the murder of a man with samurai sword after the drug-relatedft in Airshire, which turned out to be "asin spirit".
The River Jason Braiden (38) was intercepted several times in his home in Kilmarnok on 5 July 2015.
At the high court in Glasgow, James Clark (36) will be sentenced to at least 22 years in prison after being sentenced to murder.
His brother, John (38), was sentenced to 10 years in prison after being sentenced to less serious charges of murder without a prior intention.
When both men were sentenced to prison, Judge Bill Danlop told the brothers that they had done "a cruel, cruel and wild attack."
He rejected any assumption that Mr. Braiden was sleeping and waiting for them, armed with the samurai sword.
Judge Danlop added: "You are planning illegal entry with at least one knife and a nunch."
Jason Braiden may have been a drug addict, but he was a son, father, and friend.
You killed him.
After being imprisoned in prison by both men, the criminal police officer who led the investigation said: "Jon and James Clark's violent and terrible actions have led to the death of Jason Braiden."
When she reaches her age of 38, there is a plight of the heart that the family needs to survive.
The Court heard earlier that the brothers from Kilmarnok decided to rob Mr. Braiden of the gold bracelet they had given him in exchange for drugs.
Both of them went to his house under the influence of alcohol and drugs, masking their faces with scarves, armed with a knife, and the fight against the east.
The sword used in murder is believed to belong to the deceased.
The villagers said that they had seen the Clakus attack on Braiden when he sat on the couch at the window and heard him shouting.
Prosecutor Richard Godard said at the hearing: "The attack on this man was a chaotic one."
Then the murder site was described as "blood alcohol".
In addition to the injuries from nail stains, Braiden's attack struck a severe injury with a trull object.
Three days later, he died in Kilmarnok's hospital.
Both brothers don't recognize murder.
When presenting the evidence, James Clark, who had previously been judged 38 times, including the murder attempt, said, "I didn't want it, it was an accident."
John Clark, who had previously been judged 23 times, said that he just engaged in helping a brother who, he said, was attacked by Braiden."
A man was sentenced to prison for shaking and killing his baby’s age son
David Sinkler acknowledged his fault of murdering a child in his home in Istkilbread in 2012.
A man who shaked and killed his babies’ anger in an outbreak because he did not want to eat, was sentenced to seven years and three months of prison.
David Sinkler shaken his four-month-old Joshua when he "residually lost control" of his home in Istkputbread, South Englishshire, on 6 December 2012.
The cause of death was found only after a judicial medical examination.
Synker (34) was initially accused of murder, but was found guilty of murder without a previous intention.
In the High Court of Glasgow, adjudicating him a prison sentence, the judge, Lord Breiseyll Sinkler, said: "You attacked your baby's age son by shaking him, creating injuries from which he died."
When you searched him, you had to know it, but you did not reveal it.
Only after serious medical examinations have you become aware of the problem.
Your wife believed you.
Now she feels transferred and can no longer support you.
Lord Breiseyll described the consequences of Joshua's death as "catatrophic" for all and added, "Nothing will return Joshua."
In the past, the court found that, on the day the child died, Sinker and his wife Kērstie had gone with Joshua to swim and shop in Istkilbre.
5.30 Kērstija Sinklere went to meet her mother and sister.
Just 11 minutes later, Sinkler called her, who heard the "showed".
He said to her, "I don't breathe like I'm coming, I just need to go home."
Then he ended the conversation and called 999.
The baby was immediately taken to Hermiar’s hospital, where she died.
The cause of Joshua’s death was not clear at first, but was examined by a team of judicial medical experts who found the consequences of the injuries that occurred shortly before the death in the eyes and brain, and such injuries could not be achieved by chance.
One of the experts, Dr. Peter Richard, a child neurosurgical consultant at the John Redcliff Hospital in Oxford, said: "It has happened because the child has been shaken and has been injured, as well as struck with greater strength than day-to-day."
Defence representative Jan Jugid said to the court that Sinkler's "extremely sorry" done.
Rio Olympic Games 2016: Chloja Taton is threatening Julia Jephimov's position
British representative Tatone slips away from handbronze 200 m swimming
UK representative Hloya Taton criticises the participation of the controversial swimmer Julia Jephimova in Rio after the Russian representative has taken him out in 200 m swimming.
Mr Jefimova, who was allowed to participate in the games following a complaint about a ban on participation on doping, won silver, leaving Taton fourth place.
"I would have liked it to be completely clean games," said a 20-year-old bicycle swimmer.
That's not what I said.
I'm not satisfied with it, but that's what it is.
Jeffimova, who won the second place, learned about his participation in the games only three days ago.
I don't want to see how people get out of sports, but I don't think it's really right.
She did not have to take part in the competition, and a 20 - year - old British representative had to fight a medal.
Rie Caneto won the seventh gold medal for Japan in 2016 in Rio, overcoming Jephimov, which was at silver medals.
The Chinese representative of Jinlinga This was at bronze, only about six-six-century centimetres ahead of the Tatons remaining in the fourth one.
Her British teammate, a 20-year-old Molly Renskov, finished the sixth.
"The remaining fourth place is a little disappointment, no matter what you are in front of," added Taton.
It's a great experience, and I'm a little disappointed about the fourth place.
I'm so close to the medal, and that would have been a dream.
Even so, meeting the finals is a great experience that I will take with myself in the years to come.
It was a little disappointment, but in the long term it will make me strong, and it makes me more and more like medals, so hopefully I'll get closer to it next time.
Only 0,01 seconds behind the British record of 200 m swimming finals.
"Every person must give a second chance," - Jeffimova.
Jephimova, who said that she was tired of answering questions about her doping past, defended her right to start Rio.
In 2013, she was imposed a 16 month ban after her body was found to have anabolic steroid traces.
The Sports Arbitration Court (CAS) stated that athletes cannot be denied participation in Rio because they already have appropriate sanctions in advance.
CAS examined my complaint and I won.
If someone doesn't like it and someone else has another opinion, they can turn to CAS," she explained.
I do not support doping, and I have never used it.
In the second case, it was certainly not my fault.
Everyone must have a second chance.
When you're driving and issuing a penalty receipt, no one's putting you in prison.
Bens Pražs is playing a place in 50 free-style swimming
In the past, he set up a British record to win a place in the 50m freestyle finals.
The Union champion Prus (21) ran the distance in 21,54 seconds to qualify as the fifth fastest for the Friday finals (02:44 BST Saturday).
Your delegation is shameless and rude
In India, the Minister of Sport Vijy Goels Rio Olympics has been a rather striking personality, often seen in tribunals, encourage Indian athletes and take selfies after their starts.
However, he and his extensive company obviously have provoked the anger of Olympic game operators because of their uncontrolled behaviour, rehearsaling to break down to the competition zones without appropriate accreditation and gross reaction, being tested, the Indian news agency Press Trust of India is being told.
Vyy Goels, photographed in July, justifies his behaviour.
On Wednesday, the organisers of the Olympic Games threatened to cancel Goel's accreditation if his behaviour did not improve by sending an alert letter after he and his company tried to enter restricted accessibility areas in the field of exercise competition and on the arena, where obesity and squeaking took place.
"We have received several reports about the fact that your Minister for Sport has tried to enter accredited competition zones with non-accredited persons," writes Sara Petersone, the continental manager of Rio 2016's Committee of Organisers.
When the staff tried to explain that it was not allowed, the people together with the minister became aggressive and rude, and sometimes disappeared to our staff.
"If our protocol team becomes aware of more of such behaviour, the accreditation of your Minister of Sport will be cancelled and his privileges in Olympic Games will be cancelled," was mentioned in the continuation of the letter.
The leader of the Indian delegation called this case "a blouse out of the fly," and Goels himself said that he had done nothing wrong by writing it all as "a misunderstanding".
He wrote on Twitter: "How do I know we've complied with all the rules.
We support the spirit of the Olympic Games and support our Indian athletes.
Otherwise, these Olympic games are quite gloomy for India, yet there is no medal yet.
The lost fans in the social media pointed out that Michael Falps had fought so many medals - 26 - as India in its history.
Several prominants have already been excluded, including shooter Abhinava Bindra, who won a gold medal in Beijing in 2008.
This time he remained the fourth.

However, there are still some bright expectations, as there will still be competitions in boxing, golfing, tennis, lightweightity and, yes, badminton.
The only Indian gymr Dip Carmara will try to jump at the finals on Sunday, showing his terrible double speed "Face of Death", a Produvė jump that has been tried by just a few other gymrs.
In a country with 1.25 billion people, India’s low number of medals has always been the cause of the indignation.
The analysts say that there are countless reasons for this.
National passion is a cricket that is not an Olympic sport.
India has not fully invested in infrastructure and training for the Olympics - Carmara's first training tool was made from the original spare parts of an old Sterster.
Parents have always emphasised the superiority of academic knowledge on sport.
And the authorities responsible for sport have been taken over by corruption.
The International Olympic Committee has suspended the Indian Olympic Association for its violation of its Statute in 2012 as it elected leaders against whom criminal proceedings have been initiated.
In Sochi, three participants in the winter Olympic Games in India were even denied to represent their country, carry a flag or wear anything with the national symbol.
They competed as independent athletes.
When people get injured, the JetBlue plane, shaken by turbulence, is forced to land in South Dakot on the route between Boston and Sacramento.
JetBlue's plane was forced to make an emergency landing on Thursday night after 22 passengers and two crew members were injured during the event, reports the CBS Sakramento.
Flight 429 from Boston to Sacramento landed in Rapidscia, South Dakota, shortly before 19:30 p.m. after the local time.
The airline says that the wound has been sent to the hospital for checks.
JetBlue claims that it has sent the personnel to help the wounded, a backup flight to Rapidsitija to transport the rest of the passengers in Sakramento.
Drug Control Agency (DEA) misses the possibility of medical marijuana
The answer is, unfortunately, unlikely.
This is a missed possibility that may further delay treatment in many people.
Until today, there is only one approved source of scientific use of medical marijuana at the federal level for scientific purposes at Mississippi University.
Today, the DEA has also announced, obviously a little more positive news, that it will now also allow other places to apply for the same authorisation.
There is hope that the quantities and diversity of marijuana available for scientific purposes could expand.
Although it will attract attention as a focus for the study, it will be, to a large extent, symbolic, since it does not matter how much marijuana is available if access to it is still difficult.
Imagine a product that is highly demanded, but is stored behind closed doors.
In response to the demand for a product, what makes a difficult decision to produce it more, but get and it never shuts down the door.
This product is marijuana and its location in list 1 is the locked door.
In such an unpleasant situation, there is medical marijuana.
Since marijuana is a substance included in list 1 (considerably, it "is not currently approved for medical use and there is a high potential for unforeseen uses"), there are significant obstacles to closing the door.
Potential researchers are generally first resorting to DEA, as it grants permission to launch scientific research.
Even if a permit is issued for the study of substances included in Schedule 1, institutions must comply with very stringent safety rules and set up high-level safety systems that may be costly.
There is also a more subjective consideration of the granting of authorisation from its academic institution to conduct, in particular, studies on substances included in Schedule 1.
Even if certain representatives of the Faculty wish to carry out this study, university management may not want problems or any potential side effects due to negative press reports.
This was the case at the University of Arizona, when Dr. Sushi Sisley was released from office after his efforts to advance the trials of medical marijuana.
Finally, it had to seek private funding for its project, and only in April, seven years after the initial project was proposed, her project became the first medical marijuana trials approved by DEA to address post-traumatic stress to the veterans.
After years of struggle with bureaucratic obstacles, then the last key to the lock has been the National Institute of Drug Independence.
At the moment, it is the largest national funding for the study of marijuana, and it is the only supplier of marijuana itself.
Even if research into free circulation leads to a higher amount of medical medicine, the Institute will still have to confirm all the research it finances.
However, the problem is the name 'unsatisfactory use'.
Dr. Donald Eibram, representative of the San Francisco University, interviewed his documentary Marihuan, says that the Institute's main task is to investigate substances in the context of their potential addiction, not as medications.
Ebram draws attention to an important fact.
Even if the study overcomes all the obstacles listed above, the door can still be closed if the intention is to study the benefits of medical marijuana rather than its damage.
Note: In a search for rapid (and, admit, non-scientific) in the United States National Medical Library, 1,434 works on medical marijuana have been discovered in the last five years.
In the same search, only 57 works benefited from medical marijuana.
Most of the studies were about the damage caused by marijuana, for example, "A Bad trip due to the anticholinergic effects of marijuana", "Marijuana-induced pancreatitis" and "the use of marijuana and the risk of lung cancer."
This disproportion creates a rather distorted picture.
The road to the use of medical marijuana is paved by surprises and hypocrisy, where the view can be seen.
While DEA is taking on list 1 status without considering medical effects, the U.S. Department of Health and Social Affairs at the same time retains cannabionic patents for wide-ranging medical purposes.
DEA continues to set marijuana alongside heroin and LSD as a drug with high addiction potential, although the DEA’s main administrative law judge, Fraensis Young, objected to it.
Strongly medically speaking, marijuana is safer than many widely consumed foods.
For example, feeding 10 fresh potatoes may cause toxic reactions.
To compare, it is physically impossible to eat so many marijuanas that death occurs.
Marihuan in its natural form is one of the safest therapeutic active substances known to mankind.
Rally analysed, marijuana can be safely used in medical care, under adequate monitoring.
The judge of DEA himself has to say once again.
And yet, almost 30 years later, little has changed.
Whether we are aware of it or not, all of us accept a certain amount of hypocrisy in our daily life.
Maybe we don’t always have the power to make it loud or we’re such a moss or that nobody seems to have noticed it.
As regards hypocrisy in the context of the federal medical marijuana policy, endurance must be required to present the facts in a constant manner.
The lives of patients, such as Charlotte Fiji, whose seizures are reduced by medical marijuana, and many others are dependent on it.
The fact that the plant can bring so much benefits and still be behind closed doors is worth talking at a higher level.
Bloody Beetroots: Donald Tramps "Blondas Berluskoni"
Bloody Beetroots is known in the context of electronic dance music
Music says Tramps dominate media like Berlusconi
You know, we in Italy are used to the Berluskoni, and for me Tramps looks like a blonda Berluskoni," the founder of the electronic music panic association "The Bloody Beetroots" said CNN.
The candidate for President of the Republic and Italian media magnet as politicians, both known for their exaggerated personalities, their ability to attract press attention and the changed story of the media.
In the composition of Bloody Beetroots, Rifo is known for his electronic dance music and has collaborated with various artists, starting with the legendary Sera Paul Martany and ending with the electric pop singer Greta Svabo Beč in the song "Chronicles of a Falcon Love".
Rifo was born in the Italian city of Basano del Grapa, in the vicinity of Venice, in 1977, which coincides approximately with the time of the pancroque, and the figures "1977" are placed on the chest by a musician.
"The English is not my native language, so I don't understand everything about your world," Rif said, hiding behind the black fees he's known for.
I'm trying to explore, and I've tried to improve my understanding of your culture.
Rifo called on Americans to watch "Environmental Sciences", a documentary film that explores the Berlusconi monopoly on Italian media.
The documentary is about how "Berluskoni made Italy crazy," said Rifo, adding that Trampa had a similar influence on America.
"You see how a man can completely cut the system and put everything down... by his own," he said.
I think Tramps is not good for this country.
Two Turkish sailors have been imprisoned for over $500 million in the drug case
Two Turkish men were sentenced to more than 500 million pounds of cocaine smuggling on board a ship in the North Sea, each being sentenced to at least 20 years in prison.
Mamin Sahin and Emin Ozmen were found guilty after the trial in the High Court in Glazgov, after about 100 miles from the coast of Aberdeen on the MV Hamal deck, three tons of A-grade drugs were found.
The arrest in 2015 is the largest one-off cargo of cocaine that has ever been detained at sea in Europe.
Mamin Sahin and Emin Ozmen were sentenced to prison for their role in a large-scale drug business
On-board significant drugload is one of the largest in British history
The drugs were found hidden in a specially equipped ski on a tug in Tanzania sailing from Istanbul to Tenerife and then to the North Sea.
It was suspended by the British fleet fregate "HMS Somerset" and by the border force's drum "HMC Valant".
Sahin (47) was sentenced to 22 years, while Ozmen (51) in the Supreme Court of Glasgow is sentenced to 20 years.
The judge Lord Kinkleiven told men that the amount of drugs was "not only substantial but ambitious" and the smuggling of drugs has a "creating effect" on people and the surrounding society.
He said: "You were involved in the commercially most significant operation, including the transport of cocaine by ship, a operation that crossed the international and truly intercontinental boundaries."
He said that the ship's captain Sahin was not "a drug at the top of the wood," but he played an important role in the criminal offence, while the second captain, Ozmen, was "something less".
Inspectors climbed to Hamal on board after having entered the French customs office for DNAED, and when it came to Aberden, they drilled through the steel plate, accessing a secret section where 128 bags with a weight of 3,2 tonnes were found, as the approximate value on the black market is 512 million stripes.
MV Hamal was tested last year by the royal navy.
There were three tons of cocaine on board.
The inspection of the vessels found that its ballast tanks contain tons of A-class drugs.
The ship was on the way from the Bosphorus Strait to South America before it was stopped in the North Sea.
Access to this place was discovered under the closet in one of the crew’s crew’s facilities, and the gap was overcame.
Sahin and Ozmen were found guilty of transporting and hiding cocaine on board between 20 February and 23 April last year, and of supplying cocaine between 21 April and 23 April.
Both unholy men who have worked in the shipping industry since the school was over continue to claim that they are not guilty, but take the jury's judgment.
Four more men have been accused of lack of evidence.
Sachin's lawyer, Jonathan Crrow, said that the married father of two children is "a glorified stone."
He said, "Who was involved in drug trafficking."
Someone who was able to drive a ship.
By looking at the drug hierarchy, Sahin is definitely not at the tip of the drug, but somewhere below.
The huge amount of cocaine on board the ship means that it was to be taken off by the road bank
The police days went through all the ships before drugs were divided into these boxes
On February 2015, the court listened to Sahina with questions about his captain's work on Hamal.
Mr. Krov said that it was "showed" about passing the events of important daughters (9) and son (13) and "just wanting to go back to Turkey".
Both men have not seen their families since their arrest in April 2015, because families are still struggling to obtain visa confirmation.
Osman's lawyer, Di Mur, said that he wanted to see his family "falsely" but knows that it would not "be possible" in the future transparent.
Talking to the judgments we heard today, Scottish prosecutor David Harvey said: "There is no limit for international drug trafficking, and we are working closer together to achieve one step ahead.
"The success of Scotland in the persecution of criminals is indeed at global level, and in this case we have done considerable economic losses to the representatives of organised crime."
The drugs were blocked in every gap on board the ship, including under the floor.
The inspectors of this smuggling package found hidden in the boat's laundry
Mr Harvey added: 'Hamal' was identified by intelligence instructions from the French authorities, and by rapid cooperation with the General Prosecutor General of Tanzania, where the ship is registered, who also allowed to climb on board the ship.
"Our investigation then came from Guyana, which gave us access to relevant data on consignments, to Spain, which provided us with very valuable information on the ship's stops in the Canary Islands.
We also worked with colleagues in Denmark, Norway and the United States to bring together specific elements of evidence.
Despite the profound intelligence that Hamal is carrying a large amount of drugs, the British authorities' representatives in international waters could not climb on board without the permission of the Tanzanian government - something they had never allocated before.
Suju Petan, head of the International Justice and the Combating of Organised Crime (CPS), said: "By taking a quick and precise approach, the CPS criminal justice advisor managed to obtain permission from the Tanzanian authorities to board the ship within 24 hours of receiving intelligence.
Under international maritime law, British officials shall not have the right to climb in international waters on board a ship under the flag of another State unless that State grants a special legal authorisation to do so.
Without the rapid action of our criminal advisor, there would be a great risk that the ship could escape and that we could never call these people to justice.
Photographer Brian Romeižn captures the deadly "Eastern Exprescent" train
Photographer Brian Romeijn from Rotterdam took the picture of this lost train in Belgium
The pictures show the interior of the train, the broken seats, the dust windows and the narrow car cab
It has already been named Eastern exprescent wagon, but it was owned by the Belgian national railway company
The urban explorer has taken these remarkable photographs, which show the destruction of the remains of a passenger train that once was one of the best means of transport.
The flower times have long passed, and the train wagon and locomotives have been left in the train depot in Belgium, where they have become the object of popular photography and adventure surveyers.
Photographer Brian Romeijn, 40, has taken these terrible pictures, showing the inside of the train, shattered seats, dust-based windows and the driver's cab
The train wagon and the locomotives are left to blow up the train depot in Belgium, where they have become the object of a popular view of photographers and adventure seekers.
These trains were a symbol of luxury when they worked with legendary names between 1883 and 2009.
The Belgian national railway company used Locomotives about 50 years ago.
After 126 years on the rails, the last train under the name of the Eastern freighter went from Strasbourg to Vienna in December 2009, concluding the famous stage of history.
The Eastern expression was famous for the Paris-Stumbula route.
When it was launched in 1883 (Operator - La Compagnie Internationale des Wagons- Lits) it was known as French "Express d'Orient".
It became Eastern expression in 1891, and by 1930 it already had regular routes throughout Europe.
This should not be confused with the private "Venice Simplin-Orient-Express".
There are very few "Compagnie Internationale des Hagons-Lits" luxury wagons left.
In this narrow car cab in which the equipment in the basement is still fitted with measuring instruments and open wire, it is visible in this photograph.
Romeis said that the driver's cab is "in a sense claustrophobic, and the noise of the locomotives must have been inconceivable."
The lost locomotives and wagons have become the object of popular photographers and adventure seekers.
After visiting Belgium after the forgotten train, Romeindž MailOnlineTrawl said: "I really felt as it was used in its flower times."

The father is expelled from the children's school for wearing a T-shirt with a lima name
The father of two children has been expelled from the children's school for coming to their sports day in T-shirt with an offensive inscription.
A good Macbet (36) from the town of Burnley in Lyrashire says that he "does not wear" a shirt with the inscription "Lažys and Dr.am!"
However, despite the fact that, when he noticed his my seed and put a T-shirts in the opposite direction, on the next day he found that he was prohibited from entering the school territory.
The only father, who for four years worked as the head of the park's primary school in Kolne, Children, could not come after children because of the ban, and staff even called social services and police.
A good Macbet (36) from the Children says that he was not entered into the school territory after having arrived in an offensive T-shirts on the children's day of sports.
Mr. Burnley accused the school director, Sarah Mijlie, of being too sharp.
He says that he is wrong to punish for that, before going to watch his two children's race, the mistakes made T-shirts in a hurry.
A father who no longer works as a school leader said, "It was a mistake and a lack of attention from my side."
I didn't think about the sports day and rushed into it.
At the end of the event we had a father's race, and the director noticed my T-shirt and said it was not appropriate.
I apologize and cut it to the other side, and that concludes with it.
However, a 36 - year - old man said that that evening he had received a letter from the president of school leaders inviting him to a meeting with the Director the next day, but he did not see the need to do so because he had already apologised.
"Then the school principal called me and said I'm not allowed to enter the school territory," said Mr. Burnley.
I learned that after the day of sports, some parents on Facebook were worried about it and that many people were interested in it.
Any person who is concerned would say that it is exaggerated.
Mr Macbeth, who is the editor of the online magazine Love Mini, said that he was not even able to come after the children on the last day of the semester because of the ban.
However, this led to a call from school and social services.
On the T-shirt was the image of Kreiga Charles Lister from the BBC cult comedy, the "Red Lace" with one of his iconic expressions "Lažme and Dr.am."
He commented: "I told them I wasn't there because I'm not allowed to enter school.
Then I was called from the social services and asked why I wasn't after my daughter.
The school also called the police because I haven't come after my daughter for 40 minutes."
Mr Makbeta claims that he was told that he could no longer appear in school premises and that the ban would remain in force until further statements were made.
He also said that he was warned that he might be fined $500 if he was caught in violation of this rule.
Sarah Mijlie, director of the park’s primary school, said that this case had now been closed.
Sarah Mijlie, director of the park's primary school, said: "I can confirm that Mr. Makbeta has resigned and is no longer our school manager."
This case has now been closed, and I hope to return to my normal school life in September."
Children’s advisor, Joe Koony, said that the school had clear policies and guidelines.
"We all have to bear in mind that when taking on positions such as counselor or manager, you are subject to higher standards, and unfortunately he did not meet those standards this time," he said.
Professor Jonathan Nixon added that he did not think that the school should have imposed a ban on him and that a elephant was blown out of the couch.
Mr Nixon added: "The wearing of this T-shirt was stupid, and he also apologised for it."
The police confirmed that they were calling from school but did not arrive.
In recent times, the premises of the former VEF factory, located in the Liberty Street, have been renovated - there are several IT companies, the industry has already started to call this territory the local Silija valley.
The rest of the VEF area, including the Berzaunes, will also develop.

Ombudsman: Demagogy on a compulsory health insurance model with an additional financial burden for citizens does not remain any criticism.
Any demagogy as a compulsory health insurance which would impose a direct and high burden of payment on citizens does not remain a criticism of the Ombudsman Juris Jansons.
Janson met today with Health Minister Anda Chuckch to discuss the health situation.
After a meeting, Janson told journalists that the sectoral financing model proposed by the Minister of Health is sustainable and developed health care systems, making it more accessible to patients.
He noted, however, that in this case, there was a need to talk about additional financing for healthcare, as it was not enough at the moment.
Janson also stressed that any demagogy on compulsory health insurance, which would impose a direct and high burden of payment on citizens, does not remain a criticism, especially in the case of the Dutch model.
Jansons said that the Netherlands gives 11% of gross domestic product to health while Latvia is only 3%.
The government and Parliament must therefore be responsible enough to understand that the model proposed by the Ministry of Health (VM) will not work out from this point of the suffocation, expressed by the Ombudsman and added that otherwise.
Chaksh thanked the Ombudsman for his support and pointed out that the main concerns were that the patient would be with a doctor, which in turn means that the healthcare system needs additional funding.
The Minister noted, however, that with an additional EUR 35 million planned next year, only the most acute cases of oncological patients and the remuneration of labour specialists could be made.
Consequently, the VM has developed a plan and submitted a request for an additional EUR 41 million for healthcare to reduce the number of professional manuals and examinations.
"The question of priorities, whether there will be funds for it or not," said Chuckha.
This sum does not include any increase in remuneration for medical practitioners.
Commenting that the doctors were not excited about the fact that VM's review in the government led all three versions of the model of health financing, including the one providing for additional payment to patients, Chuckha said that moving all three models gives the government the opportunity to choose.
Jansons also added that moving all three models clearly shows that Latvia is not ready to impose additional burdens on the population.
It has already been reported that VM will defend the variant of the health care financing model, which does not imply an overall increase in the tax burden, but requires that part of the social tax be channelled to health, according to the summary of the conceptual report "On Change in Financing Model for Latvian Health System".
At the same time, the Ministry indicated that the best option for the financing model for health care will be chosen as a result of discussions by the end of September.
The local watermelons are already ready.
Arbūzis, the owner of the Arbūi, in the region of Grobkini, recognizes the Arjus municipality’s owner Rolands Damims.
Watermelons are already available on the Liepaja market.
A number of early breeds have begun to grow, but the more late tubers are well abandoned, the regional newspaper Course Time is known.
"This year the arbūzis grew better than last year," says the great berry grower in Rucava district Artis Ķussis.
In the face of time too, this is a much more favourable summer than in the past when it was cold and windy.
Guests of Liepaja theatre started in Riga.
On August 12 and 13, at the Daile Theatre in Riga, you will visit Liepaja Theatre, offering to the audience the performances nominated for the "Playman Night" Prize, as well as the bright intrigue - the mono-developing of the Liepaja Theatre Director Herberta Laukšēna, the portal "Delfi" is informed by the representatives of the theatre.
On the evening of August 12, the audience will be shown by director Laura Groza-Ķibere.
It is a story of a real historical person - John Merik - who lived in Victorian age in London and in his Crop, the deformed body of an inherited disease called a Blueman.
At the exhibition the title is represented by Actor Egons Dombrovskis, who received the Year Actor's nomination for Merika's role.
As the critic Normunds Akots described in his performance, Meriks is the role "through the heart released" in which the born image is not repeated."
On August 13, the audience will be offered a show "Portreti".
The performance received six nominations for "Sgame Night", including "Share-Share-Show of the Year".
The director created the exhibition as a peculiar portrait gallery, with equal importance for every image of the plays, so each one of them has a center and a background.
The performance consists of a number of mini-shows that end up in unity.
It is a observation of the nature of a man, where the main conflict is between true emotions and cold-blooded calculations, revealing in a bright way how a person changes in different situations - each of the heroes is sometimes a wolf, which, because of its softness and its own benefit, flattenes the surrounding sheep, sometimes a sheep that is broken by someone else.
In both of these dates, the small hall will be played at the Riga Theatre Director Herbert Līkaline monosthesis "Man who drives from the elevator" in the Gaļina Poliščuks grid.
It's not a sad story, but a humorous story about how a guy's only friend becomes a elevator.
Despite the style of the cemetery, which dominates the performance in the visual image, the dominant intonation of the exhibition is, however, bright and even optimistic.
"A man who drives from the elevator" is not about decision of loneliness and age, but about the value of life to love.
Even if it seems that there is no something," the critic Līga Ulberte wrote about the show.
Tickets for all productions can be purchased in "Bilette Paradise" boxes and on the Internet.
Detective Olga: My job is not a series, but a real life.
Olga Zelika, the owner and investigator of Riga Detective Agency, is waiting for me on my halfway.
She laughs loudly and makes a very positive impression on a person.
Flee in white panties and white jackets - a very elegant woman who robs me of all my ideas about what the woman-detective should be.
She's expecting me to be a Champagne, from which I'm kind of giving up.
I told you I talked to her, because I thought it was interesting that a woman was dealing with such an unusual thing.
This is always the work of men.
Olga has higher legal education - Master's degree.
He used to work in the criminal police.
Having realized that he wants something of his own and founded his own company.
Knowledge of this is modest.
"I really didn't want to return to the party," Olga says.
It's a routine.
There, in the criminal police, we investigated things, collected information.
We're working with suspects.
"This year we celebrate the 10th anniversary of Riga Detective Agency".
She calls for the anniversary celebrations: "There's no drinking."
Everyone is promised people.
Asked about her business, Olga says so: "Business is very specific."
I had a team for the first five years.
Then I realized that it was sometimes dangerous to work in the team.
This is a business where someone who does not work professionally can find himself in a very bad situation.
If journalists have the fifth power, then we are the second.
The sphere is, of course, not simple.
Many try to break us down because we engage in fraud.
May people think so!
Many come and ask if you can put listening equipment, attract dogs.
Many have seen movies.
Detective business is serious.
"It's information collection," Olga says.
If the law is a crime, I have to be warned about it.
We jam the green tea and laugh, so there's at least a cup to which we can stick and negotiate.
I've had a client whose husband is constantly hit.
She was looking for protection, of course.
We also have security.
Her husband was a manic.
At first, everything is always beautiful and good, but then begins.
"It's the most terrible one," Olga says.
Psych is broken, and it happens that you can be treated like a livestock.
This may be a bad thing.
God does not give it to suicide.
It's very dangerous.
People are becoming victims at a point.
"Many women are trying to leave families and then come back again," she says.
I refused the last order.
"It happened for the first time in my life," said Olga.
There was such a strange situation.
She was married, she had a son.
"His husband hit his son and made him disabled," Olga remembers.
I believe that the woman is a mother instinct, and first of all, we need to protect her children.
When all this happened, she came to me with a request to get a man out of it.
There are people who are obscene with relentlessness.
The worst thing is that Mother turned her eyes to it.
I can't understand that.
Her child is now disabled.
We couldn't find the body once, and the dog helped.
The drug department can't do it without dogs at all.
"I understand that there are adequate people and that there are those who don't have a sound psychotic," she says.
Of course, the facts of fraud are relevant.
Or divorce takes place in the family, and information needs to be collected.
Finding who is the guilty party.
The last thing I have had was on the subject when friends have deceived other friends.
It's interesting, because ever men jump, now women.
Even the best friends fight!
Women's "reject" friends for 100 and more thousand euros.
Women need to be careful when going abroad because they can be sold in slavery.
"Latvian women are intelligent and too trusted", Olga believes.
There have been cases when couples go abroad to marry again.
It's not legal.
Olga tells us that she had a man like Jesus Christ.
Long height, long hair.
When I was 22 years old, a tragedy occurred.
He had a severe head injury.
He returned like a completely different man.
"I pulled him out", Olga remembers.
It could be compared to hell, it was terrible.
Asked what is the most unusual thing you've ever encountered, Olga says: "Everything is special, but it's the fastest thing that makes use of confidence."
When the girlfriend throws the girlfriend.
He takes the money and don't give it back.
If you have legal education and experience in the police, you can work as a detective.
"One thing is to feel as detective, the other to be," Olga says.
The situations in which we deal with distrust are very serious, as women are often not prepared to resolve the situation.
They are not ready to accept the result.
This is an unpredictable situation because a person is not prepared to lose his family.
Not every woman is ready to accept reality.
Often young girls who feel the taste of money use rich married men.
One man who tracked his wife said that she can't be that she's not loved, because all his wives have cheated on her.
"He was married three times," Olga remembers.
Then there's a man's problem when all wives cheat him.
Olga relates the case when a woman with all her children left the man, and she asked him if he had ever raised his hand against him.
Actually, I'm constantly standing down and he's answered.
In such cases, I refuse to work.
It seems interesting to me how things are solved - whether photographs are taken and if there is evidence of fraud.
How is this going?
"The protection of personal data of natural persons exists in parallel to the detective work", Olga says.
This is a provocative issue.
One law allows you to do everything, the other allows you nothing.
We can accept such photographs and videos for personal interests, but no public survey.
If material which does not comply with the law is presented to the court, then there may be major problems.
To become a detective, education and experience are not enough, it is also necessary to be mentally healthy and meet the criteria.
We don't take fingerprints, the police are dealing with it.
I tell the clients - disconnect from the series, here is a real life!
In fact, when I worked in the (police) system, dogs had to be used too, they were very helpful.
"There's no room for drugs at all," Olga says.
Some clients turn to me in the investigation of murders, but I don't like to take such things.
It's very hard things.
There are now more and more clients of men, as women tend to complain about men.
It used to be different.
Now women are entertaining, but men are sitting at home with children.
"Of course, good people are suffering the most," it's Olga.
I like Dale Carnage.
He says stop worried and start real life.
We all know about it that if you hit one face, you have to turn the other, but you can't!
I have to say you're unpleasant.
This must not be done.
You must not be afraid to lose the life that is hindering you!
You can't become a little boss, and there's something happening to us that we allow to do with ourselves.
Yeah, my first thing was directly related to the husband's mistrust, when a woman was not ready to accept the fact that the husband cheated on her.
She always called and asked her what to do.
"I'm now asking all the clients whether they're ready to accept the situation when they find out that their husband really cheats on him," Olga says.
It's not entertainment, it's life.
If you come and wage detective, you have to take responsibility.
It's not a theatre, a show, but a real life.
I'm also a specialist.
It is a heart thing and associated with Japanese medicine - treatment by hand.
It's a very interesting thing.
Why did I start working with it?
It is associated with a large amount of adrenaline, and yourself need to be calmed down somehow.
Reiki not only calms, but restores energy, lights.
"People get out of my office positive and satisfied", Olga says.
She's got signs on her wall in the office, and Olga says that they're not writing them with a brush, but with their fingers.
I didn't just get to that point, the book I needed literally fell into my hands.
I felt it as a sign.
However, it is very personal.
You need to learn more about it here.
Olga also sings.
That's her horrific pleasure.
We're all afraid of creativity.
I've been playing guitar for 11 years.
I have recorded songs and clips.
I'm positive and smiled, but I have to rest in order to rebuild.
Others save alcohol, I need you.
Alcohol sinks.
It is a lot used in the police, because the work is full of stress.
"It causes aggression, and moves can be unpredictable," she says.
I'm interested in sport and need.
I've been doing tennis for 15 years.
I liked riding horses.
I turned off nature, articles, and I'd like to write a book.
Detective work has a fine limit when work enters your life.
"This is a job that shouldn't be put into life," she says.
Asked how you can combine work with private life, Olga says: "My beloved person is in Italy."
We have very strong feelings.
It must be the greatest love in my life.
I need to think about him, and I feel better.
The detectives usually do not trust, but he has accepted my work.
Actually, I separate my work from my private life.
I'm not in this business either.
Reiki has set me up.
When I was a child, I saw more than others.
Thanks to the needs, the intuition opens.
There's a lot of detectives, but it's a little real working.
In any case, it is work with the brain, and it is hard to disconnect.
You also need rest.
"You can't restore another," Olga admits.
The most serious case I have worked with is the Konstanci story.
I'm working on it for a year.
The man literally disgusted about that woman.
I did so that my mother and child left for England, and they went from danger.
There was no other option.
We should not regret ourselves.
We're looking for compassion.
You can't do that.
We have to be happy about every day what we have.
Thank God.
Every day three good things have to be said to each other.
Make a good job or take a day for yourself.
We can't do that to men.
It's a big mistake.
You know, we have a man next to us, not a child, and we need him to take care of us.
If not, turn and go away.
You can go to church, I've been very helpful.
You don't have to be a fanate, but do what you like and help.
Nothing will change without change, need to go away and change your life.
Under no circumstances should you put yourself and your children at risk.
You shouldn't sit down and wait.
People are created to do good and to support each other.
If God has created us, we need something and we are not in vain in this world.
You can't sit on the spot!
How better to prepare for your family photo.
The summer is still in full swing, and the next school year, which families may experience in their photos, is immediately present.
For everyone to look happy and beautiful in pictures, it is worth considering how to prepare a photo before.
Tips "Ihappymama" are provided by many children's mom Aleksandra Nesterenko and professional photographer Marina Levickaja.
I have to take a picture in nature, because it's much more natural and harmonious.
During the study, it is more difficult for children to get in and relax.
It is recommended to choose a uniform dress style for the whole family, preferably in a single color nature.
For example, Alexander says that she chooses clothes for all six family members so that she can have clothes in maximum three color shades and as little as possible on clothing.
Don't forget for a good mood.
Have fun, joke, play, but in any case don't deny or psych, unless children are not as obedient as they would.
And, behold, the following tips are already sounding from a professional photo file!
You have to understand exactly what you want to capture during the photo shoot and tell the photographer about it.
For some, they will be beautiful, acurate children and a perfect family picture, for others, "life is what it is", namely, a desire to see real, true emotions in the pictures, or, as you love to say the photographer himself, "the fleeing back", "open eyes", "break the nose".
Of course, one may also want "two in one", but this is rarely happening.
In any case, when you go to the photo shoot, you have to understand that it's just a couple of hours from your life, and the less you're gonna be shouting the better.
You yourself are neither a strong mom who works, prepares to eat, grows, and continues to grow, nor an ever-ending dad who speaks on the phone.
And not the man who lives in you behind some unknown shell.
Be a family, remember how great it is to hug each other, to smile on your own, and to have fun.
And then the photographer's task will only be to capture the real moments of emotions between you.
If you have chosen a photographer, trust him.
Stop 250 times asking to show what has happened, listen to his advice in choosing clothing, place for better shots.
Fold and crush all the clothes you need in advance so that you don’t have to handle it again on the day of the photo shoot.
Plan a route and consider how long you will need to get to the photo shoot site (especially when photography takes place in a studio and time is limited).
If you have small children, choose a time for a photo shoot that corresponds to the day-to-day routine so that it doesn't happen when your baby usually sleeps the day.
And, of course, never forget to take with children food, cookies, water and favorite toys (moon and sweets to be used only in extreme situations).
It is prepared for Dad that he may need to take the socks off, but it is not usually written in such tips, and only the photographers know what the problem is, she admits.
Do not drink much water before the photosession and lie down well.
And it would be advisable to have someone together after the photo session.
Go to the park for entertainment, eat some ice cream, take care of the skate skates - which one of my family would like more.
This will bring you great pictures and pleasant memories of the whole day spent together.
Krasnopjorov and Fadejeva: Making minimum wages - a miracle or brake for the economy?
The issue of raising the minimum wage in public debate is almost the status of the holy cow: either promotion must be supported, or there should be no telling, general phrases.
In view of the considerable increase in the risk of economic stagnation (just as the snubs have avoided the technical recession), it is important to stress that raising minimum wages is not a miracle that alone reduces income inequality, brings Latvian wages to Western European levels and will fill the state budget.
On the contrary, if the minimum wage is too high, it is causing more damage than the benefit, because raising it reduces the competitiveness and employment of businesses, especially in sectors and low-income regions.
At first moment, it seems that despite several increases in minimum wages during the post-crisis period, the minimum wage in Latvia is not so high that raising about the usual few dozens of euro per year would significantly weaken the competitiveness of businesses - only 370 euros, while in some European Union (EU) countries the minimum wage is about one and a half thousand.
However, a different picture opens up when we compare it to the average wage in the country (%) - the minimum wage in Latvia (44%) exceeds the EU average.
Since the proportion of recipients of minimum wages in Latvia is significantly higher than in neighbouring countries (Latvia - 17%, Lithuania - 11%, Estonia - 6%[1]), a similar increase in minimum wages is binding for most enterprises.
According to the results of the survey of Latvian Bank of Latvia, each fifth Latvian company replied that, as the minimum wage increased at the beginning of 2014, it was important or very important to increase product prices.
This means, firstly, that the increase in minimum wages was partly financed by consumers (i.e. Latvians); secondly, price increases for several companies meant loss of competitiveness both on the domestic market and abroad (i.e. increased imports and limited exports).
Due to more competitiveness and smoking production, it was important for almost 15 Latvian companies to lay off their employees (which means more unemployment and emigration).
In addition, almost every eleven companies replied that it was important for him to limit the recruitment of new employees as a result of raising the minimum wage.
It is worth remembering that in 2011-2013 the minimum wage in Latvia did not change.
Therefore, even if each fifth company noted productivity improvement as important in assessing the 2014 minimum wage improvement, this does not mean that a similar result could be expected also in 2017 (the fourth successive increase in minimum wage could lead to productivity gains).
Another important result is that due to the increase in minimum wages, it was important for a number of companies to increase also the remuneration of employees earning more than the minimum wage.
Thus, the effect of the minimum wage was significant even for companies that did not receive the minimum wage from any of the employees.
In recent years, the increase in minimum wages in all three Baltic countries exceeded the increase in nominal labour productivity (real productivity + inflation).
Thus, the further rise in labour productivity will have a negative impact on the competitiveness and employment of businesses, without any further increase in minimum wages (even though the overall low level in euro is quite low).
The analysis of average economic indicators is not enough to assess the validity of minimum wages.
It should also be assessed whether raising the minimum wage is "payable" in sectors and regions where the minimum wage is used most frequently.
The results of the survey of the Bank of Latvia show that the highest concentration of employees with minimum salaries is in small enterprises (the number of employees is from 10 to 19 employees; 25%).
At the end of 2013, in industry and services, the share of employees with minimum wages was higher (16% and 19% respectively) than in trade (15%), construction (11%) and financial and insurance sectors (2%).
On the other hand, Latgale, with a minimum wage of 64% of the average wage (and more than two thirds of the average wage in the private sector), may be more likely to harm further growth by reducing labour demand (i.e. maintaining already high unemployment) and contributing to the sustainability of the shadow economy.
Some indications show that the implementation of the minimum wage litigation in 2014-2015 (a total of 27%) has slowed the development of Latgale.
For example, Latgale is the only region in Latvia where unemployment was higher in 2015 than in 2013.
It should be noted that there is no region in Estonia and Lithuania that is so far behind the average wage from the rest of the country.
In Estonia, for example, the average wage in all regions is at least twice the national minimum wage.
In Lithuania, the lowest wages are in the Tauragree region, but there was also 54% of the average wage in 2015 (after two rapid minimum wage increases in 2016, this figure could reach 58%).
In public debate from time to time, the call for a minimum wage of up to 68% of the average wage in the country (see, for example, here) lacks economic justification and is not feasible in the short-term or in the long-term.
Firstly, there is no EU country with such a high number of average wages, or even so near.
Secondly, this would mean raising the minimum wage above average wages in a number of sectors of the economy (which would mean bankruptcy and mass redundancies in these sectors), such as clothing, leather production, fish processing, catering, as well as veterinary services; it is more than the current average wage in the private sector in Latgale.
Increasing the minimum wage from January 2017 to EUR 400-410 per month, as currently offered by the Ministry of Welfare, would make the minimum wage in Latvia (% of the average wage) one of the highest in the EU.
If nominal productivity increases by 4% and the minimum wage is at least twice as high, it has a clear negative impact on the competitiveness and employment of businesses.
Such negative consequences will be most common in sectors and regions where the current minimum wage has been used, for example, in Latgale.
The fact that we cannot afford a significant increase in minimum wages at the moment means that other mechanisms should be used to support low-wage recipients.
The immediate effect can be achieved by travelling a minimum (in budgetary terms) of personal income tax.
Insufficient levels of education, inadequate education and poor quality of education acquired, as well as unsatisfactory health conditions (which often arise without addressing the cost of medical services and long queues) are among the real causes of income inequality.
During the survey 521 Latvian company’s response to the increase in minimum wage in January 2014 was received.
The survey was carried out within the framework of the Wage Dynamics Network (WDN) project of the European System of Central Banks.
These figures shall be representative of companies with a number of employees of not less than 10.
This also explains the share of the low workforce with the minimum salaries in construction.
On the last day of the day, 11 fires were registered in Latvia, and operational information from the State Fire and Rescue Service (VUGD).
The major fires in Latvia were located in the municipality of Ogres, Ogresgala, where a single-storey dwelling house was burned in an area of 80 square meters, and in the city of Jēkabpils, the open flame was burned with broken slices in an area of 30 square meters.
On Thursday, firefighters also went to calls involving waste, tyres, two light cars, wall of the building, ceiling, chips, roof of the dwelling house, and an incinerated food left unattended.
During the night, the service has also been involved in 21 rescue operations.
Deaths, victims, or rescued people are not reported.
In total, during the last 24 hours, VUGD reacted to 38 calls, six of which were misleading.

Russian vice-president in Riga meets secretly with the SZZS ministers.
Dmitry Medvedev, Deputy Prime Minister of Russia Arkadijs Dvorkovics last week, met three SZZS politicians - Finance Minister Dana Reiznieni-Ozol, Minister of Transport Uldi Augolis and Minister of Agriculture Jānis Dūklavs, wrote on Friday a portal "views.lv".

Dovorkovich explained that it was not a question of government but an energy company.
Contrary to diplomatic practice, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not been involved in the conversation.
Dūklavs has justified this because he has not seen such a need, because "the Minister of Foreign Affairs is on leave", writes the portal.

Legendary editor, Hafington, left The Huffington Post.
Arianna Haffington, co-founder and editor-in-chief of the influential U.S. media holding The Huffington Post, has announced departure from the company after 11 years of work.
The Huffington Post award, created in 2005 and awarded by the Pulicer Prize, offering both serious policy and economic journalism daily and ensuring that internet sensations are reflected in the news, is considered as a pioneer in media development at a time when digital technology solutions are rapidly evolving.
Media, already starting its work in 2005, offered innovative and interactive content solutions for its time in a context where Twitter was not yet available, but feisbuks gained popularity only among students in national colleges.
Shortly after the reelection of George Bush, the representative of the Republican Party, who was the president of the United States, Hafington, did not hide the media’s representation of liberal values, and with such a view the world also produced news material.
Now that Hafington on Twitter is going to start a new business after leaving - she plans to create a startup "Thrive Global" that solves workers' health and congestion issues.
It is not yet known who could come to her place under the leadership of The Huffington Post.
During her activity, the portal withdrew from the anonymous comments, stressing to Hafingtony that freedom of expression is granted to people who stand for what they say and who are not hiding behind anonymity.
In the summer of 2015, her decision was also taken to publish news of the US presidential candidate Donald Trampu in the entertainment section.
It is true that, at the end of 2015, when Trampa rhetoric is dangerous to the US public, the details of the odiozian candidate were again published in the policy section.
In 2011, U.S. Internet Media Group AOL decided to buy the fast-growing news web site "The Hoffington Post", which was visited by almost 25 million readers every month at the time of the transaction.
The transaction amount amounted to $315 million.
In 2015, Verizon purchased AOL for USD 4.4 billion in telecommunications.
Also, Verizon bought Yahoo Internet business parts in 2016.
As a result of these transactions, The Huffington Post, a powerful and independent medium, became a small particle from a giant corporation.
Currently, the content of the famous brand is available in nine international versions, with a total monthly unique number of visits of 81 million.
Four people were killed in the cracks in Thailand.
During the last 24 hours, nine explosions, killing at least four people and several dozen injured, took place in Huahin, and in southern provinces of the country.
In the south of Thailand, two explosions took place on Friday about eight hours after the local time.
One explosive exploded in a pot in front of a marine police building, killing a municipal worker and hurting a man, announced the Governor of the province of Suratton Vongsiri Promčanna.
"I think it's linked to explosions in Huaquin," said the Governor.
A second explosion took place in front of the province’s police station.
In the south of Thailand, two explosions took place on Friday morning.
On Friday morning in Huahin exploded two bombers at the ringing tower, killing one and hurt three people.
It has already been reported that on Thursday night just before midnight in the resort town of Huahin, two explosions hit one woman and hurt 19 other people, including foreigners.
The woman killed in Huahin on Thursday was a Thai woman.
Of the 19 wounded, three were in serious condition, and seven of the injured were foreigners - four women and three men.
The bombs in Huahin were hidden in two flower pots that were 50 feet [50 m] apart.
The devices were detonated with mobile phones with half an hour difference.
Before that, one person died on Thursday in the explosion that took place in the province of Trana in southern Thailand.
Policists rescue the baby from overheating the car; parents are threatened with courtwork over the auction.
LETA informed the LETA agency that the child was rescued from a hot car yesterday, while the children’s parents threatened policemen with courtwork on the glass that was settled in the car.
Yesterday, a troubled man ran to the patrol, who told us that a car in Spice parking at the shopping centre had noticed a car in which a baby is available for half an hour without adults.
At the moment of the event, a car named by an eyewitnesser was searched for, and the car was parked in the sun.
In the front passenger seating position there were children’s seats where the baby was located.
The child was shined directly on the sun.
The silk sounded loudly, breathed intensively, and his body was red and chipped.
Given that the owner did not arrive on the ground, a decision has been taken without delay to release the rear glass of the car in order not to endanger the health and life of the infant.
The child with the whole seat is highlighted from the hot vehicle, and the doctors are called.
The child breathed the secle, the skin was red and hot, so until the doctors arrived, the guards placed cool compressions on the forehead.
Medical practitioners and parents almost simultaneously arrived at the event site.
A boy’s father, looking at the broken window of his vehicle, remained aggressive and did not allow the child to be present.
It has been discussed with the parents and explained that children under seven years of age are banned from leaving one unsupervised child.
In addition, the child was left in health and life - threatening conditions.
After discussions, doctors looked at the victim and found that hospitalisation was not necessary.
The parents of the child, on the other hand, refused to give any explanations about what had happened and threatened with the work of the courts about the ejected glass of the car.
During discussions with your parents, there was nothing to suggest that they were under the influence of alcohol or would otherwise harm the child, so a baby under four months of age was taken care of both.
Case materials have been sent to the Child Crime Prevention Department, whose employees will assess parental responsibility.
RPP recalls that even if the outside is not very hot, a car left behind in the sun is heated very quickly.
If there is a child or a pet who is left in such a car, it could endanger their lives.
Members of the LPF could request the suspension of Poni.
Members of the Latvian Research Federation (LPF) could in the near future request from the president of the Federation that its existing leader, Kaspars Poni, will be removed from office, LETA told the Federation's former vice-president Janis Dynanis.
He said that, in view of the criticism of Poni in recent days and his activities in the federation, several members of the LPF had signed a letter requesting the LPF general meeting, which is the highest institution of the Federation, and that it was entitled to decide any question raised by the general meeting of the LPF.
The members of the Federation are not satisfied with the style of Sir's management, and his going to the Olympics of Rio de Janeiro, which in turn did not have the opportunity to go to the Latvian record of the Alion Ribakava trainer German Jakubovskis, who was a poor man in Olympics, is considered to be an unethical and a disrespectful act of the President.
He pointed out that the members of the LPF as well as the Secretary-General of the Federation, Aivars Platonov, had done a great deal of work to develop the federation and sport, but the contribution of Mr.
A gentleman who worked for a long time in the federation explained that in the federation there was an attempt to concentrate power on the hands of one person.
Consequently, the members of the Federation could also request amendments to the articles of association governing the operation of the LPF, which would exclude such a possibility in the future.
Geenis explained that dissatisfied with the work of Sir in the federation had existed for a long time, but the events of the last days had served as members of the "last castle" federation in order to make a decision that action should be taken.
The former Vice President of the Federation said that during the period of Mr.
He explained that, in order to ensure faster process and decision-making in the federation, members of the LPF had decided at a general meeting on the authorisation of a board composed of the Car and two vice-presidents to manage the federation.
However, Dynanis acknowledged that Mr.
The members of the Federation trusted in Mr, considering that this would allow the federation to make decisions more quickly.
"He disobeyed the trust of the members, because in practice he took the power of his hands, making a non-ethical step," said Dynais.
"This attitude cannot come from a person who should serve as an example for other sports representatives", said Dynais.
In his view, Mr President has tried to satisfy his ambitions, which in turn does not honor him as President of the LPF.
The long-term Secretary-General of the LPF, Vladimir Maslovskis, told LETA, that a letter could be submitted to the federation next week, so that the general meeting of the LPF should come within a month.
In his view, the general meeting has to "speak all the hurtful questions" and decide on the next steps.
Mr. Sir, it has not yet been known that members of the LPF are planning to convene a general meeting to decide on his resignation.
For the time being, I don't know anything about calling such a meeting, so I have no comments.
As regards being dissatisfied with my work, so far there has been only one case, with the already mentioned coach Jakubovskis, when some dissatisfiedness has been expressed.
Before the London Olympics, when Ribavirin was not approved among the participants, he complained to the International Water Sports Federation (FINA) and invited Latvia not to send any sportsman.
"After this case Jakubovskis lost the position of the older coach of the sample, because his actions did not meet the interests of LPF," Mr.
He also stressed that the meetings of the members of the LPF, which have been accountable for their achievements, had not so far received any criticisms.
"On the contrary, we have received recognition that the work of the Federation has improved," said the President of the LPF.
Mr also explained that the Olympics in Rio have not gone to entertain but to work.
For more people in Latvia, it is unclear and they do not understand what the functions of the presidents of the federations are.
People do not understand that we are voluntiers in these positions, and for example, unlike the leaders of the Latvian Olympic Committee (LOK), we do not receive salaries.
At the same time, we need to make sure that sports federations have sufficient funding, because the State's LPF receives only 10% of the amount needed.
During the Olympic Games, I have had formal and informal meetings with representatives of the International Federation and various international programmes, including with international sponsors.
"I have also entered into the negotiations and worked on one of the World Cup stages in Riga in 2018," said Mr.
According to the data of the "Firmas.lv" portal, in 2015 LPF revenue totalled 249 444 euros, which is less than 36 000 euros more than in 2014.
Approximately 40% of this amount last year consisted of targeted grants received, which increased by around €10 000 compared to 2014.
LPF also received around 43% of its revenue, or 109 442 euros, in the form of membership, membership and other annual contributions.
In the form of donations and donations, the Federation received a further 35,532 euros last year.
Last year, the federation's expenditure increased by around 70 000 euros compared to 2014, spending a total of 263 876 euros in 2015.
The biggest expenditure was not related to payment of money to persons, to material expenditure or to salaries - EUR 215 733 was identified as "other expenditure".
Money has been spent on persons in cash EUR 20 549, while salaries have been paid EUR 14 684.
If the 2014 Federation had concluded with a positive balance, then in 2015 LPF closed with a negative balance.
As reported, the Ministry of Education and Science (IZM) requested clarification from the Latvian Olympic Committee (LOK) about LPF President's participation in the Rio Olympic Games, which, in turn, has not left Ribakava trainer Jabukovsky.
Latvian citizens have not been affected by the explosions that took place in Thailand, and the entry on the social site of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (AU) Twitter shows.
The Ministry indicated that according to the information available to the Honorary Consul of Latvia in Thailand, Latvian nationals in explosions have not been affected.
LETA already announced that YOU encourage travellers to regularly follow the information on the development of political and security situation in the country, as well as to check the security of the place of stay, pointing out that there is a high risk of terrorism in the country.
The Latvian USM invites you to avoid gathering places, be particularly careful and alert when staying in public places, and follow the instructions of local authorities.
The Ministry of Travellers located in Thailand resorts or intends to go there invites to contact the tour operators or airlines, specifying whether travel will be carried out in accordance with the plan.
The Ministry also invites travellers to regularly follow information on the development of political and security situation in the country, as well as to make sure that the place of stay is secure.
There is a high threat of terrorism in the country.
In view of the unstable security situation in the country, they are not recommended to travel to the border between Thailand and Cambodia, as well as to the provinces in the border with Thailand and Malaysia - Patany, Jal, Narathivate and Sonkhl.
In an emergency situation, the Ministry invites you to contact the Consular Department daily dezirant by phone +371 26 33 77 11 or by e-mail palidziba@mfa.gov.lv.
We also strongly encourage anyone travelling abroad to purchase life and health insurance policies, which also provide for repatriation in the event of sickness or death, and to register in the consular register.
However, the Messiah will not abandon the selection of Argentinian football.
The football superstar Lionels Mesi, after a brief reflection, decided to return to the territory of Argentina, announced on Friday the player himself.
In July, the Argentinian team, for the second year in a row, failed at the finals of the Copa America tournament, once again recognising Chile's superiority in the decisive match.
Immediately after the loss, Messie announced that he had ceased his career in the country, but then it was reported that he could return to the sample.
"I thought seriously about the chance to leave the sample, but my love for Argentina and the sample is too great," said the 29-year-old Messey.
The Spanish grand Barcelona attacker Messi has received 55 gates in 112 games in total, which is the best ever indicator.
Together with the adult sample Messi has not been great success, although in 2014 Argentina became a vice-champion of the world.
We have five times called the world's best footballer.
For Chinese Dinji and Dzeliņš double victory in Rio 20 km walking distance.
The Chinese solitaires Vans Dzins and Cai Dzelins won a double victory on Friday in the battle of Rio de Janeiro’s Olympic Games 20 kilometres.
The Olympic champion was crowned by the Gang, who carried distance at an hour of 19 minutes and four seconds, finalizing the Iron for 12 seconds.
On the other hand, the bronze was won by Australian sorcerer Dein Burd-Smit who lost 23 seconds.
The householder’s favorite Kay Bonfim corrected the Brazilian record, but he missed five seconds to climb to the honorary pedestal.
Gangs four years ago, London won the Bronze Prize.
He also has two silver medals in the World Championships in the same distance.
Judo's coach Baskin: Nikiforenko is not the real heavyweight.
Latvian judy trainer Oleg Baskins acknowledged in good faith that Arthur Nikiforenko in Rio Olympics had little chance to beat the most serious Azerbaijanian sportsman Ušangi Kukauri.
In practical terms, there was no prospect, only minimal, if he could be caught in a way or in a parter.
We had already predicted that this would be the case.
He was in good condition, and he fought properly, but the enemy was stronger.
The opponent was well known because Niikiforenko had already fought against him twice and both Arthur lost.
But he's tougher.
The artifact is artificially cast into the worst weight category to enter the Olympic team.
The weight category of up to 100 kilograms was already busy, so Arthur used the European quota in the heavy weight category.
Arturs with a weight of 100 kilograms fought against Judaist, who is 140 kilograms and who has already won major tournaments a couple of times.
In the heavy weight category there is at all very little chance.
If all kinds of turnarounds occur in the light weight categories, then in the heavy - very rare.
The question whether Niikiforenko would be better to fight one degree in the easiest weight category in the future, Baskin replied in the affirmative.
I think yes, Arthur would be better to fight in the category up to 100 kilograms.
It is his real weight category.
He's not the real heavyweight.
65 % of Venezuelans want to stop Maduro, the question is whether they are ready to fight for it.
Two of the three Venezuelans want to stop President Nikolas Maduro, but the question is whether they are ready to fight for it.
The day after the National Election Board announced that "no time" for the withdrawal of the vote that took place this year, with which Čavismo will be at the beauty of power until 2019 - people on Karakas streets continued their normal day as if nothing had happened.
"I didn't hear the news because I watched the Olympics and how Michael Falps got two more medals," said Rafael Dean, a 36-year-old office worker who rested on the Altamiras Square on Wednesday.
In early 2014, the Altamiras Square, located in the east of Karakas, was an epic centre of sharp unrest protesting against the Maduro regime.
However, now that the opposition must exert greater pressure than ever to achieve a referendum this year, people in the whole country are no longer showing such energy.
"I want a referendum, but I will not participate in the protests for security reasons," said Dean.
Others, more informed, want to mobilise in the future, but admit that the Venezuelans are not so motivated.
The Chairman of the Board of Election Tibisejs Lusena commented on the claim that the Government hinders the withdrawal process.
I will protest whenever the opposition calls for protest, but I know that some of my friends are afraid," Roberto Reijers, (60), said Fox News Latino.
So, in addition to all the barriers that the government has built to delay the referendum, the opposition is now facing a new challenge: to motivate people to go out of the streets and protest.
Until recently, the referendum initiative had broad support: at the stage of the collection of signatures, people arrived in unprecedented numbers.
However, when it comes to protesting against government moves to block efforts, the number that arrives on the myths is significantly lower.
"Some people are focusing on creating a food line, while others are afraid after 2014 arrests and deaths," said Cipriano Eredia, the legislator representing the opposition.
Following Lucen's announcement that until the next step in the referendum process - an even greater number of signatures across the country - will have to wait until October, those who are against the socialist government, say that President Maduro and his followers are simply trying to take away the courage of the Venezuelan people, making them believe that voting this year is practically impossible.
According to the Constitution, if the referendum were held in 2017, Maduro could be suspended from office, but he would be allowed to name the next President.
If he was suspended today, he is obliged to announce general elections.
The U.S. Department of State addressed this issue in a Thursday afternoon announcement calling on the Venezuelan authorities to guarantee respect for Venezuelan constitutional rights.
"The other steps to implement the President's referendum must be made clear, concrete and immediate, thus contributing to a swift and effective resolution of the current political, economic and social difficulties of the country," said it.
Luis Salamanka, a policy analyst who was a member of the election board between 2006 and 2009, that no change is expected as soon as possible.
"I think there will be no referendum this year unless social unrest and protests become even stronger," he said.
He said that Lucen and the government violated the law, but they would ultimately achieve their goal if people did not mind loudly.
In September, the opposition called for a wide manifesto. First of all in Karakas to request a speedier process for withdrawal to take place this year.
We want people from all over the country to mobilize the capital this day.
The government will feel pressure," said Eredia.
Salamanka, on the other hand, considers that this situation cannot be expected for so long.
"They should respond to the Lusen announcement faster and stronger, because it practically kills the referendum," said expert FNL.
Congressman Eredia admitted that some opposition parties wanted to make the manifestion happen faster, while other groups want more time to organise it.
The opposition must now be cautious.
If people feel insecure in this situation, there is a risk that the activity in the second signature collection campaign will be low," said Salamanka.
The referendum process, in order to activate it, must receive support from twenty percent of national voters, which are almost 4 million people.
Salamanka and other analysts are convinced that even if the withdrawal takes place in 2017, Chavismo will be saddened.
However, some people are not so optimistic.
Our party wants political change today.
"If the government closes the way to the elections, we will have to explore other legal options," Eredia said.
The Director of the LNSC A.Pukitus shall be suspended for a period of time.
On 12 August, the majority of members of the Lielvarde district council’s extraordinary meeting supported the resignation of the director of Lielvarde district Sports Centre Ainara Puķis from his duties for as long as the service verification is carried out.
In the near future, it is planned to clarify the circumstances written to the municipality by a visiting sports hall.
In particular, during the visit to the gym, the LNSC client had a head injury.
Vainots is Lielvarde district Sports center.
Taking into account the seriousness of the situation and possible customer's recourse to the court, a commission has been set up by the order of Lielvarde Regional Council Vice-President Vitas Volontes.
Its task is to carry out a verification of the service at the Sports Centre and to give an opinion by 16 August of this year.
On the next Tuesday, it is planned to reconvene the extraordinary meeting of the council to decide on further action.
It should be noted that during a particular accident, A.Pukintis was on vacation.
The Deputy Director for Training at Oksana Grimaluka-Nazarova is the Executive Director of the Sports Centre from Friday to the end of his career.
Ogres for seniors sport is a celebration.
Today, the Sport Centre stadium was held by the Sport Festival of Ogre Pensioners.
The seniorus stadium was welcomed by Sanita Tauriņa, organizer of the sports development work of the Centre of Sport, Ogres, who had prepared a special program for the participants of the Sport Festival.
This time, individual results will not be evaluated, but sports festival participants will be divided into four teams.
"Every participant will make a difference as a result of the team," explains S.Tauriņa.
Participants will have to perform four tasks: basketball speed years, building the Eiffel Tower together with the memory game, florball store, summer ski.
In order to successfully mature in all four disciplines of the festival programme, participants had to perform the challenges of warming - "Uniformity circle", "Rinkis dancis", "Splestnis", as well as three stafets - riding with horse, fulfilling frisbia and the elements of badminton.
All the tasks were prepared in an attractive form, and the participants of the sports festival performed them with joy, smile and fun comments, supporting each other.
The summer ski, which took place in the costumes prepared by the organisers, was particularly thrilled.
The competition was followed closely by volunteers from the Sports Centre of Ogres, who conducted the tasks, recorded the results and did not interfere with the advice.
There was an ogres symbol of Chekurs, who inspired sports festival participants.
Ogres seniators proved to be quite active, attractive and to be in good sporting form.
The Green Team representative Peter Zeps put the ball in a basketball basket eight times within one minute, only one effective shot was left by his team member Jānis Staujs.
Retirement is active.
In excursions are always full of buses, about 300 people arrive on the ball.
"We meet once a week in the family support centre premises where we can play nous, table tennis, exercise trainers," says Jānis Staugžs, Chairman of the Ohre Pensioners' Society.
At the end of the sports festival, all participants received thanks for their participation in the Centre of Sport in Ogres region, but the greatest benefit is a move in the fresh air, a good mood and a shared time.
Pre-existing No.19 West Bromwich Albion in 2016/2017
Guardian journalists predict position 14 (Observance: it's not only Alan Smith's forecast, but the advice of our journalists in general)
Last season heading 14
Probability to win the League (with Oddscheck) 1000-1
Until last week it looked after a new season, such as the old Bromwich Albion: the 2016/2017 season will once again be fighting for satisfaction or stagnation, depending on the "empty is a glass", even more pragmatic under the leadership of Tony Puliss.
However, then Jeremy Piss sold 88 % of his club’s shares to Guočuan Lai and Pulis in an archaeologically safe hand, made by bukmekers at once a favorite in the unpleasant role of the first released manager.
The situation has clearly changed Balack Country - and not only the Hawthorns, but also a few miles northwest of Volverhampton, where young Chinese owners, without time, refused from Kenya Jakt's services.
However, To confirm that his work is not immediately threatened, an entrepreneur has also expressed his desire not to change the club’s culture.
"I don't want to change the club's qualities or to start unsustainable fun," he said, taking over his duties.
I want to be a good owner and invest in this club in the long term.
First of all, our aim is to ensure that we remain in the Prime Minister and then to go further, I would like to see the club strengthen at the top of the Division.
I believe it is the best league in the world, and I want to bring this club as far as possible.
These are the achievements of Pulis, and the first aspect should not be a challenge.
The next objective is to break down to the top of the table, but it will be important for the new owner and the increasingly fragmented fan base to hope for a quick break up in the table so as to be aware that it is an extremely difficult task, taking into account the thorough work recently invested by other teams in the middle of the table.
To go beyond the 14th place of the last season to get up, there will certainly be a need to work more.
Only aston Villa, located at the lower end of the table, hit less gates, and it is worth recalling that on Christmas, Albion, on average, did less than one stroke at the gate in 90 minutes, almost the worst of the Division.
They were unable to get the gate 13 of 38 games, and they only put more than one gate in nine games.
Of their 10 victories in any game failed to get more than one gate, and seven games ended with 1-0.
As was expected, a dozen of 34 gates in total were obtained from standard positions.
It is no wonder that the Hawthorn team was dissatisfied, perhaps the most noticeable after the shocking 0-0 did not distinguish with Villa at the end of January, when the guestman looked better.
On the other hand, only the six best teams had better security records - although no club has managed to put four centre semi-guards on the list.
These guards are often undervalued, especially by Johnny Evans, who wants to be Arsenal in the light of the crisis of the past.
The Northern Ireland International team had a great start at the European Championship, and Albion will have to spend a lot of time selling.
Ben Foster's gates are reliable, and they're well packed in the middle line.
Darens Flecher, much like Evans, demonstrated that he was still able to play a high level at the age of 32, and Claudio Jacobs is underestimated.
All sides are disturbed by the fact that the future story of Sado Berachin, long and lacločal, is still unclear.
As a owner, the rates from Stoke and Crystal Palace were rejected, but they still remain calm and Mark Hughy is ready to wait.
After the last season, being close to liquidation, it is worth all parties involved to act.
The attacker is, of course, talented, but, as Pulis has said several times, turning him here to one side, there to the other, for a long time it has been seen that such a relationship does not work.
Albion insists that it is necessary to sign the documents on the change before let the former UK U-21 sample participant go, but his 15 million pound move with Diafru Saho fell a few days before taking over, the club claiming that he went out with a medical examination and had reached an agreement, but he had a back injury, which would mean he would have to spend the season.
It creates great pressure on the Venezuelan Salomon, who in the last season seemed very promising, but he has to improve his nine gate performance, especially if Ricky Lamberts continues to be so ineffective.
The decision to release Viktor Aničebi and Stefan Sesegnon also looks strange.
The boy throughout his career is sadly famous with his slow new players moving up and three tynnus - Jonathan Leko, Sam Fīld and Tyler Roberts coming up in the last game of the previous season with an undivided 1-1 with Livepool, hardly becoming a norm.
He will return to the testers already, but Leko is worth keeping sight.
The 17-year-old attacker in general took part in five games in the previous season, becoming the first player born in 1999 in Prime Minister, who is also highly appreciated in the English youth football system.
Matt Filips, with the 5.5 million contract with Queens Park Rangers, will be quick, but he is the only new player who took part in the first race on the weekend.
This would not be encouraging if the end were rather urgent.
"Everything," Pulis said Express and Star last month about what could be improved.
Every position you see.
We need to strengthen back players, middle player and front player.
The objectives are, we know what we want.
It is much more difficult to get them than expected, mainly due to uncertainty about the take-over process.
The season could be determined by how they have started with seven large winning games before the difficult competition with Tottenham, Liverpool, Manchester City and Leicester from the middle of October.
At that time, pressure on Pulis will have become less or unstoppable.
And, who knows, maybe even Berahino will have found a new club.
Tata Steel UK closer to the rescue transaction after the changes in the support of authorised persons to pensions
After the pensions standing in Tata Steel UK, the trustees said that the scheme could be restructured without participating in the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), increasing the company’s chances of closing a rescue transaction.
The British steel pension scheme has a liability of GBP 15 billion and estimates a deficit of at least GBP 700 million, creating a serious obstacle to the conclusion of the rescue transaction between Tata Steel UK and Port Talbot Steelworks in Wales.
Tata Steel is increasingly convinced of ensuring the future of British business with 11 000 people after negotiations with the Minister for Economic Affairs and the pension regulator.
The company plans to combine its European activities, including British business with ThyssenKrupp, German conglomerate.
However, the conclusion of the transaction depends on whether the British steel pension scheme will be restructured and the government will provide financial support.
Alan Johnson, the statutory president of the pensions, said that this scheme could avoid the PPF if the benefits received by the employees were modified.
Although this is well funded compared to other schemes, with a deficit of up to GBP 300 million for certain measures, Tata Steel and ThyssenKrupp want to control their commitments.
Johnson said that the trustees acknowledged that it was "not realistic" for a joint venture or any buyer of Tata Steel Uk to assume responsibility for the financing of the current and future deficit.
The modification of the benefits of the scheme was a much more binding option than to join the PPF, he added where workers should accept less favourable conditions.
The sources of Tata Steel warn that it could still sell Port Talbot.
The company has consistently refused to guarantee the future of steels since the negotiations on the future of its British business started in March, and it has been used as shorts in negotiations with the British government.
Kishlik, Executive Director of Tata Steel Europe, said that the Indian conglomerate wants to make its steel business more sustainable.
Talking to the Culuan year's Tata Steel meeting in India, Chaterier said that the negotiations on the restructuring of pension schemes were progressing, but he insisted that the scheme was well funded.
"We are talking to various stakeholders, including the British Government and other stakeholders, such as the Wales Government, etc.," said Charlie, Times of India.
It is believed that pensions have a certain impact on the business of goods such as steel, so we need to find a structural solution that does not hinder business progress.
The intention of pension officials to cooperate in the negotiations on the restructuring of the scheme will be supported by Tata Steel.
The potential changes in the scheme include redirecting the way the annual inflation-based increase in benefits is measured from the retail price index to the lowest consumer price index, as well as limiting future pension payments to the statutory minimum.
Johnson added: "The co-chaired and its advisors have been provided by Tata Steel, the government and the pension regulator with evidence of the scheme's ability to pay the modified benefits for an indefinite period and with a low level of risk outside the Pension Protection Fund.
Our investment strategy has meant that the funding position of the scheme has not been affected by the fall of the recent securities market in the same way as in other British pension schemes.
The CDS commenter makes Michael Fepps and Ryan Lohti throughout the race
The commenter of the Canadian broadcasting company CBC Olympic Games on Thursday evening caused anger by mixing Michael Feppss with his competitor Ryan Lohti.
Elliott Frīdmen both felt the entire 200 m length of individual swimming, which won Fepps by winning his 22th Olympic golden medal.
When Felth crossed the line, he was held up by the Frostman as Lohti, by the people of Felps and by long-standing competitors at the top of the world swimmers' top.
He said, "He's gonna do it at the end!"
Ryan Lohte will beat Michael Fepps in this race!
Fepps could not even fall into the pedestal.
But Fells won, but Lohte finished the fourth.
Immediately after Falps was at gold, the CBS was silent in transmission.
In a miraculous way, he immediately admitted his mistake.
I'm sorry, I mixed my knees.
Feppe with gold," he said.
The Canadian commenter, whose professionalism was widely appreciated by error, once again admitted his mistake in the next hours after the event and apologized to viewers on Twitter.
I apologize to everyone.
I was surprised.
"No excuse," he wrote.
In the meantime, Felph beats 2 168 years of record as the winner of the largest Olympic victory ever.
The previous record belonged to Leonidas of the island of Rhodes, who had won more Olympic titles in the first Olympic Games than anyone else.
Russian hackers attacked the computer of the former NATO Force Commander.
Hakers published lists of General Philip Breedlov and data on the work of one of the Soros Funds.
The same hackers who could have been attacking the US Democratic Party e-mails and published its lists may also be guilty of a new series of attacks, reports agent Bloomberg.
According to its information, these cyber-surveillances have attacked the correspondence of former NATO Force Commander General Philip Brīdlov and the services of the "Open Society" Institute, which are part of the projects supported by the millionaire George Soros.
The attackers published the acquired information in a link to DCLeaks.com.
Brīdlov's correspondence and data on the functioning of the "Open Society" Institute were included there.
It has been reported that hackers have had access to fund computers for about a year.
The news agency states that it is about the same hackers who carried out the attack on US Democratic Party computers, which are led by Russia's secretity.
The U.S. intelligence service has already warned high officials a year ago about a possible hacker attack on the Democratic Party.
"Reuters" news agency says it has information that the cyber attacks are coordinated by two Russian intelligence agencies or by organisations controlled by them that were then told by a number of politicians.
However, assemblies have not been able to pass this information on to the victims of cyber attacks because it was secret.
The scandal of attacks on the computers of the Democratic Party began after about 20 thousand e-mails were published on the Internet, written by party representatives during the US Presidential Election campaign.
The party candidate, Hilary Clinton, announced that Russian specs had organized the destruction of these letters.
Dmitry Peskov, Secretary of the Russian President's Press, has stated that Russia has nothing to do with cyber-terrorismists.

Parking in the happiest location on Earth will be even easier in the future.
The Disneyland has presented information about its long planned parking area structure, consisting of a transport hub and a new pedestrian bridge attractions park in the eastern side of the park.
The project, located in the east of the park 5 Freeway near the park, includes a parking area structure of 6 800 seats and a transport hub where buses, coaches, taxis and other vehicles can spend the park visitors.
The pedestrian bridge over the port of potatoes connects the recreational park with the parking area structure and the transport hub.
This structure, together with the planned 14-aqua-area expansion project of the Star War, is part of the USD 1 billion investment promised to the city of Anaheim in exchange for 30 years' exemption from the entertainment object tax.
Construction of the project, which syncs with Eastern gates, will start next year.

In July, the insulation of the house will have to be two-thirds of its population.
If the owners of the apartments are very harsh and specific about the technical condition of the building, if there is such a possibility to receive support and to arrange the building in all possible ways, then it is quite easy not to use it.
One of the most important changes is that any apartment house will be eligible for EU co-financing from this year, but only the condition is that the building's facade needs to be warmed up.
In the past, it could only be used for serial apartment buildings.
For the managers of the largest worry house, however, it is the organisation of meetings of owners of apartments.
An important problem, where the process is currently overdue, is the need for 67% of the owners of apartments.
"In the previous programme it was necessary 51%," says Toms Cīrulis, Project Manager at LNA Ltd.
"Of course, it is very difficult to ensure this because most general meetings do not have such a number of owners", says Gints Ločmelis, Project Manager of the company Namas service APSE.
The largest house managers in Liepaja - "Nam service APSE" and LNA, which serve around 900 buildings, are planning to renovate at least 50 apartment houses in the new planning period by 2020.
They do not rule out the possibility that it will be difficult at the beginning of the work to convince people to vote for renovation work, but every project that has been implemented should improve their attitude.
I also had to get a bank credit, 76% of the population of the house.
"Speaking, explaining what will be - I still get the signatures," says Vita Iesalniece, the oldest of the most energy-efficient buildings in Latvia.
John agrees with her, who also lives in a warm building.
Well, you can't make half think, and the other side plus one person then disagrees.
"No, of course, it's important that everyone agrees with the whole measure," says John.
Such changes have been proposed by the representatives of the financial institution ALTUM.
They explain that, with 51% of the votes in banks, it is not possible to attract the necessary funding, which has also been the experience in the last programming period.
In most commercial banks, two thirds of the owners of the apartments are required.
Anda Lagzdiņa, Head of the European Union Funds Division of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, makes one of the recommendations to house managers to present the citizens with the examples and various benefits of renovation, for example, energy savings.
As a young man, Aaron was long angry with the world for the death of his mother.
A potential suicide bomber’s detention operation in Canada was worthy of a print film.
It all started when the Canadian police received the video captured by the US Federal Investigation Office.
Very early in the morning, the Canadian Royal Police received reliable information from the Federal Investigation Office.
Among other things, it contained a so-called "mother" video record written by an unknown person who was clearly present at the stage of the final attack.
"And he was going to do it with a self-made explosive," said Mike Kaban, Deputy Chief of Police of Canada.
In a video in black mask, a man in English and Arabic was threatening Canadians and promised to repudiate everything they had done to Muslims.
About three hours of using facial and voice recognition computer programs, the Canadian police have managed to recognize this man.
It was the 24-year-old Aaron Driver.
He was already under the supervision of the probationary service to praise terrorism and radical Islamic ideas on the Internet.
By judgment, Driver was prohibited from doing so in the future and being involved in any radical organization.
However, until then, the authorities did not believe that Draivers could pose a physical danger to others.
When the police came to his home in the province of Stratroy, the young man came out and sat in a taxi.
At that time, the order guards tried to arrest him, but when driver was sitting on the rear seat, he had started the buckle.
To prevent the detonation of the second explosive, the police shot a young man.
He's dead from the injuries he's made.
The taxi driver hasn't suffered.
The father of the neutralized terrorist, Wayne Draivers, told the Canadian television that his son had turned to Islamic teens.
It had originally helped him to deal with drugs and alcohol.
However, Aaron was a problematic teenager, who was long - suffering about his mother’s death, and his father added.
Only when I saw that video in news today, I realized how far he had gone.
I had no idea that he was so radical.
"And I also didn't know that he was so good at talking in Arabic," says Aaron's father.
The Canadian police admit that if they had arrived a few hours later, the development of events could have been much different.
Radēviča will go to Rio as a tourist and support Latvian lightmakers.
The former Olympic and lighthouse Ineta Radēvičs at the Olympic studio of LTV said that the performance of seven-year-old athletes Laura Ikauniece-Admidiņa on Friday in the first two disciplines was not bad, given that the athletes had trauma.
Laura, on the other hand, made his reflection with the right foot, not as usual with the left.
Radēvičs pointed out that it is comparable - just like a man who is used to write with the right hand, would suddenly be forced to write with the left.
Therefore, the result of Ikauniece-Admidiņa, given the injury, is not bad.
Radēvičs discovered, has not yet been contacted by Ikaunis-Admidiņa, but she is actively following her start and feeling with her.
Ineta learned about Laura's trauma recently and expressed support for the sportsman, pointing out that the show did not begin to create safety cushions for itself, but showed the nature and the spirit of the fighter.
As for other sports, Radēvičs believes that the Olympics are very high, so one of the Latvian athletes is to reject that he has gone to Rio as a tourist, is unorthodox.
She remembered that herself, when she went to the first Olympics, where she won 13th place, was called a tourist, and it creates negative emotions.
Ineta sometimes remembers its start, not just the Olympics.
"I like to remember my emotions, not results," discovered Radēvičs.
She told me that it was always important that there was someone who would have equal energy on the trip.
Radēvičs himself, however, will be a tourist - she will go to Rio de Janeiro for the next week to support Latvian athletes.
She points out that she will definitely go to the hockey competition.
Ineta Radēvičs won the title of the European champion in 2010.
During the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, she took 13 places in the far-flashing and the three-sold-positioning of the 20th position, but at the Olympics, she did not start up in 2008 because she was waiting for her son.
In London, as already mentioned, Radēvičs had 4 places in the far run.
A film "Quanta Code" with a physicist in Kašteev's main role will be shown at the fairs.
The film explains that, in parallel with the breaking of electrons in the laboratory Kaščejev is a dreamer, teacher, socially active and civic-thinking man and father, who is looking for a connection with Visvareno.
The character of the film himself said in "Rita Panorama" Latvian Television program, taking the film was interesting to him.
I learned about how to film, how to film, how to record the sound.
"And actually fantastic work," said a physicist.
He admitted that the movie was two years old.
The biggest disagreement with the director was the title of the film.
I am strongly against this name.
There's no quantum code.
"There is no such mystery that you could find out when watching the film and it's all clear," said the associate professor of LU.
Kashcheyev admitted that he liked the fact that the movie's premieres will take place on the evening of Muryan Open Nature Films.
They are organised by friends from the Foundation "Viegļi", and these kinetics will take place every night until September 9.
In Thailand four people died in the bomb explosions of popular tourist attractions
After the Thai people voted for the adoption of the Constitution supported by the military, on Thursday and Friday in the five southern provinces of Thailand - popular destinations of tourism - there were a number of bomb explosions that killed four and injured many people.
The first two explosions fell in the seaside resort in Huuchin on Thursday evening, the next Friday morning.
The city is about 200 kilometres south of Bangkok.
The police declared that one Thai woman died at the first explosion and injured 20 people, 10 of whom were foreigners.
The authorities of power confirmed that other explosions were taken off in southern cities in Phuketta, Trana, and Suratthan.
Two bombs exploded in Phuket in the suburbs of Patonga and two more in Phann - tourism in the region north of Phuket.
In the last 24 hours, 11 bomb blasts have been caught in Thailand.
On Friday, the Thai Royal Police official Colonel Krisana Patanacharosen declared that the explosions were not related to Islamic extremists and were regarded as local sabotage acts.
"For it is too early to draw conclusions," he said.
"But we certainly know that these incidents are not directly related to any kind of terrorism, in fact it is a local sabotage, and we are trying to find perpetrators."
On 12 August 2016, following a small capacity bomb explosion in Huahin, investigators collected evidence from the scene of the crime.
On 12 August, officials announced that four people were killed in the bomb explosion series in the key tourist areas of Thailand.
There are no conflicts in the country that could lead to terrorists in the country.
'So we can say that these incidents are not terrorist attacks,' he continued.
No group has yet assumed responsibility for the attack, and the competent authorities have not accused any special group, but the explosion took place in the same week as the Thai voters approved the new Constitution.
All three southern provinces - Huahina, Phuketa and Phanna - rejected the referendum supported by the military, and in south-eastern Thai provinces, where the majority of the population is Muslims, more than 6500 people have died in trouble since 2004.
The explosions took place on the birthday of the Queen Sirita of Thailand, which is a public holiday in Thailand.
In Huahin there is the royal palace Klai Kangwon, or "a castle far from the anxiety", in which the royal family of Thailand often resides.
King Bumibol Aduljadeus was the longest ruling monarch in the world.

Porgis and Bess - which we had long deserved!
There are infinite numbers of operas that have never been heard in Latvia.
There's something that sounds very rare.
However, it seems strange that since the 1970s George Guerština opus Porgis and Bessa have not been created or played if they do not count such a series of chrestomatic solos as Summertime periodic painting on the views (including as a title-point at the summer festival held by Inese Galante), some student projects, guest performances, and so on.
There are reasons for this: since Latvia is a civilised Western world, it is bound by the regulations of the Gueršvin family heirs and copyrights, which are valid for Porgy and Bess until 2030.
Harmonisation procedures are not simple.
In addition, the author, when creating his complete production, wished that all fourteen soloists should be black.
Of course, the discussions and contexts around this opera in the United States in the field of race are little known and it would be difficult for the composer to do so.
On August 6, the concert by the composition with the help of four Artist Black American soloists and their Latvian brothers and sisters in the beginning of the 20th century gave a bright presentation at the 10th anniversary of the Cesis Art Festival, commemorating Gēršvin's charming sound recording, containing European classical music traditions with American jazz rhythms, gospe, fashions of the beginning of the 20th century and hits that remain in mind, expressing the stingingy Porgy of Ketfisrov's krop, and a glittering love story of Bess, in a musical quality which would have deserved documentation for the stories of music history.
First of all, because of LNSO and conductor Andra Pog.
Despite the difficult spatial layout of the concert event in the open-air park of Cesis Castle, the orchestra is on the next stage next to the stage, where there were soloists and singers (and great dance!) choir While, the total sound was stylisticly nuanced, contrasted rich and precise in both string and metal blowers and piano party (Mārtiņš Zilberts).
Secondly, because of the excellent soloist team.
Haristmintic dramatic bariton Lester Linč (Porgy) is a prominent singer in Europe and America who has both baron and bariton lots, especially in Verdi operas.
Porgia's role has been healed many times, many times also by Kranus - he felt like a fish in the water in this opera and inspired the stage partners even to embellish the emotional atmosphere of solidarity between the poor in the fishing village.
Letija Mura in her second Porgy and Bess concert (the first was held in 2012 at no more than the Berlin Philharmonics and Sir Simon Retle) discovered as a vital plastic combination of various vocal styles with dramatic toned tembra and fantastic piano top register.
Not for nothing, she is one of the brightest in modern Alys.
His attractive tenor, Jermein Smith, who was once seen by Andris Poga in Boston's establishment, is the image of the drug dealer Sportinlaiff, a company's role in four continents.
He shows his skills of synchronous dancing and singing as a well trained music actor.
Smits are one of the rare birds whose voices seem to remain hidden as undiscovered vocals 15 years ago when the opera voice accidentally arrived by hanging it to smash peers.
Unbelievably, even from the 24th line and relative darkness of Jermeina Smith’s expressive gesture language allows you to see the dust bag in his hands, even if there is no such thing.
How can poor Bess fail to follow such a mephistofelic tempter, who in an empty place believe the illusion of a wonderful life in New York?
The role of the crash was painted by Rodney Clark, a generously gifted artist.
The biggest vocal surprise in the Latvian soloist team in Cesis was Sirina, the famous top register of Sonora Vaice, skillful balancing between the spoken and sang text, correspondingly changing the voice position, the performance of vocal acrobatics and dramaticism, both in Sirina's plentiful My I'm Gone Now, and in stylistic accompaniment in Oh, Doctor Jesus.
In the role of Claire, the voice of Margarita Wilson was well heard, but the iconic Summertime at the very beginning expressed a sigh for a little for a loud and nervous, having its true character in the rapture.
The parties entrusted to Mihail Chulpajev, Rihard Machanowski, Andris Lapiņš (especially Krabju, a salesman on the walls of castle ruins, in response to Irma Zāvāre's famous Zealė seller in the soprano theatre).
The outstanding characters in the scenes of Ilona Bagel, Rihard Miller, Emil Kivleniek, as well as in the roles presented by Ivo Martinson, were raised by the investigator and the director and actor Juris Žagars, who was unexpectedly presented to the viewers in the form of the white lawyer Arkdeila.
In the spatial concept of the concert visit by Viesturs Kaitis, the choir worked on steps, soloists - mostly in the proscene, rarely at the entrance or exit of the stairs.
In sufficient dynamic activity, a bit of comical situations were made in the hands of Latvian soloists.
But there is a pro-zoal explanation for their presence.
First of all, some soloists sang several episodes of lomble (which sometimes made it difficult to track their stage identity).
Secondly, there is a lot of dialogue in Porgia and Bess, talking a phrase, a replica that is easier to trace in front of the task.
The audience was greatly helped by the titre machine in Cesis as a result of the operational nuance.
The weather did not give up, and the first part of the concert was long enough.
However, it did not stop most of the listeners from staying until the end of the wave of artists.
Nine in the evening, however, the starting time for a full-length opera is quite late, especially if the longer homeway is expected from Cesis, however, the opera Porgis and Bess are worthy of return to the Latvian musical chain and will most likely become one of the most bright musical adventures of this summer.
In Liepaja, too, where it took place yesterday evening, in a completely different acoustic environment.
In the game field in Riga, a man feared children with a curl.
Yesterday, on August 11, around eight a.m., the State Police received a message from a grandmother of a child who was frightened by the fact that there was a man on the street of Lomonosova, a children's field, with a curler's children.
The lawards immediately responded to the call and came to an event where they met this man with a curl, who at the time of the event was under the influence of a very large alcohol - 3.07 promotions.
It was found that a man born in 1962 had already feared children to be thirsty.
However, this time, an aggressive man used a curl through a children’s field equipment to scare children.
The man was arrested.
Criminals brought about in connection with the events of gross disruption of public order, manifesting a manifest lack of respect for the public or the shameless, ignoring the generally accepted standards of behaviour and undermining people's peace.
Such crimes shall be punishable by deprivation of liberty for a term of up to two years, or by temporary deprivation of liberty, or by forced labour, or by a fine and by supervision of probation for a term of up to three years.
The Presidents of the Federation usually use guest accreditation at the Olympic Games.
Presidents of sports-type federations usually arrive in the Olympic Games for a few days and use the accreditation of guests to change their names, so they have several owners during the competition, LETA told the representative of Latvian Olympic team (LOV) Marita Vilciņa.
On Wednesday, the wide-ranging athesis was triggered by the statements made by Alona Ribakava trainer Germanakovsky, who discovered that at the last moment he decided to go to Rio de Janeiro Olympics, Head of the Latvian Research Federation (LPF) Kaspars Sir, while the trainer should remain at home.
Later, it became known that Mr. Brazil had arrived with a coach's accreditation, for which the President himself expressed surprise because "now there is no place in there".
According to Vilciņa, only the presidents of two federations lived in London Olympics' village - Mr.
In the Olympic village, sportsmen live, as well as official persons, including for example coaches, doctors, administration of the delegation.
So, most likely, Mr. London also had a coach's accreditation.
"The other presidents of the federation arrive as guests, and they have the accreditation to be changed - arrive for a few days and then use it by someone else," Vilciņa said, explaining that therefore, the presidents of these federations do not live in the Olympic village.
Mr. Rio de Janeiro arrived already at the end of July, and Brazil will leave on August 13, which is likely to be the longest of the presidents of all national federations.
Significantly, Latvian filmed swimming started only one day - on August 10.
Latvia will be represented in the Olympic Games in 11 sports, and LETA estimates from the agency show that the presidents of six or seven federations will drive to the four most important competitions.
Zalītis Brazil will arrive on Saturday, and Igo Japiņš, the President of the Latvian Federation of Cycling (LRF), will be on the BMX competition planned next week, Ansis Dāle, the President of the Latvian Federation of Windsurfing, has planned to fly to Rio de Janeiro on August 16 when both Katie Birzule's startes will have finished, and Dzintars Urbančiks, the President of the Latvian Federation of Fighters, will have finished the day earlier.
Also planned to arrive next week by the President of the Latvian Fire Federation Kārlis Krēsliņš, when the shooter Dainim Upelnieks will have already finished.
The President of the Latvian Giuda Federation Raimonds Rublovskis, at least during the competition of Latvian athletes, did not appear in Rio de Janeiro, although his arrival was planned, the Latvian Canoe Federation is currently not President, but the conflict and its athletes are being announced by the Latvian Olympic Committee.
Meanwhile, the President of the Latvian Volleyball Federation Atis January and Juris Savickis, the Head of the Latvian Tennis Union, decided not to arrive in Rio de Janeiro.
Vassiliev appreciates the natural breasts of Latvian women.
The famous Russian fashion historian, interior designer, stage designer, book author, lecturer and collector Alexander Vassiliev is very often visited in Latvia during the last years.
Most recently, he and Misters Latvia 2016 finally evaluated the contestants and admitted that, unlike Russian folks, Latvian folks can be proud of natural breasts and lips that have not been improved with silicone and botulin injections.
In conversation with "Vakaros Ziems" Alexander Vassiliev told that for many years he has been president of the jury in the popular "Mis Russia" beauty competition.
That is why he also took an interest in the evaluation of "Mis and Misters Latvia 2016".
When asked what differing standards of Latvian beauty competition from similar competitions in Russia, Vassiliev stressed that Latvians and waterfalls have quite different shapes: "Russia's beauty competition participants have more comfortable breasts than Latvian competitors."
But Latvian young people are beautifully dressed and decrypted, as well as can be proud of the wonderful works performed by natural beauty rather than plastic surgery.
Therefore, I particularly congratulate the participants of the Latvian beauty competition on their natural beauty.
Due to its professional activities in Latvia Vassiliev has large plans.
At present, the fashion historian's collection exhibition "Proveeded Nature" is open at the Museum of Decorative Arts and Design.
In Ventspils, in Livonian Order Castle, there is an exhibition of Vassiliev "Casewear 1860-2010".
Vassiliev loved Ventspils so much that he enjoyed the hospitality of the city for a few days and went on walking along the sea.
I love it in Latvia.
Especially now, when there is a threat of terrorism throughout Europe, there is a real corner of Paradise.
"In Latvia spend time and relax is a pure pleasure", said fashion guru.
In addition, on November 23, Alexander Vassiliev will discover a private fashion museum in Old Riga.
Please help!
Please donate to treat our son, brother, grandson.
As a family of Rinald, we are grateful to the fantastic people around us and to God for the possibility of saving Rinald, but, unfortunately, we do not currently have the opportunity to fully cover the medical costs by ourselves.
Rinald Grinberg is a 11 - year - old tumour that was diagnosed with brain tumours at the end of July.
This year he graduated from grade 4 in the early school of Milzkalns with excellence, a powerful sportsman and a very talented artist.
I think everything went on to him.
A healthy, happy, persistent, hardworking and active boy.
It's always smiling and kind.
July 26 in our family will be remembered for life.
In the last few weeks, the pain was painful, but the doctors chose it to the abdominal virus.
And at first it seemed like that.
For who could have imagined that such "non-false" symptoms are much more serious to the guilt, which we may not understand.
On July 26, we got a diagnosis - Rinald has a brain tumor.
The fluid in the brain is rapidly coloured, but everything that doctors can help in Latvia is to perform a bypass surgery to release excess fluid, because the tumor is practically not available for direct surgery.
Neither can it be determined whether the tumor is benign or malignant.
Further State-paid plan: to start radiation and watch what is happening.
It seemed like a bad nightmare - we're going to have an experiment here, we'll see the results.
Fortunately, the results of Rinalda investigations were able to show the doctor in Spain.
He is the Vice President of the World Neurosurrection Association, one of the world's leading neurosurgists.
He took up an operation, and he turned out to have to be operated immediately.
The tumour exerts enormous pressure on the brain, and the risk of complications is too high.
It is also urgent to understand whether the tumor is benign or malignant to develop a plan for further treatment.
Without thinking for a moment, the parents chose to go to Spain to save the son.
At fantastic speed, on August 8, Rinald and Mom Evia were in Spain, and on August 9, they were operated.
A very complex, more than 6 hours of surgery was performed.
The operation took place in the "Santa Elena" clinic.
It was possible to remove most of the tumor, reduce pressure, and obtain analytical samples.
Rinalds is already up on his bed and as a good teenager, he asks for dinner with some potatoes.
Now we just have to wait for the results of oncological analyses.
Thanks to Dr. Araez, and to the management of the clinic, who understood the situation and operated urgently without full payment for the treatment before surgery.
They have trusted that the remaining amount will be paid, requesting only EUR 10 000 of the first contribution to operate and save Rinald's lives.
6 000 euros were delivered to parents through the sale of machinery, while the rest of the necessary travel expenses, accommodation, and the first contribution of the hospital was made available to families and friends.
But at least EUR 24 000 is needed to pay for the first stage of treatment in Spain and to repay the money we have borrowed for the first instalment.
Please help us to repay this operation so important to Rinalda's health.
Each euro is important to help to cover the costs of the operation already carried out and to enable the treatment of Rinalda to continue successfully.
Disquieting signs of anxiety in Ukraine raise the question: What does Vladimir Putin think about?
It has been made to judge the reality of these claims.
Ukraine denies them, while the US and the European Union claim that Russia has not provided any evidence.
The Open Analysis Group, Digital Forensic Research Lab, has identified some features of the Saturday fire, but little to be able to hinder Moscow's big plans.
Russia is known for the distortion or misinterpretation of events for political purposes, in particular in the context of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.
This does not mean that all Russian claims are unfounded.
The Ukraine's members of the resistance forces destroyed last year the electricity pills that supplied the current in Crimea, and some of them are also involved in criminal activities and violations of human rights.
The attempted attack in Crimea remains a topical issue, although there is little reason to suspect that the Ukrainian Government would sponsor a scenario of such events.
Whatever happens, the images found by the open source analysts show that Russia has been increasing its military presence since at least last Saturday - before the anticipated attack took place.
They show how heavy arms convoys, including coastal missile systems, are moving in the hemisphere.
Obstructively known Russian escalation
Some reports show that Russian forces in Crimea had already been planning a rotation around this time, which could help explain the activity, although it would be a great coincidence that it simply happened in one of the most stressful times since the annexation in 2014.
Whatever the end of the week, Mr Putin has undoubtedly turned Ukraine even more into his own words, choosing to use this episode, no matter how realistic it is for something bigger.
The analysts point out the worrying parallels with Russia's behaviour just before the previous military action against Ukraine.
In February 2014, similar speeches and military manoeuvres provided a cover to volunteer members of the Crimean resistance force to take up a peninsula, which was still under the control of Ukraine at that time, only to establish that they were, in fact, special Russian entities that started military occupation.
In August, when the separatists supported by Russia did not act in Eastern Ukraine, Putin deployed forces along the border, warning that they might be necessary for the "defence" of ethnic Russian civilians in Ukraine, which he said is being attacked.
He arranged a relief convoy to a region that, according to NATO, was only a cover for Russian invasion forces.
What does Mr Putin plan to do in Crimea?
Some made comments as to whether only Moscow is planning another military intervention.
The fighting in Eastern Ukraine has intensified, as was the case before the invasion in August 2014.
But this apparent parallel could be the point of introducing fear of military action rather than of actual action: it will give Putin short in its relations with Ukraine and with the Western countries.
Mark Galeoti, professor at the University of Najorca, who researches Russia, pointed out that Crimea would play a minor role as a point from which to start military action against Eastern Ukraine, bordering the Russian land, not the Crimea, and that the rest of the country is better protected.
"There is a very small chance if Russians really plan a large scale official," said Mr Galeoti.
Rather, "we can see the creation of a classic Russian pressure strategy."
International peace negotiations on Ukraine, once a mechanism for Putin to force contacts with Western leaders who ignored him as a result of the annexation of Crimea, are increasingly perceived as unsuccessful and irrelevant.
When we promise that there is a danger that the conflicts can get off again, Putin gives the negotiations a new meaning: get him out of the edge of the pit.
"It's a standard Putin's tactic - he wants to try starting from a force position," Galeoti said about the next peace negotiations scheduled for early September.
"And the only strong side is to say, "If I would like to, you could make everything a lot more, much worse."
Make an agreement with the West
Putin also said this week that during the period of Crimea's tensions, it was not important to continue the negotiations, making the other parties persuade him to return to the negotiating table and to the centre of the process.
What does it actually give him?
Firstly, it allows Russia to continue to stand up as a world power, although its economic volume is smaller than that of Australia.
Secondly, it positions Moscow as the owner of the veto in relation to the sovereignty of Ukraine, while keeping the country under the control of Russia to some extent.
It can also benefit Putin's long-standing hope for a broad-based agreement with the United States that would resolve their disputes on Ukraine and Syria, with favourable conditions for Moscow, naturally, also by ending the Western sanctions against Russia.
Putin's embarrassment for this objective has been expressed on several occasions since the deterioration of the state economy in 2014, mainly due to the decline in the country's value of oil and gas exports.
Since his invasion in Syria last autumn, he has repeatedly called on the West powers to join him in the great coalition for the fight against extremists.
However, Russian leaders may consider it necessary to provide such an agreement before the end of January of President Obama's term of office.
The Russian authorities mainly believe that the next President will be Hilary Clinton, which is more hostile to Moscow.
Donald Tramps, although it is obviously friendly to Russia, is still considered unpredictable.
On the other hand, Obama is considered to be "seeing solutions, not conflicts," said Galeoti.
So it makes sense to close the window to make sure that things are done quickly.
Meanwhile, if a broad-based agreement cannot be reached, Putin seems to be satisfied with maintaining Russia's weak neighbour by saying what will be next.
In the earlier version of this article, the year of Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine was wrong.
This took place in 2014, not in 2013.
When the convention arrives at a deadlock, the White House directs the means to fight Zicka virus
On Thursday, the Obama administration said that USD 81 million would be diverted from biomedical research and anti-poverty and health care programmes to pay for the development of a vaccine against Zicka virus with emergency measures, as Congress did not approve a new funding to combat the virus.
Silvia Matthew Barvel, Secretary for Health and Humanitarian Services, in a letter to the members of the Congress, pointed out that without the funds allocated, the National Institute for Health and the Office for In-depth Research and Development of Biomedicine will remain without money for the fight against the disease carried by the law until the end of the month.
Therefore, it would be necessary to stop the development of the vaccine at an important point in time, with the number of Zicky’s disease that has occurred in the country increasing Maiami.
Last week, 7 350 cases of Zica virus were reported in the United States, mostly in Puertoriko (according to the Disease Control and Prevention Centres).
Mrs Barvelas said that 15 babies had birth defects related to the Zicky virus.
The virus can cause brain malformations and other serious defects in children born to infected mothers.
The prevalence of disease in the continental part of the United States, when the first cases were registered at the end of last month, has increased the political rates for the reaction of the federal government.
Hilary Clinton stopped in Winwood during the Tuesday campaign, near Maami, where there was an outbreak of locally transmitted Zika virus, and put pressure on Congress to return from its five-week break to confirm the emergency funding for the fight against the virus.
President Obama and the Republics of Congress have had conflicting views for most of the year on Zika's virus issues.
In February Obama requested $1.9 billion for emergency funding.
The Republicans suspended it by requiring a more detailed account of whom the money will be used.
The legislators have been arguing for months about how much money should be allocated and how it should be spent.
Last month, the democrats blocked the examination of the measure offered by the Republicans, which would give $1.1 billion to fight the Zicka virus, but would include provisions to ban the provision of funds for family planning for the provision of contraception in relation to a virus that could be so displaced by the sex drive.
Because of this deadlock, the White House in April was forced to transfer $589 million, which was intended to fight the Ebola virus, to fight the Zicka virus. About two thirds of the funding is intended to be used inside the country.
On Thursday, Mrs Barvela said that her department had spent most of the money and that it would be spent in full by the end of August.
"The inability to decide on emergency financing for Zicka virus has left the administration to choose between delaying the important development of the vaccine and accessing other valuable national programmes in order to temporarily avoid this delay," said Barvela.
The Democrats have taken over this communication in order to force the Republicans not to grant additional money to fight the Zika virus.
At the conference, Nancy Pelosi from California, the minority leader, called on Paul D.Raien, Spicker of the House of Representatives, to remind the Congress of the continuation of this event.
"All the opportunities are exhausted, and now we turn to the National Institute of Health," said Mrs Pelosi.
Mr Ryan's advisors say that diversion of funds is a long-standing step which the Obama administration has drawn attention to in order to exaggerate the maximum political benefit from the problem of the Zika virus.
Last week, the National Health Institute announced that clinical trials of Zicka virus were started in 80 people and hopes to start the second phase of "Zicka virus epidemic countries" in the beginning of 2017.
However, as the officials claimed on Thursday, the study will stop without immediate additional funding.
Barvela said that she would channel her fight against the Zika virus in $34 million from the National Health Service for medical treatment for other diseases, including cancer and diabetes.
A further 47 million will be transferred to the Biomedicine In-depth Research and Development Authority, which supports the development of medicines and vaccines in response to emergencies in the field of public health.
This money will come from a number of accounts, including USD 19 million from a programme that provides heating oil subsidies to disadvantaged families and USD 4 million from drug dependence programs such as opioid dependence.
Even then, as Barvela said, the extra money will only suffice for the next month, when the agencies will have to "reasonably narrow down their activities" in the fight against the Zika virus, if the Congress does not act.
Over the past four months, the Disease Control and Prevention Centre has spent USD 60 million to help States protect pregnant women, USD 25 million to strengthen their preparedness for the Zicka virus and plans to fight it, as well as USD 16 million to help it develop data collection systems to quickly detect microbial and other Zicka virus-related symptoms.
The Thai leader associate attacks on tourist popular sites with constitutional changes
On Friday, the head of the Thai junta invited the people of the country to be patient until investigators find out who stands behind the deadly series of bomb bombs in Thailand this week.
General Prajut Chan-oč, leader of the junta and Prime Minister, said that criminals were "bad people" protesting against the new Constitution, which was approved by voters in a referendum held on Sunday.
"Unfortunately, there are still bad people, and they were working before the referendum," he said to the people.
In the bomb explosions in five provinces on Thursday and Friday, including in Phuket and Huachin, four dozen people were killed and injured.
The authorities claim that the attacks of burners in another country are linked.
The analysts claim that the purpose of bomb explosions was not to kill many people, but to harm the tourism sector, one of the light points of the Thai economy.
At least nine foreign tourists were injured in Huanhina.
"No matter the motifs, explosions and attacks of burners have overturned the junta's claim that the post-referendum situation will be stable," said Sunai Fasuks, senior researcher of Human Rights Watch.
These attacks have caused discrediting effects on the public, terrorising the public and harming the economy based on the tourism sector.
The personnel of the Thai rescue services take care of the bomb's explosion in Huahin on Friday.
The police claim that, in their view, these explosions do not involve international terrorism or prolonged Islamic unrest in southern Thailand.
They regard attacks as "local sabotage", not terrorism.
The time and location of the attack is characterised by a strong political symbol.
The explosions took place on Friday, when people were prepared to celebrate Queen Sirita’s birthday, which in Thailand is considered to be Mother’s Day.
Four explosions fell in Huachin, about 125 miles [125 km] from Bangkok, where most of the injured were also injured.
The Constitution prepared by the military will reduce the influence of political parties and give military authorities greater powers, even if the government is once again under the control of the civilian population.
Hunta helped ensure its victory by preventing opponents from campaigning against it.
Murray Hibert, a South-East Asian expert at the Strategic and International Studies Centre in Washington, pointed out the military suspicion that attacks were made by people who were dissatisfied.
The lights were "precisely coordinated, but obviously targeted at creating fear and anxiety, not mass damage and damage and injury," he said.
Last year, 20 people, mostly tourists from China, were killed in the explosion at the popular Erevan temple in Bangkok.
The Thai officials involved bombings with Uyguru fighters who were dissatisfied with the return of more than 100 Uyguru to China.
The President-in-Office, who has been chairing the junta since 2014 when the civil government was suspended, said that this week's explosion "slows the hearts of Thais."
Why is it better now, when the country is better, when the economy goes better, and the tourism sector is better?" he said.
We have to ask why and who did it.
Golden Reaction: How Simon Manuel looked at His historic moment
When I started the fight tonight, I was as if I tried to remove from my shoulders the gravity of the black community, which is something that I am not with myself in the position.
However, I hope that all of this will be gone.
I am more than happy with the fact that I can serve others for inspiration and hopefully to diversify this sport.
At the same time, however, I would like to have a day when we have more, and it is not Simon, a black swimmer, because the term of a black swimmer makes it look like I should not have the ability to win a gold medal or that I should not have been able to beat the record.
This is not the case, because I work as hard as everyone else, and I love sport and I want to win like everyone else.
Fight for the protection of students - lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (L.G.B.T.) - in Colombia
Two years ago, Sergio Urrego, who was 16 years ago, will be dissipating from shopping center in Bogota, before leaving a message of his suicide in the Facebook entry, quoting the song Pink Floyd "Goodbye Cruel World" ("The wicked world of the Arabs").
His death was the beginning of the contradictions that stood out this week in Colombia, where efforts to extend L.G.B.T. rights were seen in the broader political struggles that have divided the country into two camps.
After his death, Urredo’s mother, Alba Reijesa, lodged a complaint with the school officials to blame them for her only son’s exclusion when it was found that he and his classmate had an intimate relationship.
A year later, the High Court of Colombia declared a favourable judgment to her, calling for schools throughout the country to develop clearer policies to prevent discrimination.
The decision was part of a series of legal victories of the Colombian gay movement. Some time ago, the movement mentioned this year celebrated the decision on legalization of single-born marriages.
This week, however, they faced an obstacle in their fight for equality, as Jean Perody, the minister of education, which has been openly gay, has come to a scandal about the application of this provision to the scandal.
The scandal began when the social media began to circulate sexually discovered content from the pornography magazine, spreading to people the language that it is part of the ministry’s educational manual.
Perodia's doing this.
Although the Ministry offered assistance to schools on issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity with the idea of helping them to focus on the rule, it has not attempted to impose standard regulations.
"What we want for schools is the tools for resolving conflicts," said Mrs Perdeus on Thursday in the interview.
The debate started before the national debate on the future in a country where peace talks between government and revolutionary Colombian armed forces, or FARC, are taking place.
The coalition of politicians and the leaders of the Catholic Church in the opposition to the government have been very quickly mobilised to blame the government of the President Huana Manuel Santos for the unity and promotion of gender change.
To make everyone even more difficult, a government delegation in the negotiations with the FARC in Havana recently reached an agreement on gender and equality between L.G.B.T., which calls on the government to adopt more inclusive policies.
The government's criticisms and peace talks in the 42 - year - old Perodia, the emerging star of Colombia's policy.
They were also threatening to target violence against him and her partner, Cecilia Alvaresa-Correa Glena, former ministers of trade.
The Perodia kept the whole week of apprehensive peace in an effort to correct the error and resume the debate under constructive conditions.
"Partly what makes me stand and keep a clear head is a sense that there are children who will only reveal," she said.
This is a very tight field of work and a very lonely time.
She also referred to the link between the peace process and the debate on L.G.B.T. students.
While the Collabians continue to assess the benefits of a deal with the FARC, which would be a turning point for the earthquake in the country, they have to think about the upsurge in the conflict, she said.
"Is it a peaceful country that promotes inclusion or exclusion; is it one with equal opportunities for all?" she asked the question.
Although this week she has not been pleased to be the target of insults and overcrowdings, she is pleased that in modern Colombia, the gay students can take an example from her and think that they can also try to become ministers for one day.
"It is very important for me that they are calm and conscious that they can fully realise their potential," said Mrs. Perodia.
We cannot expect a new suicide to begin to change something.
Keep the vote cyber-flying - The New York Times
"The U.S. is looking for ways to keep hackers away from election caves" (information article, August 4)
The Minister for Internal Security, Jeff Johnson, says that Obama's administration is thinking about additional security protection of the national electoral system.
These changes may be necessary and should be considered immediately.
Cyber threats in various manifestations and the recent discovery that external forces, possibly national states, are increasingly interested in the influence of our elections, requires the federal government to pay further attention to the provision of our electoral system and may consider it part of the infrastructure essential for our country.
Johnson should immediately contact thousands of national jurisdictions that help to hold elections and offer assistance, advice and guidance from the Inland Security Department.
While the diverse and diverse nature of our voting infrastructure hinders efforts to ensure it, it tells us that the process must start as soon as possible.
The writer, the democrat from Mississippi, is a member of the high-ranking national security committee.
A boy was injured in the carousel in Pennsylvania, this week the third instance of attractions in parks
On Thursday, a boy was injured and taken to the Pittsburgh Hospital. The rapid help desk and park officials say this week this is already the third accident in the United States parking parks where children were affected.
A child whose name is undisclosed has only been taken to the children’s hospital in Pittsburgh about 50 miles (80 km) west of the AidLvail and Soukson park in Laijonier, Pennsylvania, said a representative of the emergency services in Westmurland.
A three-year-old boy, who went with his brother while he was on the ground, was aware of the situation, and an e-mail representative of the park, Jeff Kruscher, informed.
Cross said that the Rollo Coaster attraction would be closed for the investigation period of the event.
Children must have at least 3 feet (91 cm) in order to be able to visit the carusele and those who are less than 4 feet (122 cm) must be accompanied by adults.
According to the information published on its website, the attraction was built in 1938, and the State Department of Agriculture indicated that it had been tested in August.
The hospital representative refused to comment on the health condition of the boy.
On Sunday, a 10 - year - old boy died of neck injury from the world’s highest waterfall in Kansassia, Kansas.
On Monday, three 6, 10, and 16 - year - old girls were delivered to the hospital, who fell from over 30 feet (9 feet) heights over the panoramic wheel basket during the fair in Greenville, Tennesia.
The Prime Minister of Japan, Abe, will not visit a temple that honors the memory of those who fell in war on the second anniversary of World War II: Jiji
The news agency Jiji reports that the Japanese Prime Minister Sindzo Abe Japan's defeat on World War II will not visit the controversial Tokyo Festival, which honors the memory of those who fell in war.
On Thursday, she reported that Abe, however, was planning to send a ritual gift for Jasukuni to the temple on Monday about the anniversary.
The temple also honors the memory of 14 Japanese soldiers who are just convicted as war criminals, and China and South Korea regard it as a symbol of Japanese wartime militaryism.
He has not visited the temple since December 2013, when he announced that he had visited to show respect for those who died for their homeland.
The new Minister of Defence of Japan, Tomomi Inada, has not answered the question as to whether she will attend the temple, explaining that it was a matter of conscience.
Inada - close to the Abe ally and the supporter of the amendment to the Japanese pacifistic constitution - has regularly visited Jasukuni in the past.
The news agency Kyodo reports that the Minister of Reconstruction of the areas affected by the Japanese disaster visited the temple on Thursday of Massahro Imamura and said that he prayed for the peace and prosperity of Japan.
Relations between China and Japan, two major economies in Asia, have become more tense after the increasing presence of the Chinese coast guard and other national vessels near the disputing islands in the South China Sea, which is known as the Senate in Japan, but in China as the Diaouju.
Two suspects have been detained in planning acts of terror in Rio Olympic Games: police
On Thursday, the police detained two people suspected of supporting the Islamic State of the group during the attack planning during the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Prior to the operation on Thursday, the police had already detained 12 persons, all suspected of cooperating with Islamic State fighters.
The Brazilian federal police report that three more individuals were interrogated and subsequently released.
The two arrests on Thursday were Brazilian, but the police did not reveal their names and other information.
Although there has been no conflict in the history of Brazil with known groups of fighters, the government reports that the country has become a more pressing target due to the Olympic Games, in particular because of the participation of countries fighting the Islamic State.
Its fighters control certain areas of Iraq and Syria and the US-led coalition has carried out air attacks against them.
The team has been supported by global supporters who have carried out civilian shooting and bombing.
The murder of a young suspected French priest is officially charged with charges
During last month's murder investigation against a man arrested on Monday, Reuters reported a source of information to the police.
The suspects of 21 years of age were subjected to investigations into terrorist cooperation, and he had planned attacks on people, a source of information.
A man was phoned to Adel Kermič and Abde Málik Petitjan, who had ceased church service in Saint-Jierne two in Rome, Western France, on July 26, and turned the horse over to the 85-year-old Roman Catholic priest, Father Zak Amel.
Both police were shot.
The suspect had come from his home near Toulouse, to Sentezen du Ruwa, and had spent the night there on days before the attack.
The young man who had not previously been criminally punished admitted that he had spent the night there, but told the investigators that he had gone away the following day because he had no good relationship with Kermič and Petitjan, he said the source of information.
The investigators are trying to find out whether Kermitch and Petitdjan were involved in France and whether they were associated with the Islamic State, which has assumed responsibility for the attack.
At the end of last month, Pettgjan’s cousin was sentenced to pre-trial detention.
Doruss de Vriess pass medical tests before you move to Celtic
Nottingham Forest Club gateway Doruss de Vries arrived in Glasgow, because hopes to conclude an agreement on the transfer to Celtic.
De Vries was photographed at the entrance to the Roshol Hospital before medical examination after Hoops agreed on the conditions with Sky Be Championship Club.
The manager of the Parkhead Club Brendan Rogers is looking for an experienced centre guard to have competition for Kreig Gordon for the current first room.
However, Roger trusts in the 35-year-old de Vries because he worked together with the Dutch man in the Swansea club.
He played 51 games in Swansea, which they under Rogers' leadership in 2011 won the right to move to the Prime Minister.
He changed that summer to the bicycle form to join the Vilnius, and since 2013 he has been City Ground.
He has also played in Scotland during his career after the Diunfermline season, after having moved back in 2006.
His stay in the Real Park ended with frustration, however, when Pars experienced a double agony, being "sent in exile" from the highest level before losing Celtic Scottish Cup.
According to the contract, the Vartsargam was still a year in the Forest, and it was reported that Celtic will have to pay only a nominal fee to get his signature.
Macy's gonna close 100 stores.
Supermarket giant Macy's on Thursday announced its plans to close 100 stores, which is a dramatic step towards helping the chain of shops to advance from potentially glamorous problems: in America, it claims to be an online shopping era too many stores.
Macy's regularly reduces the portfolio of its shop, often closing several dozens of underpaid shops immediately after the annual holiday fever.
However, when it comes to the summer announcement that it will close 15 per cent of its 728 outlets, the chain of shops seems to have taken a much more aggressive stance than many similar representatives of the retail sector in terms of reducing its number of shops, adapting to the very changing shopping environment.
Walkers and buyers go by Macy's store in New York.
Retail giant announces that it intends to close 100 stores.
Macy's has many reasons to try something to change: many of its stores are located in small regional shopping centres, as the number of buyers has been particularly affected by the e-commerce boom.
In general, the category of supermarkets is more difficult to deal with, as buyers are increasingly choosing retailers with lower prices, such as T.J.Maxx and fast fashion players such as H&M.
These factors, along with the short-term difficulties such as the ever smaller international tourist spending and the weather that Macy's set in a fragile situation that has gone on for more than a year.
On Thursday, the company announced that its comparable sales in the last quarter had fallen by 2,6 per cent, a rather weak indicator, which was nevertheless an improvement in view of the very poor decrease of 6.1 per cent in the annual peak observed in the previous quarter.
The retailer's revenues amounted to USD 5,87 billion (7,64 billion for Canada), less than 3,9 per cent last year.
Macy's said it's going to cost it about $1 billion per year in terms of turnover.
And closing up such a large number of shops could at the same time be regarded as the recognition of the beginning of a retailer.
However, the value of the company's shares fell by 17 percent on Thursday, which shows that investors perceive this move as a proactive measure that tells about a stronger future for Macy's.
In some sense, that Macy's reduces the number of shops, should not be surprised.
The retailer’s director-general Terij Lundgrens said earlier that there are quite simply too many shops in the chain.
For some time, senior managers said that they had adopted a new strategy with a particular emphasis on 150 of its most profitable shops, seeking to achieve higher sales volumes in the already advantageous outlets.
Jeff Janet, Director of Macy, who has been appointed Lundgren as of 2017, said in his statement almost all the shops that the company intends to close down are those where sales and profitability are going down.
"We are aware that there is still no adequate return on investment at these outlets and that there is often no level of customer shopping experience that reflects our efforts in relation to the Macy brand," said Janete.
The company announced that it would come up with a list of stores that would be closed later.
Macy's said that still being decided on the shops to be closed and that therefore it is not yet clear exactly how many workers will be made redundant.
The retailer will not leave the main markets where it currently has shops, but it will think about closing shops in less active areas.
This move is likely not to be a problem for shopping centre managers who count on large tenants like Macy's to attract and hold other smaller shops in their shopping centers.
Are dangerous bacteria in your water bottle?
According to a new study, drinking from refilled bottles may be "more worse than licking your dog's toy", taking into account how many bacteria are to come into contact.
Website Thirdmill Reviews commissioned EmLab P&K to test 12 four different types of water bottles - with screw cap, flip-off cap, with push-button cap, and with straw.
Every bottler had used a week without washing.
Your refilled water bottle may be as dirty as a dog's toy.
"On the basis of the 12 water bottles we tested, we found that re-used pots can contain a worryingly large number of viable bacterial cells: more than 300 000 colony-forming units per square centimeter (CVV/kv.cm.)," says Treadmill Reviews.
Bottles with flip-off caps showed the highest number of microbes, more than 900 000 colony-forming units per square centimetre (CVV/kv.cm)
The bottles had microbes that could cause skin infections, pneumonia or blood poisoning.
Bottles with compressed stoppers were the next worst case with 162 000 CFU/ sqm, while containers with screw stoppers only contained less than 160 000 CFU/qm.
"Drink water from such bottles may be worse than eating from your pet's bowl" is shown on the website.
A better landscape is observed for straw bottles, where only part of the remaining bacteria were found: only 25 CFU/v.cm.
This might be because water is poured down to the lower part of the straw instead of sticking to its edges, thus attracting the microbes that love humidity.
In bottles with straw, the microbes are described as "most harmless."
"On the basis of our test results, we recommend choosing a bottle with straw, because of the absence of a small number of bacteria and harmful microbes," says the website.
We also know that when it comes to bottles and bacteria, stainless steel has better choice than plastic.
In addition, water bottles without cracks and difficult to clean places will have fewer microbes.
On the website, readers are advised to wash the bottles after each application, ideally with a mild bleaching solution.
Religion must become modern or be forgotten
In the United States, the Democratic Party has recently nominated Hilary Clinton as presidential candidates.
If the results of the last polls show true also in elections, in January America will invade its first President - a woman.
Last week, across the ocean, British Prime Minister Teresa Meya discussed the withdrawal of Britain from European rules with German Chancellor Angel Merkel.
Women raised in Western society are educated so that they can be competent and successful in any field of professional activity thanks to education, ambitions and hard work.
And today, young girls can focus on a number of existing role models working in the field of senior leadership.
So, is the really long and heavy struggle for equality between women at last over?
Hilary Clinton is ready to become the president of the United States at any time, but women's leadership in religion remains a controversial issue.
All right, not entirely.
In the religious field, women's leadership remains a controversial issue.
Last week, Pope Francisco announced the creation of a new commission to assess whether women would be consecrated in diacons in the Catholic Church.
The Angian Church consecrated Libya Lane as the first woman-bishop in January 2015, but it was only after a unsuccessful attempt in 2012.
While the reform of the Judaism movement in women's rabbi has been used since the beginning of 1970s and the conservative movement since the beginning of 1980, the concept of women's rabbin is still very strong.
In November 2015, the American Orthodoxial Rabbit Council published a rather harsh message in its third attempt to stop increasing support for the recruitment of wave Orthodox women about the conflict between the concept of women-Rabine and the law.
Not without irony, when Hilary Clinton was nominated as candidates for the office of President of Democrats, a group of American leading Orthodox rabbi against the coordination of women began a series of 'debate' on this contentious issue.
Why is there such a difference between secular and sacral?
Orthodoxical Jewishism, like most other religions, is seeking stability in what it considers to be lasting traditional values.
This is reflected in the ability to resist pressure to adapt to the changing society.
Those who are against the coordination of women shall do so on the grounds that it is not "traditional".
However, taking over with a tradition in this way is a price.
And the price of such unilateral thinking can literally undermine the tradition of itself by subtracting the oxygen that it needs to maintain its vitality from the traditional community.
In the book "August firearms", the first in the military history of the World War, Barbara Tačmen highlights the danger of giving priority to the tradition of what has become known as "the tragedy of red bees."
Until the beginning of World War I, when the war broke away from the wartime on the nearby distances to a heavier artillery that was broadcast from a distant distance, it became profitable to hide the soldiers as long as possible.
British and German troops responded to these changes by replacing their bright uniforms against boring gray and brown.
The French soldiers, however, still wear the same red hats and trousers that made them easy.
The French Minister of Wars, Adolf Messimie, suggested that his troops could act in a similar way, and that they were treated with despair and opposition.
The red trousers reflected the pride and prestigiousness of the army, and the military traditionals were not prepared to abandon it.
Mr Etien, former Minister for War Affairs, spoke on behalf of France when speaking in parliament.
"Discarding the red panties?" he cried out.
Never!
"It's an undisputed and idiotic pine at the most visible of all colors," he then wrote in Messime, "was to have a bad consequences."
Faith leaders who fight for women's inclusion in leading religious roles could fall into the same trap.
Focusing only on "traditional" religion, rather than asking the important question: "What changes are necessary for religion to flourish?" they risk losing about 50 percent of their follower.
They also take away the talent, skills and enthusiasm of the whole community that women would otherwise give.
Try to make sure that men continue to wear pants when they talk about religion can be traditional, but as red bees break, it may not be worth it.
Dina Breivere is the founder of the Women's Orthodox feminist Association in Great Britain and a student of orthodox rabbiism in Jessivat Mahart in New York.
The children in Roya region learned new skills at the camp.
From August 1 to 6, the "Varavikksne bridges" camp was held at the Centre for Children and Youth in Rojupe, during which participants developed creatively, sport, as well as acquired new skills.
We arrived at the camp at the final day when children with great passion painted glass jars.
Māra Folkmane, youth specialist at the Rojupe Centre for Children and Youth Initiative, said that this was one of the activities that the participants liked most.
A visit to Einer Kalniņa's factory "Mazbebriņi" was also a source of great joy.
Most children liked the lasergravier because it was possible to see a drawing that is on their computer gradually applied to the plate.
E. Kalniņš has told us what items to learn at school if he wants to work in the table, namely mathematics, especially geometry, computer knowledge, and technical drawing and race.
He also stressed the need to work more on the brain than on the muscles in this profession.
There are individual orders in the small hall, and it is important to plan everything first.
To get to know each other better, as the camp began, participants took part in different games, as well as jointly formed the camp "Gerboni".
On Wednesday, a journey along the sea from Roja to Zocene took place, and natural materials were collected along the way, which were later used to make cards.
Sport games were also wanted, which are of particular importance to the participants.
We went to apartment buildings, where we have a sports and recreation field, we played football and a network ball.
Children like sports activities, we have a lot of boys who play football, basketball, and every time they demand something sport.
Girls like calmer stuff.
On the next day, by means of a self-tolerant mass, we decorated jars that can later be used as pencil holders.
There was also a talent evening, children chose to speak with themselves, and one evening was devoted to performances.
Table games were also played, each of them could show their knowledge during the photo orientation, where objects had to be found and photographed.
The task was to get together in different ways in every picture.
We also painted mandalas - some of them like more, some less.
There will never be one lesson that will please everyone - sport and creative classes are closer to the other.
"Now it seems that everyone is exciting to work on glass painting," explained M. Folkmane.
At the end of the camp, diplomas were issued on creativity, sport, as well as assistance: several children helped in economic activities.
The camp name "Varavikksne Bridges" is due to the participation of children from three associations - Rojupe and Melnsila Children and Youth Initiative Centre, as well as the Roja multifunctional centre "Strops".
These are the one-way bridges.
If the racers think something faster, we take the idea; if otherwise, they borrow from us.
We share our experience.
This year, 30 participants - children who were active during the year - were involved in the camp.
"The fear is that there will be 30, and it also came," says Folkmane.
The camp took place already in the fifth year.
It started in 2010, when the social service in Roja decided that families of many children and children of poor families needed to organise camps in summer.
In the meantime, however, the situation in Paradise has improved and the camp is now intended for the local population, who come and operate in youth centres.
The aim is to spend free time materially and comprehensively.
In the past, there were two camps, each involving 20 children, while at the moment there is only one camp due to the overall decrease in the number of children in the country.
Similar activities are taking place during the rest of the year.
The children drew, painted glass, and Einārs Kalniņš came to the villages, who taught the burning of wood, the construction of machinery from wood, and the cuttings of various forms with a prosthesis.
There is also a new technique - anchoring, it's coloring with hot wax crate.
Under the leadership of teacher Ilze Šelkov, we had classes made of polymer material, formed columns, and a variety of industries.
Paintings are made from natural materials, interesting mandalas from beans, peas, linseed, and in the autumn we collect leaves.
We're trying to use what's around us.
The youth centre works in winter from 15.00 to 20.00, while in summer from 14.00 to 20.00.
"The youth centre is attended on average by 15 children per day," says Folkmane.
She stressed that Roya district council provides great support, which understands the need to allocate money to children, because they form our future.
Charlton Athletic fans "can get a seasonal ticket only if they sign a behavioural contract" and agree not to criticise the club in social media.
Although we recognise that everyone has the right to his personal opinion, the publication of confusing comments on such websites does not work.
The fan working in the field of administration was then told that he would have to get a ticket personally from former police chief inspector Cliffe Eigera, who joined the club last month after 35 years of career in the police force.
In the following letters: "I must inform you that the granting of a seasonal ticket will be renewed on condition that you sign a "Conordinated Contract of Conduct" (ABC) which will provide that you will continue to refrain from publishing poisonous or confusing comments on all kinds of social media websites representing a club or club, or any other type of behaviour that might be considered antisocial."
When speaking to Daily Telegraph, the fan described how he called the club after the season ticket payment, which was not received, and two days later, a letter was received by post.
Yesterday he went to the meeting at the club and said, "They told me that I was too much "twiss" to make others who are funny."
Driving holidays on the coasts of Dalmatia
What do you mean by the word "raise"?
I'm driving here from all power," said Colina, a former US Navy Commander who has just driven a 25-mile bike along the central part of a rough Croatian island without leaving anything there, with the exception of a spies of sweats and zalvily lush sailors who have been embarrassed in the hostile mountains.
Some bicyclers sing hymns, or they sing stunts, to make it easier for them to be on the mountain.
The Colin's girlfriend Petia recommends "The Little Engene That Courd".
Some may be silent or simply silent, thinking about what it is demanding to get into a trans-like position spoken of by combatants.
Collina is more poisonous than diverse.
Drive some yards forward to her is as if after the vests of Hugh Grentas as the film "Charter's wedding and one funeral" at the beginning.
Her mission and my mission are a week-long "luxus" yacht and a bike along the coast of the North Parliament of Croatia and the islands organised by Freedom Treks.
When you drive at summer heat along such a steep mountain place as Croatia may not correspond to everyone's perception of luxury, however, it is said that the Northern Distribution is easier to drive than the South Dalmatisation, our blankets are soft, and when we filled in booking forms, freely and convincingly before all those months, there was a window that we didn't mark, which could have provided us with battery charged e-vetosip.
The luxury part of the transaction is our floating house for a week, the very new "Melody".
At the end of the trip, we can throw our bicycles at our guides Ivan and Ivan at the rear of the ship and jump the hearing in blue water without contacting the sea pebbles, sharp stones and other people on the narrow rock lanes called a beach.
In June, water temperatures in the sea are perfect, all agree: cool enough to cool down but not cold.
On "Melody" there are masks and breathing rubs and some kayaks, if someone feels energetic after a heavy morning on the blankets.
Instead, most of us return to our cabins with air conditioners, where Helen, the ship's massage - I'm not kidding - will have already covered our beds, expanded our minibar stocks and left a new box with shocking charges on the table.
Ivan says that escalating after cycling is very important, and in the afternoon we learn to seduce on our beds or with cushion seats on the upper deck with Barten Antonio, who is always ready to prepare one of his cocktails.
"Melody", 42 m long with 15 cabins and half a dozen crews, is not a large superjaht, but rather a stylish small cruise ship.
It turns to a small island port between fishing boats and fleet holidays in yachts, and we are proud to belong to it.
Colina and Petia belong to a group of friends of Meetup.com from Washington (Kolumbia district): at sports and public activists after 45, as they call themselves.
Last year's hiking boats and bicycle holidays in the Netherlands were so successful that they decided to try something even more for adventures, and that is what they are now in Croatia.
The competing cemeteries from their church are boating and cycling on holidays in Provence, and every afternoon air is bound to compete in the printing of competing Facebook publications pingpong rally.
The free-time adventure element can be exaggerated, because our schedule is nothing unless a specific regime is established.
"Brokastis and dinner are eight," Ivan announced the new participants at the opening meeting, when we started the road from the beautiful old port of Trogiras, close to Split.
One signal of the ship's bell indicates that the account is open, while the other one at the end of the meal calls for quietness and careful listening to further information.
"Good morning!" is the cultural context that is probably lost everywhere, but not in the British contingent.
What's the difference - fun has already taken up the speed, jokes are falling as a result of the abundance of the horn, while Ivana releases day tours, but we all pretend we are afraid of swinging, contouring and profiles with climbs and falls, although anything else would be a surprise on the Croatian bike, which begins and ends at sea level.
"It's like a heart monitor," said Ivan.
Full plainness is not recommended.
The Ivan conducts the information meeting in parallel with the free switchover from English to German.
There are weeks when he has to deal with a dozen different nationalities, but we are a simple group - Swiss, German, American and British - who, during meals, sit easily at tables where two speak English, but one is German.
On the road, we're all friends.
Cycling promotes unionism, and the only competition is inside, i.e. with itself.
I do not remember when the Group's dynamics would have been more harmonious and relaxing.
Soon we're on Ivan's wave.
A small rise is a slope, which should not be confused with the inequality, which is a good thing.
Matadates are serpentines and straight ahead means straight: simple, but not always easy.
The driving instructions are always the same: "Watch alone, keep the distance, and it's not a race.
See you on the shoreside nine.
All right, five pairs, I forget you're on holiday.
Take a lot of water with you.
We will go two days in a cruise north through the Kornati archipelago, where we will drive around the whole length of Dugi Ook - Croatian "long island" - and after a little money, we will go on a walk through Telashcica Nature Park to admire its steep rocks and salt lakes, where sea water flows through the underground channel.
It is said that those who swim in it, thanks to its strength, are getting younger.
If we do so, will our feet feel younger and stronger?
On the small island of Molat, we return southward, moving from the continent to the nearby islands apparently by chance.
Most of our trips are on empty small roads along the externals of the country with a wide view of the sea and a wide range of plants: olive trees, vineyards, sharp plant prunes, Mediterranean smells in the air and countless butterflies in the flight.
As we go ahead, there is always a friction, but when Ivan stops, there is always a big shadow, and small flowers are like a prize for those who arrive faster.
Sport and public activists go a lot on cycling weekends, and they know the standards of behaviour by sending instructions along the line and leaving free space so that the motorists can perform the reclining manoeuvres much more safely.
"You're almost down there," one wheel driver says to the other after the heavy car driver decided to carry out a manoeuvring manoeuvre in an opaque curve and quickly struck down.
Happily, the brakes worked.
Ivan divides us into three groups every piece of short section for travelling on the main roads, with Ivan at the very back of the back, to encourage and "send the pace", as Ivan says.
If you have to cross the main road, we all gather, drop off the bikes and change safety with our bicycles on the other side as instructed, not before.
"Do you think Ivan is aware that he is not talking to a group of children?" asks a Swisscycler when we stand on the road and wait for a signal when we can cross it.
Not all afternoon, we can spend time resting.
In Zadar, a Roman forum and sea eagles play music, which sounds like a man of a imprisoned sea monster, through stone-integrated pipes in promenade and open water, are opened.
The famous sunset of Zadar falls perfectly between the main dish and the bottle, and after the dark comes back to the sea porch and we watch the waved lamp games in the glass trotuar, which is actually the dance floor.
When "Melody" early in the morning begins the way to the bustling Biograd resort, the organ song is nothing more than just chunk.
On the fifth day we are completely free from cycling.
A journey up the river Estuary of Kraka to see its waterfalls; then a afternoon tour in Sibani, where we look at the Cathedral of thought, the masterwork of the Dalmatian renaissance, as well as a walk of chair time along the peaceful Zlarina island, looking for its local treasure coral, makes this day interesting.
Lurda is going to take the pilgrims to attack the shadow
People gather at the Lourda Our Lady’s temple during the annual Catholic sanctification.
The French security forces are in high alert state, as thousands of Catholics gather at the annual pilgrimage of the Lurdes temple in the shadow of several acts of terrorism.
Every year, on August 15, tens of thousands gather at the foot of the Pyrenees temple to celebrate Mary’s presence in heaven.
This year, the pilgrimage takes place at a time when the Catholics were shocked by the murder of an older French priest on July 26, carried out by two Islamic extremists who invading the church in the north of France during the Mass and recamping him.
The murder of Jacques Amella took place two weeks after a Tunisian investigator claims that he was radicalized by Jihadistist online video materials,-- was hit by a truck in Bastyle's day's sanctifier in the city of Nice in Riviera, killing 85 people.
After three large-scale attacks in 18 months, many French citizens are cautious about attending public events.
The number of tourists fell sharply, and the authorities were concerned that this year’s number of pilgrims could fall sharply.
However, the fear of massive withdrawals did not materialize -- and some organizers say that even the influx of visitors' applications was observed at the last moment.
The arrival of some 25 000 believers is expected, including the delegation of large groups from Italy and Belgium and around 200 Christian representatives from the Eastern branch of Christianity.
Many pilgrims have declared that they will not be afraid.
"We don't think to stop living," 66-year-old visitor Christian said to the agency AFP, describing prayer as a "one weapon" in the fight against violence.
"It is important to show that life continues," said Matje Guinea, one of the coordinators.
We will not give up on our faith, our beliefs, or our way of life simply because some fanatics are trying to sow fear.
Due to the concerns about safety in France since the attack in Nice, a number of large-scale events have been lifted, including a huge stock market in the northern town of Lille and the European Championship in cycling, which was due to take place in Nice in September.
"Last week I lived in fear that my phone will be called in one call to cancel applications," said Fabien Lezes, a priest who is responsible for the conduct of official pilgrimage.
"On the contrary, it seems that attacks have mobilised believers," he said and announced the influx of last-time applications.
Kristiāns Žels, the head of the trade association of local hotel workers, confirmed the "high interest" of the pilgrimage after attack.
There were extremely strict security measures around the temple where a young woman, Mary, appeared in the ranks of 1858 to be a poor shepherd, Bernadete Subir.
Around 250 police officers and two dozen soldiers have been designated to protect the site, including bomb neutralization experts and experts with explosive search for dogs.
Celebrating through security barriers, these bags were tested at the entrance, and the number of access points was reduced from twelve to three.
Katrina Simckox, who was on his pilgrimage from northeastern England to Lurde at the beginning of this month, described the enhanced security measures.
"By Thursday morning, armed guards in the temples were located, and then, through the gate (with metal barriers), only one could enter, as well as bags were searched," she said.
"This all frightened my three children who were used to Lurde, and it was hard to scare them when they asked why it was happening," she said.
It did not damage my impressions, but I was sad at the need, and I realized that many people were calmed down by these measures.
The route of the opening process on Friday is also shortened - instead of starting in the town of Lurda and moving on to the temple, it will begin and end in the temple.
Other measures include the closure of the airspace for flights above Lourde, the closure of the streets near the road temple and the replacement of waste caves against transparent plastic bags.
The French Minister for Home Affairs, Bernārs Kazenev, will screen security measures on Saturdays.
About six million people go to Lurdes a year, making it one of the largest destinations for Catholic pilgrimage in the world.
Many visitors lead relatives who are sick or disabled and who come to swim in a source cave in which Mary had seen Bernadete believe in the therapeutic properties of water.
Tjeris Castio, one of the organizers, described this year's assembly as "a little unusual" in view of "the danger, as roots, seems to be in France."
However, he claimed that it would not affect the quality and depth of their experiences.
Franzuz, a 58-year-old volunteer who helped sick pilgrims, admitted that in her opinion, the presence of soldiers dressed in civilians was "a little depressing."
However, if it all calms down, it is good.
In the shooting of the Zaragoza shopping centre, two injured

Opening of the hunting season near waterbirds.
Every year, on the second Saturday of August, a hunting season for aquatic birds is opened.
This year it will begin at 16:00 on 13 August, so the State Police invites both hunters and citizens to be particularly careful and comply with security rules.
Waterfly hunts take place not only in hunting areas but also in public water bodies, and although weather conditions do not permit restorers to use these water bodies alone for other years.
Both hunters and holidaymakers and those living on water bodies call for special caution in the vicinity of lakes and rivers and to comply with safety rules, thus not endangering themselves or others.
Since it has been observed in previous years that large numbers of hunters are involved in hunting during the first days of the season, this year the State Police will carry out enhanced hunting control in cooperation with the State Forest Service.
During the control, the law will focus on the compliance of arms and ammunition with the rules of law, as well as monitor that hunting is carried out without the influence of alcoholic beverages and dangerous substances.
The police recall that the use of semi-automatic firearms with a total capacity of more than three patrols is prohibited in the hunting of waterfly birds, including the amendments to the Law on the Movement of Arms and Special Equipment, in particular Article 22 (91), which states that persons who record firearms or large-energy pneumatic weapons for hunting or sports, and who have a short stopping capacity of up to two hours during the transport of these weapons to or from hunting, are entitled to keep the gun and ammunition in the vehicle during hunting, but they must be placed as safe as possible in order to prevent the presence of a fitter or other packaging containing ammunition or weapons from outside the vehicle, from being locked doors and be equipped with a alarm device to ensure that they are not accidentally caught in the hands of unauthorised persons.
The police call on you and others to take care of the security of their own and their fellow people during the hunting season, and if you think you have an offence or some security threat, we invite you to report immediately by calling 110.
In any event of threat, the law is ready to respond to the information provided by the population.
The coast of New Caledonia is bordered by a 7.2-magnets earthquake
On Friday, the coast of New Caledonia was shaken by a 7.2-magnitian earthquake, told the seismologists that there was no threat of tsunami.
The Earthquake epicentre was located nine kilometers in a depth of 109 kilometres east of New Caledonian Ilanthera at 1.26 Griničs time (pt.4.26 Latvian time), announced the U.S. Geology Research Centre.
The Pacific tsunami alert centre has indicated that there are currently no warnings or recommendations in relation to possible tsunami threats for the region.
"The region is, as we know, not unusual, and the activity is not unusual lately," said Senior Seismologist Phil Kamins, of the Research Centre "Geoscience Australia".
It could be felt in the islands of Vanuatu or New Caledonia, but I wonder if it is strong enough to cause damage.
New Caledonia is located in "Uguns lokas" - the Pacific tectonic activity area, where earthquakes and volcano eruptions occur frequently.
Colombia and Venezuela agree on opening the border.
Colombia and Venezuela agreed to open control posts at the border between the two countries, which were closed a year ago on the initiative of Venezuela, told the Presidents of Colombia and Venezuela, Juan Manuel Santos and Nikolas Maduro on Thursday.
Initially the border posts will only be open to pedestrians.
Every day from Saturday, from 8 to 20 will open five border points.
It will be possible to open the border to transport after the conclusion of separate inter-country agreements on security, trade and energy, as pointed out by the President.
In August of last year, Maduro ordered that the border be closed in response to the attack on the Venezuelan border by the Colombian fighters.
Three Venezuelan soldiers were injured.
In July this year, Venezuela unilaterally opened the border twice as a result of the sharp economic crisis: the Venezuelan people in poverty tried to break through the border in order to acquire the goods of the first necessity in border stores.
This opportunity was used by 200 000 Venezuelan citizens.
This time for our one of Latvia's prides, sympathetic Madaras Palameiks.

She's a Latvian light screen that starts in a twisting competition.
Her coach is a father of Gint Palameik.
The Latvian recorder was divided into a mix.
Participated in the 2012 summer Olympics, participated several times in the World and European Championship (the top 4th place in the 2014 European Championship), and 3rd place in the 2015 Diamond League.
Facebook applies to the fight of advertisers.
The world’s most used social network Facebook has broadcast a kind of warning shot, suggesting that blocking advertising banners using special tools is unacceptable and that the users will also have to watch ads.
The popularity of special blockers is growing, but this means that companies with the main source of income directly from advertising are decreasing.
Facebook has now made known that it is well understood that the nature of advertising banners is damaging, but users will have to live with them.
However, they will be provided with tools to choose the type of material they are shown on their own, reports BBC.
"As we provide more and more control options for people, we will also start showing advertising to those who use a blocking software for advertising," said Andrew Bosvort, vice president of Facebook advertising business.
In other words, users will be able to choose what type of advertising they see when selecting brands and industries that seem interesting to them.
"People don't like to see advertising that doesn't apply to them or interferes with the content', says Bosvort.
Advertising blocking tools on mobile devices typically fail to function, from which Facebook receives the largest visit, but their reduction in the exposure of banners is also measured in monetary terms in billions.
According to BBC, around 200 million people are used by advertisers.
It has already been reported that in the previous quarter of the business year Facebook revenue from advertising was USD 6.2 billion, or EUR 5.55 billion.
It must be said that this is not the first time Facebook is actively involved in determining what network users see in their news streams.
As one of the last steps, Facebook has just started to take action to remove or at least limit the news streams with the headlines behind which "empty" messages are actually concealed.
At night in Brīvības iela will perform asphalting works; traffic restrictions must be taken into account.
Tonight at Bērzaunes Street from Bērzaunes Street to Gustava Zemgala Street, asphalt laying works will be carried out and therefore drivers will have to take into account the limited traffic at this stage of the street.
As LETA learned in the Riga City Council, traffic restrictions will start this stage tonight from 21 p.m. and asphalting works will last until 12 a.m.7.
In the direction of traffic towards Juglu will be directed along tram tracks.
Drivers need to consider limited traffic at this stage and additional time spent on the road.
The municipality calls for an understanding of the restrictions imposed and for the procedures of the traffic organisation to be followed.
The reconstruction of Seguma started on the main streets of the capital city - Brīvības iela from Raiņa bulvāra to Lačplēša Street and from the Air Bridge to Jugla Street, on Lāčplēša Street from the Island bridge to Avota Street, on Juglas Street Klike to Maliens Street and on Lielvares Street from Dzelzava Street to 84.vidusskolai.
Construction will take place until the beginning of the new school year and are organised continuously, including during night hours, when asphalt is mostly applied.
Medvedev Deputy Deputy in Riga has secretly met several of the SZZS Ministers.
Dmitry Medvedev, Deputy Prime Minister of Russia, Arkady Dvorkovič last week, visiting Riga, will be secretly met by three ministers of the Greens/farmers Union (ZZS) in a fish factory.
Informal meetings took place at the fish processing factory "Kaya", and the Minister of Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola, Minister of Transport Uldis Augulis and Minister of Agriculture Jānis Dūklavs, says the Internet portal "views.lv".
Such a meeting has been approved by Reizniece-Ozola.
She explained that during the meeting she was talking about abolishing sanctions for fish processors, as well as about the Incukalna gas storage.
A meeting, contrary to diplomatic practice, was held without the involvement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The organizer of the meeting was Ambassador of Russia Alexander Vešnakov.
The suspicion of misappropriation by more than €130 000 is detained by the accounting officer.
This month, the State Police (VP) Administration of the fight against economic crime (ENAP) has seized an accountant who has worked for 20 years from a commercial company in Riga, the agency BNS informed Gita Gžibovska, representative of VP.
The current information shows that the suspected woman has engaged in illegal activities for several years and has together done more than EUR 130,000.
In view of the fact that the company’s officials had not carefully followed the cash flow and trusted their employee, they only learned about the ongoing machinations after several years.
VP ENAP policemen arrested a suspected woman born in 1963 and searched in the company this month.
Criminal proceedings for misappropriation have been initiated in large amounts.
The law on such crimes provides for deprivation of liberty for a period of up to ten years by confiscation of property or by confiscation of property.
The detained person is currently subject to a security measure which is not related to deprivation of liberty.
In Estonia, Zicka virus antibodies were detected in nine people.
In the analyses in Estonia, nine people found Zicka virus antibodies, which means that they might have come into contact with this infection, is reported by the Estonian public service broadcaster ERR.
The information provided by the laboratory shows that 121 samples of Zicky virus were tested this year and nine of them were positive.
In the countries near Estonia, the first cases of Zicka have been observed in Finland and Sweden.
According to the Estonian Health Authority, no acute case of Zika virus infection in the country has been recorded and people need not undergo a Zika virus test in case of flu-like symptoms but have to contact their family doctor.
We have developed IgG antibodies (immunoglobulin G class) which show that the subject is infected at some point with Zicka or similar virus.
"This does not mean that the patient has been infected with Zick's virus", explained Paul Nabers, head of the department of infection with Synlab.
Zicky viruses carry the berries of the Aedes genus.
In Latvia there is a problem with the development of quality car procurement, the Vice President of the Auto Association Ingus Rūtiņš said in an interview to the agency BNS.
Whether in the car sector there are significant dumping problems in purchases, Rutiņš replied in a affirmative manner.
Of course.
Car purchases are quite different from those of service services, where it is easier to manipulate prices.
The car must in any case pay a certain amount as a result of the need to buy it from the manufacturer.
However, the problem is and can be classified in two groups.
Either the procuring entity is incompetent and not in a position to create quality procurement, which is the result of which, often without knowing it, 'iepika' itself.
"Does a very conscious procurement be built to get something concrete, and there then there are all kinds of miracles seen there," the Vice President of the Auto Association said.
He pointed out that it was now popular to talk about moving away from the lowest price bid to the most economically advantageous tender as the award criterion, but in part of society, these things are still misconceptions.
Now it's very popular - let's go from the lowest price to the most economically advantageous offer!
However, the criteria must be established in both cases, and when they are taken into account and evaluated, the decision is still taken on the basis of the lowest price principle.
The technical criteria for quality procurement should be very precise and market-compliant.
Points, however, do not need to measure anything that can be expressed in monetary terms.
Points do not require an assessment of fuel consumption, emissions, services and similar things.
A car needs to be aware of its foreseeable life cycle, its mile, etc., and it can easily be counted together.
"The question is then only about which of the scenarios the customer himself is interested?" explained Rūtiņš.
Peter Rubulis, project manager of the Auto Association, noted that problems related to the fact that often the same person makes purchases for cars, work gloves and food, and these purchases are derived from one example.
We have also brought to our consultation the spare parts of procurement samples, which was difficult to describe as detailed absurd.
"The problem is that the contracting authority very often lacks any understanding of the subject-matter and requirements of the procurement, just being copied from some place", Rubulis acknowledged.
And Rutiņš added - the smaller the structure that announces procurement, the bigger problems are.
"Of course this is precisely because of the lack of human resources and competence," said the vice-president of the associations.
The evolution of Latvia is not until the fight for medals.
Latvian beach volleyball duet Aleksandrs Samoilovs and Jānis Šmēdiņš left the Rio Olympic Games tournament on Thursday, coming up in the decisive match (1-2) to the owners Evandr Gonsalvešs Oliver and Pedro Solberg Salgada.
Our duo won only one victory in three matchches, and sub-group D ranked in the last fourth place.
This caused quite a great deal of confusion and sorrow on social networks, so we offer to see the brightest recordings from Twitter.
Riga Festival celebrations have started with the market.
Look at the photo as it looks at the festival market in Esplanad.
"Die Antroord" accused "Stork Units" of stealing style.
South Africa's "Die Antoord" accused the director of the film "Sicicide Sqaud" ("Saxon Unit") of using the band's unique look without permission, calling a friend's director a "little-beat" master.
The group's leading singer, Jolandi, turned to the director of Warner Bros, on the mobile application Instagram, saying, "It's exactly that, David Aier, you're stealing our style."
As she says, film stars War Delavinja and Jared Leto told me that Ajer was a taunt on the film field of Die Antword.
"But you didn't ask permission to hurt us," said the singer.
A 31-year-old musician says that Ninja, a member of her group, made a text message to Aier, but "he didn't answer anything like such a tiny filth."
Jolandi insists that Aier took the scenes from the introduction of the "Umshii Wam" short film, which shows the duets of the South African hyphopa.
She has also published a video showing that Ayer Joker and Harley Quinn were looking at the images of both singers.
Letto himself insist that the image of the inspiration Joker is the image of the rockman David Boviai.
Jolandi concludes his claim by supporting the harsh assessment of critics made by the film in its premiere.
Jolandi and Nindge, in the right words Anre du Tuat and Vatkins Tudor Jones, gained fame with three rep recordings of their study, promoting the Africaan 'Zef' counterculture.
For the first time in Latvia there will be an opportunity to hear this evening, on August 12, at the Summertime festival - invited by Inese Galante.
The virtual ensemble will play the most famous guitarist sound in the world, which includes music from different nations and lands.

All the participants of the ensemble are cousins whose names are decorated with the aphasics of the leading jazz festival, and many of the albums recorded by Trio have earned the status of Platin and Golden Disc.
The melody scent, special guitar sound, unimaginable string of vibrates, years-rounded gambling and the feeling of an ensemble are the characteristics why Randy Krauford, Lučāno Pavaroti, Scherley Beisija and other celebrities of the world have invited Rosenbergs to join in their concerts.
Trio are also welcome guests at the Carnegis Hall in New York, Los Angeles, Vienna, Montreal and other cities.

"The new season will provide even more entertaining and educationally enriching local and foreign content", says the Board Member of Lattelecom, Director of Development and Marketing Kerli Gabrielovich.

Turkey is looking for the missing diplomats after the coup attempt
Turkey shall seek at least 32 diplomats who did not return to the staff members after the coup attempt on 15 July.
Foreign Minister Mevits Chavašogs said on Friday that 208 Turkish ministerial staff were withdrawn from jobs around the world for the coup attempt period to Ankara, and 32 have disappeared "without permission".
About 18 000 civilians, military leaders and academics have been arrested or withdrawn from their positions in Turkey by the government, considering them to be a loyal US official, Fetulla Gulen, whom she accused of drawing up a government's recovery plan.
Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania, is on the list of the most sought-ups in Turkey.
Kavosoglu said that the team of the U.S. Department of Justice will later arrive this month on a visit to Turkey to discuss his possible extradition.
This issue has become a problem in US relations with Turkey, a member state of NATO.
The U.S. opposition against the violent armed tactics of the Turkish President Redzepa Tajip Erdogan after the coup, and Turkey responded to this in an attempt to establish closer ties with Russia.
Kavosoglu said that the Turkish military Attachés in Greece fled to Italy, the Attaché in Kuwait tried to escape to Saudi Arabia, but were sent back, and two generals from Afghanistan were caught in Dubai and sent to Turkey.
He also said that two officials in Bangladesh fled to New York, and one of Russia went to Japan.
The Ankara newspaper Daily Hurryiet, quoted military sources, also reported that the Turkish military Attaché to Jordan was missing.
Wall Street Journal, citing US officials who are aware of this situation, reported that a Turkish military officer based in the NATO command centre in Virginia had requested asylum in the United States.
There are those who have managed to escape.
We also had refugees among our diplomats," said the NTV broadcaster in an interview with Kavosoglu.
Since yesterday, the time has come to an end for those who were originally withdrawn.
We will take legal action against those who did not return.
The organizers of the Olympic Games are trying to clean the green coloring swimming pool
The Olympic nebula, for which on Friday training was scheduled, came to a closed pool because the organisers needed more time to clear the green-coloured water before the first individual competitions in Rio Olympics.
The water suddenly changed color on Tuesday, the synchronized diving competition.
The organisers claimed that the water race was safe even after a larger pool of adjacent water polo and synchronised swimming was also painted easily green.
Diving was not yet possible when athletes arrived in the morning to warm up, although finally the pool was opened at 13.00 after the local time - only 2 1/2 hours before women's 3 metre competition.
The color of the water looked closer to its normal color, yet still with a greenish color.
The American naughty, Abby Johnson, who competed on the tramp, told her that she came to freeze just to find out that the pool was closed without any warning.
She wrote on Twitter that "#FixTheSwamp should be in fashion.
Tom Dale, a British resonant who won the simultaneous diving of the bronze platform, also commented on the location of the pool in the Tvitera record.
Hopefully, this means that in the last few days we have not naughted inside like very bad!
Mario Andrad, the chief speaker of the Committee of Local Organizers, stressed that the pool is safe for competitions, giving green light to 3 metres for the foreheads.
He agreed that some of the athletes were disturbed by water, but he said that it was the result of a pool cleaning effort.
"We repeat repeatedly what we have said all the time - the water does not in any way endanger the health of athletes," he said.
On the first day of the situation of such water, one or two athletes complained that they were blind.
It was the result that the first reaction, when we saw how water becomes green, was to use one of the chemicals - chlorine - it's used in swimming pools very often.
We have reduced the amount immediately.
We tested water again, and this was fully consistent with the parameters.
Simon Lengford, chief speaker of Marija Poland's water sports centre, said that the pool was closed for extra cleaning works.
He said that the decision was supported by the world’s leading organisation, FINA, the International Federation of Swimming.
"The reason is that water must be calm so that the pool can return to its blue colour as soon as possible," Lengford said in his statement.
Andrad said that the deterioration of the situation of the pool was a surprise for the organisers.
"Cydia is not precise science," he said.
Some of the things you can see are long.
In the last few days, the use of rainwater in the normal state made it even more difficult.
"Nothing doesn't work," Andrad said.
He added that the athletes had access to dry workouts in the morning, but admitted that it was "not perfect."
He explained that the change in the pool’s colour was due to increased alkaline levels, similar to that of aquarium water can become green if not properly monitored.
When we started to do something to prevent green color, there were discussions about the best chemicals.
We can't use too many chemicals in water, because athletes train in it," Andrad said.
We could certainly have been better off at the beginning to prevent water becoming green.
When it became green, we made a mistake again.
The sportsmen Jay Koens and Steve Vade in Rio de Janeiro took part in the creation of this action.
Shanghai, Taipei, despite stopping cross-border communication, will still organise a forum
However, Shanghai and Taipei will organise the annual urban forum from August 22 to 23 in Taipei, announced by the Municipality of Shanghai on Friday despite the suspension of cross-border communication mechanisms.
The High-Level Municipal Officer Sha Hailin Shanhaja will lead the delegation represented in the Forum on behalf of Janga Ksjonga, announced by the Government of Shanghai in its official microblog account Sina Weibo.
The two cities have been organising the Forum since 2010.
The 2016 Forum will focus on the exchange of experience in areas such as healthcare, electronic administrative services, culture and transport, seeking to "develop the exchange of experience and cooperation in different aspects" between the two cities, as reported by the Government of Shanghai.
The Taiwanese side has not recognised the agreement reached in 1992 which strengthened the principle of one Chinese, since the new leader Tsai Ing-ven took office in May, leading to the suspension of communication and consultation mechanisms.
Ma Ksiaoguangs , a spokesperson of the Council of State for the People's Office on Lands of Taiwan, said on Friday that peaceful cross-border relations could exist as long as the Taiwanese side stopped at the political foundations of the 1992 agreement.
"We have an active and open approach to the exchange of experience between cities on both sides," said MA, stressing that the nature of cross-border relations and exchange of experience between cities should be interpreted correctly.

Museveni said that China is an ancient friend of Uganda and Africa, who supported the African continent's release from colonialism and later supported Africa's economic and social development.

He hopes that China will be able to participate in various ways in the development of Uganda's infrastructure and build an industrial park.
He also calls on Chinese to invest more in Uganda and travel around it.
Vangs She commended Uganda's efforts in the areas of industrialisation and modernisation of agriculture and added that China will continue to be the most reliable and ideal cooperation partner for Uganda.
Vangs stated that China was prepared to do everything possible to help with the economic and social development of Uganda, and added that China's cooperation with Uganda is true and without any political considerations, as it is based on a high level of political credibility and a proven friendship over time.
He said that China could strengthen cooperation with Uganda's infrastructure and industrial park and support the development of the energy and agricultural sectors of this East African nation.
