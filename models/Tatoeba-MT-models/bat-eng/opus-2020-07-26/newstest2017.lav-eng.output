A 28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco's supermarket
This week a 28-year-old chef, who recently moved to San Francisco, has been found in a climbing room at a supermarket.
But the brother of the river says that he can't imagine anyone who would hurt his brother, saying, "He's finally started to improve."
A label found at Westfield's supermarket on Wednesday has been identified as a 28-year-old San Francisco resident, Frank Galicia, said a representative of the San Francisco Medical Expert Office.
The San Francisco police declared his death to be murder and now an investigation is under way.
The Upura brother Louis Galicia tells the San Francisco broadcast ABC KGO that Frank had previously worked as a chef in Boston, but six months ago he was at his dream work restaurant "Sons & Daughters" in San Francisco.
The representative of the restaurant "Sons & Daughters" informs that the news of his death shocked them and shocked them.
"We're a small team that works as a united family and we miss him very much," said the representative.
During this difficult time, we are thinking with Frank’s friends and family.
Louis Galici says that in the beginning, Frank was at night in hostels, but in recent times life has finally improved.
"He got in a new apartment and met a girl," Louis tells the radio station KGO.
Louis Galicia says he doesn't know who would hurt his younger brother.
He was a good man with a wide heart.
"He always facilitated his family by preparing a delicious meal and preparing for lunch," said Luiss Galicia
He never wanted to engage in disputes.
He was the brother who adjusted the rest.
"Taking into account everything that's gone wrong in the world, he was like a rough diamond that flashed bright every day," he says.
Anyone who has information about the event is invited to call the SFPD Information Phone 415-5755-4444.
A strike for new doctors: calls for new protests
The representatives of the new doctors request their trade unions to initiate protests in the dispute over the new treaty.
The Committee of the United Kingdom Medical Association (LMA) Committee of Young Physicians (UKC) is preparing to request advice to support wider protests in early September.
The JRC considers that ministers have failed to question the treaty.
In July, young doctors and medical students rejected the contract offered by LMA.
58 % of all members who took part in the vote voted against the Treaty.
In a letter on Thursday evening Twitter, Elena Makkort, member of the JAK Council, states that the government continues to remain silent on this issue and that the offer of the contract has therefore been rejected.
She said: "In view of this, as a result of the JAC vote, the proposal for a treaty has been completely rejected and a decision has been taken to request new formal discussions to discuss the most important issues."
In response to the silence of the government, the JAC today formally requested a meeting with the LMA Council to authorise the creation of new contracts which will enter into force in September.
As a result of the dispute, new doctors have participated in six strikes, including for the first time in NHS history, which have stopped work.
After the vote, which rejected the contractual terms offered by the LMA, recommended by the BMA, the representative of LMA’s young doctors, Dr Johan Malawana, resigned.
Before meeting with 54 000 young doctors and medical students, he had told BMA members that the offer was good and will be accepted.
After the vote, the health secretary Jeremy Hunt told me that the contract would be concluded with English doctors.
Russia and Turkey: The Alliance of Distributed?
A shame that put an end to the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to tame and notify the end of the eight-month term and economic sanctions war.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted the Turkish leader at St. Petersburg Castle, the prospect was that this partnership was more needed for Ankara.
However, the two were tangled.
Vladimir Putin’s smile looked artificial and did not cause warm emotions, even taking into account his usual restraint.
On the other hand, the manager Tajjips Erdogan named Putin at least five times as his " dear friend", a meeting.
I got a number down.
He also promised that the relationship with Russia would not only improve to the pre-crisis level, but become even stronger.
The next day, a newspaper reported that Erdogan behaved as if nothing had happened.
I think his enthusiasm causes conflicting feelings.
However, Putin’s stagger storm shows that the Russian leader has forgotten nothing.
The first thing he mentioned in his speech was to break down the Russian aircraft on the border with Syria.
At that time Moscow reacted with a sharpness.
Putin accused Ankara of stabbing a messenger on Moscow's backs.
It was even more painful because it came from a friend.
Restoring true trust will be very difficult, perhaps even impossible.
Russia's public position has changed since November.
For several months, the government - controlled television spread aggressive insults to Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed that all of them were blamed for the Turks.
The most serious was the accusation that Erdogan's own family made profits from the illicit trade in oil with the Syrian controlled part of the Islamic State.
Of course, he denied it himself.
However, the main message of the St Petersburg meeting is that it is time to forget the past.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received an apology from President Erdogan.
Russia could perceive it as a sort of victory.
The benefit of the Ankara from peace is obvious.
First of all, Erdogan needs all possible friends after the unsuccessful coup last month in which he tried to blow.
The countless terrorist attacks have also shaken his position.
There are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have caused considerable losses, especially the charter flights ban, which, as a general rule, provides for an influx of several million Russian tourists each year in Turkish resorts.
The number of tourists decreased by almost 90%.
Russia's tour operators and charter companies also have eased their efforts when they return to regular flights.
They look forward to a holiday in the face of fever in the Mediterranean season.
Already this week, the country's TV provides for price reductions for fruit and vegetables, as imports of Turkish fruit and vegetables will be restored.
As the local newspaper Vedemosti quotes: "Tourists for them, tomatoes for us."
However, the visit included other political motives from Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West for their opinion, the weak response to the coup attempt.
There can also be a lack of satisfaction with the long-standing EU accession negotiations and with Putin's intervention, who are willing to take advantage of the situation that Turkey is alienated from the West.
The Russian leader has undoubtedly obtained additional points in the eyes of Ankara in support of its elected government following the coup attempt.
Note that Moscow is well aware of this, because it is deeply rooted in the fear of moving the regime in the country.
The summit, which took place in this beautiful seaside castle, gave Russia and Turkey the opportunity to present, as was named by an analyst, the 'deputy alliance', two countries that are excluded from the West, joined forces.
However, despite the unity shown by the public, there are still significant differences of opinion between the two countries.
The main differences affect Syria, where Russia presents itself as a peacekeeper, but in fact Russia and Turkey are supporting the opposite parties.
After more than three hours of initial negotiations, without wishing to reveal the information, both presidents announced at the press conference that they had not discussed the matter.
Turkey's President has purposefully avoided the issue of the inconsistency between the two countries, while President Putin wanted to highlight them.
There is no clear consensus on how both countries could find a common language on the Syrian issue.
However, after months of open hostile relations and potential disasters, when NATO member Turkey hit Russia's battleplane, the situation has improved, as both leaders at least have resumed negotiations.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland
The brand SKB will then have a role to play, announced by the bank’s Executive Director.
Outside Scotland SKB will no longer be available.
Ros Makevan tells the BBC channel in Scotland that SKB brand was associated with bank ambitions on a global scale.
It has abandoned these ambitions because, eight years ago, the bank almost went bankrupt and it needed financial assistance.
Meanwhile, branding experts have used SKB to protect other consumer financial brands.
The Bank received millions of pounds from international sports sponsors, starting from the six United Nations regby and ending with the Vimbdon Tennis champion Andy Murray.
However, it has now been decided to put forward other national brands at the forefront.
The Scottish Royal Banaka will be available to Scottish customers, but it will not be initialised.
In England and Wales all SKB references, outside the head office and official stock exchange list, will be changed to the name NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
Small private financial brands such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank will now also be noted.
Makevan was interviewed during the departure with clients and employees on Invernesshire.
He told the BBC Scottish Channel: "The SKB will become our investor brand and with which our employees are working because now we are becoming more than a brand bank."
In time, the bank itself became a global brand and SKB became a global brand.
Now I say that we no longer have global ambitions, we have local ambitions.
Each of these brands will represent something unique in its sector and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
SKB has already announced that it will not continue sponsoring the "Six Nations" and will engage in various brands of sport sponsorship.
"The time has come to become a brand bank, because we have long asked ourselves how to become a better bank for our customers?" says the Executive Director.
Three years ago, we would have been very cynical if we announced that we would be a great bank for our customers and that we would develop these brands.
But thanks to hard work and focus on the needs of our customers, not our own needs, we have obviously made major changes.
We can revitalise these brands again, so I think that is the time now.
Frankie Detori won the 3,000th victory in New York City with horse Predilution
The department recuperated the Champagne by winning its 3,000th victory twice by finalising the first race in New York City.
On Friday, Jockey Frankie Detor won his 3000th victory in Britain's history, taking the first place in New York City.
He reached it by winning the second victory in these races, which took place in his home city, by walking with the Predition, which John Gosden trained.
Italian, aged 45, is the sixth jockey who has achieved such a result in horse-scissored races.
He's joined Sir Gordon Richards, Dougamo Smith, Lester Pigot, Pete Edery and Willy Karson.
The three-time champion of the jaw Detor, who previously won with horse Ghayyar, said: "This is something special."
I am very moved because my family is here.
I am very glad that this happened in New York City, because I've been living here for 30 years.
This is not a big race, this is not a Royal Ascott, but an ordinary Friday evening with 20,000 people.
I feel relieved and very grateful.
After victory Detorius and Predilution is expected with rounds and gravies.
Two jockeys have reached this record race with obstacles - the champion Richard Johnson and the final 20th-time champion, Sir Antonio McKoy, who has set several records in his career, fighting over 4300 victories.
Lester Pigot, the ninefold derer was a winner, won 4493 wins during his career.
Frankie is one of today's best jockeys and there is no surprise that he has achieved the success that only few can achieve.
He is stylish and powerful, but his tactic feeling distinguishes him from other jokings.
He is a fantastic representative of racing, his enthusiasm and the harizma years attracts fans of this sport.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie that he would have fought 6,000 victories if he didn't participate only in the weekend and big races.
But when it comes to speaking seriously, it is a real pleasure that Frankie has been winning the UK race regularly for 30 years.
He is a joyful man who works well in British races, and he is an outstanding joke.
Frank Detor noted this achievement with his brand - a flying jump.
From finishing wind speed to flying jump, Frankie Detori has been a face of British horse racing for twenty years.
This has been a complete journey of adventure.
He has won numerous big races, including the Great Sevener of 1996 in Ascto, and he has also experienced an accident and disqualification of the use of preparations.
Three years ago, he had difficulty returning after six months of disqualification, but he demonstrated his character by challenging those who questioned him in his best form.
And he could take part in the race for another time - Detors said earlier that he would be willing to continue to take part in the race until at least 50 years of age.
President Putin releases the Head of Administration Sergey Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly released Sergey Ivanov, Head of Administration.
Ivanov has been in Putin’s circle for many years.
Currently, 63-year-old politician has been appointed as the special representative of nature and transport.
The crisis statement states that Putin "has decided to release Ivanov from the duties of Head of the Russian President's Administration" without mentioning the reason.
Mr Antons Vaino was appointed as Deputy of Ivanova since 2012.
The 44 - year - old Wano has been a diplomat.
Vaino was born in 1972 in Tallinn, Estonia, and graduated from Moscow National Institute of International Relations (MVSAI) and later worked in Tokyo Embassy.
He later managed the President's report and government staff administration, as reported on the Kremel's website (Russian).
After his appointment, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
In my opinion, the main work of the administration is to support your work in the office of President of the Republic by drafting laws and controlling the implementation of your decisions.
Putin told a Russian broadcasting company on Friday that Ivan himself wanted to leave office and recommended that Vaino be his alternate.
Does the smile convince?
This step made Moscow more attractive.
Sergey Ivanov is an ancient and close ally of Vladimir Putin and, like Putin, he worked at the Soviet security service VDK.
He was one of the most influential men in Russia.
At a state television session, both men announced that Ivanov resigned on his own initiative.
However, despite the smiles directed at the cameras, which such an explanation convinces, especially before the parliamentary elections.
Is this a result of the fight for power?
Nobody knows that.
However, the official statement that a man, who was considered a possible president, suddenly wanted to become the head of Russian environmental policy, is being seen with a great shave.
In the notes published on the road website, Ivanov says to Putin: "It is a fact that at the beginning of 2012, I ask you to entrust this difficult post to me, perhaps even a problematic post, for four years.
I have worked for four years and eight months.
Ivanov entered the post in December 2011.
Former Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Security Council of Russia and a former official of the State Security Service of the KGB, like Putin.
In the late 1990 ’ s, Putin was led by the Federal Security Service, which is the successor to the KGB, Ivanov took the position of his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov the five most trusted.
At the end of the second term of Putin, Ivanov was considered a potential candidate for the post of the Russian President, as the election of Putin to the third term would be counter-constitutional.
But then the President became another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister and returned to President after three and a half years.
A lovely appearance of fish in a garden in the town of Banf
A man in Banfa asks for help to find out the conditions that a fish of the species appeared in his garden in Banfa.
Kevin Benin thinks that 75 fish might be sand eels that have gone off with a water station.
Mr. Beneen, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, published a fish video on the Periscope website, hoping that someone might know how these 5 centimetres of large fish came into his garden.
A crossing of Queensphere: the bridge is now connected to Faif.
At present, a EUR 1.35 billion project is planned to be completed in May 2017.
The engineers have connected the northern part of the Queensferia cross and the viaduct, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fif.
The first of the four connecting parts has been completed, which means that the bridge construction is nearing its completion.
The faifs bridge is 60 feet [600 m] long and weighs 30 000 tons.
It consists of 10 000 tonnes of steel, 20 000 tonnes of concrete and 46 support cables.
At present, a EUR 1.35 billion project is planned to be completed in May 2017.
The Economic Secretary Katas Browns had come to the building site today and was one of the first to climb into the bridge.
He said, "This is a symbolic and historic moment in the construction of the Queensfery bridge."
In this project we see an unparalleled civil engineering solution, where only this part has been built using more than 30 000 tonnes of cement and steel.
Despite the huge weight and size of the bridge, connecting the bridge and the viaduct is an extremely delicate process that requires enormous precision.
In general, more than 79% of the bridge decks have already been constructed and the last stage that will connect the bridge to Rosite will be covered today, which means that all parts of the bridge are ready for laying.
Michael Martins, Director of the fourth bridge connection project, says: "The first bridge is a very important point in building any bridge."
In this fantastic project, the first connection demonstrates the construction of the highest class of civil engineering.
After the installation of the last stage of the road and its connection with the support of the northern tower, we had to connect the northern section of the road to the part of the land, or the viaduct.
This was done by lifting the part of the viaduct of the northern carriageway over 700 millimetres southward.
It was a huge and, at the same time, very delicate surgery.
It is huge because it is 222 feet [222 m] long, weighing about 6,000 tons, and it had to be drawn down by about 3%.
Delicate, because the tolerance in both directions with which the team worked was just a few millimetres.
Happily, everything worked well.
Simona Bailsa acquires gold in exercise of women.
Forget the tension.
Forget the alarm.
Simon Bails doesn't worry about it.
Dynamic jumps.
No effort can be made to perform exercises on the beam.
Improper on the floor.
It's perfectly perfect.
And finally the Olympic champion.
On Thursday, a 19 - year - old American gymr won a golden medal, fully demonstrating the difference between himself and the rest of the world on the Olympic stage.
Her total score of 62,198 was superior to the head court for the result of the silver medal wins and her teammate Alija Raismānas and bronze medal wins the result of the Russian athletes Alija Mustafin.
On Thursday, the U.S. athletes Simon Bails conducted a training exercise on the individual multi-scene final for women in the 2016 summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Butil became the fourth American in a row, who won the title of a multi-show champion and the fifth best gymnastics, gradually strengthening the reputation as the best of his generation of gymnastics and perhaps the best gymnastics in history.
When the final result was announced, she passed through tears, because the long way to this moment was over.
This achievement ranks him next to unparalleled athletes such as Michael Felips, who raised his sport at another level.
For the last three years, Bailas has dominated his sport by obtaining 15 medals at the World Championships, including 10 gold medals, fulfilling such an excellent, accurate and ambitious combination of exercises that, in 1984, Olympic champion Mary Lu Reton called him "the best gymnastics she's ever seen."
In Brazil, she was faced with the last test, where she had to deal greatly with the expectations of her rather than the other athletes.
She would be disappointed if she returned to her home in Spring, Texas, without gold medals.
The U.S. athletes Simon Bails (left) and Alija Raismāne are surrounded by after playing the gold and silver medal in the individual multi-scene finals for women in the summer 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which took place on Thursday.
The first gold medal in Baal got on Tuesday, making a special random coordinator of Martha Carolji's opening party.
Though Baal claims that in his long journey to the peaks of praise, it is not true.
Some of her performances, which includes her special acrobatic transition, are accompanied by Latin music that would fit perfectly on the street next to the Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
A girl who was adopted by her grandparents when she was still a baby and discovered by coach Amy Bourman’s mother on his tour to the gym where Bourman’s teens took place has now become a force to account.
She has not lost her numerous competitions since the summer of 2013 and the series of winnings can continue as long as Bailas wants it.
Although Mustafin had a little direction during two rotations, it was just an illusion.
The balance circle and free movement - the part of the competition where Bailas will defend his champion - are still in front.
She came forward with a score of 15.433 on the beam and strengthened the control with a result of 15.933 in free movements
She was tenderly humiliated by Raismane while they were waiting for results that were only formal and she poured out the tears of joy when she filled the dream she had ever written in her notebook.
The result of Raisma was a small relentless of four year - old events, when she divided the third place with Mustafin, but lost the battle for the bronze medal.
This time, a 22-year-old team captain, called an American Grandma, came under strong leadership.
After her performance, she was able to devote a crowd of air kisses to free movements that challenged her doubts about her return.
Meanwhile, the 19-year-old Bil’s virtual Twitter entry, which she published this week, has a completely different meaning.
The 6-year-old Mahaeus Brown lives with a gun in Philadelphia.
The police say that the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, pointing out that it is already the second six-year-old shot in Philadelphia this week.
Grandparents of the children of the CBS Philadelphia news channel confirmed that it is Mahay Brown.
Grandparents say that Brown was shot several times, including in the girdle, in the foot, in the hand, and in the abdomen, but still in consciousness when he was taken to the hospital.
His grandmother, Delores Melendez, tells the television: "His little body was just a lot of haunted."
I can't believe that.
The boy is in a critical situation in the hospital and has already suffered several surgery.
The family informs us that he will surely recover.
He had to start his first class at a local primary school.
Brown is one of the four people shot in the city of Jermantuna.
Three men were shot: two 29 - year - old men and one 32 - year - old man.
The channel CBS Philadelphia reports that one of the 29-year-old men is in a critical situation, while the rest of the two victims are in a stable situation.
The canal says that a child was found in a car front seat near the 29 - year - old victim’s critical position.
The other two victims were not in the car, and the police were investigating whether one of them was an attacker.
The explorer told the channel CBS Philadelphia that most likely several shooters were involved in the shooting.
At the scene of the event, a number of gun liners were found.
Looks like it's been a long time fire.
The shells were found on both sides of the pedestrian lane.
"So it looks like there have been several armed shooters here who have been actively involved in the shooting," says Antony Ginaldi, Chief of the Philadelphia Police.
Several homes and cars have also been damaged.
No one has yet been detained and it is reported that the police are checking the records of surveillance cameras.
On the other hand, during the shooting, a humiliated bullet hit a six - year - old girl in her hand while she played in front of her home in the Vestoukleine district.
She's slowly recovering, but the police are still trying to blame.
Why do we need Simon, Gabia and Laura?
I call it Women's Olympics for a number of reasons.
Firstly, I have been on all the Olympics summer since 1984, and the U.S. team has never been so good.
Secondly, the team includes three lightweight girls, Simon Bails, Gabija Douglas and Laurija Hernandez, inspired by many young girls of origin.
People may be proud that this team includes Alija Raismne, who is Jewish and Madison Cocian, who is Catholic.
Finally, this team really represents America.
It has also strengthened the participation of black and Latin American athletes in this sport.
For the last four years, the best gymnastics is an American of African origin.
Last year, Simon and Gabi took 1st and 2nd place.
These are impressive results.
In the previous Olympic Games, Gabia Douglas suddenly became Olympic champions, and America could rejoice.
Now the world has seen incredible exercises performed by the three world champion Simon Bails, Douglas and Laurija Hernandez, carrying out unprecedented but masterful exercises.
On Thursday, Simon became the fourth American in a row, who has gained a golden medal in an individual multilevel woman.
Her teammate, Alija Raismāne, got a silver medal.
We have seen the best that this sport can bring, but the situation in the rest of the country is completely different during exercise.
Simona, Gabia, and Laura entered the Olympics, just like Alija and Madison.
They are "Olimpic Five", because the next Olympic exercise team will have only four athletes, and this is coach Martha Carol's last year of coach's work.
In fact, gymnastics is expensive sport. Winroists are mostly trained in private passenger clubs, and they are maintained by parents who pay for exercise, premises, travel, uniforms, hotels (thresholds, athletes and their families) and other expenses.
Most of these lightweight clubs are located in urban areas that can afford this sport.
In these clubs athletes take away all their exercises, and it is expensive and long investment in light families.
Amy Bourman - Simon Bailey's trainer and Maggie Hainy - Laurie Hernandez's trainer has trained his athletes since both girls started to engage in lightweightity.
We must provide young girls inspired by Simona, Gabia and Laura, with cheaper training opportunities.
I set up my own SME organisation 20 years ago.
My organization finds itself in Harlem, and we offer more than 15 000 young people in the city (mainly black and Spanish origin) exercise exercises free of charge or at a low price.
In September we will discover a branch in Detroit (my home town) to provide local young people with an opportunity to learn about this great sport.
Lightliness develops strength, flexibility, and body coordination, as well as teach hard work, discipline, and pursuit of goals.
This combination ensures a long life with good health and success in both school and work.
This team will inspire thousands of young girls to train in the field and it's fantastic.
Working with this sport is very important, especially for young girls.
This is a very exciting time.
Thank you Simona, Alija, Gabija and Madison for their excellent demonstration of the "Youth Force" by acquiring the golden medals of the Olympic Games and motivationing countless young, diverse-source girls to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Following the rejection of Jeremy Hunt’s offer, young doctors plan to expand their strikes.
Ministers hoped to end the disagreement by reaching agreement on the changes to the agreement with the British Medical Association, but this was rejected by 58 percent of the 37 000 new doctors who took part in the vote.
In July, Hunt announced its intention to enter into a contract indicating that NHS was in a precarious situation and that further delay would only be detrimental to staff and patients.
The first new doctors have already signed a new agreement that changes working conditions during night shifts and weekends to improve working conditions during non-standard hours of work.
Last night, Dr Elena Macourt, a representative of BMA’s new doctors, announced that young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it would exacerbate the labour crisis and not impose equal conditions on all doctors.
Eight weeks before the first new doctor group will sign the new agreement, progress must be made because there is no time left.
BMA's efforts to solve the problem through negotiation have been faced with the government's unwillingness to engage and, at times, with total silence.
This happened despite the fact that last month Jeremy Hunt said that his doors were always open.
Jeremy Hunt must act immediately, stop inactivity and cooperate with young doctors.
If he does not do so, the new doctors are ready for new shares in the protest.
During the last strike, over 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits were carried out at the end of April, while nurses and consultants tried to replace doctors who had gone in picket.
Ministers hoped to end their disagreement by reaching agreement on changes to the agreement with the British Medical Association.
BMA wants to raise the rate for work on weekends by 54 000 new doctors who would be covered by the new contracts.
The NHS Executive Director, Daniel Mortimer, called on young doctors to avoid strikes.
Mr Mortimer explains that strikes do not solve anything, but only increases pressure on the overcharged workers and worry, creates stress and obstacles for patients, carers and their families.
Over the past two months, we have talked to the new medical committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and other institutions, have responded positively to their questions about protectors and rapporteurs.
Employers expect active cooperation on other important issues, such as placement of employees, flexible training, in addition to training for those returning after a career break, training costs, mutual recognition of training programmes, drop-out of studies and gender pay inequalities in medicine - it shows that employers, England health education institutions and the Ministry of Health seriously want to implement the agreements concluded with BME in November, February and May.
The medicine can reduce the risk of heart attack by 2 pounds a day.
Thousands of heart attack patients could be treated with 2 pounds a day because official representatives recommend that they be used more in humans and for a longer period of time.
Ticagrelor reduces the risk of recurrent heart disease in people with heart disease.
This medicine is already prescribed for use 12 months after the heart attack, reducing the risk of recurrent heart attack.
It is recommended that NHS represented NICE be used for 4 years after the heart attack in order to further reduce the risk of heart attack in people with cardiovascular problems.
However, the NICE currently in the hands of the NHS recommends that this product be used 4 years after the heart attack in order to further reduce the cardiovascular risk.
Every year, about 140 000 people in England are experiencing a heart attack, and a quarter of them are experiencing repeated heart attack or strokes.
Heart attack and stroke are caused by the accumulation of fat in the walls of the heart, forming obstructions.
If the obstruction ruptures, it can cause a clot, blocking the flow of blood to the heart and causing a heart attack.
In turn, if a clot separates from the blood vessel wall, it can go further into the blood stream and block the blood’s access to the brain, leading to an infarction.
Those who have had a heart attack are at greater risk of recurrent heart attack.
Ticaglor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca, and marketed under the name Brilique, reduces the risk of developing blood clots.
The new NICE guideline published today recommends the use of 90 mg Ticagrelor for 12 months in humans and 60 mg twice daily in combination with aspirin for another 3 years.
Professor Carola Longson, Health Technology Director of NICE, explains: "Despite the availability of drugs to prevent repeated heart attack, more than a quarter of people who have had heart attack experience another heart attack or stroke, which often have severe consequences."
Fears from a repeated heart attack can have a negative impact on the quality of life.
Evidence suggests that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin effectively reduces the risk of recurrent heart attack and heart attack for those who have experienced it once.
By recommending treatment with Ticaglor provisionally, we are pleased that we can extend the treatment opportunities to thousands of people who benefit from it.
In view of limited information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor, in particular the risk of bleeding with this medicinal product for more than three years, the draft guidelines do not recommend its use beyond this deadline.
Politkorectuma promotes fraud during elections in Muslim communities
According to the management report, former Mayor of Tauerhamlet City Lutfur Rahman was dismissed from office in the context of corruption.
The government report reveals that the culture of political integrity makes eyes open to large-scale fraud in Muslim communities.
Former Minister of Government Sir Eriks Pikle criticises the police, electoral supervisors and city councils that they ignore the signs of fraud in the election process, because "the ethnic and religious interests are afraid to be undermined."
The former community secretary, who has now become the head of the anti-corruption organisation, says that the intimidation of voters for religious reasons is so common that the police should be allowed to place guards at the electoral stations to protect intimidated voters.
He also recommends that voters should produce an identity document when they vote to prove their true identity.
Only the name and address of the voters should be given at the moment.
He even recommended that the fingers of the voters who voted be marked with a special ink to prevent double voting.
The rapporteurs should also ensure greater protection, says Sir Eriks.
He felt that the press should ensure greater access to Council documents and decisions taken by informal committees and working groups.
He says: "The girl is not only to prevent fraud in elections, but also to protect local government from a wider culture of corruption and fraud, which goes hand in hand with it."
The report was commissioned by Dauning Street following the scandal in the Tauerhamlet City elections.
Last year, the special election court decided to cancel the mayor of the city Lutfur Rahman from the city mayor due to corrupt and illegal activities.
The Court found that Rahman "concluded" the religious view of his Muslim community and silenced his critics by indicting them in racism and Islamophobia.
"Rahman led his election campaign with a decree that the religious responsibility of the faithful Muslims was to vote in favour of him."
About 300 votes were false or dubious because one person had voted several times.
Sir Erik also points out that there are signs of fraud throughout the country.
He pointed out that it was particularly worrying to have post-election fraud, where senior members of Muslim communities forced others to vote for the candidates they wanted.
Sir Eriks suggested a series of measures to improve the electoral system, including the presentation of an identity document, in order to clarify the identity of the person.
His report says: "The evidence shows that vulnerable members of ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, are forced to vote for the oldest candidates selected by the community, particularly in the Bangladesh and Pakistani communities."
"It is a concern that district institutions do not address these problems because of political corrigendum, because they could undermine ethnic and religious interests."
Sir Eriks made 50 recommendations on how to improve the electoral system, which also prohibits political activists from working with votes cast by post to prevent "the collection of votes".
The report under consideration by Teresa Meja also calls for a closer check of registration to prevent electoral lists from being used for fraud in the area of immigration and benefits.
Consider requesting voters to produce an identity document before voting.
Mark the voters' fingers with special ink to avoid double voting.
A systematic check of the fitness of persons to ensure that the person has the right to vote.
Set a three-year limit for requests for automatic postal voting.
To ban political campaign members and activists from working with votes cast by post and election envelope for voting by post.
Ensure that the police have the power to appoint a guard at the electoral station.
Make changes to the law to facilitate the prosecution of persons for intimidation in accordance with the 1983 Act of Human Rights.
Do not take pictures in polling stations.
Make requirement to use English only (except in Wales) in electoral districts.
Strengthen the training to ensure that voters go to the election caves on their own.
Sir Erik is a humiliary critic of the Metropolis police, expressing the misunderstanding that no accusations have been made in the Taurerhamlet case.
He says: "The court only disqualified Luftur Rahman and his representative for actions related to corruption and fraud."
He was convincingly found guilty of proof of criminal law on the basis of irrefutable evidence.
He also criticises inefficient city council voters' 'cocks Check' voters' registration stations.
Sir Eric says: "The court decision last year is a call for alarm.
Our land is known as Parliament's homeland, but the alarming and concealed proliferation of electoral fraud and the fate of the institutions that fraud does not threaten this good reputation.
Irritation with the explorer - Kate's fellow and other fellows of Rio Olympic celebrities
In 2016, the fans of Rio Olympic Games were thrilled by Pauline Ferrand Prevot, a Frenchcycler, recognized by the fans as extremely similar to the Duke of Cambridge.
However, a 24 - year - old bicycler is not the only sportsman who fights this summer for gold, who, as the media says, is proud of the peer of his celebrities.
Therefore, in honour of Rio Olympics and all the famous faces present on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympic players, which is quite similar to Hollywood stars.

The commenter of the CBC Olympic Games apologizes for his comment that the Chinese swimmer is 'determine as a pig'.
Bairona McDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhas finals in fourth place 4x200 m in free-style desktop for women, called a conspicuous storm in CBC viewers.
The Canadian canal CBC was forced to apologize because one of its commentators commented that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer had "falled out of the competition that he died alone" and "completed as a pig".
The commenter Bairon McDonald thought that his microphone had been turned off when 4x200 m free-style desktops for women at the end of the final presentation of their personal views.
McDonald, who was included in CBC's commentary team to give comments on the vitality of life, said: "It's a small 14-year-old who is unable to keep up with China."
She went out of the race, she died just and ended up like a pig.
Thank you very much.
The result of the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan in the second stage was 1:57.79, it is 1.61 seconds slower than the result of the Canadian Teilore Ruck, allowing Canadians to reach China.
The viewers reacted promptly to the Internet throughout Canada because they were shocked to hear such a tone and expression.
Emmet McMarfarlain wrote on Twitter: "Did the CBC commentator just say that in 14 year-old swimmer from China " ended up as a pig"?"?
The idiot did not realize that they were still in direct ethers.
Ai Yanha from China 4x200m free-style final women were named "a small 14-year-old from China who does not hold with him."
The criticism against Bairon McDonald quickly came into force, as many requested clarification.
Twitter users were unable to believe by listening to the insensitive comments made by Bairona McDonald.
Twitter user Sara Paradise wrote: "Oh, #ByronMacDonald.
You're representing CBC and Canada and you're all listening to us as races.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who was at that time directing the CBC live, apologised for McDonald's comments, saying, "We apologised that the comment on the result of swimming was made on the direct ether."
It was a unfortunate choice of words, and we are deeply sorry that it happened.
CBC apologised more than 90 people who responded to this comment on Twitter.
Mr. McDonald's colleague Scott Russell had to apologize in his place.
Then CBC copied an apology for more than 90 Twitter users who complained about McDonald's comment.
The channel also quickly published an apology and a statement.
We regret very much that such comments were made and came to direct ethers.
Yesterday we reacted and apologized immediately to all viewers and followers on the social media.
For the sake of clarity, the comments made by Bairon were not addressed personally to the swimmer.
But they were in any case unprofessional and unsuccessfully chosen statements and Bairon was very sorry for what happened.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald personally apologized to the immediate ether and tried to explain that he did not think that his comment would be perceived as a personal attack.
In the live game of CBC Olympics, he said: "I would like to use a moment and apologize for the comment that I made yesterday after women's freestyle competitions."
I'm talking about the swimmer's performance, not about him personally.
It seems like I didn't mean to show disrespect, and I'm really sorry that this happened.
Note the buyers are shocked by a woman who unhappilys in the middle of the underwear store.
Buyers felt uncomfortable when a woman began to get dressed to hold panties in the middle of the store.
As the situation deteriorated, she applied them to make sure that they were standing and then pulled off, placing the pan back in the store's shelf.
She continued looking for clothes at Folkestona Bouverie Place shopping center store and held four more panties.
Primark shop Bouverie Place in the shopping centre of Folkeston – a place where she held her underwear and then put it back to her shelf.
At that time there were two children’s mother, Jenny Davidson, who says that after the underwear was put on her clothes and left the store without buying anything.
She says that people could not believe in their own eyes.
As she stood in the middle of the store, she took her shelf underwear, took her socks and trousers off and measured them there.
She did not even try to find a more discreet place to measure them, but she simply kept them there.
Everyone looked at her wearing panties and obviously didn't like them, because she just put them back on her shelf.
She measured three more panties until she decided she didn't like any of them and left her store.
She did not seem to be concerned that someone was watching or thinking about a person who would buy the clothes she had retained.
Miss Davidsons (33 years) from Kent says, "The idea is that someone will buy clothes that have been retained by another person and have not been washed out afterwards."
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidsons adds: "I assume that after she left the store, the employees took the clothes out of the shelves of the store - which is also acceptable."
I can't imagine that I could buy a new underwear and find out that another woman has used it and hasn't washed it.
Mr Primark indicated that Mr Primark was aware of an incident that took place on Tuesday, 9 August.
The specific clothes have been removed from the shelves of the store.
How to protect yourself from firearms using Krav Maga
The world is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer.
To find out how to protect ourselves in a distance from attackers with a firearm, Krav Maga’s great master from New York City Ron Mizraki spoke.
Whether you are attacking the front or back, this video shows how to protect yourself and gain the upper hand over the attacker.
When an attacker is attacked from the back, it is necessary to turn around first to see the attacker clearly and to avoid a shot path.
Then the gun should be covered between his front hand and his shoulder and make a blow in the face of the opponent with his free elbow.
Then there's a blow with a knee around the groan and while the attacker is stuck in his pain, take his gun, put his face on the hand of the gun and step up, continuing to put the gun against him.
If the attacker is approaching the front, the situation is similar - one's path must be avoided, weaponted and assembled so that the evil man cannot fire.
At the same time, pressure must be put on the gun and blow the opponent down his chest and finally take the gun away and step up to it.
Sounds complicated?
Watch the video to see how Mizraki does it.
But remember, if you're not a Krav Maga master, it's safer to give your money back to the robber.
The Vandal family demolishes the social home of Saltach Cornwall and is laid on the street.
The Vandals’ family has been laid out of residence for terrorization of neighbors, causing damage to a social house of 50 000 pounds.
Tania Skeldon and her partner Shon Trebilko were only stolen from the property of Saltash Cornwall because several complaints were made against them.
When they were forced out of the property, shocked householders found that the property had been fully demolished.
The floor and walls had holes, waste and walls were covered everywhere with graphite.
The family has now been laid out of the property and is likely to live in a private property.
The manager of the housing service in Cornwall Donna Maveja says that there are concerns that housing will not be able to be restored.
She says that people living here were extremely difficult, and she believes that they cannot live.
In this case, a number of factors must be considered, since there will be no good reputation for this property in Cornwall.
This family is famous and their name is well known.
The couple had three sons who were periodically living in property, and the police say that their terror was a form of violence, street bloated with baseball bats, intimidation of locals, drug use, drug selling, and loud bloating and grooming.
In June, 47 - year - old Skeldon was sentenced to punishment for antisocial behaviour.
In several demolished houses, waste was found.
There are also several floor boards in the home where drugs can be traded.
The neighbors say that they were on a regular journey to the street and are constantly called police.
The Cornwall Housing Service put them out of their property forced when they were given 11 weeks to leave the house voluntarily.
The desperate neighbors were very happy for fate because their lives were absolute hell.
One said, "They didn't care about other people."
We lived for them next 20 years, it has always been crazy.
I can't believe how often we saw the police here.
We couldn't lie down this morning.
We woke up because it was so quiet here - we were not used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, here's going to be wonderful.
Adam Fitzpatrik, who is the Head of the Neighbourhood Protection Service of Cornwall, said that the family did not cooperate with the local security authorities.
The family has lived here for 20 years and has been regularly called the police.
A variety of old and unusable objects were found in the house-growing garden.
He also said, "It is very regrettable that the tenants did not show any responsibility for their conduct, because leaving the house is always the last step considered by Cornwall's Housing Service."
This was a very difficult case, since their conduct was extreme and their neighbors were very keen to see in their conduct.
I appreciate the work my team has invested in this case, the police in Devon and Cornwall, and the members of the communal, who were brave and cooperated with us, providing the necessary information.
I hope that this event will make life easier for our neighbours and show that antisocial behaviour is not acceptable.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived here in different periods of time, but they were all about 20 years old.
Clean mattress left on the floor of one of the rooms after application.
Staff will now have to clean the waste pile left in the house.
In 2014, the police house carried out search and found more than 70 grams of marijuanas, weights, accessories and 1700 pounds in cash.
Skeldone is only recognised as being guilty of class B drugs in order to distribute them.
She insisted that the money was intended for her son Lee Sheldon, who died in an accident in 2013.
After the disappearance, they know that they are now renting some private property in Plimut.
There were graffiti on many walls of the house.
The police say they will continue to set up tenants who violate their rental agreements.
The Dévelopon and Cornwall police representative, Angela Krov, points out that this promulgation is a clear warning to other tenants who continue to violate the rules.
She also said, "This is a warning for those who believe that they can behave as they want and that they will have no consequences."
The police in Devon and Kronvola do not accept criminal and anti-social behaviour, and the police will continue to work with our partners to protect local communities.
Ready to spend can give impetus to the economy.

Cannes may have banned burkin's swimsuits on beaches.
The mayor of Cannes in the southern resort of France has prohibited the wearing of burkin's swimming costumes on the beaches of this city, which almost completely cover the female body and very resembles the hydrotherap, announced on Thursday by local officials.
The Mayor of Cannes, David Linar, has stated that "access to beaches and swimming is prohibited for anyone who has no swimming suit that respects good practices and secularism" as a fundamental principle of the French Republic.
"The "Pludmal suit, which is an external expression of religious belongings at the time when France and cults are the target of terrorist attacks, can pose a risk of public order disturbances (false, clashes, etc.) that need to be prevented," says the Order.
"We are not talking about a ban on wearing religious symbols on the beach, but about the external clothing associated with confidence in terrorist movements, which war with us," explained the municipal communal service manager Tjeri Miguel.
He added that the burkini swimsuits on Cannes beaches have not been seen since July 28, when the right-wing member of the Central Party "Republicans" Linar signed this order and came into force.
This week, the Aquapark in Marseille abolished a planned private event for Muslim women who would have been dressed in swimsticks, as the politicians of both the right and the left expressed their embarrassment for this event.

On 14 July, 85 people were killed in a terror in Nice, a town close to Cannes, under the responsibility of the Islamic State.
On July 26, two attackers who had sworn their trust in the Islamic State were brutally murdered by a priest in the church in north-west France.

Thursday, August 11, at Lucavsala, one of the last festivals of this summer was given - there will be "Cubana" till Sunday night.
On the first night of the meeting, groups such as Enter Shikari from Great Britain, who were expected last year, but had not seen disappeared from the program, American panki "NOFX", DJ Maxim from the group "The Prodigy" and others.
In the next days of the festival, the programme also features important words - "Guano Apes" and "Garbage", the drummer of the pancock legend "Ramones" with "Marky Ramone's Blitzkrieg", "Brutto & Lyapis" with the leader of the Belarusian pankroka Sergey Mihaloks, popular Greek actor and singer Vahtangs Kikabidze, Ukrainians "Vopli Vidoplyasova" and many others, but the full program of the event can be viewed here.
This is the second year in which Kubana festival takes place in Latvia.

President, who remained in the shade: Gustav Zemgal - 145.
On Friday, August 12, 145 years old, the second President of Latvia Gustavs Zemgals, was born.
Zemgall promulgated the State of Latvia, but it is not worthy of the widely described shadow of the first President of Latvia Jānis Čakste and the last president of pre-war period Karl Ulmanis.
None of our country's citizens have been so much advocate of democracy and the rule of law as Zemgale, ten years ago, the book dedicated to Gustavs Zemgale writes Arnolds Auziņš.
In conversation with the Delfi portal, Auziņš emphasizes that Zemgale is one of the rare politicians in high positions who have had a sense of humor.
The rest of this kind, always very right.
He taught this not to be so, today it might be similar to Raimonds Vējonis.
"He was close to the nation," says Auziņš.
Modern politicians are poorly aware of history, they referred to Kārlis Ulmanis as good leaders, but rarely who knows how poor he was.
He was General Balodis at the government sittings.
Even if he was kind and smiling in pictures, by nature he was hysteric.
"The Earth, with its sense of humor and its democraticness, left exactly the opposite impression," Auziņš said.
Aivars Strangs, professor of the Faculty of History and Philosophy of the University of Latvia in conversation with Delfi, agrees with the report about Zemgale as a calm and balanced state.
He also noted that Zemgale had expressed respect for minorities, who regularly invited Jewish representatives to the President’s castle.
"At the time, it was not a common practice, after the Zemgale Presidency, Albert Kviesis took over this tradition," says historian.
He was such a quiet and balanced person who had long been told to become president.
He didn't want to do that. He just didn't feel the glory.
He also took a rather critical view of himself because he did not know French, but thought that the President should certainly understand it.
"During the Presidency, the basics of French were learned," explains Stranga.
Zemgale did not allow reinstatement, but he did not like so - called positions.
In any case, he is a very respected person in the history of Latvia, and before he came to the castle of President, he was in serious position - he was a well-called notary.
Zemgale also led the famous Zemgala kasi Suvorova Street 3, where the society of storageists and publishers was located.
He was always progressive.
There was no great respecter of Ulmanis, but he was not in public.
"In private negotiations, it has sometimes been said that Ulmanis's actions do not make him feel confused," says Strang.
Lived in a peaceful life, there is no suspicion of irregularities or corruption.
How does Zemgale remember today?
Sadly, for a large part he is only associated with a street in Riga.
He was an absolute democrat, and his views were central.
"At the time, there were no major shocks, that is, he could associate with such a truly stable Presidency," said Strang.
During the Presidency of Gustava Zemgala, from 1927 to 1930, Latvia's state visit to Sweden was also held, which, at that time, indirectly meant full recognition of Latvia in the neighbouring country and inclusion in the Nordic democratic nations' family.
On May 28, 1929, Zemgale arrived at Stockholm.
The response visit of King Gustav V of Sweden to Latvia took place on June 29, 1929.
The second President of Latvia was born in 1871, and he spent time in January 1939.
Just ways to help your child cope with anger attacks.
I often feel that when my child is angry, my parents feel that it is wrong and inconceivable.
When a child openly shows his anger - we don't know how to react, Ecoet says psychologist Jekaterina Kesa.
The specialist urges us to have a little conversation about these natural and human feelings - anger and anger that each of us experience periodically.
Aggression - it is already a physical activity directed against another person, and it usually appears when you feel angry.
When we adults are angry, excited - we usually know what happens to us and how to deal with it.
We can express our anger and anger: express, suppress, hide, keep it in ourselves, tell our friends or other loved ones about it, we can play a sofa in anger, smoke a cigarette (that is not the best way to denigrate anger!), go to a shower, hit a doll on the table and do other things we do not usually do.
We do not turn our aggression towards others because we know various other ways of dealing with these emotions.
Children, when they are angry, do not understand what happens to them, how to name them and how to live with them.
They can say, "Go away!", you're a fool, "The Bad Mom", "I don't see you", "I won't dare to dare you" - and very rarely, when you can say, "I'm angry at you".
Children live literally, they are completely here, at this point, they are spontaneous and truly in showing their feelings, and are often also in prison for various emotions.
It is very important that parents do not prevent their child from showing feelings, including anger, being ashamed of it and not looking at it, but on the contrary, help the child.
Do you need a pause in the relationship?
A long day of work, in which everything has not really been done as you would like, or simply a bad mood, is so many reasons why you would like to "disengage" from all over the world for a moment, a day or even longer.
Is it possible for a moment to invade the relationship and breathe a little?
Or does this show, however, that each of the partners is on its way?
Ladies and gentlemen, in different ages, share their ideas.
John (23) is brief and concise: "In my view, if relations require identification, you are not with the real person."
Meanwhile, Eduard (30) has discovered a scheme that may help someone.
If you feel that your partner starts to fall into your nerves for every little detail, then definitely it's the time you should study other hunting fields to see if you miss her, or you don't think about her, or even want to see her at all.
So the answer is - yes, holding the pause can help save time and understand how important you are in the other half.
Kaspars (29) reveals his theory.
In my opinion, it is necessary to keep one's daily routine in relations, because if you spend time with a person 24 hours a day, seven days a week, then the disputes are inevitable.
This is because you notice every detail you do, and it starts to fall on your nerves.
People start to offend each other, especially if there is nothing to talk about, just about what you have done day by day.
My personal experience suggests this, so I have never had a relationship for more than a few months.
If you think for a moment that is better elsewhere or with someone else - then why is this woman with whom you are with deserve someone who can think that it is not good enough and there are paradise fields behind the mountains?
Thinking is already a little betrayal.
If not, then no.
"I have, so a little condemns those who don't." says Edmunds (46).
Karl (33) has a completely different view.
I think everyone needs a moment's rest.
You can't every moment, all the time, in the morning until the evening, look each other in the eyes and rejoice in the love of the unfavorable.
Get out of here!
There's so many things - friends, work, party.
It's time for everyone.
Of course, a friend or wife can live up to the edge of the grave if both are able to balance family life and the rest of the world.
That's it and that's it.
B. Mārtiņš (27) says this: "I don't need to say it, or I don't need it, or I can't take it for the rest, but one thing is clear - there's nothing in its proposed relationship to the end, something is missing."
If this question is raised, then it must be borne in mind that there will be some change in the near future - on the right or on the wrong side, it will depend on it itself.
I think while you are still new and crazy, the pause is needed - even all the time, but when everything remains serious and the relationship is completely different, there can be no rest.
You decide to spend all your life together!
"If you can't hold each other's society now and once again need a rest, then what happens when you're going to be pensioners who comment on how passing cats say or argue about where on the day the garden should be better maintained", says Kristaps (19).
All the names of the lords have been changed.
With its thrilling and thrilling personality, Rozentāls was the first to awaken the interest of the Latvian nation in depicting art.
"In this sense, he was the first love of the Latvian people, which as such will remain unforgettable for life", she wrote Roman Suta as the oldest master of Latvian painting.
Also, in 2016, when opening the old artist's extensive retrospective exhibition in the main building of the restored Latvian National Museum of Art, it is clear - Rozentāls is the first love of Latvian art.
The exhibition was opened on 12 August, but already from 13 August it is available to visitors and will be available until 30 October.

The U.S. models of business behind his interpretation gained a glitch of sophisticated photography and the inevitability of a horror film.
Basically, very provocative, to a balanced work of fiction and banal vulgarity, in which it is difficult to draw marginal lines between the territory of the European art house film and Hollywood genre product.
The film with Vigo Mortensen in its main role highlights the question of whether parents' conceptually chosen life models (ecologicalism, vegetation, alternativeism and isolation from the grace and values of the consumer society) bring blessing or destructiveness to their children.
The father of six children is the idealist after the death of his wife with questions about the accuracy and true values of the souls.
A moving, lively film by Matthew Ross this year received the Cannes Festival Award for the grid.
Of course, sharks do this just as attacking the beautiful girls - it was a swimmer in the jaws, in this case a brave surfer, which is represented by Blake Laivly.
She asked for her great heroism.
This solonum of survival can be compared to the demonstration of James Frank's activism in the film 127 hours and Ryan Reynolds' game in the film Apraks live.
Perhaps there is also a major role in the guilt of the artist Mila Kunis, whose transformations from the illustration of the embarrassment of the creative community and the embarrassment of the family values of the Teieus seem only to be created by the fantasies of the quite desperate Hollywood scene.
The Islamic State in Syria is in the hands of a population of 2 000 civilians.
Some 2,000 civilians who are used as a living shield have been reported by the U.S.-based alliance of Kurds and Arabs and observers on Friday, as a group of terrorists, fleeing from Menbiza, Aleppo Province.
"We didn't hit them, because they took civilians with us when they fled to Jerabuls," said the pressman of Kurdu Menbike's Military Council.
After two months of battle, the Syrian Democratic Forces (QSD) led by the Kurd-Arab Alliance in the north of Syria, announced on Friday that Menbiza was released from the Jihadist.
The Islamic State of Menbikiu was recruited in 2014.
QSD has already launched most of the Islamic State fighters last week from Menbiza, but some have held back and showed strong resistance.
However, on Friday they left the city, taking themselves with them prisoners.
Islamists go to Gerabuls, near Turkey's border.
Syrian activists' organisation, based in London, has also reported that the Islamic State has robbed about 2,000 people.
SOHR reported that Islamists hid urban cars, forced people to defeat them, and then took them to Jerabuls.
Islamic state fighters have also committed mass abductions in the past.
In January, Islamists extorted over 400 civilians, including women and children, in the province of Deir ez Zora in the east of Syria.
Later, the Islamists released about 270 of the prisoners.
As many Islamic State fighters have fled from Menbiza, it is unknown.
A press representative of Kurdu Menbiza Military Council reported that QSD has managed to save 2,500 people held captive by Islamists in Menbiza.

Kolegova refuses to stand as Chief of Candidate for the SRS.
Inga Koļegova, head of the State Environmental Service, decided to withdraw his nomination for the post of Director-General of the State Revenue Service (SID), LETA informed the Agency at the Ministry of Finance.
Kolegova notes that the discussion of her candidacy has increased among the opposing coalition parties.
It seems that the real reasons for the discussions are linked to the visible, but more often, the invisible interests of politicians and have nothing to do with the assessment of my professional capacity.
"It's unacceptable for me," he stresses, he has already been the applicant for the head of the SRS.
If her candidacy were confirmed in the government, it is clear that this would not be a convincing vote and would prevent her from working properly and implementing the necessary changes in the END, with the support of the entire government.
Without this, Koļegova concludes that it would not be possible to work well.
"I have, more recently, made public the fact that I do not want to be politically dependent, but now my whole process of candidate is too politicised," explains the official.
"Thank you for the trust and support shown to me, it is the experience that I appreciate as a benefit" wrote to Reizniece-Ozola in Koļegova.
On Wednesday, the Unit stated that during the meeting with Koļegova "significant contradictions" between the explanations of the candidate and the information available in the public registers regarding the dividends costs of SIA Pallogs, as the publicly available decisions of the Pallogs Participants' Meetings foresee not to distribute profits.
Dace Pelėka, Deputy Director General, currently performs the duties of Head of the SRS.

The Freeport of Riga has introduced all the recommendations of the SC regarding the project of the Russian island.
The Freeport Authority of Riga has implemented all of the five recommendations of the State Audit Office (RT) regarding the development of the project Infrastructure on the Russian island for the transfer of port activities from the city centre, the portal Diena.lv has been informed in the company.
The approval of the project is planned at the upcoming Riga Freeport Board meeting.
In order for the recommendations to be implemented in accordance with the opinion of the SC, when preparing the necessary documentation for the implementation of the recommendations, the Freeport Authority of Riga also guided the conclusions of the legal and operational audit carried out by the international auditor Deloitte in the Freeport Authority of Riga and the recommendations made to improve project management during the next phase of the project.
Information on the implementation of the recommendations has also been sent to the SC today.
Despite the fact that the Freeport Authority of Riga disagrees with the opinion prepared by the SC on the usefulness of the implementation of the Russian island project, we are very responsible for the implementation of the project and the financing provider - the European Commission (EC).
I would like to emphasise that all the planned construction works within the framework of the project have been fully completed within the time limits and in the planned amount.
"In order to demonstrate to all actors involved in the implementation of the project, including the EC, the GCC and also the valvidors that the main objective of the free port is to successfully implement the project, we have fully implemented all the recommendations of the GC on project management and monitoring issues", says Sanita Kaire, Project Manager of the Russian Islands.
The long-term action plan for the control and monitoring of the achievement of the project objective was complemented by the main planned activities of the parties involved and the time limits for the necessary decisions, the definitions and time limits of meetings and regular reports, the monitoring instruments of the planned construction process, and the definitions of key border points.
The approved action plan to achieve the project objective by 31 December 2018, in line with the recommendations of the SC, has been supplemented by performance monitoring activities, thus reinforcing control of the activities of the other parties involved in the implementation of the project by the Freeport of Riga.
The project management plan, defining the areas of project management and specifying the documents developed to ensure the control and monitoring mechanism for each of them, has been re-designed to improve project management and mitigate potential risks.
The project management structure scheme, which reflects the planned structure of the project management team, staff qualification and functions, has been developed to increase the capacity of the project.
In order to improve communication between the Freeport Authority of Riga and the stakeholders involved in the project, a project communication plan has been developed which, in addition to the parties defined in the project action plan, defines the project’s successful completion of the project, the principles, forms and periodicity of the exchange of information.
In order to improve the control of the use of financial resources, it will be necessary in future to justify in more detail the need for the conclusion or procurement of a service contract and the rule of law.
Within the framework of the project, the port infrastructure conforming to world standards has been built in the Russian island - four new deep-water ports, railway ports, as well as engineering communications.
The structures co-financed by the Cohesion Fund have been completed and put into service at the end of the year, leading to savings of EUR 10.6 million for the envisaged funding.
Security at airports has been reinforced by threats in Slovakia.
Following the receipt of a non-specific threat, Slovakia has strengthened security measures at several airports on Friday, announced the Ministry of the Interior.
"In view of the threat, we have strengthened security measures at international airports in Bratislava, Poprad and Košice," the press representative of the Slovak Ministry of the Interior told the news agency AFP on Friday.
"The National Security and Analysis Centre is currently analysing the information we have received," he added.
In the Slovak capital, an informal European Union (EU) summit will take place on 16 September, with the participation of all the countries in the block, except Great Britain.
The meeting will discuss the consequences of the Brix referendum in Great Britain and discuss the future of the EU without Great Britain.
Slovakia has the EU Presidency until January.
German researchers are discussing the number of victims of the Berlin Wall.
According to a new study, the number of deaths at the communist border in the former East Germany border could be much higher than seen before, but doubts about the real number of victims are still undisputed.
According to data from the Berlin Wall Museum Checkpoint Charlie, between 1945 and 1989, the Communist authorities murdered 1841 people who tried to escape from their controlled territory.
The border-related deaths have been investigated by the museum for years and the number of victims has been adjusted on a regular basis.
This year, 11 deaths have been added to the list, including among the victims, a six-year-old boy who drowned trying to get to western Germany through the then Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
Among the new victims of the Berlin Wall are the Soviet dezertaires.
"The final amount of harm caused by the double evil of communism and socialism is not yet fully documented," says Alexander Hildebrante, director of the museum.
"Our task is to ensure that the graves of those who died in an attempt to escape the country controlled by Communists are maintained and not lost," stressed in Hildebrante's widespread statement.
Other researchers, however, have already questioned the new figures.
The interview with the Süddeutsche Zeitung states that the history of East Germany, the Berlin Free University, is inconceivable.
He, along with other researchers at the Berlin Free University, is currently reviewing possible suspicious deaths at the border, and up to now they have only been able to confirm 260 cases.
In the past, researchers estimated that only 138 people were murdered by Communists near the Berlin Wall.
In view of those people who died in an attempt to escape the Baltic Sea or in the West through the territory of neighbouring countries, in the view of the State, the number of victims could reach around a thousand.
However, this is still far less than 1841.
One of the reasons for the number of different victims could be different methodologies.
The Checkpoint Charlie Museum also lists all cases of suicide of East German border guards, regardless of whether they were directly related to their service.
The museum also lists non-violent deaths.
"If the senitors between 70 and 80 years of age died of heart attack after the contraction with border control", this should be the consequence of this "slaughtful border", Hildebrante believes.
But Satan is convinced that a distinction should be made between the old people, who may have died as a result of their experience, and those whose death was caused by prolonged waiting during the bus at the border.
Irrespective of this, it is not easy to record victims, because the Communist East German authorities did not collect such statistics, and researchers have to draw up documents in various scattered archives, says the State.
However, the Satania Group has recently come up with new documents and could, in the near future, come up with an estimate of the number of new victims.
The President of the LPF, Mr. Rio, has gone with a coach's accreditation; it is itself a surprise.
In recent days, the President of the Latvian Research Federation (LPF), who has been proudly praised, has arrived at the Olympic Games of Rio de Janeiro with the accreditation of the coach, but feels surprised about it.
On Wednesday, the wide-ranging athesis was triggered by the statements made by the Olympic swimmer Alona Ribakava trainer Germanakovsky, who discovered that at the last moment he decided to go to Rio, Sir, while the trainer should remain at home.
The list of drivers initially approved swimmers Alona Ribakova and Uvis Kalniņš, coach Jakubovskis and Dave Kolins, as well as the president of the Federation, Mr.
The Latvian Swimming Federation applied for the Olympic Games, and before departure Aldons Vruļevskis claimed that Germans would have and are looking for tickets.
'However, obviously he wasn't, for objective reasons,' said Mr, saying that it did not affect the result of Ribavirin.
At the request of the Federation, Uvja’s trainer took the initiative to help her.
Mr. Sir, who himself is a member of the LOK Executive Committee, has criticised LOK's activities, to lead the blame on the Olympics' supervisory organisation.
In my view, it is unethical to approve five persons at the LOK Executive Committee and not to bring one of them.
'I don't know why the swimming federation did not have enough space,' Mr President said that the work of the federation and their presidents had not been evaluated in society, reminding that the presidents of the federation were not paid.
He also criticised Jakubovskis himself, saying that before the London Olympics, when Ribavirin was not approved among the participants, he complained to the International Water Sports Federation (FINA) and invited Latvia not to send any sportsman.
Mr. Sir, he could not tell us why he had a coach's accreditation at the Olympic Games, which was probably due to Jakubovskis.
"I was referred to as the president of the Federation, "the righter", but for unknown reasons received a coach's accreditation and now I'm not inside."
The situation changed daily, the number of accreditations available changed.
By the last moment I think German will be, because I did not have any other information.
According to the information available to the LETA agency, a few days before the start of Ribakava, she had a face-to-face conversation with Poni and then the swimmer had had a tear in her eyes, but the President of the LPF himself said that it had been a daily conversation with the athletes before the start.
Mr.Mr. recalled that the LPF oversees five sports, which are in the Olympic programme, and four of them are training children in Latvia as well.
The President of the Federation said that it was also very important for Latvia to discuss the issues of dissipation, and he also talked about such programmes, which were already in Rio in Europe for almost two weeks.
He praised the work of the Federation and said that in 2018 the World Cup could be dealt with in Latvia.
A visit to Rio is not my vacation, I work here, spend my time and try to implement four-year programmes.
There'll be 600 000 drops of pup.
During the program Latvenergo fish resource recovery this week, salmon and tampon juveniles are being introduced in Daugava near Mangalsala, and this year more than 600 000 annual salmon and tampons are planned to be introduced into the fish farms of Bior Tomes and Dole, Institute of Science.
LETA informed the Latvenergo Agency that the feeding of fish will continue in the coming months – 6 300 000 young fish of different species and larvae will be transported in the water bodies of the Daugava basin each year.
In spring of 2016 and early summer of 2016 will be released lingerie and wilking larvae, in June - singa, in July - one-summer salmon, in August and September - zantards and vimbas.
Director of Latvenergo Production Maris Kuņickis said that the concern for the environment is one of the cornerstones of sustainable development of Latvenergo Group.
"In measures for the protection and reproduction of fish resources, each activity is aimed at environmentally friendly actions in close cooperation with the scientific institute Bior, in the production and transportation of both juveniles in the Daugava basin and other activities", Kuņickis pointed out.
This year, more than 600 000 annual salmon and thyme pups will be snuffed.
For the second year, fish pups are marked with a butterflies.
Today, there are 25 000 juvenile salmon pups with an average weight of 31.3 grams.
Each year, in scientificly-based species and in figures, juveniles and larvae are introduced into the Daugava and its pool water bodies.
The reproduction of fish resources in Daugava and its pool water bodies shall be carried out by Bior in accordance with laws and regulations on the basis of an inspection of the damage caused by Latvenergo's economic activity and a conclusion on what compensatory measures are to be taken to ensure the diversity of fish resources.
On the other hand, the State Environmental Service, on the basis of that examination, decides on the amount and type of compensation.
Latvenergo's annual compensation for the recovery of fish resources is EUR 1 035 000.
In the spring of 2016, Latvenergo, in cooperation with the Society "We Fish", holds 400 artificial fish nersta nest in the Daugava near Kaibala and Ikšķile.
Cooperation with the Society to promote the natural resurgence of fish is an additional supported initiative within the framework of the programme for the recovery of fish resources.
Placing artificial spawning nests in the water storage is an important measure that contributes to the protection and reproduction of fish resources in Daugava.
The festival "Sansusi Concert Hall" has a rural courtyard, forest, cirsma.
Guli in the tent, eats like a restaurant, walks in cedars and listens to the investigated chamber music, enjoying the quiet peace of nature, - an alternative chamber music festival in Sansusi, which already invites to the city of Aknieste for the third summer.
The festival will take place in Sussia - no longer existing villages - in the courtyard of the former parish, next to the forests and in circles.
Within three days - from 12 to 14 August - five shows can combine the careless and sophisticated pleasure of natural and academic music.
Here the theatre and contemporary circus, performances and installations meet music.
Opera and academic music, especially in its newest expressions, find new audiences in a free and open environment without the stiffness of the concert halls.
The distance from here to Riga is about 150 km, but until the smile in the face and lightness in the legs only a few minutes.
"Please don't look for the program, because knowingly we have chosen not to publish it in advance, so people don't go to one particular event or artist, because the true taste of Sansusis can only be counted by spending all three days in it", invites the festival initiator and host, operabaritton Armands Siliņš.
The festival's gateway is open on Friday at 5 p.m. and the first concert is held at 19.00.
Of course, there will be software with all the information on the site.
For those who have to choose one day, we recommend Saturday, because it is the most saturated one, from 9 a.m. to the next morning.
"Artists' names are available on the website www.sanssi.lv", story Armands Siliņš.
For example, a violinist Eva Bindere, a cellulist Kristīne Blaumanis, opera star Inga Kalna, clonnetist Guntis Kuzma, trompetist Jānis Porietis, pianist Reinis Zariņš, quarteti Quadra and RIX, and even Estonian air acrobatist Grete Gross, who together with Latvian musicians Ēriks Kiršfelds, Mārtiņš Zilberts and acrist Anci Strazd has created the contemporary circus performance Confines on the internal fight of the artist.
New jobs have also been created especially for the festival.
The performance for children "Kukais" by Olesj Kozlovska and James Niemanis, who according to F. Kafka, will be participating entomologist (the police researcher) Uģis Piterāns, along with Armands Siliņš, musicians and actors.
Oskars Herliņš has created the first Sting quartet, while Anna Ķirse - Koku opera, the main characters in Andrs Kalnozola's line with Katrīna Neiburga's video projects and Andrs Eglin's stage design, will be trees in three small pots in three hectares' wide kailcirties.
As they sing Lima Ledins, Dinara Rudene and Zigmara Graša's voice, they will come into romantic relationships, just like the lightening era of Swedish natural scientist Karl Linnee's study of Koku weddings (1729).
The Olympic Games in Rio are today launched by one of the largest hopes of the Latvian delegation, the seven-chance athletes Laura Ikauniece-Admidiņa.
Ikauniece-Admidiņa will start the race at 15.0035 after the time of Latvia in a 100-metre event, but at 16:50 a.m., the competition is expected to be high.
On the other hand, at night, on Saturday, the hard work of the bullet will start until 4.05 - 200 meters.
The seven-year race will be closed on Saturday, when the long-haul, dive and a race of 800 meters will take place.
Before the Olympics, Ikauniece-Admidiņa, who won the bronze World Championship last year, was named as a candidate for the Olympic Games medal.
In May, the Latviete also set up a new state record (6622 points) and won the second place in the prestigious seven-chance competition in Ghecis, Austria.
Ikauniece-Admidiņa also took part in the London Olympics 2012 when she won the ninth place with a renewed Latvian record.
During the last year and a half, the athletes have corrected the state record four times.
Today at 16 a.m., the start is also intended for the Latvian judo collion Arturam Nikiforenko, which starts in weight category above 100 kilograms, taking control of the fight with Azerbaijanian Ušangi Kukauri first.
This will be the first Olympic game for Juddy.
The Agency LETA has already announced that on Thursday in weight category up to 100 kilograms, the Latvian judo kegist Jevgji Borodenko had already suffered losses in his first fight.
He climbed up to the Japanese Hagu Ryanski, who later won the bronze.
In 2000, Vsevolod Zeleony brought Latvia the award of the Olympic Bronze, but in the next four Olympic Games Latvian judistes won only one victory in seven battles, which was won directly by Borodek in London.
16.30 After Latvia's time qualification, Dainis Upelnieks will start shooting the competition, and the selection will end on Saturday.
The Upelnieks Olympic mark was received only on the day when the composition of the Latvian delegation was officially announced, but later on he discovered to the agency LETA that he had been quite sure about driving since April.
A sportsman arrives at the Olympic site as one of the first Latvian athletes, trying to make maximum use of training opportunities in the shooter.
19.05 After Latvia's time, three trips will be carried out by the Debitant of Olympic Games, 17-year-old Latvian sailor Katie Birzule, who competes in sailing for winds in the class RS:X.

On Saturday, the decisive final journey on medals will take place.
Today's academic Irish competition is also finally scheduled to take part in Sanita Pušpurei, a Latvian representing Ireland.
On Wednesday, the race was cancelled due to adverse weather conditions.
At 19:10 Pušpure will compete for C/D semi-final single ladies, fighting for 13th place in Olympics.
On a second quarter of her trip, she won a fourth place, from a third position that would allow her to continue fighting for a medal, falling behind any 0.65 seconds.
He won the 13th place four years ago in London, when he also represented Ireland.
Today, 24 sets of medals will be divided into the Olympic Games - archery, lighthouses, trench cycling, riding, trenching, trampling, judo, academic rowing, shooting, swimming, tennis and weight lifting.
Reid claims that if Klinton is elected as President, she will appoint Garlandas as the judge of the Supreme Court.
Hary Reids, the leader of the democratic party of the Senate, is convinced that if she becomes President, she will designate Marik Garland as the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.
The Republic of the Senate Party has blocked the approval of Garland since March, when he was nominated by President Obama.
Mičs Makonnels, the leader of the majority of the Senate, told that the next president would choose who would replace Antonina Skalu, the current Supreme Court judge.
On Thursday during its conference, Reid announced that it is certain that Clinton would choose Garland.
The representative of Reida later told us that he did not personally talk about this subject with Clinton and that it is just speculation.
He praised Garland and said that the Clinton team would not want to "shot the boat" with a different choice.
Garland is the Chief Judge of the Appeals Court of the United States Columbia district.
Reid said that the Republicans blocking the Garland nomination were "deputies" and act in the interest of Donald Trampa, candidate for President of the Republic Party.
He also said that Tramps was not suitable for Presidential work.
Treats announce the calamist calendar for women and men.
The magazine Treats will work with photographer David Belmer to create the 2017 calendar Pirrrei in the 70th century style.
In its 2017 NU Music calendar it is planned to demonstrate the new supermodels, not the blight celebrities.
At the beginning of this year, the President of the magazine Treats Steves Šovs announced that his erotic art magazine was different from his old playboy, because "Playoy is a male magazine".
This magazine is for women.
Looks like he's talking about the calendar too.
In the press release on calendar making, Dave says: "We have to return to the depicting of the stinging and classic calamities in pictures, where women's body does not embarrass, but inspires both women and men."
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a great work of art.
Models can send their photos in electronic or personal caging sessions in Los Angeles and New York.

Greenland shark is the longest-resident vertebrate - video survey
Scientists claim that Greenland sharks are the longest life from all vertebrates on our planet.
Shark researcher Julius Nealsen says that a longing record belongs to a mother, who could be 272 to 512 years old and five feet [5 m] long.
The French court rejects the claim to demolish stores in the Jungle refugee camp.
The French court rejected the request of the authorities to break down tens of self-established shops and restaurants in the “Jungļu” camp, where there are thousands of refugees.
During this week's hearing in Kalais, the authorities indicated that the country should break down 72 self-established shops, where people sell various goods such as cigarettes and energy drinks in the camp area, offer hairdressing services, tea for 50 cents (40p) and simple meals for some euro-based restaurants.
In prison, the Prefect Office indicated that these self-developed companies should be dismantled, as they form the shadow economy and do not pay taxes, as well as fire and sanitation risks.
The representatives of the humanitarian group explained to the court that these small businesses are important because the food provided by governments and support groups does not provide the camp needs, in which the population continues to increase.
They also indicated that established shops and restaurants often offer free shelter and food for those most in need.
The Lilles Court ruled that there was no legal basis for expelling people who had created 72 shops, but that understood Kalje's prefect concerns.
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food, coffee and restaurants play a greater role than simply providing food for people who live in "excessively under uncertain conditions".
He pointed out that these places were peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the sites at the risk of demolition is the Jungle Book Kids camp, which provides more than 200 free meals a day, English and French language classes and advice on asylum issues for hundreds of vulnerable minors without an adult escort.
More than 170 000 people have signed a petition on the protection of the children's cafe.
The letter addressed to the Guardian states that the liquidation of the café " would be a disaster for these children, some of which are only 8 years old."
On Friday, two charitable organisations "Helping refugees" and "L'Auberge des Migraants" said that the number of people in the “Jungų” camp has risen to 9,000, which is the highest indicator since the rapid influx of migrants in summer.
The United Kingdom wins a silver raid in the 7th series of battle, when the Fiji National Unit crafts gold.
The impressive performance of the British team rezbija-7 series ended on Thursday, when in the exciting final stage of the Deodoro stadium, the State Union of Rio Fiji convinced them with a result of 43:7.
Fiji demonstrated the masterclass in the management of the ball, the bombs played with the foot, supporting the game and brutal forces in the game, fighting gold - the first Olympic medal in its history.
The sakava brought a respected comfort prize - a silver medal that was the third medal of Britain on that day. The British team can boast of its success in the first Olympic regbie-7 tournament in which they won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The great battle in the semi-final, in which the Bok team suffered a defeat with a result of 7:5 in the first half of the day, possibly played at the finals for the United Kingdom.
But in any case Fiji's selection is now in its best form to win the team of 15 men.
Although unlikely, however, some consolation for the United Kingdom could be the fact that at least one British got a gold medal. It is Fiji sample of the main trainer Ben Ryan - a former English coach from Vimbdon.
It was an exciting adventure for Britain.
Eight years ago, in Ryan's direction, they lost all the games regby 7 series stage in Adelaide.
This time they lost only one game.
Sacrifice is painful, but growth is amazing.
Fiji made an impressive start for a match, and the joy of the British forces was to be restored.
The Captain Thomas Mitchell and members of the team were in contact with several opposite busses and the World Series champions went under the direction of 5:0, when Osea Kolinisau got the first landing.
In the last four minutes, Jerry Tuwai also increased the victory by implementing the land under the right wing.
The result of 12:0 and the British team had not even really touched the ball.
Micella’s great power to do so did not allow Leon Nakarava to gain three points, but it had little impact on Fiji’s outcome.
In the seventh minute of the game Jasa Veremalula got landed in the right corner, strengthening the victory over Britain to 17:0.
After the victory, Nakarava further increased the victory and had stayed more than a minute... the end of the first half time.
Vatemo Ravouvou was avoided from some inactivity by British forces and crossed the line, getting points.
Land provided a result of 29:0.
Fiji seemed to be born to play regby-7 match while the British were just studying.
In fact, it is true.
The British team made a profound change in the half-time by breaking up Fiji's player line... full of four minutes, which, after the first half-time standards, was good, until Joshua Tuisova, got a few more points for Fiji's team.
Dan Norton managed to gain points in favour of the British team by taking the ground in the left corner and achieving the result of 36:7, but the game had already been lost, while the fans of the South Sea islanders sang, won the flags and dance in the tribunals.
You can’t be surprised by the joyous attitude of Fiji.
Matthew William made Fiji victory even more sweet with another grounding game at the end.
When the game ended, Fiji could start to celebrate, but the British could only sit down at the grass after the defeat.
In the first half of the day, the semi-final Fiji defeated Japan with a result of 20:5, while the British were superior to South Africa, where both teams were hit by land and the South Africans lost only a few points.
In the first half, Kyle Braun put the box under the command of the teams, and in the second half, Den Norton crossed the line with shiny skill and brought the ball between the pillars, providing British victory.
Markus Vatson, who is the brother of England's regbby-15 team player Antonio, was the perfect power to win the team and another silver medal at the end of the game.
The fight against cancer has inspired Helen Glover and Heter Staning's victory in rowing.
It will be the most emotional medal of gold in these races and it is already expressing much.
From the first to last cancer, the moment of Helena Glovere and Hetere Stanninga gold played a special role in the Estacio da Lagoa track.
Although there are only both athletes in the boat, they were accompanied by Robin Williams’ echo, who inspired them to obtain the second Olympic gold medal by rowing women, becoming the first women in British sports history who have made such progress.
They were undoubtedly dominated by 39 times as they won an unprecedented, unprecedent victory.
Both great athletes with swans elevating on the water surface do not fully reflect this triumph.
A team who is working hard to constantly improve their performance and make the greatest contribution to their success is given by a trainer who did not know if he would experience this day 30 months ago because he was found cancer.
According to him, it disappeared as quickly as it appeared.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of those who could operate and so happened.
If it weren't done, it would spread throughout the body.
And the situation would become uncontrollable.
It changes your vision a little.
Williams discovered cancer in December 2013.
This trio was successful in opening the recovery procedure at the beginning of the intersessional period in 2014 and reducing the duration of the break if it can be said.
I needed income, so I quickly got to recover.
It encouraged recovery.
I was in a hospital and took a distance of 6, 10, and even 15 feet [15 m], although the doctor said that some steps would be sufficient.
It all started.
Airing in itself is a challenge, but this time it was even bigger.
After the victory, William was the first idea, who was very nervous all mornings and spoke more than usual.
Staninga, who has served in the Royal Artillery Unit in Afghanistan, said: "This was an emotional week, but it means a lot to me."
It only confirms how much it means to us and how much I, Helen and Robin, have worked.
The last three years with Helen and Robin have been great.
Without Robin we wouldn't have achieved anything, so thank him very much, he's the best coach in the world.
I can't imagine a better trainingmate or a better coach.
Helena Glover and Hetere Stanninga have not lost their race within five years.
The couple achieves the huge speed with which the competitors cannot compete.
Even in the last 500 meters, when teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to get closer, the weight of Stanning and Glover was too high.
We felt every moment.
Helen shouted, "Keeps the rhythm, keeps the rhythm."
Do not lose concentration really matters.
We made a good start, but at the same time we had no high expectations.
On that day we did not want to burn records, but simply to rent well and win the race, and that was what we did.
A couple of years will be resting to decide what to do next.
The next month there will be the wedding of Glover and the television adventurer Steve Bass.
So far she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean that this was my last game.
That would have been too much pressure.
In London, I needed about six months to realize that I was the Olympic champion.
It was a new experience and I was very excited.
This time it took about four minutes.
She said, "The feeling is fantastic."

The head of the Kolegovu SRS will "lead to the last".
According to him, now the Prime Minister Maris Kučinskis (Agricultural and Farmers' Union) and the Minister for Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola (Agricultural and Farmers' Union) are already "essentially important" for the approval of the Chief Finance Minister-in-Office of the SRS as the nominated candidate for the Kollegov.
Rajevskis said that both Kučinski and Reizniece-Ozola in this government's approval of the head of the SRS is the "first big decision" that can affect him as a political future.
If it is now starting to change its position in the choice of the candidate for Head of the SRS, this will have a negative impact on their leadership in the national administration.
The agenda for next week's meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers includes the question of transfer of the head of the VVD to the office of Director General of the SRS, as demonstrated by the Government's agenda.
The post of Head of the SRS was headed by Minister of Finance Reizniece-Ozola after the resignation of Inara Petersone from the management of the service and when the competition for the post of Director-General of SRS ended without result.
On Thursday, August 11, in an interview with Latvian Radio Executive Officer Dace Pelėka, Latvian Executive Officer allowed - if she could stand as a leader, she could agree.
The Minister of Finance also later admitted that other candidates for the post of Head of the SRS were not being considered for the time being.
Raivis Dzintars, Head of the Saeima's Saeima Group, also recognised that NA has continued to support Kolegovs under the leadership of the SRS.
In Spain, the possibilities for reducing the deficit are at risk of failure to establish a government.
On 12 July the European Commission (EC) expressed its opinion that Spain and Portugal had not implemented sufficiently ambitious measures to reduce the deficit to 3% of GDP required by the euro area.
The calculations show that, despite the austerity measures implemented, the Portuguese deficit was 4.4% of GDP at the end of last year and 5.1% in Spain.
However, the European Commission decided not to impose economic sanctions on both countries, while setting fiscal targets for the next time.
One of the reasons why the EC did not impose sanctions against the two countries is the growing Euroscepticism in many countries of the European Union.
Additional sanctions would only multiply such a negative mood.
The critics point out, however, that the EC is not consistent in its decisions, by agreeing on common rules from the outset and then failing to apply them to life.
For example, Mr Jens Vademann, President of the German Bundesbank, pointed out that Europe is losing confidence in itself, creating the citizen's perception that European Union rules are recommended rather than binding.
The EC has now proposed and all Member States have approved an extension of the deadline for the adjustment of the deficit by the end of this year for Portugal and for Spain by 2018.
The European Commission promises to examine progress made by both countries in the coming months, while at the same time pointing out that both Spain and Portugal should be prepared to introduce additional austerity measures if circumstances so require.
The initial forecasts show that the target set for Portugal could be achieved within the set deadlines and that already this year the deficit could fall to 2.5% of gross domestic product.
This means that, under the Stability Programme, the government of this country needs to implement austerity measures of 0.25% of GDP this year.
These measures should be included in this year's budget, with additional attention paid to the control of the purchase costs of goods and services.
In the case of Spain, the situation is much more complex.
This year the budget deficit has to be reduced to 4.6%, to 3.1% next year and to 2.2% of GDP in 2018.
Moreover, consolidation measures should be 0.5% of GDP each year in the next two years.
The fact that, for eight months already, the Spanish political parties have failed to reach an agreement on the establishment of a government, makes it increasingly difficult to achieve these goals, and it is becoming more likely that Spain may have to hold early parliamentary elections for the third time a year.
However, public opinion polls show that the political scene of the third elections in the country would not be significantly altered.
The most popular party is still the current popular party chaired by Prime Minister Mariano Rahoi, whose election would once again obtain a minority of 33%.
Only socialists have increased their popularity, while the popularity of the pro-congregation party "Podemos" or "Commonly we can" and "Ciudanos" or "Pilsonas" has decreased slightly.
The People's Party wants to get socialists and Ciudanos into the government again this month, otherwise it will not succeed in adopting and submitting the draft budget for 2017 to the European Commission for approval.
As announced by the representative of the People's Party parliamentary group, Rafael Hernando, if the government fails and the parliamentary elections are also held for the third time, Spain will become the ambition of Europe as a whole.
Beach cleanliness in the Gulf of Riga is critical.
Surveying the beaches for the fifth year, activists concluded that, unfortunately, the number of waste found each year is increasing, and here most bathing visitors are to blame.
The most contaminated bathing sites are in Riga.
It is explained in the opinion of the capital city that bathing sites are collected daily, but it is quite difficult to deal with dirty visitors.
In addition, the waste left on land may be washed in water during the rainstorms, thereby significantly damaging its quality.
With the exception of Liepaja beach and separate sites in Kurzeme, beach purity elsewhere in Latvia is critical.
This week, volunteers from the campaign "My Sea".
By measuring the road along the Gulf of Riga for five years, activists concluded that the number of waste left by the population had increased every hundred meters.
Unfortunately, this year, the assessment of criticism has begun.
"We see that this will be the year when the number of waste on the beach is 100 meters, perhaps even more than 200 units," says Jānis Ulme, representative of the expedition "My Sea".
The radio call of Latvia, he was on the Tūja beach, where a voluntary march along the Gulf of Riga will continue.
This year, even daylight lights left in the sand of the sea had to be collected among the activists left behind by various municipal waste and picnics.
The hiking participant and organizer Ulme says that in pollution it is the people who are responsible for the pollution.
"The main source is the visitors to the beach themselves, because more than half of the total number of waste is plastic, different waste, starting with bags, pieces of plastic that are already in the degradation phase, is no longer possible to identify them, and to throw them, bottles, corks", says Ulme.
The most dirty beaches are also swimming places in Riga.
For example, in Daugavgriva every hundred meters, nearly 800 waste units have been collected on average, which is critically large.
The campaign’s organisers also explain that it is possible to mention Norway as many as possible and not everywhere warning or prohibition signs.
"The average figures for all three bathing sites in Riga together - Daugavgrīvs, Daugavgļļļi and Older people - unfortunately, there are large and far above the desired goal, where Latvia is moving, to reduce the number of waste units to 135 units by 2020", the environmental advocate concludes.
Cleaning of bathing sites in Riga every day, on summer hot days even twice, explains the representative of the board Uģis Internalkis.
Still, the fight against dirty visitors is very difficult.
We return to the cultural issue of these people.
"For those who consume alcohol, smoke and do all the things that cannot be done, even special signs do not work," says the Interior.
Therefore, the Interior invites visitors to report pollutants to the police too.
You can call the police, make sure to point out these violations and fight everyone in this way.
Perhaps you can put some new warnings, but as I said, it is unlikely that this will change the situation radically.
"As everyone should simply turn around together and be intolerant to such offenders", he stresses.
Meanwhile, water quality measurements have already been carried out for the fourth time this summer by the Health Inspectorate, which can impose a ban on official bathing sites.
This year, as for other years, water quality is everywhere good and satisfactory.
At the moment, the situation is that in all 56 bathing areas, water quality has always been good and there are no restrictions on swimming.
"For the last time we will take analyses at the end of August," says the Senior Environmental Health Officer, Normunds Kadiķis.
Wastes left on land during heavy raining may be flushed with water.
In turn, this may affect its quality, indicated by an environmental specialist.
Rotations in the Russian elite continue - the change of head of Putin's administration.
Did he lose office?
Vladimir Putin announced to the Russian media that Sergey Ivanov wanted to leave this post himself and will be the President's Special Representative for Nature Conservation, Ecology and Transport.
When you announced the changes, Putin spent many years working together and doing it successfully in front of the television cameras.
I am satisfied with how you carry out your duties.
I remember very well our agreement not to use you for more than four years in this post of Head of the President's Administration.
Therefore, I treat with understanding your wish to change the field of action.
And I hope that you will also make full use of your knowledge and experience in your new position.
However, it is highlighted that the management of the President's administration is a very important position and it has made Ivanov one of the most influential people in the country.
Given that the elections of the State Council are expected in Russia next month, fear was expressed that this step is linked to the fight for power in the Russian political elite.
Ivanov was also called a potential substitute for Putin for President, and the statement that he himself wanted to serve as a representative of the President in matters of nature and transport has raised doubts.
According to Lsm.lv archive, Ivanov is a general public representative of the KGB and the Federal Security Service.
Ivanov has been an old and close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He started his career at the Sundays of 1975, where he met Putin.
Later, when Putin became the head of the Federal Security Service, Ivanov became his deputy.
On the other hand, the first President of Russia, Boris Yeltina, was appointed Secretary of the Russian Security Council at the end of his reign.
In 2000, following Putin's coming to power, the "Dactrine on Information Security" developed by Ivanova was approved, which provided for the revitalisation of national censorship mechanisms in Russia.
In 2001, Sergey Ivanov became the Minister of Defence of Russia, but already in 2005 he was Deputy Prime Minister Mihaila Fradkova and was responsible for the development of Russian defence companies and arms exports.
Now, after leaving the office of Head of the President's Administration, Ivanov will also maintain his place in the Russian National Security Council, where he will also work on the new Head of the President's Administration, Vaino.
Wine comes from the family Soviet party in the elite.
Head of the President's Administration, Vaino has been nominated by Ivanov himself.
I and Anton Eduardovich have known us for a long time.
Still since we were working under your guidance in the government.
And for the last almost five years, we know practically every day.
"That's why I'm sure he's ready for this job, according to all his professional and personal characteristics," said Ivanov.
Wine comes from a family belonging to the elite of the Soviet party.
His grandfather Karl took high positions in the Estonian Communist Party, including ten years up to 1988, his first secretary.
Internet edition "Meduza" with reference to the book "Estonian self-determination and independence" says that at the end of the 1980s Karl Vaino had asked Moscow to allow force against the participants of the demonstrations.
However, he had received his refusal and soon lost his post.
Shortly thereafter, Wan has moved to Moscow.
Anton Vaino has graduated from Moscow Institute of International Relations and manages Japanese language.
However, he left the diplomatic service to work in the administration of the minutes of the President.
It has already been announced that the last insurgent Russia has been shocked by the abandonment of a number of high-ranking officials and even arrests, including the replacement of the governors and federal representatives of several areas.
According to political scientists, President Putin is transforming the ruling elite before the forthcoming elections in 2018.
One of the main features is that the representatives of the structures are increasingly active at the leading positions.
The judo fighter Nikiforenko also loses in the first fight of the Olympic Games.
This was a battle in the first round, and the Latvian judo frog has concluded its participation in the Olympic Games by finalising 17th place.
Coach Oleg Baskins admitted that the hope of Nikiforenko was very little, and it was already clear before the competition.
He also found that the judo rode in the fight was the shoulder injury.
Significantly, to get to the Olympic mark, Nikiforenko had to start in a weight category other than the usual weight category of up to 100 kilograms.
Azerbaijan was 25 pounds [25 kg] heavier.
It has already been reported that in Jevgeny Borodenko’s fight in weight category up to 100 kilograms against Ryannuuki, two-and-a-half minutes, until the opponent made a clean victory worth a throw.
Therefore, Latvia's judo race Rio has finished.
The dreams disappear in the sand of Rio.
Judaist Jevgeny Borodak entered the Thursday.
Yes, he had a more titled opponent, but ambitious ones can sometimes be surprised.
He didn't get it.
The task of Arthur Nikiforenko was even more complicated because of the smaller experience and the opponent also respectabls.
The result is similar, even though he was on the tattoo for about one and a half minutes longer than Borodek.
Unfortunately, Latvia's jutees have been the worst in a lack of ambition.
Gunārs Ķirsons and his financial stunt Vladimir Šstakovs, Alexander Jackevičs left Latvia, is no longer "Golden Score", and the development of the judo goes down the slipway.
Jackevic, who advises Kazahstan's juddies here, and Vsevold Zelion's heirs are not seen.
But if you don't grow up, you won't.
And that's the federation's prerogative.
So as from another galaxy "Rita panoramic" was heard by the President of the Latvian Judo Federation's promise to fight medals.
Flight far from reality.
In the evening, we were looking forward to the beach volleyball match Samoilov/Smēdiņš - Evandru/Pedru Solbergs.
Intriga, as in the "death" group, losers have finished their games.
Latvia's duet was a small derogation - it could also be lost, but not more than four points in two six.
The long-standing previous game raised tension.
Nobody wanted to die -- this feeling turned over the windy card along the match.
Players were given extra difficulties by the bustling wind.
At first, it seemed as an ally of us, which was more comprehensive.
But he didn't.
Against Latvia's duet to play here was quite simple.
He's staying on Samoilov and waiting for him to break.
Canada was flooded, and Cuba was broken at the end of the first set and at the beginning of the third because the load had nothing to do with it.
At that time, he could go fishing because there were few jobs, but when he was, he did it for honor.
The Brazilians Samoillov and Shemah were able to win two-sixs because the first took control of 16:15, but also remained on the 16th as well, also slay the lost-spot limit.
But it was also possible to lose with 0:2, because the second six deficit was -4, but also thanks to the wind managed to win.
The third had already carried the Evandra's plate.
The chain was formed - an inconceivable service, the second hand, often flying too close to the network, and Samoilov remained very few options for a resultive attack.
If Samoillov had a foreign on the field, he was better off this time, and only to Sausha take a loss away would be unprofessional.
Creilis was wrong too, and quite symbolic that he struck the last ball in the block.
The team is being killed.
This time, there was certainly also a lack of success: in the third six, only two attacks of Evandre almost went out of the card, but the ball still hit the line.
Two trips were next to the line.
The contentious episodes also decided in favour of opponents.
In the first two games, Evandr was very productive.
All together was in the loss on the tab.
The causes of failure must now be carefully analysed.
Perhaps you should have been living next to the stadium, not with a delegation in the Olympic village.
On the way two and a half hours.
Perhaps a series of seven semi-finals gave some confidence.
Perhaps it was not necessary to play in Klagenfurt, but rather to come here and get better acclimatized.
Perhaps there was a mistake in finding a sports-shaped upper.
So far, the question is more than a response.
Our little guys have finished their games.
The dream about the medals is over.
What's next?
There are still some World Cup tournaments, as well as the "Masters" of Jurmala.
Samoillo and I have never been friends in life, because there are too many different personalities.
But that is not necessary either.
When a dream about Olympic medals is broken, the idea of divorce may arise, because the blame will be sought not only in itself but also in a partner.
The difference is not difficult, but it will be more difficult to find worthy partners in Latvia.
Both brothers play the monks, but John and Tom have already tried and divorced, while Micah Samoilov are still too green to begin to conquer the world’s peaks.
You can try Harald Regzi, Alexander Solove, Edgar Toch, to return to Martin Plevis, but it will not be better than this option, which has not proved itself once in the World Cup stages.
The sand of the cocabana did not smile to them this time.
And that's it.
Of course, we should also take into account the fact that the beach volleyball is becoming more popular, that new couples enter into circulation, and only the rare plant is less than two metres.
This does not guarantee success yet, but is an important argument in the fight for victory.
We don't stay any longer.
Both athletes and journalists have the opportunity to stay in the places offered by players, as well as to choose their own.
The U.S. basketball team lives on a cruise ship, with some tennis players not leaving the Olympic village.
Also, some beach volleyball players have found a hotel in Cokaban.
This time, we offered rather modest accommodations for journalists, which were subject to high prices.
Therefore, the choice also fell to the apartment for rent.
The risk is because sometimes it can be uncomfortable from a logistical point of view.
This time the risk is justified.
We rent apartments with Vladimir Vladimirovič on the border of Cokabana and Ipanem.
The beach is 200 meters away and the bee arena is half an hour walk.
The district's pretty sure, because it's the pevela, but there's no room for attention to be lost here too.
Vladimir Vladimirovich is not exactly what some think about, but the professional sports journalist in Russian media Vladimir Ivanov.
P.S. seems to have dreamed another medal dream on Friday morning.
In the 100-metre race and high-flying, Laura Ikauniece-Admidiņa left their personal records.
But there are five more disciplines.
After a 10-year break, Porgy and Bess sound in Liepaja.
In 1973, Opera Porgis un Bessa experienced its first-time experience in the Latvian National Opera.
Since then, the internationally recognised masterpiece has not been reinstated.
That is why the organisers of Cesis Art Festival and Liepaja Art Forum decided in close cooperation to give the audience the opportunity to enjoy George Guersvin's masterpiece.
"We are very pleased that after a ten-year break, when Liepaja was able to enjoy the performance of the opera, this version of the concert performance of the great George Guerschvin Porgi and Bess is enjoyed with us at the new, newly opened concert hall "Bielais dzintars", says Baiba Bože, Head of the concert hall "Lielais dzintars".
Opera "Porgis un Bessa" is a famous musical story of love, its volatility, passion, as well as domestic tragedies and simple daily joys.
It reflects the African American vitality, music and rhythm.
It is this lack of political integrity in this opera that this shutdown of tolerance makes it so alive.
"And yes, this love story is extremely powerful, extremely beautiful and in some way really deep," says director Viesturs Kairiškis.
What I like most - listening to or playing this opera is always a stop point - the famous melodies, the famous motives, but these transitions from one character to another, lighting one character or another personality, or choirs, or orchestra.
"It's the most exciting, this building", the opera is appreciated by the music director and conductor Andris Poga of opera Porgi and Bessa.
The visitors to the operation agree that this is a grand event.
They are delighted to hear the world’s famous opera.
Happy is that Liepaja can feel the breath of the world.
"Complete professional", the opera is appreciated by the visitor Edgars Lamas.
The concert was special because for the first time the orchestra was played in the new open concert hall "Lielais Dzintars" and the opera concert took place for the first time.
The field at the Art Museum could be named after Janis Rozentāls.
The vice-president of Riga Andris Americas Rozentras Rozentāls told us that in the future the museum's own address could be not Krišjāņs Valdemāra Street 10a, but Janis Rozentāls Square 1.
Māra Lāce, Director of the Museum, admitted that re-registration of the address would create a great bureaucratic burden, but generally this idea was welcomed and therefore accepted by the municipality's proposal.
The city of Riga has set a basic dimension for this idea in 1936 by creating the Burkards Dziņs monument for Janis Rozentāls, which stands at the museum.
Wilhelm Purvičis, the director of the museum at the time, was one of the initiators for the creation of this monument.
Thus, this further activity could be purely logical.
I'm a little bit upset with my conscience all the time, but Wilhelm Purvis, where are we going to put his name?
"But if you, Mr. America, promise to think about it," said Lāce.
The building of the National Museum of Art, after extensive reconstruction and modernisation, officially collapsed this May.
This week, VEF Culture Palace will finally start reconstruction.
About 11 million euros will be renewed by "Velve" Ltd.
It is planned to renovate several castle spaces, including two viewers' halls, as well as the building to fit people with reduced mobility.
The Riga City Council intends to raise the money from the European Union funds to the project of EUR six million, but Oļegs Burovs, Director of the Property Department of the Riga City Council, admits that the project is not yet fully clear as European funds.
"Despite the fact that the political will to start the repair of VEF Culture Castle by attracting European Structural Funds is, we expect a decision for months, real action from the officials of the Ministry of Finance, will be granted or not," Bourov says.
Last December, we were told that everything depends on Brussels.
Two weeks ago, the Ministry of Finance received a letter from the European Commission that you would take the decision yourself that Brussels did not take a decision here.
We are now seeing another circle of discussions coming up again, then we will see what we can expect in the coming days.
"I would like to say that the Riga City Council has no doubt guaranteed that this process will be initiated and completed within the time limits", says Bourov.
It has already been reported that more than a year ago, in March 2015, VEF Culture Palace collectives organized a concert at the entrance before immediate, immediate renovation of the building.
Although the year passed, the renovation of the building was still not started and collectively continued to work under inappropriate conditions.
In the strategy of the Property Department of Riga City, VEF Culture Palace renovation is divided into sets of seemingly independent reconstruction works, where each will ensure the exercise of different functions of the castle.
First - increasing access to VEF Culture Palace and improvement of the surrounding territory.
It is intended to arrange the surroundings and engineering communications, as well as to restore the building façade.
The second is improving the supply of services from VEF Culture Castle.
It plans restoration of interior, wall and ceiling of the building, improvement of stage and sound recording studies, as well as arrangement of interior engineering communications of the building.
Third - Improving the working conditions of creative amateurs, which includes plans to improve workshop equipment, space heating and ventilation systems.
Before the 40th anniversary legendary rock group, "Līva" can be seen at the exhibition in Liepaja.
The exhibition will present various "Livus" characterizing objects - photographs arranged in a timeline to reflect the group's activities from the beginning to 2010, when announced the end of the group's activities.
Participants' stage clothing, musical instruments, awards and concert recordings will also be shown, as well as other things not yet seen by the wider public, which reflected the creative activities of the group "Livi".
The exhibition will be supplemented with items from Liepaja Museum collection.
The visual design of the exhibition was created in collaboration with the fashion artist and painter Elita Patmalniece.
Musicians who had been associated with the Līvi group and their relatives also responded to the call and shared both objects and memories.
The beginnings of "Līvu" can be found in 1972, when a German instrumental ensemble is created at Liepaja Culture House, led by Juris Pazintils.
The ensemble has participated in the festival "Liepājas dzintars" in 1972 and 1974, as well as in the views of the city and Republic.
In 1976, a fateful meeting took place, when Juris Paviklis met Eric Ķigēlis and established a group in the Culture Palace of Metalurgs, inviting to join Ingrid Gūtmanis, Andris Kruzins and Janis Skrodum.
Over the years, the composition of the group has not taken place once.
Participants have joined, others have gone, some have returned.
However, the most important thing - the desire to confirm that Latvian rock music is able to live and exist - has remained unchanged.
"What to see was not lacking - denim, hair and bardain, these boys were perceptiblely different from the stereotype of the common stage singer," the music explorer Klās Vāvere says about the group.
In the band without the above-mentioned musicians there were such outstanding musicians such as Igo, Vilnis Krieviņš, Modris Šterns, Valdis Štarks, Laikis Rēcējs, Tālis Semibarnieks, Ainars Virga, Aivars Breze, Guntars Mucenieks, Dainis Virga, Tomass Kleins and many others.
The entrance to the exhibition is free of charge.
The exhibition is open from August 19 to October 30.
On August 27, at Liepaja Concert Hall "Pūt, Winds" will take place the 40th anniversary celebration "Līvi" of the band "Livi".
For the first time in a period of 8 months, there is inflation in Bulgaria.
In July Bulgaria’s national statistics showed 1% of monthly inflation.
This is the highest since 2012 and the first indicator over zero since October of the previous year, when it was positive (0.2%).
The average annual inflation after PCI was -0.8% in the last 12 months ( August - July 2016) compared to the previous year.
The consumer price index in July 2016 was 101.9% compared to the previous year and the monthly average inflation rate was 1.0%.
Since the beginning of the year, the inflation rate was -0.2% in July 2016 compared to December 2015 and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 was -0.2% in July 2015.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016 there was a rise in prices for the following consumer groups: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); entertainment and cultural activities (6.3%); hotels and restaurants (1.2%); household goods and services (0.3%).
Prices decreased for clothing and footwear (2.2%); home appliances, household appliances and regular cleaning (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained at the level of alcohol and tobacco, management, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education in the previous month.
Zbigniew Stankevičs: The time is coming, and the truth is up.
The Archbishop of the Catholic Church of Latvia Zbigniew Stankevičs in an interview with Independently emphasises that if we want to gain strength for life, the Gospel message must be placed at the centre.
For the power of the truth is greater than evil.
Many are already on the way to the festival of the Most Holy Virgin Mary in the heavens in Aglona.
What message will believers receive there this year?
In recent years, the pope’s nunny has expressed his desire to direct the main worship in Aglona.
Therefore, the main message is in his sense.
It is also a kind of tradition to develop the direction of Krusta led by Bishop Jānis Bullis.
He will also make his own message.
I'm running a concert service on the previous day.
Last year I turned to Pope Francisco's encyclic "Laudato si" and updated the total house covered by it in the context of the Earth theme in Latvia.
This year... of course, I have been watching what is happening in the world and I try to respond to it in my speech.
My approach coincides with the church’s suggestion that the Gospel message should be placed in the center of life.
It must be shown that the Gospel responds to the most painful problems of human life and gives him inspiration for further progress.
Then it addresses people.
But in Cesis, in the Lampa discussion, you said that "should come back to an understanding of the perfect man".
What do you know?
Does this mean that a person is turning away from the message of the church?
And does the church have such a return resource today?
In Indian capital, there is a plunder on the road by a man dying.
No one in the capital of India has ever been aware of the stinking man on the road - it turns out that he has laid an hour down on the side of the road and then robbed himself, informs BBC.
A man identified as Matibel has been reported to have run in a rude day and worked as a guard at night.
Matibole 5:30 a.m. went to the house on the road when a light car struck him.
The record of the surveillance cameras shows that the driver has left the car to look at the victim, and then left.
One hour later, when no one knew of a bleeding man, he was robbed by a garrison.
Some 90 minutes after the crash, police arrived and the victim was taken to a hospital where he died of the trauma.
When renouncing his candidacy to the post of Director General of State Revenue Service (VID), Inga Koļegova, Head of State Environmental Service rescued the government from falling, Ojārs Skudra, Associate Professor of the Faculty of Social Sciences of the University of Latvia, considers.
The explanation of the declaration of candidacy in relation to the contradictions in the ruling coalition is linked to the fact that she has prevented the fall of the government.
In a conversation with the agency LETA, Skudra said that it was difficult for him to imagine that next week, in the government meeting, 'Unitity' would support the candidacy of Kolegova.
Consequently, if the Ministers of Unity voted against, but the Koļegov would still have approved it, it would lead to the government delegation.
The expert also considers that both the Minister of Finance Dana Reiznienis-Ozols and Prime Minister Maris Kučinski have been consulted prior to the announcement of the candidacy notice.
At the same time, it is also a concessions to the 'Unit', which were firmly opposed to her candidacy.
In predicting whether it would be possible to find a suitable candidate by tender, Skudra acknowledged that there were two options: either a compromise figure or an institution as the executive director of the Director-General would continue to lead Dace Pelek.
At the same time, he points out that if the Minister of Finance has so far claimed that another candidacy has not been considered, it is a hint to Beijing that it is not possible to take part in the contest.
LETA already announced that the Head of State Environmental Service Koļegova decided to withdraw his nomination for the Director-General of the SRS.
On the grounds of 'Unit', the government suspended the approval of Kolegova for a week for the post of Director-General of the SRS.
Following the government's decision to postpone the decision, Koļegova confirmed that it is still ready to become the head of the SRS.
However, she later changed her mind - in her application to the Minister of Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola, she pointed out that she withdrew her consent to transfer to the office of manager of the SRS and that she did not have a easy choice.
The Secretary of the press of Prime Minister Māra Kučinska, Andrejs Vaivars Agency LETA, explained that a new competition would be held for the vacant General of the SRS.
An accident involving a police car took place in the centre of Riga.
This afternoon, a road traffic accident involving the State Police Car has occurred in the centre of Riga.
A police car with sound and light signals has rushed to the top category call until the intersection between Krišjāņ Barona and Dzirnavu was hit by another car.
The police explain the circumstances that occurred, but the initial information suggests that the other vehicle has not missed the police car.
In the event of an accident, a woman has suffered.
This year the number of inhabitants fell in Riga
At the beginning of this year there were 638 784 inhabitants in Riga, which is 0.34% less than in 2015, when the capital was officially registered with 641 000 inhabitants, LETA was informed by the Central Statistical Office (CSP).
In terms of population, the capital of Latvia belongs to the 30th place between the capitals of the European Union (EU) and the major cities where the population exceeds one million.
According to data from Eurostat, Latvia's capital is convincingly among the largest cities in Europe, with 127 women per 100 men.
All three capitals of the Baltic States have the highest female participation in Europe's largest cities: 123 in Vilnius, and 121 in Tallinn per 100 men.
A warning pictogram shall be displayed at the LNMM.
In the coming days, warning signs - pictograms - will be placed at the National Museum of Art of Latvia (LNMM), the representative of the Property Department of the Riga City Council Baiba Gailīte, told the agency LETA.
The repair of rapid damage caused by skatebordistes has now been successfully completed in the museum glass.
The warning pictograms will be displayed in the nearest few days.
Its residents will be told that the cover may be slippery during rain and snow, not to move by cars, as well as to visit bicycles, skates and skateboards.
About this social network Facebook was then also written by Usakov, who pointed out that no safety hazards were posed, but that "does not look like fuels" and skatebordistes "will come to the brain".
Holidays for children and parents - New children's playgrounds have been set up in Riga.
In this summer season, the municipality of Riga has set up two more playgrounds in the city, Ķīpsala and Čiekurkalns, which are already available to children.
The beach of Kipsala has a wide, multi-functional toy vessel with various climbing elements, bridges, games, trubs and skis.
Playground for children of all ages.
The field also includes swings and various balancing elements.
The fantasy world is filled with a location for small boaters on the coast of Daugava with a view to the passenger port and the cruise ships there.
A gaming house, trampolines, step track, equilibrium bridge, swings, toy balls and other parts of the game, as well as a training area with circular forces and coordination trainings, co-ordinates, etc. are installed in a playground of play between the 4th and 5th section of Čiekurkalns.
Under the space covered rubber cover in different colors.
A new, colourful pavement of the pavement is applied to the street-side to play area.
A reconstructed section of the road was discovered in the trees.
Minister of Transport Uldis Augulis, State Road Management of the Republic of Latvia (LVC), as well as representatives of the builders SIA "Biders" and local authorities today opened the Russian border of the reconstructed main road of the country (Grebņeva) -Rēzekne-Daugavpils-Lithuanian border (Medumi) (A13) from Medums to the Lithuanian border (1564-163,05 km).
Roads are a country's business card, especially border roads, so special satisfaction is to discover a reconstructed section on the border with our southern neighbours.
This is another example of the fact that the co-financing of European Union funds improves the situation on major national roads.
"As forecasts show, the resources available to roads during this planning period will be acquired already in 2018 and we need to think about how to continue maintaining the most heavily loaded roads in very good quality, as well as ensuring the mobility of citizens in all regions of Latvia without European Union funding," Uldis Augulis stressed by turning the symbolic tape.
The Minister of Transport also indicated that the proposals made by traffic experts on sustainable financing of Latvian roads will be presented to the government in the near future.
In the construction phase from Medumi to the Lithuanian border (156,4-163,05 km) SIA Benders started last year and continued this year after the technological break.
The costs of reconstruction are EUR 13.5 million (including VAT), and the project was co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
"In the reconstructed stage of the road, road construction has been completely restored and the next year the repair work will be started in the next stage from Medumi to Daugavpils itself, so the whole road will be arranged from the border of Lithuania to Daugavpils", informed Janis Lange, Chairman of the Board of LVC.
The main roads of the country are most under pressure, and by 2018 we intend to make all the major roads of the country in good condition.
The next task will be to maintain them in good quality by providing timely maintenance and changes to the surface of asphalt every 7-9 years.
"It will, of course, require adequate funding, and all drivers look with hope at the proposals made by the expert group to bring the road financing system into line", noted Lange.
Within the project are arranged road connections and lighting in the centre of the Trees.
Significant land works have been carried out: in four stages, large-scale dehumidification and large-scale rocking and burial works have been made, and the road has been very uneven so far.
Public transport stops have also been renewed and the turnaround area for public transport has been built again.
In the past, the road had insufficient rest, and the terrain relief was not transparent because of mountain valleys, as well as the old road of common relief.
During the next construction season it is planned to restore the road section from the border of Daugavpils city to the now reconstructed stage (144,80-156,40 km).
This year, LVC plans to carry out different types of works on more than 1,100 kilometres of national road.
Information about all the repairs planned on the national road network this year is available on LVC website www.lvceli.lv.
"In order to achieve the desired weight reduction results, the right choice of combinations of foods is very important," says Lithuanian dietologist Laura Romeraite-Kukleriene.
Moreover, it is easy to do in the summer season when our own gardens grow fresh fruits, berries, and vegetables.
A balanced combination of diet products can help not only reduce excess weight, but also contribute purposefully to various processes of the body.
Makaroni and vinegar are a successful combination because they provide a long-lasting sata sensation and help fight fat.
Studies published in the European Register of Clinical Nutrition have shown that vinegar has a beneficial effect on blood glucose levels and helps us to feel mundrum.
Cajerna pepper and protein-rich food such as poultry meat or protein cocktail cause not only a sense of sata, but also reduces the leg after a large meal in the next meal.
This combination of meals can also increase the amount of calories burned after a meal to 35%.
Research has shown that cayenne pepper can help to get rid of a layer of fat in the abdominal area.
The eggs contain a metabolic enhancer, choline, while paprika is a good source of vitamin C.
The intake of sufficient amounts of these nutrients can lead to a reduction in cortisol levels and consequently a fat accumulation around the middle part of the body.
Oat flakes, which are accompanied by fresh berries, are another delicious and fat burning breakfast that is worth to be included in your menu.
Oat flakes and berries contain fibers that, according to the Canadian scientific findings, control the level of Grelin, the appetite stimulating hormone, and thus also the feeling of hunger.
In addition, the berries contain polyphenols, which are aids in weight reduction and also prevent fat formation.
Vegetables and proteins are also able to perform miracles in weight reduction.
This combination can cause a feeling of sata.
The vegetables contain water and fibers, therefore they contribute to the sense of sata.
At the same time, proteins slow down the digestive process and provide a sense of satature for a long time.
You can eat chicken with salads or make a protein cocktail from the ready blend and enjoy it with your favorite vegetables.
Which combinations of products should be avoided.
The fruit contains sugars - monosaccharides or disaccharides - compounds of one or two molecules.
The starch in the gardens, on the other hand, is a polysaccharide.
The fruit divides into the stomach mechanically and does not chemically divide them up to a third or fourth degree in the digestive process in the gut.
The solid is divided into three different stages, which starts already in the mouth.
It is therefore important not to eat the sweet food immediately after a meal.
To eat the sweet food immediately after a meal, it is "saturated" in the stomach with other dishes, where it is not chemically digested and bloated.
Don't eat bread, potatoes, peas, bananas, date or other products containing carbohydrates with lemons, limes, oranges, grapefruits, pineapples or other sour fruits.
The enzyme pthialine present in saliva works only in a alkaline environment.
Fruit acids inhibit not only digestion of carbohydrates but also contribute to fermentation.
Don’t eat eggs and meat, nuts and meat, cheese and eggs or cheese and nuts, meat and milk, eggs and milk or nuts and milk and similar protein rich combinations of products in one meal.
The processing requires different digestive juices, each of which have different strengths, characteristics and time to enter the stomach.
Watermelon, honey-melon, muskatmelon and other melons must always be eaten separately from other dishes.
Melons shall not be digested when they are in the stomach with other foods.
Fat in combination with protein rich products.
Fats form a successful combination with starch, but the same cannot be said about fats and proteins - fats hinder the digestion of proteins.
Protein can be combined with very small amounts of fat.
If a large amount of protein-containing products is consumed, avoid taking fat completely.
This also applies to freshness - it is not recommended to combine large amounts of nuts (containing proteins) with whole avocados (containing fat).
Such a combination prevents effective weight reduction.
How do I prepare it better?
"Meet preparation, heat treatment causes a significant loss of nutrients - approximately 15% to 55% of the original nutrient composition of the products", says the dietologist.
In most cases nutrients go to loss by boiling foodstuffs in water.
However, the nutritional value of certain foods increases directly by boiling.
It is recommended that after cooking the remaining liquid is used for soup preparation - in this case you will not lose any nutrients left in the water and you will be able to eat them later.
It is recommended that vegetables are prepared, including steaming.
The heat treatment significantly increases the bioavailability of lycopene in tomatoes.
The amount of lycopene increases by 25% when co-administered with tomatoes for 30 minutes.
The heat treatment also significantly increases the bioavailability of becacarotin found in red, yellow, orange plants such as tomatoes, carrots, sweet potatoes and spinach.
The heat treatment of eggs and meat removes the natural characteristics of the proteins in them, making them more easily digestable.
Similarly, heat treatment of meat and eggs makes the iron and other mineral substances in this product more easily absorbed by the body.
It should also be borne in mind that freezing of products can reduce the amount of vitamin C from 10% to 90%, however the sweetening of fibre is not affected.
Beans in combination with tomatoes may increase iron intake in the body, which in turn ensures better brain and muscle function.
Our body hosts up to 33% less non-bloody iron, which can be found in plant products such as beans, leaf greens, cereal products, than bloody iron found in animal products such as beef, fish and chicken.
You can significantly increase the absorption of non-bloody iron in the body by taking products containing non-bloody iron together with vitamin C sources such as oranges, tomatoes and berries.
Vitamin C helps to change non-bloody iron so that our body absorbs it more easily.
Iron is needed for the production of haemoglobin that provides oxygen in the muscles and brain.
To obtain maximum benefit from salads, add healthy fat to them, such as olive or linseed oil.
When preparing the butterflies with a lasal, add to the rich lasimus or sardines of vitamin D, free-at-dose yogurt, which is a good source of calcium.
Vitamin D increases the amount of calcium absorbed in the gut and plays an important role in bone formation.
Oats (as well as other whole grain products) together with vitamin C sources such as strawberries, broths, caves and other fruits or berries help to stabilise cholesterol levels, as well as to avoid obstruction of arteries.
Snapchat’s “Anime” effect is criticised for asbestos-carrying
Snapchat's representatives say that this filter has been inspired by animation, but some commentators claim it is racistly insensitive.
With this lens effect Snapchat lets 150 million users daily change reality in a rather absurd way and play with their identity.
You can turn yourself into an pineapple, dog, or image that would fit in the painting of Roy Lichshtenstein.
Lens are fogy, image-distorting tools that generate more than 30 million transformed Selfies per day.
Any error shall quickly become public.
The effects of Snapchat’s lenses have already been criticised in the past, with the impression that the application promotes too blacknessy or bright skin shades as a standard of ideal beauty.
This week, new lens effects were published, allowing users to create hermits of eyes, teeth and round cheeks, and some critics described it as a racist Asian Asian cartoon – the “yellow sign”.
The question was also asked whether such contradictions did not show that the company had greater problems with diversity.
News and public failures broke out on Wednesday, when the expenditure on "The origin" and "Motherboard" announced that the effects of the lens had been removed from the app.
The company explained that the purpose of the lens was to portray the images of Anime rather than to hang people of Asian origin.
However, those who experienced racism were reminded of the painful stereotypes.
Others strongly denied the similarity with Anime.
Greek American art student Greissa Sparapani Twitter received a wide-ranging resonance on images. In her letter she says that the effects of the lens are "false and inconvenient, not to say any more."
She added that it was hard not to notice the apparent similarity between Asian cartoons and lens effects.
This suggests that the effect of the lens is not just yellow in the sense of face, but yellow in the sense of facial racism.
Snapchat is not the only company that has fallen into these cultural traps.
American culture is also involved in the endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from business meetings to Hollywood and the devices we use on a daily basis.
And Snapchat's great youth audience, which represents different races, unlike older people, is more sensitive to such things.
If Snapchat’s lenses create an image that offends users, then "in today’s days, such things are not overlooked," Katie Jou, who was 25 years old, expressed in an interview.
On Thursday, the Product Manager of Medium, Jou, deletes his Snapchat app and advised others to do the same.
In her article "Medium" and telephone interview, she explained that she felt that race problems are due to Snapchat's employment policy, which does not support racial diversity.
Jou criticised the management of the company, which consists mainly of white men and then concluded his article with reference #DeleteSnapchat.
"It means there is no racial diversity in the company, so such decisions are made. Whether there are some other racial representatives in the company, but they do not have such a position to be able to express their opinion safely and easily", says Chinese American Geno.
Others share her view, while Snapchat has not responded to her complaint.
The company does not disclose how many different races the employee represents, indicating that it is a private company.
Snapchat refused to discuss the origin of his employees, but the representative found that the company had hired a staff specialist who would concentrate on the representation of racial minorities in the company, which are not widely represented and will facilitate incorporation into the company.
In turn, Jou will not renew his Snapchat account, adding: "Interesting whether they really need more users like us to understand that it is not right."
The Congress Chamber declares that the military officers have amended the reports of the Islamic State.
In a statement published on Thursday, the Assembly Chamber points out that the representatives of the US Central Command have amended the reports depicting a war against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria much more optimistic than is actually the case.
The analysts of the Central Command intelligence service express their general satisfaction with the provisional report of the mission team established by the Armed Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the representatives of the Republic of the Republics of the Defence Sub-Committee, indicating that their leadership controlled the reports on American progress in the fight against the Islamic State.
The Central Command, known as Centcom, is a military base in Tampere, Florida, which oversees US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
Latest news about this report shows that intelligence reports approved by senior Centcom leaders reflect the US fight against terrorism more positively than is actually the case.
Ken Calvert, representative of the Republic of California, says: "Centcom's action is unacceptable - our soldiers are those who suffer if our policy makers receive false reports."
Centcom's management errors are found in the organization's senior management.
This 10-page long report reflects in detail the existing problems in the presentation and analysis of the Central Command on American efforts to prepare Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
Although this does not provide compelling evidence that the senior officials of the Obama administration were obliged to distort the reports, this shows that the management of Centcom has put pressure on analysts to illustrate a more optimistic view of the threats posed by the Islamic State (also known as ISIS or ISIL).
The report points out that in the first half of 2015, the press releases, statements and reports of the Central Government represented the situation significantly more positive than it was actually.
For example, Centcom’s representatives publicly announced that the Mosula recovery operation could start already in April or May 2015.
Mosula is the second largest city in Iraq, which is still under the control of Islamic State.
A representative of the Party of the Republic of Kansas, Mike Pompeo, says in his report: "A long inquiry of the Republic of Kansas shows this clearly."
Between mid-2014 and mid-2015, the main officials of the U.S. Central Administration amended their reports to represent the threat of ISIS in Iraq weaker than they were actually.
The Party of the Republic of Lithuania set up a working group to learn that analysts are concerned that information about the Islamic State is being distorted.
Further to the investigation, the report published on Thursday will be followed by new findings on the matter.
General Inspection of the Ministry of Defence carries out investigations into Centcom's intelligence activities.
On Thursday, the members of the Democratic Party of the Committee of Intelligence issued their own report in which they agreed to some of the conclusions of the working party of the Republican Party.
A representative of Democrats Adams B. Šifs says in his report that Centcom too restricted the preparation of intelligence assessments for ISIS and Iraqi security forces between 2014 and 2015.
Mr Schiff explains that this process "continued the dissemination of information", deteriorated the ethics of analysts' work and "distributed the facts that are not true."
But Shiff and the members of the Democratic Party added that there was no evidence that the White House had put pressure on Centcom analysts to draw up reports in line with the "pre-defined or political stance".
The Daily Beast published the preliminary results of the assembly investigation on Thursday.
In August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon general review initiated an investigation following complaints from Centcom analysts.
Commander Patrick Evans, a representative of the Pentagon, announced that Pentagon would not comment on the Congress Report until the investigation continued.
He also added that experts sometimes interpret complex data differently, and the Ministry of Defence and the intelligence agency calls for a constructive dialogue on vital issues of national security.
The investigation is not limited to whether the American-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is successful (a statement expressed by more and more representatives of the Ministry of Defence).
But last year's accusations call into question whether President Obama can fully rely on reports from the Central Government on military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and other hotspots.
The criticism of Islamic intelligence reminds us of more than ten years of events when Centcom's intelligence analyst Gregory Hocker published a study claiming that George V. Bush's Administration started Afghanistan's war, thinking too little about its possible consequences.
Hooker also played an important role in opening the Islamic State Intelligence.
Last year, the official representatives reported that the Hougher team discovered that, contrary to public reports, air flights to Islamic National Oil Plants had not significantly undermined the financial situation of the terrorist group, as they had built temporary plants to sell oil on the black market.
The Times of September reported that this discovery did not occur outside the central government walls.
At that time, Centcom's commander General Loid Ostin III received sharp criticism, as many lawmakers believed that war reports described the situation too positive.
In April, General Austin was on vacation and replaced by General Joseph L. Votels.
In the United States due to Britain, women in the field hockey wins the United States, thus gaining already fourth consecutive victory.
The day after the victory over Japan with a score of 6:1, Thursday Kathy Bama got the first two gates for the U.S. women's field hockey team, when the Americans won the Indian team with a score of 3:0.
Five gateways in two games are an unforgettable achievement, but a 27-year-old Bama said that she could not remember if she had ever done that.
She said, "I don't have any idea."
I am not from those people who count their gates.
But she knows that the result of the Americans in the Olympic Games is 4:0, which gives them their group undisputed Britain, which, on Thursday after winning Japan with the result of 2:0 remained unconvinced.
The UK and the US will meet on Saturday to play the last match in the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for a quarter of the finals and the game will determine which team will take the first place in the six team and which second.
The first winner will avoid a little longer a meeting with the strong Dutch selection, which is the second group leader.
Despite the failure of the Saturday game, Americans have already expressed their surprise by taking the last place between 12 teams in London four years ago.
The team also consisted of Bama.
She grew up in Blubel, the field hockey she first took hands at the age of 3 (their older twin sisters already worked with this sport in Dresel) and joined the national team when she was 16 years old, becoming a sample of the newest players in history.
She wasn't at the 2008 Olympics because she didn't get into the finals.
But the year 2012 was unsuccessful for her and her team.
The following year, English Craig Parham was appointed as a sample trainer and everything changed to the right side.
Bam called it "cultural, mental and physical change."
We did not invest as much in London as we do now.
We have changed everything completely.
In the Thursday game, Bama opened the result by getting the gates in the first half time with the rear of the bridge.
India started the game without victory in its account, but their selection was very strict and kept a minimum result of 0:1 until the end of the third period, when Bama repeatedly got the gates.
She took the ball in the anti-Acontinent zone on the left side of the field, then noticed to be on the middle of the field and send the ball in the enemy gate, putting the Americans in the direction of 2:0.
In the middle of the fourth period, Melissa Gonzalesa got another gate.
This was the first U.S. goalkeeper in Jackie Brigg's dry game with each of the first three games being launched on one of the gates.
She's gone.
And, like, Bam.
"We are currently going very well," said Paham, but just how good will show the game on Saturday.
The most depressing meal of the depression period is "Steam meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his election to the President, Franklin Delano Ruosevelt sat in the oval room to hold a meal.
President Roosevelt has tasted such fine culinary delicacy as a goose liver pastor, or fuagre, and Maryland turtles.
However, on that day his meal was much more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, potato slicer and a plum bottle in the dessert.
Jane Ziegelmane says, "It's a way to show solidarity in cooking with people who were very hard at work."
Her husband Andrius Kou adds: "It's also a message for Americans, as they should eat."
A couple from the Brooklyn Heights district are food historians.
The last book of kou "Dārņu Sautāju" describes Chinese cuisine in America, but Ziegelmane describes life through food for rent in Manhattan's eastern lower part of the house.
Their new joint work, "Seven Food," which will be published by Harper on Tuesday, is a story of American food during the great depression.
By showing some solidarity in cooking, they held a meal together by the reporters Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a simple lunch menu in the Flatiron region, which has been operating since 1929, when major depression began.
Ms. Ziegelmane, aged 54 years, ordered a sandwich with processed cheese and fried olives, while Ms. Kou, 57 years old, ordered salads for turkeys, potatoes, and vegetables.
When the reporter ordered counterfeit thiefs, the couple admitted that his choice was very appropriate for the conversation about the food of the Great Depression time.
Ms Ziegelmane said that the fake thief was very popular.
There was a peanut bunny, a liver bunny, and a bean bunny.
They were prepared from basic ingredients and other ingredients that enriched the meal.
Imagine how it is - eat as many peanuts as they would be at noon.
Mr. Cou got bored.
"Safely thought the belly was full of lead," he added.
In predepression, the American dinner table resembled a Swedish table, especially in rural areas.
Women were prepared to eat for their male workers and breakfast, lunch and dinner, freshly prepared spices were served.
During World War I it was Americans who sent Europeans food. The "Seal meal" described how the Americans adjusted to circumstances when America suddenly no longer had an abundance of land.
"At that time the food became the main focus of the American people on daily life," says Mr. Cou, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write on this subject.
The new budget's diets became equally important: unknown dishes such as fake brews and friezes became daily; scents were "a great way to use surpluses," noted Mrs. Ziegelmanes, because the chefs could hide the unattractive ingredients under the creamy sauce.
Fresh fruits were replaced by cheap dried fruits.
Meat, which has been the main ingredient of American meals for years, has now become an extremely rare luxury commodity.
When the number of calories and the nutritional value of food were more important than the taste, new, yet invisible forms were born.
In an ancient kitchen, Mrs Ziegelmane found a recipe for making onions filled with peanut butter.
Mr Kou adds: "It was not a popular supplement to the lunch table."
Mrs Ziegelmane says, "It was surreal."
Groundnut butter and snack onion is not compatible.
Many recipes for home foods applied to difficult times.
Household economists such as Louise Stanley, the Head of the Federal Bureau of the Household Economy from 1923 to 1943 set government eating habits that had not occurred before or after the Great Depression.
By publishing articles and recipes in newspapers and magazines, they advised householders to become "economics" and accept challenges such as converting pasta and carrot bread into a delicious meal.
"Sorry Maltīte" is a feast of historical charms.
It is particularly interesting to note the attitude of the government towards its hungry citizens, for example, President Herber Huuver 'allow me to eat cakes'.
Although in public, he spoke of his simple childhood and eating in Aiowa, he actually ate as a fine millionaire he had become.
Mr Cou says, "He liked the European cuisine, for example, a fish with a cucumber sauce."
He ate almost in a green guest room, wearing a half - day jacket.
He was completely separated from reality.
President Roosevelt would have made the same mistake if his wife Eleonora had not recommended him to set an example with his eating habits.
The book reports that Rūzvelt hired a housekeeper who didn't teach how to cook, so the White House became a place "where not only one of the most beautiful dishes in Washington was served, but also the worst prepared dishes."
As soon as the state economy recovers, most of the signatures of the era of depression disappeared.
But we continue to pay attention to Calories and nutrition, as well as to the use of science in cooking, added Mrs Ziegelmane.
A couple says that when writing the book, they gained a greater understanding of the mother’s eating habits of Ms. Ziegelmane, for example, why she was unable to throw out her food.
"She was really afraid to throw out the food," said Mr. Cou.
Mrs. Ziegelmane said, "She actually injured people."
Once, there was an incident with wind cones.
When we were at the Ashenberg Hall, a couple of writers pulled out a dessert made from a bag home: a plum pot that President Roosevelt used to eat at lunch.
"It's a plum foaming," said Mrs. Ziegelmane, adding that at that time it was a common habit of giving a chic name to modest dishes.
It has no foam, only dried plums, some flour, sugar, water, and cannula.
Everyone impatiently poured the spoons into the brown mass on the plates.
Surprisingly, it was not that bad.
Mr. Cou ate a few more couches.
Listening to an experienced "economicist", he said to his wife, "The handsome slice of grounded hazelnuts."
Gilead will receive reimbursement for legal expenses in the fight against Merck for Hepatitis C patent
The district judge has decided that "Gilead Sciences Inc." is entitled to reimbursement of expenses incurred by legal professionals in proceedings for the termination of the hepatitis C patent against the pharmaceutical company "Merck & Co Inc."
In June, Gilead was justified in the case of a fine of GBP 200 million for two Merck patents that threatened it with the successful Sovaldi and Harvoni tablets, when the US federal judge found violations in Merk’s activities, such as the taking of oaths and other non-ethical acts.
During the hearing on Thursday, the U.S. district judge Bet Labson Frimen pointed out that Gilead had the right to claim compensation for legal expenses incurred in defence of the case.
Merck tries to get a position on the market against Gilead, which dominates the market with a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that are effective in 90% of liver diseases.
The case was started already in 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other in an attempt to acquire ownership of newly developed active ingredients in sofosbuvir, which is the main ingredient of Gilead medicines.
The U.S. supported forces claim that they have taken full control of the city of Manbidja from the Islamic State.
The U.S. supported forces took full control of the northern part of the town of Manbidja, near the border of Turkey, and the last Islamic State soldiers left the city, announced on Friday by a representative of the group.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDS) are currently cleaning the city from the last enemy fighters who have not yet left the city.
They have released more than 2,000 hostages-civil people who had been hit by the fighters, news agency Reuters said to Sharfan Darvis from the Manbidge Military Council, a member of the SDS.
"The city is now fully under our control and we are looking for fighters," he informed the agency Reuters.
In 2015, Clinton's income reached 10.75 million dollars and the couple paid 34.2 percent of the federal tax rate.
On Friday, Hilary Clinton published a 2015 tax return showing that the candidate for President of the Democratic Party and her husband had earned $ 10.75 million this year and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
During 2015, the Clintons donated USD 1 million, mainly to their Clinton Charity Organization. Former President Bill Clinton earned about $5.3 million in his capacity as Spyker and former Secretary of State earned $3 million from his book on work in the State Department, published in collaboration with Simon & Schuster.
Clinton Election Society - the Senator of the U.S. Virginia State Tim Kein and his wife Anna Holton have published their tax return for the last 10 years.
In 2015, they paid a federal tax rate of 20,3 per cent.
"Hilary Clinton and Tims Kein continue to set new standards for financial transparency," said Mrs.Jenifera Palmieri, partner of the Clinton campaign in his communication.
On the other hand, Donald Tramps conceal a variety of excuses and reservations so that promises to disclose their tax information should not be honoured.
Publicising paid tax information is a record practice for US presidential candidates, but it is not required by law.
The New York businessman Tramps and his lawyers mention the audit of the State Revenue Service as a reason not to disclose tax information.
"Your move", in his Twitter entry, announced the tax information of the Democratic Party candidate, by Ian Sams, partner of the Clintone campaign.
On Thursday, the special advisor to Trampa, Michael Kohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trampam to disclose tax information before the audits had been completed.
Trampa critics, including Mits Romnie and other Republicans, as President of the Party of the Republic of 2012 claim that his refusal raises questions about his real property amounts, donations amounts and other business commitments, including commitments with Russia.
On Friday, Clinton poured down oil fire by publishing a video, where several influential Republicans demand Tramps to publish their tax information.
She returned to this issue again during her economic talk on Thursday in Michigan.
She said to the crowd: "He refuses to do what other presidential candidates have done for several decades."
“Polytico” says that during the 1990s, Tramps had paid very little or no tax for two years, and on Friday, the author of the New York Times business column told us that many bookkeepers and lawyers thought that nothing had changed today.
Federal tax rates are an important issue in this presidential election.
The Clinton, in support of Varena Baffeta's proposal, promotes the idea that anyone who earns more than $1 million a year must pay a tax of at least 30%.
This proposal is also supported by President Obama.
Last week, Buffet called for the exchange of tax returns in Omaha, Nebraska, where his “Berkshire Hathaway” conglomerate is also present.
Baffet said that he was also audited by the Revenue Service and Tramps was afraid of voters rather than tax authorities.
The Clinton campaign has published tax information until 2007.
The Clintons now live in Chad, New York and have paid an average federal tax rate of around 32 per cent between 2007 and 2014 and a total tax rate of around 40,5 per cent.
The 2015 Clinton Tax Review shows that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income is wage.
Their main investment was a low cost index fund, from which Clinton's dividends received $109,000.

Jewish film director criticises the hotel in Berlin for disabling Israel's far-reaching code at the request of an Arab - RT News
The French film director of Jewish origin has created a storm in social media, when he discovered that there is no Israeli code of distance conversations at Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin.
Klod Lancman, director of the documentary on the Holocaust Shoah, did not hide his dissatisfaction with the Berlin Kempinski Bristol hotel and addressed an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his recent visit, Lancman tried to find the Israeli long-stay code on the list offered by the hotel.
However, this country was not included in the list of countries to which you can call directly from the hotel number.
How is it possible that in 2016, in Berlin, the capital of New Germany, Israel has been blocked and destroyed?
It's Lancman.
Instead, the "Campinski Bristol" hotel offers to call the country through its call center.
Director requested an explanation from hotel staff.
Lanzman writes that the answer he received was shocked.
The hotel administrator explained that "it was a conscious hotel management decision".
The reason why the code was taken was even more frustrating the film director.
"The vast majority of guests are Arab and they asked for Israel's code deletion," Lancman quotes the hotel employee's explanation.
Suddeutsche Zeitung tells us that the Israeli ambassador to Germany, Jakov Hadas-Handelsman, has called this case a "great shame."
We are surprised and shocked about this incident.
The same thing is a great shame in itself.
And the fact that this is exactly the case in Germany is precisely this hotel network with even more humiliation.
No explanation required.
The official said, "We hope the hotel will draw the right conclusions".
This event has also gained quite broad resonance on the Internet, where people described it as a scandal.
Others believe that Kempinski's hotel is simply designed for Arab customers.
Another record said "fuck you", indicating that the hotel is next to the synagogue on the Kurfurstendam street.
The edition of Der Spiegel tells us that the hotel itself has quickly rejected all of the charges, declaring that it is all "confident" and apologised to Lancman.
"We have not received a direct order to remove Israel from the list of national numbers," quotes the representative of Kempinski, Suddeutsche Zeitung.
And add that the code has again been added to the list.
The police use rubber bullets and tear gas against protesting Brazilian students.
The student and police conflict took place on Thursday in the city of São Paulo in Brazil, where the students gathered in a demonstration against the reforms of the government education system.
The police used rubber bullets and tear gas against students.
The problems began when the law officials tried to shoot students, resulting in police use of rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students participated in the event to show their dissatisfiedness with the reforms of the education system.
The proposal of the São Toméan Governor Geraldo Alckmin is to close almost 100 public schools, while 300 000 students will be transferred to other schools with a view to saving funds.
Some demonstrators drew graffiti on the walls with messages against the interim president Michael Temer.
This protest took place only a few days after the previous protest, when the students gathered in demonstrations with a view to expressing their support for the suspended President, Dilma Rousef, who was voted for by the Senate.
Scott Kelms Skinner finish first, bringing the golden medal to the United Kingdom during cycling
Kelm Skinner from Scotland finished the first men's cycling team banged in the race on Rio cycle, which took place last night. The British team guarded its champion's title, which it won in the 2012 London Games.
A 23-year-old sportsman from Glasgow played an important role in this race, making a proud legendary Scottish Scout of Ser Cris Hoy and leading a victory for the favorites of New Zealand.
Four years ago, Britain won an amazing victory when Hoi won the fifth of his six medals of Olympic gold.
And they also repeated it at the World Championship in London, although Hoy had already finished his career as a sportsman.
The problems were in the stage between Beijing and London Olympics because they had to replace the experienced start specialist Jamie Stafu.
They did it at the last moment.
When Hoy went, he tried to fill Kian Emadi and Matt Krumton.
Britain’s coaches put hope on Skinner, seeing potential in him, which he later proved.
Hinde, Kany, champions who four years ago started together with Hoy and Skinner who set up the record of Olympic qualifications, but the better start of the race was New Zealand team
However, the British trio obtained gold medals.
In his circle, the Hindes had been invading, and Katniss took the lead, and Skinner took care of that command.
The change of strategy played an important role in victory, as Hindes driven with more gear to allow Kenya and Skinner to drive faster.
Hoy's race was seen as a BBC representative and caught the eyes of Skinner, Kenya and Hindes at the moment they climbed to the fair.
The 23-year-old glasshouse said, "It was an irrefutable honor."
I'm doing my best to defend my name.
The finals we set up the Olympic record and won the World champions.
It was just incredible.
There's no better win.
After winning with Kenya and Hoy in the 2012 Olympics in London, Hindes confessed that intentional fell on track after the unsuccessful start.
Later, he rejected this comment and the British competitors could not prove the opposite.
There were no such incidents this time.
Hindes said, "The British flags recalled London in the tribunals."
Over the last 3 months, we have become a united team.
We have lost so many World Championships, so victory in the Olympic Games really was special.
One medal will race for a country that received seven out of ten gold medals during cycling in Beijing and London.
If this achievement is a team progress indicator over the last five months, then the next five days will be very exciting.
Given the result of Kenya, he could indeed repeat Hoya's success by obtaining three Olympic gold medals.
For Kenya, this would mean six stolen gold and one silver medal. In addition, Katniss was born on March 23 (it seems to be the holy day of the British people, because in that day Steve Regreivs, Mo Farahs and Roger Banisters were also born).
He was also born on that date.
The next race of Kenya is the strike, which starts today and will continue for the next three days.
A 28-year-old sportsman from Bolton said: "Now I'm just enjoying it.
The team trip is always the best.
Because then you can win with your teammates.
If it's fair, it's just a little alone to win."
Hindes said, "If he gets two more gold medals, he should be put in the rank of a gunman."
That day it was the only fight for medals, but it was not the only good news for Britain.
Sir Bredley Vigins, Ed Clensey, Steve Burk, and Ovein Doul showed the fastest qualification period for four kilometers to be brought to four.
Their time was 3:51.943
The world record, which was installed in London in 2012, is 3:51.659.
The first round and final will take place today in the second half of the day, where Vigins will certainly be at the heart of attention.
Yesterday before his qualification trip, he had a disagreement with the Commissioner when judges called him to measure his height.
A woman drive that will continue and end today, Laura Trota, Joan Rovsela Shanda, Elinor Barkere and Katie Archibald from Milan set up a new record time of 4:13.260.
The British delegation hopes that the British cycling team will fight medals in the middle of the Olympic Games in the hope.
Recalling the outstanding and unprecedented performance in Beijing and London, everyone expects the same achievements as Rio.
In the meantime, after accusations of sexuality and respect, technical director Shein Saton resigned, and Hojs and Victoria Bendletona also completed their career.
However, starting with the first cycle race, it seems that Britain will always reach its highest level at the right time.
The future of the Portland Cup is becoming uncertain, as an ambitious agreement has been terminated.
The future of aluminium cupboards and hundreds of its employees in Portland, Victoria has become unclear, as its main customer, the energy company, has announced the termination of cooperation.
This Communication is based on the plans of the Victorian Government to stop subsidising the energy company, which is vital for the company to continue its work.
The 20-year subsidies will be suspended in November.
As a result, more than 2000 jobs at the Alkoa Portland plant are at risk.
Up to 2000 direct and indirect jobs could be at risk.
In addition, it will also have unpredictable side effects, as the melting plant consumes about 10 percent of all Victoria’s electricity supply.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry’s melting facility, which led to an interruption in the coal-fired power plant.
Alkoas Portlanda cupboard works with losses and can be closed.
These events were caused by a number of years of speculation about the rise in the value of the Australian dollar and the cost of production of the factory.
AGL, a factory energy supplier that supplies energy from its “Loy Yang A” plant in Latroubes Ieleja, says that it is likely that the other three owners will terminate their contracts as well.
Most of the power plant is owned by the Alcoa and Alumia Joint Undertaking; in addition, the company also owns China's CITIC holding companies and Japan's Marubeni Corp holding companies.
"AGL" hopes to continue operating on the Portland plant, which would mean a further energy supply to the pipeline," said its representative.
“AGL” informed that contracts are so-called “risk-limiting contracts” that will come into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a validity of 12 months and will therefore remain in force until 2017.
"AGL" plans to receive revenue from these contracts also in the fiscal year 2017," said the company's representative.
The potential effects on profit from the tax year 2018 are limited by favourable market forecasts for future wholesale electricity prices.
AGL claims that in its forecasts, losses of USD 187 million have already been estimated, with the assumption that these contracts will be terminated.
Alcoa states that the decision to terminate the contracts will not affect Alcoa’s ability to continue operating or to supply energy.
The U.S. company reports that in 2010 it concluded a contract with Loy Yang for 20 years, but in November it will be terminated.
The analysts have expressed concern both about the possible closure of the Portland Cup in Victoria and about the closure of the Tomago factory near New York due to the weak economics of the industry.
The Executive Director of AGL, Steven Mikelson, said last week that according to analysts estimates, 600 megawatts and tomago 900 megawatt energy were used in the course of the Portland year.
If both of these plants were to exit the energy market, the demand for energy would be significantly reduced.
And that wouldn't be good at all.
The Community legal centre rejects 160 000 people each year.
Every year, more than 160 000 people's demands are rejected, and as the budget falls, the situation could get worse.
Three out of five people in Queensland - mostly pensioners, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those who do not have the means to combat illegal exodus - are denied free legal assistance and representation.
The Community legal centre, which is already overstated, warns that, as funding falls, the situation will only become worse.
As of June next year, these legal centres will receive 30% less funding than they have so far.
James Farrell, Director of the Queensland Legal Center, said that the latest report of the National Judicial Centers Association says that thousands of people in need are being refused legal aid at the moment.
Mr Farel pointed out that if this decision is not repealed, the situation will only become worse.
He also says: "The Queensland legal centre constantly receives insufficient funding, which means that thousands of people in need are refused aid."
People trying to put an end to violent relations, people with deep debts, families experiencing divorce, workers who are unfairly dismissed - all of these people have legal problems and this report shows that they do not receive the necessary assistance.
As of June 2017, the federal government will reduce its funding by 30 per cent, which means that several thousand more people in Queensland will have to deal with their complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on the general prosecutor and the Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately stop reducing funding so that people in need of legal aid can get it.
Last year, the government opened its plans to raise the level of legal aid to the national average.
Now is the time to also address the needs of local communities and their customers and to invest in this important area by the Palazčuk Government.
Donald Trampa campaign was sued by the court, because one of the employees has pulled out a firearm
New York: Donald Trump's organization has been sued by the court because they have not taken action to get information that its North Carolina Operation Commander has turned a gun against a staff member when they drive in one car in February.
This incident was described in the court claim lodged on Wednesday at the Sharlote court by Vincent Brongi - a former programmer of the campaign.
The brothers said that he had waited months for the initiation of the internal review of the case, but understood that this would not happen.
Leader Earl Filipe "has pulled out his gun, put his right index finger on the head, and turned a stop to Vincent's knee," Brondi claims in his complaint.
He also claimed that when he submitted complaints to the local and regional leadership of the campaign, Brehdi learned that at least four more people had experienced the same.
"Irons don't have to shoot to make a loss," says Brendy in his complaint.
Just two days before this case was presented, the presidential candidate made a scandal on the post of President, declaring to people that "The Second Amendment People", i.e. arms owners and enthusiasts, could act if the election were to win his rival Hilary Clinton and his elected judges.
Trampa’s campaign announced that the media had wasted his words from the context, and he never put anyone on the verge of violence.
The leaders are willing to recover compensation from the campaign organisers for permissive supervision, but from Philips for the attack, the use of illegal weapon and the creation of emotional stress.
Trampa’s representative, Houta Hixa, did not comment immediately.
I'm not able to get in touch with Philips.
WCCB - Charlote's local news agency tells us that Philip has recently abandoned the campaign.
Nor has he managed to call his consultancy firm "Innovative Consulting Services".
The presidential candidate for the Party of the Republic of Lithuania, Donald Tramps, has carried out a controversial election campaign.

A new tradition - the parish and sports festival in Ķūļciems.
On Saturday, for the first time in Kūļciems, people gathered for the parish and sports festivals.
Ten years after the celebration, it was decided that Ezer’s festival would no longer be held.
A new page has now been changed.
The day started with sports competitions.
This time the competitions were not traditional and too serious, because, for example, the shoots had to be thrown to the lying target, the boot fly, the man's left hand throw, the bombing has not been in any Olympic game at all.
However, each member could show how strong, courageous, successful, and reflective he was.
After sports, everyone gathered in open-air aesthetics, where the parish festival started.
In the meantime, there was also a "children's corner" where the little could get out in the inflatable attractions and get a new image in the shadows.
A new one that could also become a tradition was a driver’s parade, both for tractors and for motorcycles.
All were approached by Inga Kadike-Skadiņa, the head of the administration of Kūļciems municipality, who wanted a nice rest and a dry time, but the rain did, however, bowed down, but it couldn't disturb much.
The festival continued with the welcome of the younger people of Ķūļciems.
Indeed, it is good that the parish has expanded with five girls and one boy.
With their performances, the fans had come to amateur art collectives from Engure region – the audience enjoyed the performances of the seniorian dance group Rudens rhythms, the performers of the dances of different nations Redas and the Golden Pearl of Youth dancers.
And that's nothing about the wet scene that one might have slipped.
Of course, local folks and visitors were delighted by the famous actress duet Jānis Jarāns and Dainis Porgants, who were once again Mildiņš Nabiņa and Ekslitīte Krāniņa, as well as Berzciems' attractive wives from fishermen's house "Dieniņa".
Ball was played by the group "Bruģis".
The United Kingdom needs to maintain the Olympic spirit and extend the Hittrov.
Hetrova will not only promote prosperity and growth in local regions and London, but also throughout the country.
This, in my opinion, makes Hetrov very attractive, as in 2012 in London, where we invested huge amounts of work, so that all regions of the country would benefit from the Olympic Games.
Stratford and Truthend gained a huge amount from the Olympics.
And we will do this again by providing local people and businesses with business opportunities near Hetrov.
We will create 10,000 new business opportunities for local communities alone, 40 000 new jobs and finally put an end to youth unemployment in the neighbourhood of Heathrow.
As in London Olympics in 2012, there will be people who will consider this challenge to be too big and that the enlargement of Heathrow is too ambitious.
At that time, people said that Britain would never succeed in preparing for the Olympic Games and that it would be a global outrage.
The skeptics were wrong for 2012, and in the case of Hetrow too, they will not be right.
There are always obstacles that need to be overcome, but Hetrow has so far overcome everything.
Like the Olympic Games, Hitrova is an infrastructure project that will benefit the whole society and not individuals alone.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs, with economic growth of 211 billion, creating soil for both employment and experience at the airport and throughout the UK.
Hetrov has a great team that has created an infrastructure investment programme worth 11 billion, with time and budget running from Terminal 5, which has been named the best airport terminal in the world for five years and finally with Terminal 2, which has been built between the two more intensive runways in the world.
Now they are ready to create a third runway, which will be financed with private investment worth GBP 16 billion.
The London Olympics 2012 was a great success, and I am sure that will be the enlargement of Hitrov.
The time has come to revive the Olympic spirit and to expand Hittrov by ensuring the future of our trade and creating a new employment environment with which Britain could be proud.
Lord Paul Deitton is a member of the Board of Hitrov and former Secretary of Commercial Affairs of the Ministry of Economic Affairs.
In Switzerland, a woman goes to the highway trying to commit suicide.
In the cool middle of the night, he got up to the highway.
The police are trying to find witnesses for an accident when on Thursday morning, a number of cars crossed over the highway.
The accident took place on Thursday at midnight on the A1 road near the Vo Canton of the city of Morges.
The Vo Canton police report says that when she desperately wanted to commit suicide, she had learned on the road in the dark, where several cars had taken her.
The victim, a 49 - year - old Swiss, was in contact with several cars, including a heavy car, in a clear attempt to kill himself.
She died at the scene.
Several of the drivers involved in the accident have already given evidence, but others have not yet been identified, says the police, which calls for references to the drivers and witnesses involved.
A criminal investigation has also been initiated in the case, which is a logical step, by lawyer Gilles Hofstellers told Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it is not yet known whether any of the drivers involved will be punished.
Was it possible to avoid collisions?
Hoffsteller adds, "The prosecutor will understand this."
Two similar cases that have occurred over the last 5 years show that none of the drivers will be held accountable.
In both cases, the pedestrian had gone to the highway in the middle of the night, so it was decided that drivers could not expect a pedestrian to be on the highway in the middle of the night.
Last year, a police officer was justified to kill indecently, when in August 2014 she left a man who was lying in the middle of the night on the A1 road near Paijerne.
The Court found that the 22 - year - old victim had drunk and then noticed falling asleep on the road.
The Court concluded that the policeman on his way to the accident site went in an appropriate manner and the judge acknowledged that the man lying on the road was "a totally unpredictable and extraordinary case".
Anyone who has information about a Thursday accident near Morges is invited to contact the police by phone 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 44.
Online to collect signatures for the organisation of a new SRS manager’s competition.
The petition portal "Avaaz.org" launched the collection of signatures to organise a competition for the new Head of State Revenue Service (SID).
In a petition addressed to the Ministers of the National Association (NA) and the Greens/farmers Union (ZZS), the public wants a transparent and professional process of nomination of officials.
The petition was created on 10 August and is currently signed by 55 people.
Inga Koļegova nomination process shall be transparent and non-professional.
This reflects the best functional traditions of the Soviet Union.
It discredits public administration and once again makes society hope in government and politicians.
"A competition with clear criteria is needed, against which all candidates must be assessed," says the text of the petition.
Its author Jānis B. has pointed out that there are no known criteria for a post selected by Koļegova.
Nor is it clear what candidates have to do in the work of the SRS.
The inquiry indicated that the National Registry should create a new open competition, where professional candidates are actively addressed, staff selection specialists are attracted and appropriate remuneration is offered.
The Minister of Finance, Dana Reizniece-Ozola, formally nominated the head of the Koļegovs SRS last week; this week the government was intended to approve him for his new post, but all the ministers of the "Unit" party voted against, so the question of the week was postponed.
Samoilov: If we lost, so I played bad.
Beach volleyball Alexander Samoilov and Jānis Šmēdiņš hoped for the prize at the Rio Olympics, but without coming to it there is no difference where to close the competition, after leaving the tournament Samoilov said.
One of the world's most powerful beach volleyball couples on Thursday sub-groups held a final and decisive game with 1-2 (16:21, 22:20, 7:15) lost the Brazilian Evandr Gonsalveš Oliveir and Pedro Solberg Salgada, concluding their participation in the fourth year's most important sport forum.
Latvian athletes won one victory in three sub-groups, but the same ratio was two more.
The ratio of small points between three pairs was then counted, which was the most favourable for Latvia's duet after the convincing loss in this match.
"In the first-six we were led, but from 16:15 it also remained on 16 points", the play was remembered by the Smaid.
I don't even know how we left the rest of the set with no points.
You can't play it.
Then, in the second-six, everything was in order and at the end of the set was able to break the game, and it had to be a good foundation for the third-six as well.
It was the same, but after we exchanged the parties, the result grew only for one team.
We had too many mistakes in the attack.
In the subgroup, all teams were similar, almost all the match had three faces, so the important was the small points.
"It was possible to play a little more like that than to give up 3-4 points in a row," said the sportsman.
We knew Evandra could be set up.
"In the first set, we met with it, we put 1-2 points, and in the third one at +4 he already left the game," the Chesser remembered.
We tried to show the best game.
I did, I did not.
I did not see the situation before the match, but it was known that as little points as possible.
"If we lose, so I play bad," Samoilov said.
We were waiting for a good service from Evandru, and in the first six, we also got pretty good, but in the third, he opened the service and it was difficult to attack.
On the other hand, I made a lot of mistakes at the Pedro service, but I had to deal with it.
Samoilov told us that, contrary to the previous match, the athletes were not nervous today.
"We went, we played, the protection was, but we needed a better service," said the sportsman.
"They were good at play, and in the end they already came to "urror".
Before the tournament, we said immediately that the soze was inconvenient as it might have been.
We also had the chance to fight for the first place, but we were not even out of the group.
"All of us expected a medal and we also did ourselves, but then there is no difference - 25th place or fourth place," said Samoilov, who predicted that the duet will continue to play together in the future as well.
I think that there will be no question and we will continue to play together, because this is only one tournament.
Samoilov, in Rio de Janeiro, was already a career in the third Olympic game, because in 2008 he started up with Martin Pleav in Beijing, but four years ago in London, he played with Ruslan Sorokin.
In the meantime, Smaid was the second start in Olympics.
"Latvenergo" follows the process of opening up the gas market from the position of a potential trader.
The state energy company "Latvenergo" follows the process of opening the gas market from the position of the consumer as well as potential trader, said the press secretary of the company Ivita Bidere.
"The decision on whether or not Latvenergo will join the gas market in the future as a trader will determine what gas market model and regulatory framework will be created."
"We are therefore actively involved in the creation and commentation of laws and submit our proposals," said Bidere.
The Agency BNS has already written that the Ministry of Economics (EM) in cooperation with the Public Service Regulatory Commission and the Energy Company "Latvijas Gāze" has drafted the Cabinet Regulations Project "Traffic Regulations for the Sale and Use of Natural Gas" which will change the existing principles of the operation of the natural gas market, providing natural gas users with the right to freely choose a natural gas trader from 3 April 2017.
In its work on the new regulation of the natural gas market, the EM aims to make the natural gas trading process as simple and user-friendly as possible.
Therefore, as the most efficient and user-friendly service solution, a "trader central model" has been chosen where all activities related to customer service are provided by the trader - one contract, one invoice and one information provision and customer service point, leaving technical issues to the distribution system operator.
A similar solution is currently being implemented in electricity trading.
It is recalled that there is a gradual opening of the market for household users - even after 3 April 2017, those household customers who do not want to choose another natural gas trader will be able to continue to receive natural gas from the existing trader at a regulated price, thus becoming a related user.
"In such a case, the obligation to supply natural gas to connected users at a regulated price has been imposed on the public trader", informed the Ministry.
On the other hand, operators will have to choose a natural gas trader with which a natural gas trade contract is to be concluded.
Prior to the conclusion of the contract for the sale of natural gas, operators of natural gas will be provided with the former natural gas trader at a fixed price.
The Cabinet Regulations Project details the rights and obligations of the natural gas dealer, system operator and users.
The rules shall lay down the arrangements for the supply and disposal of natural gas to users, the requirements for the safe use of the natural gas system, the rights and obligations of the trader, the public trader, the system operator, the user and the owner of the gasified facility; the arrangements for payment of payments for the services received, the interest of delay, the procedure for changing traders and the supply of natural gas to related users; the arrangements for the supply of natural gas to related users by the public trader.

Minister: It is planned next week to judge the increase in the salaries of the Director-General of the SRS.
Minister of Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola (Union of Greens and Farmers (ZZS)) plans next week to talk with Prime Minister Maris Kučinski (ZZS) and Government coalition partners about the increase in the remuneration of the Director-General of the State Revenue Service (VID).
Reizniece-Ozola indicated to journalists on Friday that the question of increasing the salaries of the Director-General of the SRS should be addressed urgently in order to make this post more attractive to potential candidates for re-enquisition.
Also next week, we have talked about changing the terms of the tender.
The Minister also stressed that she did not think of a particular candidate to be asked to take up a vacant post.
At the same time, Reizniece-Ozola took the view that Inga Koļegova, the Head of State Environmental Service, would have been a good Director-General of SRS.
On the other hand, with regard to the current duties of the Head of the SRS, Daci Beijing, who expressed his readiness to apply for this post, the Minister reiterated his view that the new Director-General of SRS should have a "side view" and should not come from the SRS structure.
She also stressed that she was waiting for the Saeima to return from the holiday to take the legislative amendments necessary for the reorganisation of the SRS as soon as possible.
The Agency BNS has already stated that Inga Koļegova, head of the State Environmental Service, presented an application to Dana Reizniece-Ozola (ZZS), which withdrew its nomination for the post of Director-General of the SRS.
In her application, she said that it was not an easy choice, but in the last two weeks her relatives have been under serious emotional pressure, although they have not carried out any legal acts.
Kolegova also pointed out that the discussion of her candidacy has increased among the opposing coalition parties, which is also unacceptable.
It has also been reported that Inara Petersone, Director-General of the previous SRS, left office at the end of June.
Oil prices continue to rise; exchange indices are increasing in the US and Europe, as well as the value of the US dollar.
Oil prices in the world continue to rise on Friday morning, with investors' mood having a positive impact on the statements made by the Saudi Arabian Minister for Oil Affairs, which reinforces the expectation that the biggest oil winners will act at the forthcoming OPEC meeting in September to stabilise the world oil market.
The three main US stock exchange indices have reached record levels on Thursday, which have not been observed since 1999.
The main positive factor in the market was the increase in the price of oil and the strong financial performance of a number of large companies.
The rise in oil prices and the strong financial performance of a number of companies on Thursday also led to an increase in European stock exchange indices.
The value of the US dollar rose on Thursday against the euro, against the British pound and against the Japanese yen.
In the electronic trading of the New York Stock Exchange, the WTI mark of crude oil price for deliveries on Thursday of September increased by 1.78 US dollars to 43.49 dollars per barrel.
The price of crude oil of the Brent in October increased by 1,99 dollars on the London Stock Exchange to 46,04 dollars per barrel.
The turnover of the conservative producer "Blue Lagoon" is falling by 33.8% last year.
The turnover of the conservative producer Blue Lagoon last year was €4.22 million, which is 33.8% less than the year before, while the company's losses fell by 5.7 times - to €90.7 thousand, according to the annual financial statement published in the Lursoft database.
According to the company's management report, in 2015 the company worked with losses due to a number of reasons, including the persistent lack of working capital, caused by the withdrawal of Unicredit Bank from the Baltic market, leaving the credit line previously in force, leaving the Blue Lagoon with concluded contracts without being able to execute them.
Consequently, the company did not have sufficient funds to buy cheaper raw materials in large volumes and to obtain a discount on the volume.
The withdrawal of the relevant bank from the Latvian market also prevented the company from implementing European Union structural funds support projects, which would have allowed the company to acquire new production equipment and upgrade the infrastructure.
Similarly, the company's financial indicators in the past year were negatively influenced by the rise in raw material prices and the customer's unwillingness to pay more for the goods produced by the company.
"Only in the second half of July 2016, customers recognized price changes and were willing to purchase goods at the new - highest - prices", says the company's management.
Also in 2015 Blue Lagoon started discussions with potential investors, including the assessment of company's movable and immovable property.
Investors have already been at the company's largest creditor "Unicredit Leasing", where the parties have met and discussed possible investment plans.
At the same time, the implementation of the restructuring and optimisation plan launched in 2014 and 2015 had a positive impact on the company’s performance and development.
This plan included improving and optimising the technological processes, allowing for higher production productivity and capacity.
"A number of equipment that provides a higher speed of production was purchased," the company's management pointed out.
The Blue Lagoon management notes that the equipment purchased in 2016 will allow the company to execute orders that were not yet possible.
The first batch of products to be produced on this equipment will be ready in August.
As the intention protocols on sales of the product have already been signed, all output will be sold in accordance with the intention protocols.
The new product will increase turnover by around 300 thousand euros per month", says the company's management.
Also, in August 2016, the company plans to sign a cooperation agreement on supplies of fish products to Iraq.
The Blue Lagoon in 2016 has sent the first experimental container to Israel, expanded the market to Cyprus, and will sign a cooperation agreement with a new supermarket chain in the USA this September.
As a result of all of the above measures, the company plans to increase turnover.
In 2014, Blue Lagoon worked with a turnover of EUR 6.347 million and a loss of EUR 5.113 million.
Blue Lagoon was founded in 1997 and its share capital is EUR 1,156 million.
The company belongs to two Latvian private individuals - Mihailam Kaidanov (89.11%) and Igor Shirshona (10.89%).
Welcome to pl. 15 near the museum to wait for a movie dujos Zāra Leanderi and participate in the press conference.
Riga can be seen as the beginning and inspiration of Zar Leander’s godly cinema dunes.
The visit of Zāra Lendere to the intersection of Ruth, who was a Swedish ambassador to Latvia, turned out to be fateful in Riga in 1924 because it was she that discovered the unusual low contract she tried to draw to the theatre scene in Riga.
Perhaps the accident in Riga became the fateful turning in the creative way of Zar to the world famous.
Riga Zara Leandere was associated with warm memories, and she hoped to come to Riga in guest shows, but unfortunately these hopes were not to be fulfilled, as World War II started.
Using the form of the performance, this meeting will be possible at Riga's holidays 2016 and a great Ieva Kerēvica will feel in the outstanding role of Zāra Leandere.

The insurer shall pay compensation to the passengers of the air carrier cancelled on Wednesday.
If Insurance paid a reimbursement for a family for the cancellation by an air carrier at Riga Airport on Wednesday, 10 August, which led to the refusal of the planned music festival visit.
On 11 August, an application for reimbursement was received from a customer.
The family had planned to go to the music festival in Belgium, but since this was not possible due to the cancellations at the airport on Wednesday, the customer had been charged a compensation for the booking of accommodation that could no longer be cancelled, as well as for the purchase of the festival tickets amounting to EUR 204.
On the other hand, the money spent on air tickets to customers has promised to be reimbursed by the airline.
If Insurance of all travel insurance compensations on average 15% of cases has paid compensation for interruption or cancellation of travel.
"At these times, expenses are reimbursed for the purchase, return or exchange of tickets, as well as for booking of accommodation," says Dagnija Rutka, the Head of Insurance Risk Insurance Product.
As we know, on the evening of 10 August a private aircraft stopped at Riga Airport due to technical problems of the runway, so only several departing flights were cancelled, but several incoming flights had to be transferred to other airports.
Because of the village repair, the man is at ruined ceilings and forced to leave the house.
The 4th studio of the LTV programme called Dmitry Saddjašev, whose neighbor has started the capital repairs in his apartment, and since then Dmitry has been on the ceiling of the house with no confidence that being in the apartment is safe.
The problem is that my neighbours carried out an arbitrary construction and my apartment has damaged its ceiling.
Then I inform the Riga Building Board, the House Manager and other organizations.
The Building Board said that we are not any operational service and we have no experts.
"The owner of the law must go to the Latvian Engineering Union, and from there there there will be an expert," says Dmitry.
The guest expert arrived, recorded what had happened, and admitted that the cover was not in a satisfactory condition.
However, since the first application of Dmitry on the building board last month, so no one could answer until the beginning of this week if the presence in the apartment is not life threatening.
On the building board said - this is legislation, wait if you are not satisfied, write to everyone in turn.
"Then I wrote to the Riga City Council, but they sent the house manager, then the house manager again to the construction board, and then there is a deadlock," says Dmitry.
After examining the whole pile of paper, it is clear that the construction work is stopped, sometime you can hear that someone works there.
In another two months' time, an expert has to be carried out and in six months' time, the owner of the apartment who carries out the repairs must eliminate all these defects.
The independent expert has developed his opinion, but the building board considers it incomplete and superficial.
The expert has not indicated whether an existing metal grid is affected by the design, and therefore it is not certain that the lower owner of the apartment is in danger.
"So we have requested further clarification from this expert", says Ilze Žūka, representative of the Riga City Council.
Despite the ban on making any repairs in the upper apartment, it is still heard from there that construction continues.
The non-construction penalty for arbitrary construction is between 70 and 700 euros, but in the specific case it may be much more severe.
While an expert opinion is expected, the building board decided that both apartments should not be operated - both in which construction works are carried out and in which Dmitry's apartment is carried out.
"This is not a case in the practice of the building council, when, in this way, the residents may, because of their ignorance or simply an unwillingness, pose a threat not only to their own ownership, but also to the owner of the lower property, as a result of which this owner cannot exploit his property", says the representative of the building board.
Now Dmitry has to find another place to live with relatives, friends, hotel or rent another apartment.
But Dmitry’s damage can try to recover from a neighbor’s civil order, which may take a lot of time.
As a result of this intruable construction, it is prohibited to stay in both apartments now until the engineer gives his conclusion, and it can be expected for as many as three weeks as possible.
The damage incurred will have to be borne by the owner of the apartment in which the repairs took place.
The owner of this apartment is also threatened by a prison sentence for a period of up to six months, because the building board has not taken into account what was said.
Let's go!

The conversion of the former Ķemeri sanatorium into five-star hotels will cost EUR 22 million.
The conversion of the former Ķemeri sanatorium into a five-star hotel "Park Hotel Ķemeri" will cost 22 million euros, and the agency LETA will tell Gita Želve, representative of the future hotel manager SIA "Park Hotel Ķemeri".
The construction of the hotel is the first reconstruction phase of the Kemeri's former sanatorium.
The second stage will be "wellness" or wellness clinic, which is planned to be discovered in 2022, while the opening of the hotel is scheduled for May 2018.
Želvė notes that the exact costs of clinics are not yet known.
But she says that it will be located in a polyclinic building of the former Ķemeri resort, an area of about 12,000 square meters.
The clinic will be located on three floors.
The owner of Park Hotel Ķemeri and the planned clinic is the international fund "G Capital Europe", which invests in European assets.
The owners of G Capital Europe are several investors who invest money in this fund, indicated by Želve.

By the middle of 2017, design works will start in autumn next year.
As reported earlier, the historic sanatorium complex "Ķemeri" is planned to create a five-star hotel "Park Hotel Ķemeri" and "wellness clinic".
However, the reconstruction lasted.
On the other hand, the 2010 report also claimed that Ominasis regularly communicates with the hotel operator Kempinski, who continues to ensure day-to-day technical control in the sanatorium Ķemeri, and that already in 2011 the reconstruction of the future hotel Ķemeri was definitely done and immediately started preparations for opening the Kempinski chain.
In October 2014, its readiness to buy Ķemeri sanatorium's assets belonging to the insolvent Ķemeris sanatorium was confirmed by Park Hotel Ķemeri at the auction, but a month later the auction was found not to happen because the winner had not paid for the purchase in due time.
The sale price was set in line with the starting price of the last tender, EUR 2.86 million.
As LETA informed the representative of the city council Ieva Aile, the municipality, when signing the protocol, has shown that, with the support of co-financing of the European Union structural funds, the infrastructure will be restored to the historic Kemeri Park, an interactive nature tourism site will be created, roads and parking places.

The Russian hacker has broken the e-mail of former NATO commander Breddlov.
The hackers who broke U.S. Democrats' National Committee (DNC) computers may have carried out several other cyber attacks, have also broken down the Bloomberg business news agency of the former NATO European Force Commander Philip Bredlov and the George Soros Institute.
The information obtained by the hacker has been published on the website "DCLeaks.com".
Among other things, Bridlov’s correspondence and information on the work of Soros Institute were included there.
For hackers, the Institute's computers have been available for a whole year.
According to Bloomberg, these cyber attacks were carried out by the same hackers related to Russian specs that broke the DNC e-mails.
The Wall Street Journal reports that the U.S. President Baraka Obama's administration is currently discussing imposing new sanctions on Russia, thus responding to the hacking of the DNC computers.
In order to impose sanctions, the administration will have the official cyber attack on the servers of the Democratic Party to challenge Russia or the hackers supported by the Russian authorities.
As reported, the WikiLeaks website published around 20,000 e-mails from the DNC computer system in July, from which it is understood that the leaders of the Democratic Party have tried to harm party candidates in Hilaria Klintone's former rival, Vermont Senator of Vermont, Children Sanders's campaign on the start of the democratic nomination in the presidential election.
As reported by US press sources, the Federal Investigation Office, which investigates the crackdown on democratic servers, as well as other U.S. specs, considers that Russia's relationship with the cyber attack is no doubt.
Macartney: The Beatles threatened the presence of Joko Ono.
Paul Macartney acknowledged that the presence of Joko Ono created a feeling of danger for the legendary group The Beatles.
The 74-year-old rock star is currently maintaining a "good" relationship with the widow of the poor John Lennon, but when she went to the group to visit the recording studio, she was afraid, because Ono was the only woman in the group - George Harrison, Ringo Stear, Lennon and Matartney.
When the singer asked about the relationship, he said to the magazine "Rolling Stone": "They're really good."
We were at risk at the time.
While we were writing, she was sitting on the amplifiers.
Most groups could not tolerate it.
We were able, but not quite successful, because we were very tense.
We were not sexists, but the girls usually did not come to a record study, they allowed us to work.
When John first met Joko, she didn't sit in the control room, but in the middle of our four.
The writer of Yalow Submarine also admitted that he now has regular contacts with former member of the group Ringo, and at any time confirms the work plans of Apple's recording studio, but in any case the "The Beatles" is "completed".
Asked if he still meets the other member of the legendary rock group, Makartney said, "Not at all."
We meet in social events and parties.
But I don't go to the meetings, I feel a little isolated from it.
I left Apple during my heavy divorce.
In one place, I sent John Eastman to the meetings, and I said, "Don't tell me what everyone says, because I can't go to the table."
It was too painful to see our pet die.
The company now works in such a way that I'm just listening to all the records.
I am part of the approval process.
NASA climate model: Venus has ever been a inhabited planet
Venus has ever been a inhabited planet based on NASA’s latest climate models.
Researchers at the NASA Godard Space Research Institute have developed a model to explore the history of Venus, using tools and algorithms also used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether or not Venus, whose surface is hot, waterless, and whose atmosphere is almost carbon-only, has ever been like Earth.
Scientists have previously said that Venus’s slow rate of rotation is explained by a dense atmosphere.
However, the latest simulations show that Venus had ever had a plan, a earthlike atmosphere, and has slowed down.
The model also looks at the former topography of Venus.
There were more dry areas on the planet than on Earth, but on it there were enough water and geographical diversity to allow life to develop and prevent water evaporation.
In the early days of Venus, the sun was 30 percent brighter.
In simulation of the GISS model, the Venus rotation model reveals that the bright part of the day on it lasts 2 months, explained in the press release by GISS scientist Antonio Del Genio.
This process warms the surface of the planet and causes a rain, which in turn forms thick cloud layers that act as a umbrella protecting the planet from the heat of the sun.
As a result, there is a moderate climate temperature, which is actually a few degrees lower than the temperature on Earth today.
The model depicts the history of Venus, which is similar to the theory of evolution developed by scientists in their hypotheses.
Although it was ever inhabited, Venus has been exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light over several billion years.
The oceans were evaporated, and the garages were burned with ultraviolet scars.
When the water was completely evaporated, the couples remained only in the plan's atmosphere of carbon dioxide with the deadly greenhouse gas - Venus, as we know today.
Scientists published the results of the new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns from the position of "Avalanche" coach
On Thursday, Patrick Roy, vice president of the "Avalanche" and hockey operations, submitted an invitation as a reason to mention the lack of influence in the team decision-making process.
The vice-president and generalist of Colorado Jo Saiks confirmed this message and informed that the club would immediately start searching for a new coach.
"For the last three years, I have been energetic, enthusiastic and purposeful in the performance of my duties as the main coach and vice president of Kolorad's club's hockey operations," said Roy, who is 50 years old.
During this summer I have thought a lot about how I could improve the team's performance to give it the necessary glory and achieve a higher level of results.
To achieve this, the visions of the vice-president of the main coach and hockey operations must be completely consistent with those of the organisation.
He should also be able to influence decisions relating to team performance.
These conditions are not met at the moment.
Sayy, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
She said Patrick informed her about his decision today.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organization and wish him all that best in the future.
In his first season with the Avalanche team in 2013-2014, Roy was recognized as the League's best coach and received the Jack Adams Prize.
He helped the club reach 112 points and the first place in Central Division, but in the first round of off games the team was defeated by Minnesota hokojiesti. Since then, the club has not entered the game off for two years.
"Avalanche" concluded the 2015-2016 season with a result of 39-39-4 and remained five points behind the "Wild" team without receiving the second special invitation of the Western Conference organizers.
In his career he won four Cups of Stanley - two with Montreal "Canadien" and two with "Avalanche".
North Sea oil platforms workers resume negotiations and leave the strike
The workers' strikes on the Northern Oil Platforms have been waged by the workers, as the two parties to the dispute have reopened their negotiations, and the leaders are negotiating.
The Wood Group periodically organises strikes on offshore oil platforms operated by Royal Duch Shell.
The joint statement states that the trade unions of the Wood Group and the United and RMT agreed to resume negotiations on the resolution of the dispute.
In the coming weeks, several full-day meetings are scheduled to begin at the beginning of the following week to re-examine the problematic issues.
Trade unions have reported that their recent activities, organised after more than 25 years of interruption, are aimed at a planned wage reduction of 30 per cent.
This year, the Wood Group reduced its salaries for North Sea workers by 9 percent due to the negative market pressure.
Already in 2014, the company reduced the number of land-based workers' salaries by 10 percent.
The company explains that the additional wage cuts would allow the company to survive the downturn in the market.
Shell, on the other hand, already reduced salaries for several thousand people and announced plans to stop oil and natural gas operations in 10 countries in order to optimise its work in preparation for a large-scale merger with the British energy company "BG Group".
Energy companies are under pressure from falling oil prices, and the situation is even more complicated by the British decision to leave the European Union.
At the beginning of the week, the Scottish Member Dave Anderson met with representatives of the workers to discuss one of the most important issues: the Northern Sea strike plans.
He said that the North Sea is vital for the region's economy.
In his report, he explained that the North Sea and the country as a whole needed an economy that benefits all, not individuals alone.
In 2016, the new North Sea projects are expected to invest almost $ 1.4 billion, compared with $7 billion, invested over the last five years.
Kepler size star rotation speed in the Plejad constellation.
The newest Tricket mission has helped astronomers to gather the most complete catalogue of star rotation speed in the Plejada constellation.
The new data help the astronomers understand why stars in this star turn at different speeds, as well as how the speed of star rotation is related to the production of planets.
"We hope that when we compare our results with other stars, we will get more information about the relationship between the mass, age and even the history of its solar system," Pasadena Caltech Infrasarkano Process and the Analytical Center scientist Luis Rebula said in the news release.
The pitcher is 445 light years away from Earth.
Many stars just begin to grow in this starry world, reaching about 125 million years of age.
They turn at maximum speed.
These growing stars emit a large amount of star winds at maximum speed.
When the wind arrives in the star magnetic field, it stops the stars.
As the stars age, their rate of rotation is reduced.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by determining the time between the appearance of a recognized star area, such as a sun spot.
The latest star rotation catalogue shows that larger stars turn slower than smaller stars.
Rebuls compare stars with dancers, bigger staves perform pyramids slower than small staves.
Rebuls tells us that the Plejades "ballet" shows that slowly rotating objects are larger and more massive, while more quickly rotating objects are very small stars.
Thanks to the fact that the Plejades star is so close, it serves as a great space laboratory, where you can compare the characteristics of stars with the speeds of rotation.
Rebul says that the Plejade star helps to create theoretical models of star decoration in both directions for both older and younger stars.
We still need to learn a lot about how, when and why, the speed of the stars will slow down and their complete stopping process.
Rebuls and his colleagues discussed in detail the analysis of Plyjad's star rotation rates in the three new publications, which will soon be published in Astronomy's Journal.
