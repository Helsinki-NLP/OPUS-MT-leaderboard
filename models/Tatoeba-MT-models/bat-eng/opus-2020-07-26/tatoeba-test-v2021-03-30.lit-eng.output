But he knew it couldn't continue.
I guess not.

He can't eat anything sweet today.
She's eating.
I'd like to travel around the world.
Do you like Italian?
I've been in prison for five years.
I didn't grow up.
Any universe that is simple enough to understand it is too simple to create a mind that can understand it.
We didn't have to rush.
Please?
No matter which team we win the match.
He's running away.
This dress is too big for me.
Go and get out of the way to your car.
Bring her a plate of salad.
We're in war.
She didn't answer.
I heard Mary wants divorce.
Is this tick or foal?

What do you think?
You're guilty.
She rejected my request.

Can you come to the ninth?
Why did you call?
They discussed that problem.
If I hadn't received his help, I would be dead.
He was almost asleep.
I have one brother.
Why did you come here?
Do you like this color?
Isn't it strange that Tom's still not here?
Millions of people lost their lives during the war.
Compare your sentence with that on the board.
She accepted him joyfully.
They need our help.
Did you get Tom's message?
I don't like how he speaks.
I don't know what's going on with me anymore.
I learned a lot from him.
He killed that man.
Do not trust (do not wait too much).
That brown hat is old.
He's playing golf every Sunday.
Be creative.
I couldn't understand what he said.
Close the gate.
I'm always tired.
He's a weird guy.
Go back to your place.
Be friendly.
Isn't that a wonderful morning?
It's at least a story.

His son, eight.
If I had wings, I would go to you.
Where the hell are you going?
He promised me he would be more careful in the future.
When did you hear the shot?
I forgot to buy one pillow.
I've heard a lot about you.
We're going to eat lunch.
Italy is a very beautiful country.
It's an old besmer.
Eat bread!
Although he lives in the United States, Thomas is not free to speak English.
The school is five miles away from my home.
I gave my guns.
Who ate all our food?
I know her bread will be delicious.
Please come.
Women are changing the world.
In Singapore, spying on the floor is a crime.
I wanted Mary to love me instead of Tom.
You can sit on the chair.
We need more sugar.
The smell of the roses filled the room.
Bad sometimes wins.
Thomas has already taken three cups of coffee.
I don't understand German.
Yes, please.
I'll help you.
You're guilty.
What are you looking for?
What does that mean?
Apples on the other side of the wall are sweetest.
What's that?
I'm studying Japanese.
It's pointless.
She had the head of a woman, the body of a lion, and the wings of her feet, and the tail of her serpent.
Tell me how you solved the problem.
Would you like to dance with me?
Even if I wanted to, I could not explain what happened there.
I'm afraid of heights.
I don't know where to go.
If you don't rain, then let's go.
Who's going with me?
I agree.

Let's wait here.
That girl I told you about who I lived here.
Please, just get out of here.
I can't believe she's older than my mother.
Look back and see the black cat.
His family traveled a lot.
Do you know him?
I don't know whether to turn left or right.
I'll clean up the kitchen later.
He came from a small town in the mountains.
I talked to my friends.
All your cats are gray.
And now I remember the times when we've been up with you.
When we go to bed, we say "good night."
Scandale ruined his career.
Cats are complex individuals.
He was so poor that he could not buy bread.
I suggest you ask Tomo.
This bag is not small.
There's nothing wrong with that.
If you invite him, he'll probably come.
I know you know I know.
Come back home six years ago.
The bread is fresh.
I'll be back in half an hour.
I don't want to be a bad man again.
Are you a lawyer?
Where's your school?
Candles light the room.
I'm sorry.
Fold the paper in half.
What does he write in a letter?

The eternal silence of these infinite spaces frightens me.
Why do you need a new umbrella?
He drew a straight line on the wall.
You need a car?
Take your hat off when you enter the class.
They do nothing more than complain.
She was rushing.
Please contact me when you come to Boston.
Thomas rose at seven o'clock.
This is for us.
I'm listening to the radio.
The boy wants to know the truth.
Thomas ate the whole pizza alone.
You have to take care of yourself.
You need patience, Tom.
How are you?
Your trip starts here.
Can you believe what he said?
Thomas asked where you were.
I'd like to help, but I'm very busy.
Thomas could not stop thinking about Mary.
I think we should call Tom.
Don't be late in the bus.
All the apples are there.
You'll have to pay.
What time should we go to the station?
The more I think about it, the less I like it.
I'll take you to a new park.
Everyone knows her.
She's incredibly naive.
Where are you living in Turkey?
Thomas's gone.
I can't.
Get out of class.
Three dogs sleep on a mum carpet.
Thomas had already finished the work he had to do.
If you can't have children, you could always adopt.
That's what I thought.
Although she ran as fast as she could, she still did not get to the bus.

Do you like to live that way?
It's hot today, isn't it?
Do you really have a home?
Are you playing chess?
Her boyfriend is Turk.
You answer me.
My mother can't come.
There are many alumni in Bavaria.
Do you know if he has a girl?
I don't have a family.
Parents expected too much of their son.
What would you like to order, gentlemen?
He did it.
He entered my room without permission.
You can't just leave.
Come on, move!
You can sit on the chair.
Where are you living if you don't have a home?
Our union can be perfect.
He told me I could use his car.
Nearly all students like English.
That test was so tough that we didn't have enough time to finish it.
That's all.

John is Professor of French Literature at Oxford University.
Do you understand what he said?
What color is her hair?
The sooner you return, your father will be.
Are you ready to start your journey?
Your watch's been late for ten minutes.
They cheated on you.
I thought you said she was yours.
How much money do you have to hide under your bed?
We believe in God.
I'm Irish.
Here's the man I've been waiting for.
He didn't pay the debt and he disappeared.
Mr. Brown speaks Japanese very well.
No, he's not my new guy.
I love watching baseball and football.
Everyone, except her, smiled.
The queen stood by the king.
This bridge was built two years ago.
She's my first love.
You have to keep your promise.
Thomas looks different today.
What is the price for the room?
We have to drive from here.
Thomas doesn't want to do this again.
I asked her to wait a minute.
How long ago did you start studying Esperant language?
They're not in danger.
Her advice led me to go abroad.
You're the only one who can help me.
What places does it hold in the folder?
That's why we played inside.
Your carpet is completely white.
But I don't want to.
I'm sorry I can't meet you tonight.
Thomas has a sister who is a lawyer.
I look like my mother.
You look just adorable tonight.
Doc, can you listen to me?
You know, don't you?
I'm hoping to see him on Monday.
Thomas's been dressed.
It's hot, so be careful not to get out.
Did you find your letters?
For God's sake!
He doesn't remember if that room was empty or not.
The shop sells expensive accessories for women.
I don't like to be wrong.
It's not theirs.
I'm not getting up early.
Stay where you are.
The house is her.
The doctor advised him to stop doing so much work.
Are you sure?
You were busy.
I can't live that way anymore.
He'll do anything to make money.
I just want to talk.
What music does Thomas like?
That tree grows near her house.
Don't talk to the reader.
How you doing, miss?
I would put it in dollars.
I hate winter.
I think Thomas's going to kill Mary.
There are only two right answers.
If I had been rich, I would have given you some money.
When did you meet her?
Where did you curse them?
Thomas didn't show up.
Don't be so serious, it's just a game.
He told a funny story.
I don't have time now.
Thomas is our team captain.
This carpet is very long.
Listen to what the teacher says.
Why don't nobody eat my potatoes?
I asked Tom to play guitar.
What does that remind you?
She made it literally.
What a great night!
I can't find Tim.
She called him Charles.
I'm not sure it's a boy or a girl.
Life is beautiful.
She's taking them to school.
Tatoeba was temporarily unavailable.
Nobody believed what you said.
I didn't know what to say.
Do you think I should go alone?
Just answer the hearing.
I don't want to ever be in debt.
Look at the train running through the bridge.
I'm not the only one who likes Thomas.
I'm really bored now.
No, I don't think I'm guilty.
Where are we?
I'm about fifty-five.
Her hat seemed funny.
Don't touch her, she's too young to understand.
I bought this suit for this occasion.
This is similar.
Be careful, okay?
That's the only explanation.
I can't believe I'm really here.
Don't you know the way?
I love it very much.
Tom needs help.
I've printed hundreds of pages.
I see and hear.
Don't forget the ticket.
Put your hand up before you answer me.
Please replace the flag.
Isn't it true you got a gun?
Yesterday, I was in bed.
The war ended their investigation.
When spring comes, the day becomes longer day after day.
I'm listening to radio.
Sweet dreams!
Leave my car alone.
This is Tony's book.
I had to come before.
Thomas eats just what he wants to eat.
Who stole this apple?
He lost his ticket to the Chinese.
What would you do if you were in his place?
I don't like summer.
By the way, what's your address?

African elephants are bigger than Asian elephants.
What I always said.
He heard him cry at midnight.
Please bring me a glass of water.

Eat bread!
If God does not exist, we would have to create him.
You should do it yourself this time.
My family was very hospitable to me.
You don't understand.
It has green eyes and light brown hair.
Does Thomas have experience?
She left her umbrella on the train.
I'm a vegetarian.
You must go there.
What's the reason?
I can't see anything from here.
Because I didn't get the answer, I wrote it again.
She's standing behind the wall.
Don't expect too much of me.
They missed a great opportunity.
Fight for your right.
He's always talking to me when he meets me on the street.
Look at the book on the table.
I drank one beer and stayed very drunk.
Thomas did not think he needed a personal guard.
Somebody opened the door.
Do you have any questions about this lesson?
We saw her entering the park.
It doesn't seem like you're busy.
It didn't look like you wanted that book.
I have a red bike.
It's low and thick.
I want to go to Tokyo.
The trip was troublesome.
He's much smarter than me.
Thomas still does not look interested.
The weather is terrible today.
I didn't want this to happen.
The dog's trying to get out.
As I said, I won't do anything.
After that, there's a small brown dog on the tables.
Stop them.
Anna loves chocolate.
I know Mike loves the basketball.

Don't be afraid of change.
Please open this box.
Is it healthy to eat fish?
My baby wants to talk.
I asked her what she likes music.
There are no incident witnesses.
Is she satisfied?
But he knew he had no choice.
Do you remember this game?
She's gone without docs.
I'm often here.
She continued her speech.
Mike doesn't have to play baseball well.
The camels are often used when traveling in the desert.
Mary is a bookstore.
Good weekend.
I saw his car in the window.
Are you ready?
I'm happy I'm not a woman.
Stop wasted time and get back to work.
The more, the better.
Ten years is a long time.
Is this your car?
I can't believe you're still hungry.
It is quite normal to want to be happy.
We have to move very carefully.
Did you get Tom's message?
I was hurt last night.
If I had been rich, I would have given you some money.
I don't have a computer at home.
My father doesn't eat much fruit.
Can you give me a discount?
She kissed my cheek and wished the good night.
My friend's here.
Where are you living now?
The older you are, the harder it is to learn your language.
Thomas doesn't drink coffee, but he's smoking cigarettes.
Not all people like dogs.
I'll stay here for a few days.
I don't feel good.
Why did you say that stupid thing?
You can't defeat me.
I don't think I can do that.
Is that true?
She's crying.
See you in hell.
He's my father.
He doesn't want to wait for you.
He took his family to the zoo.
Thomas refused to go to the hospital.
Half of the nine.
This car was made in Japan.
Is that your first time in Japan?
Tony was happy.
My father asked me to open the door.
Make his photorobot!
Your brother wasn't in school today.
Thomas's never gonna let you down.
I was then in Canada.
I made this food myself.
Write the pencil.
Somebody wrote his name on the wall.
Whoever can go in a wrong direction will go out like that.
They don't have sugar anymore.
I love your daughter.
Thomas's hoping he's going to stay tonight and he's not eating again.
Somebody opened the door.
I'm not your mother.
Why isn't Tom not in the car?
My name is Ricardo.
When did you get the telegram?
You don't have to swim in that pond.
When's snow dissolved?
He thought who I was very tired.
I think she doesn't want to eat anymore.
Or you're with us, or against us.
Please help me, I'm dying!
Thomas knows she likes Mary.
I like this music.
She's scared of the dog.
He went to the park, but he stopped to her house.
Snow's falling fast.
We're here for lunch.
Of course I should read this book.
At the moment, Thomas is not in prison.
Thomas and Mary went to the museum.
The ship was gone beyond the horizon.
Good morning, my dear dog.
God blesses those who repent.
I can't work when you're standing there.
Marile had problems with the lungs.
We were one big happy family.
What color did she buy for her own car?
The kid cryed all night.
Do you see me?
She witnessed him.
My father raised the rice.
We speak Japanese.
The result was disappointing.
I climbed through the window.
Meat isn't ready yet.
Give me a piece of cracks.
She needs more sleep.
Did you hear anything?
Is she your mother?
Contamination, would you turn on the light?
He no longer trusts a doctor.
It was the first time I visited the museum.
We've spent a good time.
I think Tom's gonna want to sit down.
What a wonderful family.
Are you still in Florida?
You didn't have to eat that green fish.
Tomorrow is the last day.
We looked through the window, but we didn't see anything.
When was the last time you saw Thomas?
The Swedish capital is Stockholm.
They talked about love.
Thomas doesn't want to do this again.
I don't understand.
It's left, the child would feel very lonely.
I don't know anything here.
Our team lacked mobility.
Cat's gone through the street.
There's a mirror in there.
Why don't you want to help the police?
I want to meet your father.
Please continue.
He was busy.
I'm a widow.
I saw him.
I'm learning Lozhban.
"Good morning," said Thomas smileing.
My hand hurts.
He needs a ladder.
You shouldn't go.
You shouldn't trust him.
There are seven days in one week.
You have to take your own way of life.
No one could live without air and water.
He slipped and hardly fell back.
They work eight hours a day.
I eat and drink.
I do it every Sunday morning.
She soon opened the letter.
Are you busy at the moment?
I take everything I said.
Where do you have all those keys?
I got inside the window.
Take Tom to the hospital.
I have a white cat.
He quickly wrote our names.
Our son died during the war.
It is a dissatisfied result.
Of course you're wrong.
I can't tell who's gonna come first.
I don't want to talk to you because you broke my heart.
Don't trust him.
We may as well all go
Who is that person sitting at the next end of the table?
This idea is very attractive.
They go shopping.
All that is genius is simple.
Her disciples learn too much.
Thomas raised his hand.
Let's go lunch.
The birds fly south.
This tea is very delicious.
I don't agree with him.
I'm guilty.
Not bad, but I'm a little tired.
This is a wonderful idea.
He's very proud of his toy.
That's enough for us.
I'm totally scared.
The woman wants to know the truth.
Is this word often used?
Lithuania joins the European Union.
I want to be a speaker.
Where's the cat?
I'm sorry for what I did.
She's become a self-assist.
I learned to ride a bike when I was six.
He took a piece of credas.
Let me do that.
I like jazz.
I'm sure he's innocent.
Open the window and let go of fresh air.
Have you ever caught a button?
It's hard to sning.
Have you seen my mom?
I know his name.
Thomas doesn't want to live that way.
Do you agree with what she does?
He came here before the end of the class.
You know their address?
What the hell are you doing?
He looked down at his dirty shoes.
Her cat lay on my backyard and didn't want to get down.
There are some good hotels in the city.
What's this letter from?
He doesn't want to learn today.
We're all different.
You don't know how hard I love you.
I wrote a long letter to her.
He couldn't do what he wanted.
I feel a little weak today.
Life is fun.
She's here?
I don't like to be wrong.
Be careful, okay?
I bought a camera for $30.
That's great.
It's no method, it's a challenge.
You can answer it in English.
He wants to see us again.
Water's very shallow here.
Where are you living?
My friend doesn't use sugar.
I fell off my ladder.
He's telling people what they're talking about.
Bob then washed away dishes.
My brother is two years older than me, but he's three centimetres below me.
I can only tell you what I know.
I'm thinking about you.
What's your home address?
He'll be free tomorrow.
Have you seen my wife?
Your daughter heard us speak.
Thomas's gonna die soon.
I'm used to go to sleep late.
I've met him before.
Look at that house with a red roof.
My apartment on the fourth floor.
She was already pregnant.
We're basketball players.
These clothes are right for you.
Don't blame her.
Do you know you're stronger than you think?
I love her so much that I can't leave her.
Can you come with us?
I don't care about him.
Thomas could not find the reason why he had to go home early.
Put your hand up.
He didn't sell it home.
Nobody has ever seen God.
She saw something waiting for her next school.
It doesn't seem like you're busy.
Where's Mary?
The new contract allows us to demand anything we want.
Thomas is still a prisoner.
Go and open the door.
I told you I'd get another shot later.
God, help me!
She told him she was happy.
She needs him more than he needs her.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Tom, I'm back.
Did you want to see me?
It's not a mistake.
The airport is quite far from the city centre.
You can turn the radio off now.
You can turn the radio off now.
You're a very loving person.
Ankara is located in Turkey.
You're a very nice person.
I've been in Boston several times.
You're a very nice person.
