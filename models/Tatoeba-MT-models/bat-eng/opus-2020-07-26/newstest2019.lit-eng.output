"MG Baltic" case: the new Gustave says that he has not yet been able to get acquainted with the case material
At the 11th meeting of the MG Baltic court on Monday, all the accused were gathered: Sharūnas Gustavis, Gintaras Steponavičius, Vytautas Gabšys, Eligijus Masiulis and Raimondas Kurlianskis.
The hearing started with evidence of the accused.
At the last hearing, a new lawyer named Š. Gustainis, appointed by the State, Aleksandras Doroševas, told the Chamber of Judges that he had not yet been able to get acquainted with the case material.
Then MG Baltic Associate Linas Belevičius said that in order to ensure full defence of a person, the Chamber of Judges had to allow the new lawyer to have access to the case material and asked for the hearing to be held.
"In order to ensure the defence of a person, he shall have access to the criminal case material.
This is not just a formal sitting," said Mr Belevevičius.
The new lawyer, Mr Dooševa, noted that he had not been able to get acquainted with the act under appeal or with all the material in the case.
In a previous trial, a suspect, Mr Gustainis, informed him that he had refused his lawyer because he could no longer pay him.
Sound recordings were also heard at the meeting.
The accused lawyers were offended by the fact that the audio records submitted to the court were of poor quality.
Legal protection suspects that policy-making by MG Baltic supported or initiated group-friendly decisions in the Seimas and other state institutions, as well as influenced the decision-making of the winners of public procurement, reminds ELTA.
In the course of the historical investigation, more than 150 persons were interviewed, of which more than 50 members of the previous and this term of office, several former ministers and members of the European Parliament.
More than 200 surveys and more than 30 searches have been carried out.
It is suspected that Š. Gustainis received a bribe of more than 8 thousand euros, G. Steponavičius - 15 thousand euros, V. Gapšys - more than 27 thousand euros. E. Masiulis is suspected to have taken a bribe of more than 106 thousand euros.
A working party is suspected of bribery and trade impact, Liberals Movement - bribery, trade influence and abuse, while MG Baltic is suspected of having an impact on buying and selling these parties.
It is suspected that the politicians were consulted on the bribes with the Vice President of MG Baltic Group R. Kurlianski, and subsequently proposed or supported initiatives in the Seimas or other institutions.
Ethics guards: Liberals Movement Board on the Right to Action of Vilnius Unit
"The decisions taken by the Board are in accordance with the articles of association," the heads of the board Vytautas Tamošūnas told BNS after the meeting of the panel.
"Our solution was not some new one.
The explanation as a commission has already been made in July when the question about Pagėgiai and Utena was raised.
Then we said, according to the statutes, that is the issue of the board's competence.
And if the board decides that any section may behave as it wishes - to go with the committee and the board agrees, then the section can go, but if the board decides that there will be part-lists, what the board has adopted, then it is a decision that all sections form part-lists.
And if you don't agree with the board, then there's an opportunity to stop membership and go with the committee," he added.
According to Mr Tamošūnas, the party board will now decide on further action.
On October 17, the Board of the Liberals Movement of the Party revoked the decision of the Vilnius City Division to participate in municipal elections not with the list of the party, but with a new election committee.
In the opinion of the party board, the decision of the capital liberals to participate in the elections in the form of a public election committee violated the statutes of the party and the decisions of the board.
By October 31, Vilnius division had to withdraw its intention to participate in municipal elections with a committee list.
But the department didn't do that.
Former Head of Unit Aušrinė Armonaitė has already withdrawn from the Liberals Movement.
The Mayor of Vilnius, former Chairman of the Liberals Movement Remigijus Šimašius, promising to pursue another term of office as Head of the capital, has already presented the team and ideas of the social election committee "Jaž Vilni, in which we are proud".
He left the party as well.
The elections of municipal councils and mayors will take place in March of next year.
The inhabitants of the village in northern India had a tractor that used to break a single man, told officials on Monday.
The forest supervision officer Mahavir Kajlagi (Mahavir Kadžlagi) said that the tigrei had drowned a man working in the fields late on Sunday, the villagers surrounded the beast and, as the female attempted to get out of the house, took it to the tractor.
The inhabitants say that about 10 days ago, this swarm also attacked and humiliated one young man.
The village is located in the Dudhva tiger reserves in the region of Lakhympur in Kherio, about 250 km southeast of the capital of Utar Pradesh.
The use of tigers in protected areas shall be prohibited.
Director Rameshas Pandey, said that according to the Law on the Protection of Wildlife, the case would be reported to the police.
In April, the villagers in the Nighasan region of Utar Pradesh, the state of Nighasan, struck another tiger, and suffered serious injuries.
The tiger is a national animal of India; under the Wildlife Conservation Act, the tiger is considered to be a endangered species.
According to government data over the last three years, at least one person died every day during the last three years in contact with wild tigers or elephants.
The number of human conflicts with tigers has grown gradually since the 1980s, when India launched a programme of the protection of the tigers, under which reserves have been set up in the national parks, and the finalisation of the great cats has started to be a crime.
Although the methods used to calculate tigers have changed, the census would show that the then population of approximately 1,800 tigers has grown to 2 226 individuals in 2014.
The recommended microchips are recommended for cats and dogs
Kęstutis Mažeika, Chairman of the Seimas Environment Protection Committee, along with other members of the Seimas, has registered amendments to the Law on Animal Welfare and Protection, in which cats and dogs are offered to be permanently labelled with subcutaneous microchips.
"We suggest that cats and dogs should be labelled with subcutaneous microchips, and that the registration and labelling of cats and dogs should be organised by local municipalities, the Ministry of Agriculture and the State Food and Veterinary Service.
All dogs will be marked free of charge in 2019 and cats in 2020 will also be covered by public funds, so citizens will not be concerned and the costs will be covered by specially designed public funding," said Kęstutis Mažeika, Chairman of the Seimas Committee on Environmental Protection.
The amendments to the Law aim to address the systemic need for animal labelling for domestic animals.
This is expected to avoid problems caused by irresponsible livestock farmers, illegal multipliers or sellers.
It is estimated that, on the basis of the expected average price of the microchip and service provision of around EUR 5 per transitional period, all animal owners will be compensated.
The total cost of labelling all pet animals may reach up to EUR 6 million.
The need for these funds is estimated to be spread over three years and will amount to EUR 2 million per year.
It is expected that the funds will be allocated to labelling programmes through the special programme for the promotion of municipal environmental protection, whose revenues will increase significantly this year due to increased taxes on natural resources and the reallocation of funds.
The municipalities will be able to use these funds not only for the marking of cats and dogs, but also for castration and other programmes.
According to Mr Mažeika, mandatory labelling practices are widespread in almost all countries of the European Union, allowing both the animals themselves to be protected (for those who are lost can easily be returned to owners) and saving the time spent by the livestock farmers themselves, where search for the abandoned and lost pet has taken a lot of time and money.
EU legislation also provides that only marked pets can travel.
At the same time, labelling obliges responsible care of the animal throughout its life.
Previous proposals have had a mandatory resistance, as the programmes concerned have been proposed to finance the population.
"The model that is currently in place should avoid this criticism, because animal protection is offered to finance increased income in the environmental support programme and the right to be labelled not only for veterinarians but also for the public, i.e. persons from animal care institutions who have received special courses at the Veterinary Academy," says the authors of the project.
The draft law was registered by a group of Seimas Members representing different parliamentary groups - Kęstutis Mažeika, Algimantas Dumbrava, Eugenijus Gentvilas, Edmundas Pupinis, Rimas Andriikis, Antanas Vinkus and others.

Ritas stretched the help hand to the Ukrainian club
On Wednesday, the FIBA European Cup 4th round match will take place in Vilnius "Ryto" Arena, where the clubs of Kosovo and Ukraine will meet.
The double will be prepared for political reasons in the capital.
Vilnius Ritas will accept the team of Cherkaski Mavpy and Pristina KB Prishtina at the Riga Arena on November 7.
"For political reasons between Kosovo and Ukraine we could not hold this match at home, so we are very pleased that our friends from Vilnius agreed to accept us - "Rytis" thanked the Ukrainian crew's hero Maxim Michelsson.
- We have a lot of friends in Vilnius, and our countries always agree well with each other.
Lithuania is one of the best basketball traditions in the world, so we will have a real honor to play here.
We hope that we will receive support from the Vilniuses.
The Kosovo team could not come to Ukraine because these countries do not have any diplomatic relations.
Currently the Ukrainian crew takes the third place after the first round with one victory during three meetings, while the Kosovo team is in the second position and has more victory.
This will be an important concern for the E group, as only two crews will come into the next phase.
In the past, Ukraine and Kosovo were selected for the 2017 European Basketball Championship.

On Wednesday, basketball amateurs will be able to get into the game free of charge, and the start of the match will be 19 hours.
Women lie better" star actress B. Arsobaitis persecuted by the liars
This is probably just a coincidence, but the charming brown actress Brigita Arsobaitė has already been receiving several roles in relation to the liars.
At first the series "Womens lie better", then the performance "Mėgė" and finally the comedy "Mėgiai".
In this film, Brigita plays a handful of hero of Dainius Kazlauskas.
"I really liked the film "Mrage" because I'm more a theatre actor and I'm rarely shown in the movie.
A wonderful team of colleagues gathered from the beginning promised a great result.
This experience is very important and valuable to me.
But the most interesting thing that happened on the site was the dog Sunny!
I thought if I had a dog, it would really be big and serious.
I've never admired these little, decorative fifs.
But, during the filming, Sunny got so attached to me that the sympathy became reciprocal and, finally, I wanted to buy it from my master, but unsuccessfully, - the actress smiles.
From the first minutes new Lithuanian comedy "Velgis" has been caught into the composers of Lithuanian film hits "Unexperied" and "Tarp our boys..." producer Paul Virbickas and producer Stasys Baltakis and Vladimir Razarionovas.
Your beloved just said she's waiting.
That would be great news, but... your beloved is your brother's wife!
But that's not all.
If you don't have the chance to publish all "good news", parents suddenly say - they're different!
After 50 years together...
And all this takes place just before the most beautiful celebrations of the year - St Christmas!
But the end will surprise you even more, because no one expected such a nuclear event.
All the heroes are not as they seemed at first sight...
In the Arsobaitė comedy "Melgiai" are given a good mood to viewers by four-time film stars: Giedrius Savockas, Dainius Kazlauskas, Edita Užaite, Giedrė Giedraitytė, Liubamiras Laucevicius, Larisa Kalpokaitė and Gediminas Girdvainis.
The comedy "False" has been in the Chinese since 9 November.
Whether to write down taxes of EUR 100 million on emigrants
On Tuesday, the Seimas adopted an amendment to the residence declaration law prepared by Ramūnas Kabauskas, the leader of "states" for consideration.
56 Seimas Members voted in favour, 9 against and 25 abstentions.
The Seimas will proceed to the consideration of amendments on or after 6 December following the conclusion of the Government.
According to R. Carbauskas, these contributions are calculated for people who have not declared their departure from Lithuania.
According to the Parliamentary, over three years one person does not pay about 1 000 euros, and now there are about 100 000 such persons.
Social Democrats Algirdas Sys regretted that, in this way, the Seimas would 'comply with obligations' - declare the departure and then no taxes would be counted.
A member of the Committee on Health, Mr. Antos Matulas, noted that Lithuanians who live abroad are using the fact that when paying a small health insurance fee, they come to Lithuania for treatment - they are provided with the same services as those that pay this tax to the population.
The amendments provide that persons leaving Lithuania who will pay social insurance contributions to the European Union, the States of the European Economic Area or the Swiss Confederation, and that "Sodra" will be exempted from paying health insurance contributions in Lithuania.
The head of Sodros, Mindard Sinkevičius, has previously said that such a step will make life easier for both emigrated people and the activities of Sodros.
The video on the Internet reveals a serious problem
It is filtered as the mother’s pilot climbs on a straight - lined slope, while the little one climbs, slips down and climbs again.
The video received many reviews and comments.
People were thrilled with the perseverance of the little bear - often slipped down, he was back to the mother again.
He's not the first time he's done, but he's not trying to give up and he's finally reaching his goal.
The video actually belonged to attention, but it also reveals the threat to animals posed by humans.
Scientists claim that it is also necessary to talk about the fact that people may be harmful when they want to learn about wildlife.
"It's obvious to me that the bear drone was very scared.
They're moving to see that they're panicking.
If there were no drones, they would probably have chosen a safer way or had to overcome it less slowly or with caution.
This is a great example of how drones should not be used," says ecologist Mark Ditmer in the magazine The Verge.
Some time ago, Mr Ditmer, together with his colleagues, studied how drones function.
In the case of animals, manual work gauges were set up.
When the drone came near, some bears would run, others would not run anywhere, but the hearts of all of them began to beat more often.
Scientists recommend that bold animals be filmed in a responsible manner, that they do not fly too close, that they do not raise noise, or that they do not wander where it is prohibited.
The fled president was asked through a newspaper
On Tuesday, the Kiev Court invited President Viktor Yanukovych, who withdrew from Russia, to come to the case about his alleged state's betrayal in an unusual way - the summoning was published in the Official Journal of the State.
In the court call published in the government news newspaper "Uriadodoj courier", the former leader is invited to attend a criminal proceedings meeting on 19 November, during which his final arguments could be heard.
The document states that Mr Yanukovych has the right to attend a video meeting.
On October 30, the Kievn court closed the debate in the Yanukovych case.
The Russian lawyer, Mr Janukovyk, was given the opportunity to register in the Register of Foreigners before November 19 in order to participate in a meeting where Mr Yanukovych is expected to speak his last word.
Kremlius was supported by Mr Yanukovych and fled to Russia during the Maidan uprising in February 2014, provoked by the President's refusal to sign the Association Agreement with the European Union.
The Russian President Vladimir Putin later revealed that the former Ukrainian leader had been removed to Russia through a special operation organised by Moscow.
In March of that year, Russia exported the Crimean Peninsula to Ukraine, and later on, the country's eastern war between the separatists supported by Kiev and Russia.
Since then, the battles have led to the lives of about 10,000 people, despite numerous attempts by the international community to secure a long-term ceasefire.
Valdas Benkunskas will conduct a list of Conservatives to Vilnius City Council
Former Minister of Economy, Parliamentary Dainius Kreivys has already been approved as Conservative candidate for the year.
During the weekend during the preliminary elections of conservatives, the members of the party rated the list of candidates to Vilnius City Municipality Council.
According to the party, V. Benkunsk, Chairman of the Vilnius section meeting of TS-LKD, became the leader of the conservative list.
The first ten candidates came to Vilnius City Council members Paulė Kuzmickienė, Adam Bužinskas, Gediminas Švilpa, Audrius Skaisys, Rasa Baškienė, former Member of the Seimas Liutras Kazlavickas, Chairman of the League of Young Conservatives Mantas Benkunska, Arūnas Valinskas and Goda Karaziaitė.
Direct elections of mayors and municipal councils in Lithuania will take place on March 3 next year.
Restrictions on cogeneration plants against the Constitutional Court
The Seimas opposition, as promised, appealed to the Constitutional Court (KT) against the decision of the rulers to adopt a law on the possibility of stopping the construction of waste incineration plants.
On Tuesday, the Seimas opposition Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) Group announced that the group members of the Seimas had applied to the KT to investigate the compliance of the amendments to the Law on Waste Management adopted by the Governing Body.
"The Parliaments stress that the provisions of the law are intended to question existing waste incineration plant projects, by entrusting the Government with the establishment of new restrictions (20 km from the area of residence) until the entry into force of the law for construction of waste incineration plants started in Vilnius and Kaunas," says the report.
"The Houses note that in view of the fact that the prohibition on the construction of facilities of national importance for the management of waste laid down in the law (i.e. a distance to be defined and a definition of "resident territory") the substance of this prohibition is disproportionately limited or even denied the right to carry out economic activities related to the incineration of waste for energy production, since the criteria laid down are formulated in such a way that, having regard to the density of the population of Lithuania and the distribution in the country, the construction of such facilities is practically impossible throughout the territory of the country", is added to it.
We argue that the law adopted is contrary to the constitutional principle of the rule of law.
"The Court has repeatedly stated that legislation is not applicable to those legal facts and consequences which arose before the entry into force of the new legislation.
In this case, the Government is empowered to apply the law backwards in accordance with an indefinite criterion.
Such legal regulation is in breach of the principles of constitutional legal certainty, legal certainty and the protection of legitimate expectations, and hence the constitutional principle of the rule of law," refers to the appeal.
It also notes that major financial investments have already been made in Vilnius and Kaunas Cogeneratic Power Plant projects.
After stopping the projects currently being carried out, the state would not only suffer hundreds of million financial losses, huge losses suffered by Lithuanian residents and increase the heating price, increasing pollution of the environment due to the increasing amount of landfill waste disposal.
Members from the Seimas TS-LKD, Liberals Movement, Social Democratic Groups and the Senior Vice-President of the Social Democratic Group, Algirdas Butkevičius, signed the referral to the KT.
A couple of weeks ago the Seimas managed to collect 71 votes in order to reject amendments to the Waste Management Law adopted by President Dalia Grybauskaitė's veto, which provided for the right of the Government to stop the construction of Cogeneratic Power Plants already started, and also set 20 km from residential areas for the construction of "carantine" area.
The amendments to the law adopted by the Seimas shall enter into force from 1 January 2019.
This proposal is planned for consideration at the autumn session of the Seimas.
However, the right of the Government to suspend projects already launched is not planned.
The CT will deal with this case in order - not earlier than one year later.
The LeBron James statistics "Lakers" club raise questions
The beginning of LeBron James' career at the Lakers club of Los Angeles is not the same as he expected himself, the organization and basketball fans.
The Lakers season started with four victories and six defeats, and such a weak start helped to develop rumors for the possible dismissal of coach Luke Walton.
However, these talks were encouraged by the President of the basketball operations, Magic Johnson, who said that the coach would not be released, but that the need to play is better.
The biggest team star, Mr James, should also turn to himself.
Although the attacker's statistics are usually impressive - 26.8 points, 7.6 wins the ball and 7.7 resultant transmission.
But she doesn’t tell the whole truth.
During the first ten seasons, other figures show that Lakers is playing better when there is no L. James in the square.
The player's negative +/- statistics showing how many points more go or miss the crew when there are certain players on the field.
Here, when L. James is in the square, Lakers spent 30 points on this season more than competitors.
When he was sitting on the bench, he'd earn 19 points more than the rivals.
The Lakers Western conference is now only on 13th place, but several wins can turn everything around the top feet.
Spain will continue to contribute to Lithuania's airspace security
The meeting noted that Spain would contribute to the protection of the airspace of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia in 2019 and 2020.
"Lithuania highly appreciates Spain's cooperation in NATO and its significant contribution to ensuring the security of our country and region," Minister L. Linkevičius said.
The Spanish Air Force has already carried out five NATO Air Policing and Air Policing Missions in the Baltic States five times, three times in Lithuania.
The last Spanish Eurofighter destroyers were deployed in Šiauliai in May-September this year.
Spain will also contribute to the protection of the airspace of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia in 2019 and 2020.
The Minister also noted that regular consultations on security, political, economic and strategic communications between Lithuania and Spain are taking place in the fight against propaganda.
L.Linkevičius expressed hope that Lithuania and Spain will continue to work closely together on European, transatlantic and other multilateral issues.
Since 2004, when Spain opened its embassy in Vilnius, Ambassador Jose Maria Roblesas Fraga is the fifth Spanish representative in Lithuania.
On 29 October, Jose Maria Robles Fraga presented letters of credence to President Dalia Grybauskaite.
V. Ačienė on detention of R. Ačas: I believe in the innocentness and law enforcement of a man
"To me it was the unbelieving thing I could never think of.
On the other hand, it may be that the ministry is doing the work that must be done.
Every one of us is working on our own.
I believe in law enforcement, I believe in my husband that everything is right and fair, that any unfair action by him should not be done," V.Ačienė said to BNS.
R. Ačas Special Investigation Service (STT) was detained on Monday - legal protection suspects that he, as director of the Raseiniai Municipality Administration, took a bribe of high value and, in exchange, was able to create exceptional conditions for a private company that signed a contract with the City-owned Raseiniai bus fleet.
Representatives of private companies are suspected of buying Ač directly or having taken part in bribery for various financial operations.
In April of this year, R. Ača, the Council of the Municipality of Raseiniai district, in a third attempt after the distrust expressed, dismissed the position of the head of the administration.
The former "order" member of the Lithuanian Social Democratic Party led by Gediminas Kirkilas became a member of the newly established Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party in March this year, he suspended his membership of this party on Monday.
Mr Ačas a few years ago, he was unsuccessful in the mayor elections as a representative of the election committee "Your Raseiniai".
V. Ačienė says that the husband did not intend to put forward his nominations for the Raseiniai mayor elections next year, but had not yet decided whether to participate in municipal councils elections.
V. Ačienė was elected to Seimas on the list of Lithuanian Peasantities and Greens Union, she is a member of the Seimas Anticorruption Commission.
Politician says that it is waiting for further law enforcement action - and it will depend on whether it will be removed from work in the Commission.
"I really don't make sharp decisions today, this week, I think I'll make a decision.
I will see if there is a need to make accusations, of course I will take a different or different decision.
I probably need to keep aside all the things that are being investigated in the Anti-Corruption Commission, but again - all the time she put in her place," she said.
Representative of the opposition conservatives in Seimas Radvilė Morkūnaitė-Mikulėnienė invited the Speaker of the Seimas Viktoras Franckietis and Head of "States" to separate Ramūnas Carbauskas from the statements made by the group colleague Vida Ačienė and withdraw her from the Seimas Anticorruption Commission by transferring her work to another Seimas Committee or Commission.
She claims that the further work of V. Ačienė in the Seimas Anticorruption Commission would "encourage confidence in society and discredit the work of an important parliamentary supervisory committee".

Of the 500 records, most of the copies were distributed to radio stations, producers and friends, and only 50 copies of Safey entered the trade.
Now "Coldplay" is a world-known, respected and loved group that has issued seven albums with more than 100 million copies.
Over the past two decades, the group has won 107 different awards, including nine "Brit Awards" and seven "Grammy".

In the West Bank, an Israeli knife attacked by a Palestinian
The war "has prevented this attack because it identified a terrorist trying to hit a knife against civilians and an IDF military officer," says a report distributed by the Israeli army about an incident near Kirjata Arba's naussy next to Hebron.

Dalia Grybauskaitė invites China to create a more favourable investment environment for EU business
President Dalia Grybauskaitė invites China to create a more favourable investment environment for investment in European Union (EU) countries, facilitating foreign import conditions.
At the opening of the Trade and Investment Forum in Shanghai, D. Grybauskaitė stressed that the overall goal of Europe and China to see signs of economic slowdown should be 'unite efforts to halt the spread of protectionism in the world', applying to the root causes of the tensions, 'production surplus and unfair competition' caused by trade wars.
"The European Union has a very important commitment by China to create a more attractive, open environment for investment, which is important in negotiating a trade agreement with China.
It is important to conclude this trade agreement as soon as possible, ensuring that foreign businesses feel welcome and secure here, as well as strengthening intellectual property protection," said D. Grybauskaitė.
According to her, the opening up of China is important not only for Europe, but also for this country, but also for global economic growth.
The President underlined that the transparency of investment must be "higher than the interests of any business group".
"Transparency, the rule of law, strict compliance with international treaties - this must be essential to the environment of new investment relations," said Mr Grybauskaitė.
'Corped capital flows should not be expected in any country in the world - not only here or in our countries -' she added.
China's import exhibition is trying to mitigate criticism by avoiding opening up its market and protecting only its own companies.
The exhibition includes several heads of state, more than 2800 companies from 130 countries and regions of the world, including Lithuania.
According to the Lithuanian Department of Statistics, China currently holds 25th place among its export partners.
Last year Lithuanian exports to China grew 50%, which amounted to 180 million euros.
At the same time, the volume of imports from China exceeded EUR 820 million.
Some officials worry that China's investment in Lithuania can have undesirable political influence, while Beijing's exceptional focus on Eastern Europe has divided the unity of the EU.

The causes of Lion Air accident revealed: the anger of the dead's loved ones
Data from the black box of Lion Air, the broken Indonesian airline, show that at least four of its last flights showed a malfunction of the speed gauge, and reported to the investigators on Monday.
The Chairman of the National Transport Security Committee (NTSK) said that a similar crisis occurred in the last four flights of the aircraft, including the fateful when the liner fell on the Java Sea on 29 October shortly after the rise from Jakarta.
During this disaster, all 189 people were killed on the plane.
A lot of media reported in the previous flight of Boeing 737 MAX 8 from Denpasar to the capital of Indonesia.
"When we opened the black box - yes, the technical problem was the speed in the air, in other words the speed of the plane," said Mr Tjahjon during the press conference.
"The black box data showed that during two flights before the flight Denpasar-Dža time was the same problem too," he added.
"There's been a lot of rumors in the social networks.
Now we want to clarify that in the black box (the data remain) about the four flights in which there were problems with the speed indicator," the Head of NTSK pointed out.
During the meeting with the members of the deceased’s families S. Tjahjon said that the information of the flight recording device corresponds to the reports that the speed and height of the last flight did not change.
The search team has not yet found the second black box that records interviews in the pilot's cab.
Lion Air stated that when a flight from Bali to Jakarta had been made in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations.
One of the founders of the company Rusdi Kirana was not invited to speak at a meeting of the Minister of Transport, Budi Karyas Sumadi, the modelled family members, with the officers supervising the search for aeroplane and victim residues and the investigation of disaster.
However, he stood up and bowed his head when angry and grieving family members demanded that Mr Cirana, together with his brother Kusnan, established Lion Air in 1999, would be born.
Lion Air behaved inappropriately," said one man who presented himself as the father of the passenger Shandy Johan Ramadhan, who worked as a prosecutor on the island to which the plane was flying.
"I want Mr. Rusdi Kirana and his team to pay attention," he stressed.
- Lion Air has never come to meet me since the crisis began.
We lost our child, but Lion Air did not show us any embarrassment."
After this meeting, Mr Kirana went out in a hurry, avoiding the issue of journalists.
Many families expect long results in the process of identifying the dead.
Almost 140 lavonmais, loaded parts of human remains, have been handed over to police medical experts.
So far only 14 victims have been identified.
The gymnastics questioned why the boater was allowed to fly two months ago, although during the 28th flight from Bali to Jakarta in October, there was a failure, including by taking the passengers' frightening sudden flight down shortly after the take-off.
Lion Air said that this failure was eliminated.
Is it true that the problem was solved?
- If not, the technicians concerned must be held liable.
The law is very clear, not they said that the plane was allowed to rise again.
This bad technique must be answered by law so that the accidents in Indonesia no longer occur again.
Mr Tjahjon said that there was a large amount of fine scrap and the fact that the scrap spread into a relatively small area indicates that the liner was probably heading to the water at a very high speed.
"The plane was seamless when it fell into the sea.
He didn't get lost in the air, and the plane's engines, when he touched the water, were running in high turns, which is shown by all the broken turbine blades," the officer explained.
The breakdown of Lion Air has been the biggest aviation disaster in Indonesia since 1997, when Garuda’s plane crashed in the vicinity of Medano, 234 people died.
After the crash, the rescuers — the minor — were also affected
On Monday night on the road Breach - Plungė, cars BMW and Mercedes-Benz were hit at Tilvik.
Three victims have been reported in the car scene.
It is reported that a BMW driver, born in 1999, left the opposite side of the traffic and ran to the Mercedes-Benz car, where Dad was born in 1967, and a daughter born in 2005.
The BMW driver was rescued by firefighters.
You know, girl's teeth out of the "Mercedes-Benz" accident.
All victims were taken to the hospital.
Presidency: No artificial facilitations for referendum
Following the approval by the Seimas of the proposal to reduce the referendum cartel for the first section of the Constitution that currently holds greater protection, the President will veto amendments, says its advisor, Mindaugas Lingė.
"For the Constitution, more than half of the population voted - that is the requirement.
This is also the case for the amendment , in particular the items contained in its first section , which should certainly be of a minimum proportion .
It is not easy to predict that the president would really veto," said the internal policy advisor of Dalia Grybauskaitė to the news radio on Tuesday.
He stressed that the first section of the Constitution defines the fundamental subjects of the State: language, flag, territory, capital, sovereign sovereignty, and that, therefore, the reduction of the number of votes required to replace these articles would create a 'negative precedent' and 'revert the uncontrollable risk'.
"The president felt that there was no need for any artificial facilitation, more need to prepare for the referendum itself, more dialogue with people," he said.
On Tuesday, the Seimas plans to vote on the adoption of an amendment to the referendum law.
It provides for a decision on amendments to sections 1 and 14 of the Constitution with higher protection, subject to the approval of at least two fifths of citizens with right of election.
Currently, the Articles of Section One and Section Four of the Constitution may be replaced by more than half of all citizens entitled to vote in a referendum.
Approximately 2.5 million citizens have election rights in Lithuania: half would be 1.25 million voters, two fifths – one million voters.
This proposal was born after the Seimas confirmed in September the President's veto on earlier amendments adopted in Parliament to alleviate the demands for the number of votes for the change of citizenship by Article 12 of Section One of the Constitution.
It is proposed that the referendum be reduced in preparation for a referendum on double citizenship and should take place on 12 May and 26 May of the following year, when the first and second rounds of the presidential elections are planned.
Emigrants, after the restoration of independence on 11 March 1990, are currently unable, with the exception of some exceptions, to have a double nationality.
Double citizenship is sought by the Lithuanian community of the world, but fears that there is no referendum in the present conditions - there is no sufficient number of people to vote.
R. Masiulis: Lithuanian Airports "bārka", therefore they need to be updated
The infrastructure of Lithuanian airports and roads is starting to make a graduate, so it needs to be updated, says Minister of Transport Rokas Masiulis.
According to him, the renewal of Vilnius Airport is a minimum task which the State must perform.
"Air transport infrastructure is already becoming bright because it was planned for smaller passenger flows.
We must renew Vilnius Airport - it is not even part of the far-reaching planning, it is a minimum that we must do", said Mr. Masiulis at the communication conference organised by the Democratic Development Fund and the State News magazine on Tuesday.
According to the Minister, the next decade will be extremely important, as important projects will have to be implemented - the construction of "Via Baltica", "Rail Baltica", the external airport of Klaipeda, the upgrading of Vilnius and Kaunas airports, and perhaps the construction of a new airport.
"It will be very important for the next decade - we have to finish the construction of roads, rail integration, the construction of the external port in Klaipėda, the construction of airports, and perhaps decide on the construction of a new airport.
We must not sleep, we have already started projects that will exploit our potential in 10, 20 or 30 years' time," the Minister of Transport said.
Mr Masiulis said that road maintenance has been under-funded in recent years.
"The situation of mice is not improving so far, because the funds are not being used enough.
We are likely to build new roads, but even for minimum care, such as motorways, there is a lack of funds.
We must determine the amount of road surveillance to be allocated if we want their condition to improve," said Mr Masiulis.
He stressed that the Lithuanian transport sector's exports increased this year by 18.6%, while the largest export market became Germany, overcoming Russia.
Mr Masiulis once again criticised the European Commission's proposal that EU carriers will be obliged to return the wolves periodically to the country of registration.
"We must make our exporters feel at home in Western Europe.
In my opinion, the proposal for tractors to go home constantly is absurd, because in Europe, vans would be empty trucks, burn fuel, increase emissions.
The railways will be the main winners, because costs will increase so much that part of the transport will move on to the railways.
We are looking for ways to defend our positions," said Mr Masiulis.
According to the Ministry of Transport, the transport sector accounts for 12.2%.
Gross Domestic Product of Lithuania (GDP).
It employs more than 118.000 employees and more than 7.500 companies.
Dispute with heritageists
Last week, Mr Masiulis announced to the Seimas Economic Committee that negotiations on changing the cultural purpose of the Vilnius Airport building would allow the old terminal to be destroyed and a new one to be built.
However, Algimantas Degutis, interim director of the Department of Cultural Heritage (CED), was called political pressure in his deliberations.
According to him, the building built in the 1950 ’ s is a value recorded in 1993 in the register, and not politicians, but experts have to decide on its deletion.
Mr Masiulis then commented that the modern arrival terminal would contribute to the improvement of the Lithuanian image.
"The removal of this old terminal from the heritage would be a politically important step for it to be destroyed and to build a new modern arrival terminal to feel in a modern country, rather than such an interesting, truly unrepresentable country as an innovative one," said Mr. Masiulis last week.
Mr Masiulis then also reported that it is planned to build a completely new passenger terminal in Kaunas and to connect the airport to the Rail Baltica track, building the underground station.
This transport unit should operate in 2026 after the construction of Rail Baltica.
Last year Vilnius Airport served about 3.7 million people, this year it is expected to be 4.8 million passengers, and next year it is 5 million.
Last year Kaunas Airport served a total of 1.2 million passengers.

Next year direct flights to Madagascar will be launched from Vilnius
In spring of next year, the largest passenger plane Boeing 767 flying from Lithuania will land at Vilnius Airport, which will fly directly to the Bay Island belonging to Madagascar, based on information provided by the tour operator Itaka Lietuva, the portal "madeinvilnius.lt".
It is announced that Blue Panorama airlines' passengers will be able to choose from 259 economic classes and 8 business class locations.
The new direction of holiday will be reached directly from Lithuania from April 2019.
Dominic Milowskis, Managing Director of Itka Lietuva, claims that tourists from Lithuania are trying to offer new holiday destinations.
Madagascar is an island in the Indian Ocean near the east coast of Africa.
Other tour operators also prepared new holiday trips for the summer season 2019.
For example, Novaturas and Itka will start flying directly from Vilnius to Tirana (Albania).
Minister of Finance on the potential crisis: it is important not to talk about disease
"We always have to prepare for more difficult times.
What I would like to welcome is that for the third year in a row we build reserves in Lithuania's history for the first time in a row.
But it is also very important that we do not talk about sickness," said Mr Shapoka during his visit to Brussels on Monday.
ELTA recalls that on Monday and Tuesday, the Minister for Finance and Vice-President Miguel Tuskienė participate in Brussels in the meetings of the Euro Group and the EU Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN).
The ECOFIN meeting discusses issues related to the taxation of digital services.
This new tax is intended to avoid fragmentation of the EU's single market, as some Member States have already introduced or intend to introduce a certain tax at national level.
In the short term, it is proposed that an agreement be reached on the taxation of income generated for the provision of certain digital services in the EU Member States before there is a global consensus.
The Euro Group will review the draft budgets of the euro area countries submitted to the European Commission (EC).
On 23 October, the EC rejected the Italian draft budget as not complying with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact.
This is the first time that the EC makes use of this option.
For more information, please contact Belgium, France, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain.
The Euro Group will also address the issues of deepening economic and monetary union: the feasibility of implementing the European Deposit Insurance Scheme and the reform of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).
Lithuania has a stronger role to play in ESM financial support programmes, but it is believed that ESM functions should be clearly defined in order to avoid duplication of functions between ESM and other EU institutions.
Balys Burach.
Lithuanian work traditions and customs
More recently, 120 years after the birth of the famous Lithuanian photographer and cultural artist, ethnographer and national researcher, Bali Burač (1897-1972) in Sidar, Šiauliai State, then in Šiauliai province.
When we mention the 100th anniversary of the Lithuanian State, we have an excellent opportunity to remember how the national rebirth that brings life to many people in Lithuania, including their brothers Burachis - Balis, Jonas, Bronie - all of the creatives of the village's very depth, we can engage in fostering, apprehension and preservation of our cultural traditions.
Balys Buračas traveled over 50 years after his home country with a camera in his hands, presented a wide and realistic picture of customs, traditions, folk art and material culture in our country.
He sought to preserve the rapidly disappearing national strata and had a rare ability to grasp the residual value of his work.
In the photographs of Bali Buračs, Lithuanian landscapes, castles, and everyday and public holidays, our people have decorated pages of Lithuanian newspapers and magazines with national costumes.
This publication contains a significant part of Bali Burač’s heritage for describing national labour customs and related traditions and, above all, for their appealing iconography.
The published material shows not only the distinctiveness and beauty of those traditions, but also the progress of our civilization over the past century, despite two world wars and heavy occupations.
In the manuscript of the book, the works of the interwar Samogitian, especially the Cupish, northern, tentacles, as well as the works of the inhabitants of the High and Dzūgia, their celebrations and other traditions and customs written by Bali Burač.
Over 400 rare photographs, mainly unpublished, have been selected for this publication from around 10,000 negative ones, protected in museums and archives, which are grouped according to the selected texts.
They reflect unique aspects of ethnic culture characteristic of the hippopotamus, groanings, and other districts of Auktaitija and Žemaitija.

Tragic Destiny of a Pair — Just after a few hours of marriage
In the southwest of the country of Texas in the USA, just a few hours of an earlier married couple of virgins died during a helicopter accident.
24-year-old William Troy Byler and his wife, Bailee Raye Ackerman Byler died on Sunday shortly after midnight he was trapped in the hill 16 km north-west of Juvaldis and 129 km west of San Antonio, said local peace judge Steven Kennedy.
It is strange that the disaster occurred at a distance of about 24 miles [24 km], to the extent that the young people were years old.
A helicopter pilot of 76 years old Gerald Douglas Lawrence also died.
Young people were studied at Sam Houston State University in the city of Hansville, Texas.
They were married on Saturday evening at the Bylers Family Ranch near Juvaldis, and after the wedding feast, they fly a helicopter belonging to the family.
The accident occurred when the helicopter fell about 24 miles [24 km] away.
The young people were flying to the international airport of Sant Antonio, where they intended to go to the plane and fly the honeymoon, said Mr Kennedy, without specifying the destination of the last pair.
"This is a very rocky, uneven terrain area, and that hill is about 120-150 meters high," said Mr Kennedy.
G. D. Lawrence has been piloting aircraft of that family for many years.
According to Mr Kennedy, he piloted helicopters and served in Vietnam.
After the autopsy, it should be clear what the pilot's physical condition was and whether it could be the cause of the disaster.
The helicopter collapsed about 5-10 minutes after the take-off.
His scraps fell in a wide radius on the slope of the rocky hill, and the hull remained "dangerously attached", on Monday during the press conference said the air safety investigator Craig Hatch of the National Transport Safety Board (NTSB).
The investigators are going to bring the scrap and then take a thorough look at it, but it will not be easy for the tractor and the truck to reach that place, he said.
The reason for the disaster has not yet been established and the preliminary NTSB report should be published after two weeks.
Israeli Prime Minister calls Iran the entry into force of new sanctions "historical day"
"Today is a historical day," said Mr Netanyahu to his party, his office.
"Today is the day when, under the leadership of President (Donald) Trump (Donald Tramp), the United States introduces extremely severe sanctions for Iran, the most severe sanctions for Iran throughout the period when efforts to curb his aggression began," said the head of the Israeli Government.
Earlier on Monday, the Israeli Minister for Defence Avigdor Lieberman stated that the new sanctions would put a 'decided' blow to Israeli actions in the region.
The measures that Washington calls 'the strongest sanctions of all times' have been introduced following the decision taken in May by Mr Trump to withdraw from the world's power agreement with Tehran on his nuclear programme.
The sanctions aim to significantly reduce Iranian oil exports, which have already fallen by about one million barrels a day since May, and to remove Tehran from international financing.
Israel has long opposed this agreement with Iran and says that its scope and time limits are too limited.
The Jewish State also says that the abolition of sanctions allowed Iran to fund militias and its own military activities.
Israel is particularly concerned about Iran's actions in the neighbouring Syria and has promised not to allow it to stand there in military terms.
The other participants in the agreement with Iran - Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia - do not agree with the US's decision and say that the agreement, as has been foreseen, has so far prevented Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.
The court recirculates the circumstances of the death of a young motorcycler
The death of a young motorcyclist in Vilnius, Northern City, which has ended in an accident case, will be heard by the court of the witness.
On Tuesday, the Vilnius Regional Court decided that one witness would be heard at the next meeting on 26 November in order to clarify all the relevant circumstances of the case.
In the present case, the conviction has already been declared, but the prosecutor’s office does not agree with it.
On August 22, the Vilnius City District Court declared that the motorcycler’s accident ended in Vilnius was legalized by a car driver, 79 years of age, Eduard Osipova declared that the motorcycler was driving at a high speed and committed a serious violation.
Vilnius Regional Prosecutor’s Office asks the regional court to set aside the decision of the district court and claims that E. Osipov is the highest fault due to the accident, and the conclusions of the district court are unfounded.
The legal counsel of the deceased motorcyclist’s family is also required to cancel the judgment.
The accident took place on August 11, 2015, about 15 a.m., when the car "Skoda Fabia" driving from Lakūnai street entered the Žirmūnai street and faced a motorbike on the main road.
The prosecutor's office charged the man that the driver of the car had violated the Road Traffic Rules, which were intended to give the road, and caused a road accident: the man who had died on the main road of the Peaggo motorcycle.
The initial police reports indicate that the motor driver was killed, but after the investigations, it was found that the vehicle was representative of its power.
Judge of the Vilnius City District Court Rolandas Busžinskas BNS has said that the experts found that the motorcycle driver was driving at speeds of 89,2 kilometres per hour, even though the speed allowed at that place was 50 kilometres per hour.
"The driver could not predict that the motorcycle will drive at such a high speed," said the judge.
At that time, a hot - age driver claimed that he was only 5-6 miles [6 km] per hour.
The cycle driver, who saw the obstacle, tried to stop and fell off the vehicle before facing "Skoda Fabia".
According to the Prosecutor's Office, E. Osipov had to give the motorcyclist a way from the sideline to the main road.
Novaja Gazeta: six Vagner squads were killed in Syria
Among the deaths - five Syrian troops and six persons belonging to the military company Vagner.
The Novaja Gazeta source in Syria is announcing this.
According to the source, one of the 5th Syrian Armed Forces Corps units has been deployed in the said territory, with a number of Syrian volunteers and "military personnel".
"Novaja Gazeta" sent a request to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs with a request to provide information on Russian fate.
A former Belgian king will have to undergo a paternity test
This decision is the partial victory of the artist Delphis Boel.
It has been seeking recognition as a child of the former monarch since 2013.
The 50-year-old woman claims that her mother's Baroness Sybille de Selys Longchamps and Albert II had a short love novel decades ago.
The 84-year-old king hates parenthood.
According to the data of the Station RTBF, he may refer the case to the Supreme Court as a antidote to DNA testing.
According to the Court of Appeal, Jacques Fischer, a former man of Delphi's mother, neither in biological nor in legal terms, is the father of the artist.
The Delphas asked for the relevant study to be recognised as the daughter of Albert's "thick" father.
WRC parties distribute money but social workers will do nothing
The Central Electoral Commission (CEC) intends to allocate a budget grant of almost EUR 3 million to the largest political parties this week.
This spring, the leading Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party (LLDDP), led by Parliament's Vice-President Gediminas Kirkilo, is not yet planning to commit budget resources.
However, they may be granted in the near future by a separate decision of the LAG, provided that the legal environment governing the allocation of grants to lots changes.
Laura Matsitityte, President of the GCC, informed the GCC that "this Thursday a committee is scheduled for the adoption of a decision on the allocation of the half-yearly grant to parties".
According to the French authorities, the decision on the issue must be taken by the GOK by 15 November.
Seven lots are foreseen, six of which are Parliamentary, for distribution of EUR 2.751 million.
The opposition Union-Lithuanian Christian democrats should receive more than 0.66 million euros, for the governing Union of the States and the Greens - about 0.55 million euros, for the opposition Party of Social Democrats - about 0.5 million euros, for the opposition Liberals Movement - almost 0.4 million euros, for the non-attached Labour Party of the Seimas - about 0.23 million euros, for the recently reigned Party of Law and Justice - almost 0.22 million euros, for the Parliament, but not for the ruling, nor for the opposition - for the Polish election campaign - about 0.18 million euros.
Under the law currently in force, which will be followed by the GCC in allocating budget money, grants are awarded to parties who meet the requirements of the law and who have received at least 3% of the votes in the last elections to the Seimas, municipal councils and the European Parliament.
This is why the current legal framework does not allow only the LSDDP established this spring to expect to receive money from the budget.
For this party has not yet participated in any election.
It is true that the ruling coalition is trying to change the law so that social workers can receive at least a couple of hundreds of thousands of euros as the next year's three elections - self-government, President and European Parliament.
The respective amendments to the political parties and the budget laws adopted by the Seimas were passed on by President Dalia Grybauskaitė.
The Seimas has not yet decided on this veto, but the representatives of the governing bodies Mr Kirkkila and the leader of the country-specifics, Ramūnas Kabauskas, believe that the Parliamentarians will seek to reject the opposition of the President.
However, it will not be possible to do this until this Thursday's meeting of the LAG, so according to Mr Matingitytė, 'grants will be divided according to the legal order that has existed to date'.
It is true that the President of the KGB did not reject the rejection by the Seimas of the President's veto or new amendments to the budget allocation to parties this week, the Commission may consider the decision to grant an additional grant to individual political forces, including the LSDDP.
"We will take into account the entire legal environment in which we are implementing the laws that we have adopted," she said.
If the Seimas were able to reject the veto and new laws would enter into force, they would allocate additional money to the parties, with the corresponding amounts in addition borrowed for that purpose.
The grants already allocated to the seven parties would not be affected by such a decision.

Possirenko: Clients of the murder of activists Handziuk must be punished
"I would like to say that no version - or more than 20 today - will be rejected.
Each will be very carefully checked in accordance with the examination procedures.
I, as President, do not have the opportunity to obtain information that could undermine the conduct of the investigation.
However, the authorities must ensure transparency and the law enforcement authorities must work effectively.
Only in this way will it be possible to learn the truth and punish evil," said Mr Posošenko at a meeting with young people on Tuesday in Kiev.
He stressed that he is the most interested in clarifying the murder of Mr. Handziuk, and the murder of murderers, organisers of crime and clients, 'take the necessary responsibility'.
'After this case has been relisted in the execution (the boy), they are completely right and rightly threatened with imprisonment to a living head,' the President of Ukraine said.
He rightly described the public requirement for an open and impartial investigation of the case.
Mr Poroshenko stressed that the statements of representatives of the law enforcement authorities in the parliament should show that 'the authorities are determined to bring criminals and murderers to justice whatever they are no longer'.
He also said that political speculation on this subject would not help to clarify the situation, but would become more confused.
"I call on all, and power, and opposition forces, not to waste unjustified arguments and, God, not to use this killing for public relations," the president said.
On the contrary, we now need to unite and ensure that the study is effective, fair and transparent, and fast - such as to build public confidence.
We just have no other way."
'No one will be allowed to take advantage of this situation in the country's destabilising situation,' he assured.
In July, when he fought against corruption, Handziuk was attacked with acid in the city of Cherson.
She was counselor of mayor of this southern city of Ukraine.
After the attack, a woman was hospitalized, but she died on Sunday in the hospital.
On Tuesday, the Prosecutor General of Ukraine submitted a declaration of resignation to the police and prosecutors without clarifying the perpetrators of this attack.
After her death, the authorities received accusations from public activists that they were unable to carry out a proper investigation.
The activists also demanded the resignation of the Prosecutor General and the Minister for the Interior.
"I am making my declaration of resignation today," said Mr Lucenka, on the basis of his study report.
Parliament still has to accept the resignation of the prosecutor.
Lucenka accused the activists of exerting pressure on the investigation and leading to important information, making it difficult to identify K.Handziuk's murder perpetrators.
Bill Gates presented the toilet without water
By delivering a futuristic toilet, Bill Gates' transition from traditional such facilities to waterless water was compared with the computer revolution of the 1970s.
The founder of Microsoft Bill Gates at the exhibition in Beijing presented the high-tech toilet, which does not need water in the water pipe, and said "Reuters".
The toilet without water works in accordance with the principle of solid and liquid waste separation.
Both types of sewage are processed into chemical fertilisers.
"The technologies you see here are the greatest achievements in the field of sanitation in the last 200 years," Bill Gates quoted "Bloomberg".
The technological toilet was created with the funds of the charity fund established by Bill Gates and his wife, Melinda.
Within seven years, the fund spent $200 million on a facility that could turn man’s waste into fertilisers or water.
In total, Bill Gates said that there were about 20 toilet models.
The machine is now finished and can be sold.
However, in order for such toilets to be produced massively, the Gates Foundation is ready to spend another 200 million.
According to the Gate Fund, 500 thousand children under five die every year due to poor sanitation conditions in the world.
The fight against poor sanitation, such as cholera and others, increases the amount of money spent on health, which already amounts to 233 billions.
To better illustrate the sanitation situation that needs to be improved, Bill Gates is presenting the toilet with a glass of fecals.
According to him, it is a good reminder that in a small example "can be 200 trillion rotavirus cells, 200 thousand bacteria causing infectious diseases, 100 thousand worm parasite eggs".

This pesticide, sold under the names "Vapam" and "Sectgon", is authorised in Europe until 2022 when a new safety inspection is to be carried out.
"There was no other choice but to remove it from the market, whether or not there are alternatives," said F. Weber.

President Paul Biya, attached to the seventh term of office in Cameroon after the counter-troversity elections
Through the ceremony under the supervision of Parliament's President, Cavaye Yeguie Djibril, 85-year-old P. Biya promised to protect the 'unitity and unity' of the West African State.
The oldest President of Africa, who has been governing his country for 35 years, has been declared a winner in the 7th elections on October, which have gathered 71% of the votes.
However, the elections were covered by low turnout, violence and suspected fraud.
On the eve of Biya's inauguration, 79 students and three school staff, including directors, were captured in one presbiterian school in the North Western region, where English-speaking separatists carry out an armed campaign for independence.
Most 22 million people in Cameroon are French and one fifth are English.
In 2016, the North West and the Neighbouring Province started to claim autonomy in the event of a dissatisfiedness regarding alleged discrimination in the fields of education, judiciary and economics.
In 2017, P. Biya refused to give up radically announced an independent state, "the Republic of Armenia", and raised weapons.
According to NGOs, at least 400 civilian and more than 175 security force officials were killed this year through separatist attacks and government response operations.
More than 300 000 people have fled from violence, some of them cross the border to Nigeria, but many have been forced to live in semi-false forests.
During the elections in October in the North Western region, only 5% of voters voted and 15% in the South Western province.
In both parts of the country, Mr Biya collected two thirds of the votes.
Pre-election of Conservatives: errors due to lack of investigation
"Some of the places have been missing - understand that the party has organised everything with its resources.
Some municipalities have allowed their premises to be used, but not everywhere there have been voting boots because we cannot buy them.
Thank you to those who popped up," said politics.
According to him, complaints are received, but their content is not substantially altered, and the lesions themselves are not of a malignant nature.
"There was a dream.
Not all the people who took part in the elections had experienced - they were also in news.
So not all of the actions were in line with our order.
It was therefore necessary to warn the CRC that the principles we described were respected.
These complaints do not, however, give rise to doubt about the results," said A. Anušauskas.
According to the President of the CC, there have been cases where ballot-papers were unprinted - and once they are known, the ballot-papers found in ballot-papers were cancelled without seal.
Some towns lacked space, but according to Anušauskas, complaints and violations involve several dozens of ballot papers.
'Well, because the difference of several thousand, it's really not making a fundamental difference to the election results,' A. Anušauskas explained.
It is said that the party's membership in the elections was 55 %, while the activity of non-participants was 69 %.
Both candidates had 400 observers, and 600 people worked in commissions.
Neither does the results announced on Sunday change - 79% of voters voted for the winning Ingrid Schimonytis (16418 votes), while 21% voted for Vygaud Ušacka (4441 votes).
On 17 November, the TS-LKD Council will officially support Mr Šimonytė's candidacy in the country's presidential elections in May next year.

Kęstutis Strupas requests the annulment of the VTEK Decision
Kęstutis Strupas, the former Director-General of the Vilnius University Santara clinics, asks for the annulment of the decision of the Supreme Commission for Official Ethics (VTEK) – it has recognised that transactions have not been declared in time and thus violate the law.
Mr Strupo's complaint was examined on Tuesday by the Vilnius Regional Administrative Court.
The decision will be published on 26 November.
The applicant requests the annulment of the VTEK decision of 23 May, BNS informed the representative of the court Sigita Jinavivičienė Baltadunė.
Mr Strupas believes that gifts for family members should not be declared, he claims that he has understood the exception from the law.
In May, VTEK announced that K. Strupas and Silvia Strupienė, the head of the Ambulatory Rehabilitation Division of the Republican Vilnius University Hospital, were then removed from Santara's clinics and violated the provisions of the law governing the declaration of private interests.
The investigation established that four transactions were not declared within the prescribed time limits: loan taken from the bank by the spouse, bank acquisition in 2017, gift given to the daughter in 2017, apartment, and loan granted and not repaid to the spouse in 1996.
S. Strupienė also declared these transactions out of time.
Persons who have violated the law on the coordination of public and private interests in the civil service may not be encouraged for the year.

Last year, according to Info TV, Mr Strupas presented his daughter real estate with a value of 125 thousand euros.
However, the aforementioned data were not indicated in the declarations of interests by the former head of the Santara clinics and his wife.
Legal protection Mrs Strupas, along with at least ten other persons, has made allegations in corruption research - according to law enforcement, winning purchases of public computers and software in clinics, has demanded an unfair financial reward from businesses, it has been disguised as support.
In this way, Mr Strupas is suspected to have spoken at least five times during public procurement in the field of IT in Santara clinics.
Mr Strupe himself is denying his fault.
The corruption alleged Professor Strupas was dismissed in September from the position of Head of Santarea's clinics.
In a decision of the Ministry of Health and Vilnius University of Santara's clinic partners' working relationship with Mr Strupus to terminate at his own request.
He has been in charge of the hospital since November 10, 2013.

He has been appointed by the Prosecutor General on 12 May 2016 following the continuing attempts to remove his predecessor, Viktor Šokinas, suspected of being responsible for corruption for senior officials and politicians, from this post.
Minister of Energy Ž. Vaičiūnas meets representatives of Orlen Lietuva
As Elt reported by Aurelija Vernicka, the advisor to the Minister of Energy, the meeting will address the achievement of renewable energy targets in the transport sector by 2020 and beyond.
According to the European Commission (EC), transport is the only sector currently not achieving a consolidated EU-level trajectory in the National Renewable Energy Action Plans - a share of renewable energy in 2015.
The EC estimates that progress towards a binding 10% target in the transport sector is rather slow due to various difficulties, including rather high greenhouse gas reduction costs and unclear regulation.

The German Internal Intelligence Officer lost his post
The conversion of 55-year-old H.G. Maassen has also been blessed by the statement that his problems led to the "radical left power" of Markel's coalition.
As a result, he was not transferred to another position, as promised earlier, but forced to take a stand for caution.
Among other things, it turned out last weekend that, a few weeks ago, at a meeting of representatives of European internal intelligence organisations in Warsaw, Mr Maassen criticised the 'navi' immigration policy by Mr Merkel.
The German Minister of the Interior, who defended the intelligence manager at the press conference on Monday, stated that the latter comments by Mr Maassen were unacceptable and that he was "relieved personally".

Congenital girls break stereotypes about wedding dresses
A girl with a white blow in a bride dress - a mission (no) possible?
Can a white swan sailing towards the altar be larger than the size of S or M and still look attractive?
Plus size reality show "Didžio (r) Evolution" will already prove today that the beauty of the bride and eligence does not depend on the female's kilograms.
But that's not all - one of the project's girls will have her boyfriend on the filming field tonight leaning on the tears of happiness.
"There are those who believe that bigger girls do not have the attention or the gaze of the boys.
It's just a myth - my boyfriend is a sporter himself, but I like him, as I am, and he doesn't need some standard figure from me," Aurika, who will speak the show before his wedding dress.
Wedding dress is not easy, in all senses, clothing - it's a complicated construction, it's a lot of materials, it's a heavy dress, it's not comfortable to move.
Some women also believe that a bigger girl in the white dress will look even bigger and therefore less confident of yourself.
I can assure you that this "problem" model has been properly chosen," explains one of the commission members of the show, fashion designer Robert Kalinkin.
The girls' fate in the project R. Kalinkin decides together with the entire commission - plus the size of the fashion house opened by Erika Vitulskine, the photographer and the social media star Nagliu Bieranc, and the TV producer Laura Pupute.
"In the event of a girl who has to say good-bye to the show, there are a lot of Chinese among the members of the commission - all of us represent different spheres and the winner of the show in different ways.
The task of demonstrating wedding dresses has been made difficult, and this - now I can reveal - has shown that there have been two newcomers that have certainly not been worse than old people.
It was a special evening in all its meanings," says Mr Kalinkin.
Young people - 23 years of scandalous behavior in one of the best performing events of summer reality, Eve and Mother Dovile, 31 years of exceptional beauty, took part in the selection of "Didžio (r) evolution" and got to the top 20.
Unfortunately, after the first high-opening picture of girls on the streets of Vilnius City, they had to say goodbye to the project.
The show's girls were returned to the LNK audience for their favorite vote on the TV portal.
The international recognition has been taking place in Lithuania for the second week – here the girl will compete for the first name of the star in the country plus the size of the star.
So far, only eight have left them - and all of them are well aware that the winner will only be one.
Intriguing and unpredictable reality show "Didžio (r) Evolution" week starts this Monday evening at 20:30 through LNK.
actor I. Elba has been chosen as the most sexualist man in the world
The US "People" magazine declared the most sexy man in the world this year.
Idris Elba, a 46-year-old British actor, became her.
Although a man claims that this message was unexpected, he did not make a laugh about the new title.
I thought, "You can't be!
Seriously?"
Then I looked myself in the mirror, and I thought, yes, I look sexy today, and I laughed at the actor.
When Idris spoke openly, he named this title as a very pleasant feeling of comforting his ego.
The British star is sure to have often come in by the misguided words and fascination that made his childhood uneasy, because he was "very high and inexpensive."
The young actor did not please and become a kind of subject for peers and because of his rare and unusual name and his African origin.
"It's just that I raised my musts and made my muscles the biggest guy in my city area," Idris smiles.
When a man loses his pride on theOse screens, Elba works with disputing parties held in Spain, and especially in squambling Ibiza.
In time, a man likes a Thai box and has a song that is realizing, creating his own line of clothing.
The British actor believes that the most important thing for him in the world is family, so he plans a wedding with the engagement of Sabrina Dhowre.
I. Elba became the 33rd most sexy man in the world, who was chosen by People.
In 2017, the title was given to Blake Shelton.

Controllers no longer require 20 km of construction of waste incinerators
Vilnius Cogeneration Power Plant is being built near the Gariūnai market.
The managers no longer assume that a 20 - mile [20 km] distance from settlements would be maintained in the construction of waste incineration plants.
The Head of the Environmental Protection Committee "State" Kęstutis Mažeika registered at Seimas on Monday in an amendment to the Waste Management Law, which refuses such a claim.
According to Mr. Mazeikos, the 'state' group, which previously supported the provision on a 20 km distance, promises to support the correction for its refusal.
Mr Mažeika's amendment provides that waste incineration plants could be constructed from January 2019 to the requirements of environmental protection and public health protection laid down by laws.
He admits that the amendments were raised by the President's doubts about such a ban.
"In view of the definition of the territory of residence, it is clear that it would be almost impossible to discover a place where the above-mentioned objects could be built," the chairman of the committee states.
Most of the Spanish authorities opposed the President's veto amendments to strengthen the construction of waste incineration plants.
In addition to the construction of insurance waste incineration plants less than 20 km from settlements, the amendment provided for permission for the Government to take decisions on the future of two power plants already constructed, taking into account the interests of public health.
The latter provisions are not proposed by Mr. Mazeika.
An energy group "Lietuvos energija" is built in Vilnius for waste and biofuels, and in Kaunas, together with Fortum Heat Lietuva, a Finnish energy group.
The latter is already burning waste in Klaipėda.

By telephone, the British Prime Minister Theresa May offered an opportunity to review the mechanism of the so-called countermeasures agreement, which would allow for an open border between the Province of Northern Ireland of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland of the European Union.
The Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar promised to consider this proposal, but rejected any possibility for Britain to withdraw unilaterally from this agreement, as stated in the report published by the Irish Government.
In the interview, Mr May has "enabled the revision of the safeguards mechanism", which is set out in it.
'Waradkar has made it clear that there is an open review of new proposals, provided that the outcome of such review is not linked to a unilateral decision to terminate the imposition of restrictive measures,' says the Government's report.
The Brexit negotiators have not found an acceptable solution to avoid checks at the British and Irish land border, when Britain leaves the common market and the customs union next year.
The two parties agree on the 'prohibitive measures' to maintain the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland open until a larger trade agreement is signed to ensure that no additional customs controls at the border are carried out.
The EU wants Northern Ireland to continue to comply with EU customs rules, but London wants it to be applied on a temporary basis to the United Kingdom as a whole.
The Daily Telegraph newspaper announced on Monday that the Secretary of Brexit Dominica Raab wants Britain to withdraw from the safeguards agreement unilaterally in three months' time.
However, Mr Varadkar has said to journalists in Dublin that his government 'is unable to support this.'
'The three-month or limited time-limits are not worth the paper on which it will be written' he stated.
In the past, London and Brussels did not confirm the information about the Brexit breakthrough in the negotiations after the announcement in Britain that the agreement was reached by hand.
'I would say that we are continuing to make progress in the negotiations, but there is still work,' said Mr May representative in London.
Margaritis Schin, a representative of the European Commission, also said to journalists: 'We are not yet there'.
Nobel Prize winners are calling for access to reliable information
On Monday, a group of prominent thinkers, including Nobel Prize winners, issued a declaration calling for the right to obtain reliable information in the online era.
Among the 25 signatories to the International Declaration on Information and Democracy, there are economists Amartya Sen (Amartija Sen) and Joseph Stiglitz (Dzosefas Stiglica), Iranian lawyer and human rights activist Shirin Ebadi (Sirin Ebadi), and the writer of the Nobel Prize for Literature Mario Vargas Losa (Marijus Vargas Lilosa).
'We are calling on the leaders of good will to take action on all continents to strengthen democratic models and open public debate, through which citizens can make decisions on the basis of facts,' says the Group's report.
They argue that the 'global area of information and communication' is a common good that 'must be protected in order to strengthen freedom of expression and opinion'.
"People have a fundamental right to access information which is freely collected, processed and disseminated on the basis of the principles of commitment to the truth, views of pluralism and rational methods of finding facts," the authors added.
The document asks for help from world leaders, including US President Donald Trampa, who often criticises the 'unreal news' but regularly accused of distorting facts.
The world leaders should express their position on this issue when they meet in Paris on 11-13 November, called for a signatar.
This declaration was drawn up within two months under the leadership of Mr Ebadi and Christophe Deloire, the head of the media freedom and the media protection organisation "Reporters without borders" (RSF) based in Paris.
Among other signatories, he was the President of Senegal, Abdu Diuf, a Chinese lawyer and human rights activist, Teng Biao, and political scientist Francisco Fukuyama (Frensis Fukuyama).
The Seimas approved higher fines for harmful products
The Seimas approved amendments to the Product Safety Act providing for penalties for breaches of product safety to be increased.
Amendments to the Chamber were approved unanimously.
As Mr Antonio Vinkus, member of the Seimas Committee on Health, said on the new draft, it is welcome that the objectives set relate to better protection of consumers of products.
Its provisions are also aligned to the requirements of the Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
"My head, in the proposed draft law, is allocated to all actors involved in the supply and distribution process: producers, service providers, importers, distributors and others.
As the practice shows, the current system of fines does not always prevent further infringements because the entities that pay the fines continue to commit repeated infringements," said Mr Vinkus.
The draft was prepared by the Ministry of Economy and was supplemented with proposals by the Seimas Economic Committee after the approval of the Government.
The amendments to the Law aim to increase penalties for infringements, to strengthen the protection of consumer rights, to give more power to market surveillance authorities and to establish a clear framework for product safety and surveillance of compliance.
At present, according to the Ministry of Economy, there is no obligation for producers to properly label the product, thereby ensuring its traceability.
Moreover, according to the Ministry, the market surveillance authorities did not grant access to the territory, buildings, and premises of manufacturers and suppliers to carry out checks, which complicates the work of the authorities.
The assessment of the ministry, the six-month time limit for imposing fines and warnings, shall be too short to establish the infringement, to carry out the investigation and to impose a fine.
Also, according to the Ministry, the penalties imposed are not effective enough.
Companies often repeatedly violate the requirements of the law - in 2017, only 14 companies did it.
The Ministry of Economy has proposed to impose an obligation on manufacturers to properly label the product, in order to ensure its traceability in order to facilitate market surveillance authorities to clarify suppliers of non-compliant products.
It is also proposed to grant market surveillance authorities the right to access, within the framework of public product safety controls, the territory, buildings, premises and inspections of operators who manufacture, supply products to the market.
The intention is to increase fines for violations of the law.
A fine of between EUR 150 and 2 500 (now 144 to 1.448) would be imposed on the manufacturer, importer or authorised representative who has placed the product on the market and the distributor which made it available on the market.
If the State Consumer Rights Protection Authority (VVTAT) or other market surveillance authority decides to prohibit the placing on the market and the supply of dangerous products or the provision of dangerous services, a fine of between EUR 1 000 and 5 000 (now between EUR 868 and 4 344) would be imposed.
Failure to comply with the requirement to withdraw dangerous products from the market, to recover them from consumers and to destroy them would impose a fine of between EUR 2500 and EUR 6 500 (now between EUR 1 448 and EUR 5 792).
Where dangerous products have caused damage to the health of the consumer, a fine of between EUR 2 500 and EUR 15 000 (now between EUR 1 448 and EUR 11584) would be imposed.
Where dangerous products cause death to the consumer, a fine of between EUR 6 500 and 25 000 (now between EUR 5 792 and 23 169) would be imposed.
According to the Minister, a fine of up to EUR 25 000 is imposed in Poland and Austria for infringement of legislation on product safety (minimum amount is not fixed), Belgium - from EUR 26 to EUR 600 thousand, Romania - from EUR 155 to EUR 666, Bulgaria - from EUR 125 to EUR 7 500.
10th - year - old child: raped family member
Millions of people have been attacked by the event in Colombia.
A 10 - year - old brother was raped by a girl who gave birth to a healthy boy.
The baby saw the world as a result of Caesar’s harvest, but both the girl and her baby feel good.
For a while, they were supervised by doctors.
There's got to be some time left before the young mother and the kid get out of the house.
"On the basis of the information that I received from the police officers, the young child became pregnant after she was sexually exploited by a member of the family - a brother," said the director of the hospital where birth was accepted to one foreign TV.
The police investigate the incident of rape and violence against the child.
Norwegian Armed Battalion took part in NATO exercises in the outermost and most remote areas
The troops from the Norwegian armed forces took part in the series of complex exercises in the mountains north of Oslo.
It's part of NATO exercise "Trisector Connection 2018" - the largest NATO exercise since the end of Cold War.
Most soldiers from the second Norwegian military battalion after September 11th terrorist attacks spent a lot of time away from home in places such as Afghanistan - that is, in warm lands.
But most of all, they are skilled in fighting under the Arctic conditions, and these skills are particularly useful now that NATO is changing its focus.
In recent days, soldiers in the mountains from Tynsto, often in the outermost and most remote areas, have taken part in the inscanized battles against genuine British soldiers.
Warms have the ability to survive in this cold wild nature, but in the cold climate they have to stretch a much higher weight on their shoulders - one bag weighs about 50 kg.
The soldiers who are in charge say that they share their skills on how to survive and fight under such conditions with other NATO troops.
According to the soldiers, this exercise, which, as no other, is a real war, will teach them to be ready if there is a serious threat.

It is obvious that after Vygadu has left the next election struggle, this stage of my life is over," said Mr Mačiulis.
He said he did not regret the decision to leave Kaunas policy for support to V. Ušack, but regretted that "Lithuania lost its unique opportunity to have a real lead in the context of international relations".

Workers in Kaunas Castle: what are they doing here?
When the Kaunas people noticed the workers who were in the castle of Kaunas, they felt that the reconstruction works of the preserved tower had finally taken place.
The director of Kaunas City Museum Gabrielis Sužiedis believed that the works of changing the protective roof cover were taking place in the southwest tower with a piece of protective walls.
According to the preceding article, the roofs will be cans.
"The damaged coating of the emergency condition was a threat to the surrounding people - people could fall into and cause injury - so it had to be changed.
The stones were no longer resistant to moisture, so heritage was also damaged," the director of the museum explained.
Will these rooftops be similar to those that were centuries ago?
"All works are compatible with heritage and other institutions," Mr.G. Fragmentius added in his attempt to make the result as authentic as possible, but at the same time important and practical side - rooftops must protect the values from moisture.
A universal solution is chosen to work with the heritage.
Prior to this, the tin of elements of Kaunas castle was covered for soviet age, so they no longer had historical values," the director of Kaunas City Museum detailed.
The contract of employment was signed on 2 October.
Works are expected to last for more than three months from the signing of the contract.

This amount was budgeted for this year, according to the speakers.
The works in Kaunas Castle are carried out by the company "Statia".
Kaunas. day.lt is frustrating, as according to research performed, Kaunas castle may have seemed earlier.

Eastern Europe Studies Centre will cooperate with two significant US "brain centres"
According to Linas Kojala, the head of EESC, who is located in Vilnius, and which is counting on 13 years of activity in Vilnius, the installation in the USA will allow to implement projects and make the Lithuanian vote heard more on the other side of the Atlantic.
"We have been working in this direction for several months.
I am pleased that the two large institutions see us as partners and are looking for opportunities for joint actions.
I have no doubt that niche activities will be created, as NATO, security, disinformation and the development of the Eastern Partnership countries are being analysed for them as well," said Kojala.
The agreements note that EESC and US institutions will work together to prepare applications for international projects, exchange expertise and knowledge, and conduct expert visits.
This should be particularly useful for Lithuanian analysts, as both partners have a great international reputation.
FPRI has been active since 1955, bringing together almost one hundred top analysts.
In the latest global ranking of analytical centres created by the University of Pennsylvania, FPRI took place in its category seven.
At the same time, CEPA, whose analysts have been invited to consult and work in the highest political institutions in the United States, goes to ten in the same category.
"This will provide more opportunities for Lithuanian analysts working in various institutions to enter the US information space and encourage us to raise the quality card up", added Kojala.
One of the first practical steps should be to help partners distribute the recent EESC analytical publication "Lithuanian Foreign Policy Review" among decision-makers in the USA and in the public space.
The Eastern Europe Studies Centre is based on ongoing projects and is not supported by targeted grants.
Among the EESC partners implementing joint initiatives are the European Commission, NATO, USAID, various international funds, etc.
