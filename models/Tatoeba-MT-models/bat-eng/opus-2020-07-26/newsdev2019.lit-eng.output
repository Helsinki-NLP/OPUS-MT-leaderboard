They are required to live in the home of employers according to the law.
These employees work for a small salary six days a week, up to 18 hours a day.

Dr. Lyn Ognissanti honors the mayor of Bedford.
In the photo: Lina Ognissanti sells ice cream during the warm season of the year, while in the winter it is spergs.
For more than 40 years, women who have been shopping in the centre of the city will be honored by the private reception of the mayor.
Lina Ognissanti, who trades ice creams and sparrows in the kiosk Dinky Donuts on the road of Bedford Midland Road, was invited to the family by the pope teas.
Almost 3 000 people have signed a petition online to be awarded or recognised.
Mr Ognissantis said that she had such praises.
According to the Mayor of Bedford, Dave Hodgson, Mr. Ognissanti and children and grandchildren were invited to his office to see the city's regs and historical artifacts as well as to drink the pott's tea.
“Lina Bedforfe holds a special place and its kiosk is part of the city centre”, he said.
I'm glad she accepted my invitation, and I look forward to our meeting in my office so I can thank Lin for her work in our city."
Mr Ognissanti thanked her, in her words, "for the pleasant" people of Bedford who thought about her, and said: "This is a great honour and a beautiful act."
The petitioner, Sarah Mahmoud, said that he did not expect to have so many signatures.
When he heard about the admission planned for the end of the year, he said: “I am very happy about Lina, because she deserves it because of her great character.”
In Kel, with Alster's Lambretta club
The "Lambretta" motorists were unchanged cultural satellites of fashion in the 1970s.
The group of fans of the Italian Motorizer tries to preserve the spirit of those times.
70 years after the establishment of the first Ulbretta club, about 100 motorists from the United Kingdom and Ireland gathered this weekend in Ferman County.
One of the two first club members, Chris Wilson, acquired the first Lambretta in 1966 for about £40.
“I was a motor vehicle only, but I learned that I could use it and otherwise.
It was a bit of a sport.
I didn't engage in fashion culture, and I'm probably too old for that now," he said.
"It was quite cheap and reliable, you could have bought it at an affordable price, and you bought it to do anything more than just drive from A to B."
He attended a separate start race of Lambretta at the YT ring of the Isle of Man.
The first Ulster Lambretta club was founded in the early 1980s and was transformed 12 years ago.
“Along in 1971, motorists and other forms of transport were increasingly interested in people, and clubs were also affected by general disturbances, so I thought: “All, it’s the end,” said Chris.
"At some time, interest came back and, obviously, it grew more and more."
Philip Steele is a Secretary for Members of the Ulbretta Club, currently with 97 members.
“All motives are different.
Some members have been influenced by fashion culture, since it has almost everything started.
Others are race enthusiasts or handicrafts – you will find all kinds of people here.
There are also those who are just interesting winds.
Many engines are modified, so there are no two equal.
You can not change the engine and drive quietly at speeds of 35 or 40 miles per hour, adapted to narrow Italian streets, but some members have improved this.
Some highly modified engines could probably reach a speed of up to 100 miles per hour."
During the weekend, there were faults, some of which had to be pushed on by the engine.
And even though the weather in Northern Ireland is not always as pleasant as that of Lambretta's Italian homeland, this time, the motorists in Ferman's County had sunshine.
Ruth Davidson asks the author for silence on the „Brexito” issue
Mr Davidson asked his fellow Conservatives for a period of time so that the Prime Minister could reach an agreement on Brexit.
The head of Scotland's industries said that, within two years of the EU referendum, there was time for debate.
She expressed her opinion following Boris Johnson's words on the Prime Minister's plan, which he called "a crazy and totally absurd".
She said that it was time to support the Prime Minister.
She said at the party conference in Birmingham: “In the past two years, we have had time to debate.
The former Secretary for Foreign Affairs has served in one of the best offices in the history of the country, and during that period most of the current plan has been drawn up, which has already been recognised in November last year.
Conservatives must now support the Prime Minister, allow her to conclude the deal and help to implement plans in the country.
I think the silence period would be very useful."
Her comments followed the sharp criticism of Brexit's debate, which was not the first time announced by former Secretary of Foreign Affairs Boris Johnson.
In an interview with BBC journalist Andrew Marro, Theresa May later assured that it believed in Brexitu and that its office's plan could provide a favourable free trade transaction with the European Union.
Mr Davidson also said that when he took part in other elections, he would commit himself to preventing the second Scottish referendum on independence, because in 2014 "it was promised that such an event would be the only one in their generation".
When asked about a possible repeated referendum on Brexito, she replied: “If we are talking about Scotland’s history, I have repeatedly stated that you cannot repeat the referendum if you are a nationalist and the result does not satisfy you.
I would change it if I said you could hold another referendum on Brexito because I expected a different result."
Road M8 After Police Incident Reopened
The Highway M8 was reopened after the police incident at Glasgow.
According to the police, a few years earlier than 7 p.m. is closed in both directions at the 15 Townhead intersection in the event of a pedestrian’s concern.
Traffic on closed roads did not happen for three hours and was disturbed in the city of Marathon Great Scottish Run.
In 20 C.E., a man was subsequently taken to the Royal Hospital of Glasgow for research.
A friend of Christine'a Blasey Ford approved a statement on sexual abuse suspected of Bretta Kavanaugh
Lelanda Keyser, who was a friend at high school with Dr. Christine'a Blasey Ford, accused of being a candidate for the Supreme Court of sexual abuse, when they were both teenagers, wrote a letter to the Senate Court Committee and explained that, although he did not remember the party at the house during which the attack may have taken place, he believed in Ford's story.
In the past Keyser made a statement through his lawyer that he did not remember that party and did not even know if he had met Kavanaugh.
While witnessing against the Committee on Courts on Thursday, Kavan Augh often mentioned Keyser's statement as proof of his innocence, he did not mention Keyser's statement that she believed in Ford's words.
On Friday, President Trump instructed the FBI to carry out a study during the week when the Republican senator Jeff Flake and other moderate senators asked for time to study and postpone the entire Senate's vote on Kavanaugh for a week.
On Saturday, Keyser sent a letter to the committee through his lawyer, saying that he wanted "how can you contribute to the further FDB investigation" on Kavanaugh.
“However, as my client has already explained, she does not know Judge Kavanaugh and does not remember the party or gathering in which he was with or without Dr. Ford”, says Keyser’s lawyer Howard Walsho.
The letter goes on to explain that Keyser "does not leave the story of Dr Ford and has already said to the press that you believe in Dr Ford certification."
"However, the simplest and irresistible truth is that it cannot approve it, because it does not remember the abovementioned event," the letter continues.
Kavanaugh's friend Mark Judge, supposedly being close to the attack, claimed also to contribute to the FBI investigation.
The illegally convicted population of Chicago tells us about life with a corrupt police officer and is in a crime
The Chief Prosecutor of Illinois is trying to change the history of the Chicago police after the dark period.
It is believed that an unfair policeman exploited innocent people in social housing and unwarrantedly arrested a large number of people.
To date, 42 people have been convicted.
Instead of the Wells project, only an empty area has been left in the area of the social housing project, and in the past more than a decade, the policemen in Chicago have used nothing to corrupt.
They were led by Sergeant Ronald Watts.
The residents accused him and his tactic team of extortion of property, counterfeiting and rape of police reports and evidence.
Willie Martin and Cleon Glover are two of those sentenced to date by General Prosecutor Kim Foxx of Cook County.
“If you didn’t work with him, you ended up being bad.
You were his enemy.
You prevented him from acting and earning," said Cleon Glover.
“ I was really afraid.
I wanted to escape from that area,
But I didn't have where to go," said Willie Martin.
The lawyers of the Fox Ethics Division review further 30 to 40 cases related to Watts.
Ida B. Wells Social Housing resident Landon Allen said that many people decided not to keep up with Watts.
"Many things didn't last," he said.
"But it wasn't important."
According to another former resident, Clarissos Baker, no one believed in the people’s words about the sergeant who performed official duties.
“He has his gang.
Who will believe us?"
said Baker.
Joshua Tepfere, a member of the Chicago program for the validation of the university, says that until now no one really believed in them.
“It’s long since these people didn’t seem important to them and they didn’t care, because they’re black people living in social housing, so they thought they were still a crime,” said Tepfer.
‘Sergent Watts was in prison for 22 months in 2013 for an attempt to steal the FBI informant.
Martez Wise is also placed in prison by Watts.
I just had a son born.
For four years, I couldn't be with him.
He almost didn't know me because he was just born, so I had to reconnect with him," said Wisse.
"I've lost four years in business."
For 72 years living in “Fidelity” believes in the success of block circuits, virtual reality and artificial intelligence
The potential of “Fidelity” block chains has been observed by 2018 when all corporations started talking about this technology.
The Director General Abby Johnson led investments in cryptovalists – the most risky and volatile asset class in recent years.
“In about two years ago, I and other senior leaders were simply curious about what is happening, especially in the becino market,” said Johnson.
We started to talk and we realized that we had to find out.
The curiosity led to the start of the "cast" bitcoins in the New Hampshire unit, when the price of this crypto was about $180.
Last December, the price was almost $20 000, and Johnson said: “We were surprised that when the price rose, we started to earn, even though we never expected to do so. ”
She didn't specify how many bitocinos "scake" or how much "Fidelity" earned.
"Fidelity" employees are clearly interested in these technologies.
The employees' club, called "Bitus and Blocks", is now equipped with around 2,600 members to organise seminars and meetings with specialists.
The company has agreed with Coinbase, which has enabled Fidelity clients to check the cryptoval balance using the Fidelity mobile app.
In 2015, it was made possible to contribute funds through bitcoins.
According to Johnson, the company rejected most of the other possible uses of bitocinos or, at least for a short time, refused them.
We're trying to monitor the market.
And so far Katie Chase, the chief strategist of the Fidely Technology Centre for Applications and the head of the Block Chain Incubator (which is part of FCAT), are looking for ways to use public and business block chains.
The Chase could not comment on specific projects, but it showed that it had a great deal of interest for customers, partners and employees.
“It’s still very new.
If you become aware of the information, you will understand that you are still trying to find evidence of the concept," said Chase.
We have tried to apply block circuits to different situations, and we have learned a lot, but the technology is not so advanced as to solve these problems."
So far, she says, the group pays more attention to attempts to understand the nature of these obstacles.
They are trying to understand how to calculate the value of physical items such as works of art or to use block circuits in the supply chain.
"As long as it is not at the centre of attention, I think it will end up having an interest," said Chase.
"Fidelity" will be ready for it."
She set out, as an example, the Pebble clock, which had been completely unsuccessful in marketing standards, but finally got the Fidelity back.
Her group has created an app for the smart clock that has stopped manufacturing after three years, collecting millions through a Kickstarter joint funding project.
Apple Watch was ready on the market.
It soon applied the Pebble app for the new Apple product.
“We were not blindly convinced that the Pebble clock would be popular, but wanted to be ready if people like smart clocks,” she said.
"We have accumulated knowledge and we were ready when smart clocks were released into the mass market."
The Slavesian island was destroyed by the earthquake and the tsunami
On Friday, September 29, the Indonesian island Sulavesi was hit by a powerful 7.5 - point earthquake that caused a tsunami and killed nearly 400 people.
There are many injured and the number of dead is believed to grow.
According to the representative of the Indonesian disaster management agency, electricity and communication are not working, making it difficult to assess the damage in Pala and the nearby Danube fishing community.
The California students worn T-shirts with racial inscriptions
As reported by CNN's subsidiary KGTV, the Escond Schools Union confirmed this week that about 10 students had taken a poorly thought-out decision to show racism at an event for senior classes.
"We are proud that all the diversity and fearless diversity are being accepted in our school," said director Adrian Lepe-Ramire.
"We will not tolerate the promotion of racism and exclusion."
The report also indicates that Escond's secondary school, union officials and local police are investigating the incident.
“The school administrators contacted the parents and guardians of the wrongdoers and will be subject to disciplinary sanctions,” says the report.
According to a report by the police district, the students of the school north of San Diego were wearing t-shirts, with letters, from which a racist record was written, and they were photographed when they were worn.
The school usually confirms the notes in advance, but some students choose their words after taking a photograph of the official picture.
The Union's report states that such conduct "is not consistent with the culture, values or history of the Escond High School".
"We have to understand the impact of our words and actions and take responsibility for the decisions that we make every day," said Lepe-Ramirez.
"Ascondium secondary school continues to foster a culture based on family values and unity throughout the community."
A former student at the Cade Pannell canal KGTV said that in the social media, a offensive picture of him was offended.
"It offended me personally," he said.
“It may have seemed funny to them, but it’s not.
Only unwise people can laugh at such things."
Shaquile's O'Nealo son, waiting for heart surgery, Shareef spends the 1st UCLA season
The son of Shaquile O'Nealo, the Member of the Basketball Museum of Fame, will have to spend the first season of UCLA due to a heart disorder.
According to “TMZ Sports”, O’Neali will undergo heart surgery in order to eliminate the disorder observed by UCLA doctors during a routine examination.
“Thanks to God, UCLA doctors early noticed the problem”, – O'Neal said TMZ.
“As long as rehabilitation takes place, I will attend lectures and be a normal student.
I'll be back very soon."
O'Neal signed an official intention protocol in August, promising to play in the UCLA team, which has already attracted a number of famous names and is one of the best first courses of the country for the season 2018-2019.
“Shareef has improved significantly in secondary school,” said Bruin's chief coach Steve Alford last month.
“He’s a taller, has skills, is athletic and will be a great member of a new team.
We are happy with the composition of this year's team, and Shareef will make a perfect addition to it.
He has a good foundation and can improve on both ends of the site."
According to "247Sports", the 18th century O'Neal is a 4-star candidate, 8th place in 2018 in newcomers' ratings as a heavy attacker and 41th place as a player.
Before joining UCLA, O'Neal helped Crossroads to achieve a record result – 25:9.
Chief son of Sarah Palin being accused of violence against his father
In 28 C.E., track Palin was arrested for three offences, including an attack.
On Sunday, he is not first arrested for domestic violence.
According to the court records, an incident took place at the house of Palin in Vasil, Alaska, where tracker Palin had hurt his father, Todd, in competition with his truck.
The 28th anniversary of the Saturday incident was arrested for three offences, including the attack.
The court records indicate that the dispute began when the husband called to take the truck, but the father refused to hand it over.
As explained in the statement by the court, track Palin was arrested for the crackdown of the first degree and for the fourth degree of attack and for the fourth degree of misdemeanour, and his father was injured in his face and head.
According to the documents, Palin called him out of the police who spoke to him and ordered him not to use weapons.
The court statement also states that a man went up on the garage roof before being arrested.
The court documents contain the words of Sarah Palin that her son was "suffered" and "used some kind of medicine".
It was also recorded that track Palin had previously consumed several bottles of beer.
He was arrested in early 2016 and accused of domestic violence against a woman, of obstructing the reporting of domestic violence and of holding a weapon under violence.
“When I see my son, what he is experiencing when he comes back, I understand other families with the consequences of post-traumatic stress disorder, and I know what injured soldiers are,” said former Republican candidate to vice presidents and Governor of Alaska.
"Now I understand better than ever that America's best people need a chief commander who will respect them and appreciate them."
Elizabeth Warren claims to be provocatives for presidential candidates after the mid-term elections
“The time for women to march to Washington and correct the corrupt government that women have to lead,” said the democrat Senator in speaking to the crowds gathered at the Holjok Town of Massachusetts.
"So I promise that after 6 November, I should think well about whether it is worth standing as President."
Warren, who is trying to defend his post in the competition with the Republican representative of the state of Geoff Deehl, said earlier that the president was unable to get to the office because he wanted to pay attention to work in Senat.
"It is very important to focus on the mid-term elections and stop acting as if the only important thing were the 2020s," she said, speaking to the rapporteurs in the National Press Club in August.
"The main important fight is the mid-term elections for the term of office, and they are important not only in Massachusetts, but also in the country as a whole."
Warren has long been seen as a potential candidate for democrats from 2020 who could compete with President Donald Trump.
However, it would await a difficult initial election struggle, where other well-known democrats may participate – former vice-president Joe Biden, Senator of California Kamala Harris and Senator of New York Kirsten Gillibrad.
Accurate mental health clinic associated with the third mymsling death in less than a year
According to The Mail, a third person had already committed suicide before the end of the year in a luxury psychiatry clinic.
The television commission daughter, Shaquelle Vidal (23), died on April 7, who voluntarily spent almost a month in the West London, Marylebone hospital of Nightingale.
Her boyfriend James Lyle (57) – a manager of a hedge fund, a millionaire and a former sponsor of the Conservative Party – paid the costs of its supervision for five years.
The future chief chef died almost six months after the birth of the celebrity celebrity Daisy Boyd (28), a grandson of Rose Gray, one of the founders of River Cafe.
After the separation, D. Boyd died of the inherited daughter of D. Macmillans (43), who suffered from the crime against cocaine on 5 October, which was illegally carried by a clinician.
Two months ago, the artist Alan MacDonald (61) withdrew from his life when he was released from the hospital for four days.
In May, the Quality Commission criticised the Nightingale clinic because it did not make enough efforts to prevent the introduction of illegal substances.
On 11 March, the daughter of Avo Vidal, the “Mock The Week” company, was registered in Shaquell’s clinic.
Last week at the preliminary hearing of the Westminster Coronaire court, King’s lawyer Katie Gollop said that on 29 March Shaquelle disappeared from AWOL and returned to the impaired mental condition after a week.
Mr Gollop, acting on behalf of Avava Vidal, said: “My client wants to see what happened to Shaquelle, what she has been dealing with and what she has done.”
Mr. Lyle called Shaquelle "I'm a kid."
John Gordillo, a neo-official father of Shaquelle, said: “I know that Shaquelle continued to communicate with James Lyle and he was in New York at that time."
At the meeting of Mr Gordillo, she discovered that on 4 April, Shaquelle called on him and said that he wanted to buy and drink cyanide, and he called clinics 20 minutes after this call “more than dozen times”, but nobody replied.
“It seems to me that the next events could be avoided if someone responded”, he added.
On 5 April, the doctor of the clinic found the mental condition of Shaquelle to be extremely poor."
In less than 48 hours, she went along with a satellite computer cord.
The representative of Nightingale expressed his sympathy to family and friends and said: "Our clinic aims to provide high quality care in a safe, therapeutic environment."

“Led Zeppelin” is again brought to court on the supposed radiant reef of “Stairway To Haven” guitar
“Led Zeppelin” was again brought to court for the guitar reef used in the 1971 song “Stairway To Heaven”, which was allegedly stolen by the group.
Some of the British hits of the 1971 group are said to have been washed.
The Court of Appeal rejected the 2016 ruling that the group had not copied another group under the name "Spirit".
The application was submitted by Spirit guitar trustee Michael Skidmore in 2015.
It seems that the litigation about the Led Zeppelin song "Stairway To Haven" will last a long time – like the song itself.
The group will again stand before the court against the accused of stealing the guitar reef of the 1971 ballad.
The U.S. Court of Appeal rejected the 2016 ruling that the group did not copy hit the start of the band "Spirit" music.
It is argued that the judge had made mistakes, such as falsely informing the jury about copyright laws.
The case has been returned to court.
Michael Skymore, trustee of “Spirit” guitar Randy Wolfe, first brought an action in 2015.
Police gangs ended in Michigan when the policeman crossed over to them to shoot a suspected murderer.
In his girlfriend's murder, the suspected resident of Michigan was arrested after the police gangs that ended after he crossed the police car.
It is suspected that in 33 C.E., Adam Nolin shot his girlfriend in Wajoming, Michigan, 27 C.E. Tia Mae Randall.
He was brought to court on Friday in a hospital where an officer was in contact with a SUV police car, because Nolin shot police officers trying to escape the highway where intensive traffic took place.
Nolin has been charged with five serious crimes, including attacks to kill and escape the police.
“Course at the hospital is not a common case, but it is not the first one,” said the captain of Wajoming Police James Magufee.
"It is subject to appropriate treatment, but the justice process must also continue.
The judges have often adjusted so that it can be implemented."
Nolin's girl's body was found on Thursday in a mobile house in the district "Creexide Estates".
Two children were shot by a shot, and the police immediately identified Nolin as a suspect.
The police then issued a public warning regarding Nolin and provided a short description of the man and his 1996 black Dodge peak.
The man noticed in his pickup and went to the U.S. 131 motorway when the police tried to stop him.
Nolin hit the concrete wall with a pickup, then got out of the car, and let go of the motorway.
As he ran, he shot the police in the run.
One policeman was in the SUV police car and moved Nolin from the back.
The observer recorded the event.
Nolin has been taken to the hospital in a difficult but stable condition and will remain there until he is prescribed and transferred to the Kent Regional Prison.
“This event showed that Western Michigan police risk their health in order to protect the community,” said Magufee.
"They were arrested by a man quite quickly and by appropriate means and we are very proud of them."
A total of two charges have been made against Nolin in order to kill him, and he is also charged with the escape of the police, the carrying of a hidden weapon and the serious crime committed by the use of a firearm.
He is not yet guilty of his girlfriend's murder, because the investigation is ongoing.
“It is known that we are still conducting a murder investigation, which we will soon end, so that we can present it in time to Kent Regional Prosecutor”, said Magufee.
The judge praised a courageous man who smote his teeth into his house to a thief that was incarcerated in his house
The judge did not regret the greatest praise for the courage of the man who stood up against the two criminals who tried to break into his house.
Although one hacker tried to snuff him with a wooden board, David Oldham, in 63 C.E., was not afraid.
A man working for the caretaker of the University’s territory defended, struck both criminals, and struck one of their teeth.
The ravens fled, but after the fights, the blood of Mr. Oldham remained, under which Craig Ford was determined and arrested after four months.
When publishing judgment on Ford, who lost her teeth trying to invade Mr. Oldham's 400 000 pounds of individual house in Ormskerke, Lamashire, King Judge Clement Goldstone, said: “You probably didn't expect such a reaction to Mr. Oldham – when you overheard that you saw only your eyes and nose, you were confronted with him at the house, he hit you.
He also struck your fellowman who tried to break into the second floor and jumped from the roof.
On Friday, when Mr Ford was sentenced to three years and four months, the judge said: “I hope you have learned two lessons.
Firstly, David Oldham should not be irritated, and secondly, it is better not to start with the police.
For your crimes now you have one tooth less than before and you are bitten by a dog.
It's still a little punishment."
He added: “I want to praise Mr. Oldham for the way he responded to your actions. ”
Prosecutor Derek Jones claimed that Ford had committed the crime in 2016 already been sentenced for another break and had to be imprisoned for three years, but was released in a parole.
Mr. Oldham told the royal court of Liverpool that he had jumped when he heard the noise at home about 19.00 a.m. on 5 April.
Jones said: “P. Oldham, who is a wealthy man, was courageously left home and resisted the accused.
When he was fearful of his security, he struck him in his face, so he struck him and slew his teeth.
Then another intruder jumped from the roof in front of Mr. Oldham, who instinctively hit him in his face."
According to Mr. Jones, he took a wooden board and tried to steal Mr. Oldham, and Ford said: “Stop him, he beat my teeth. ”
He said to Mr. Oldham, "If we go, we go out" and, together with Ford, fled from the crime scene.
On August 2, the police caught Ford in the house in Wavertree.
Ford kicked the police dog, then he bit him in his shoulder.
It is believed that the second hacker is still free.
Fords who do not have a permanent place of residence 25 years. Ford admitted guilty of breakage, destruction and dangerous driving, even though this is prohibited and he does not hold a driving licence.
Topic activists, Johnson met the critics
Torus activists have humiliated Boris Johnson today as he was rescued as “a man and an aggressive man”.
P. Johnson, who is trying to please ordinary people in his uncompromising language about Brexit, received a strict evaluation by former Minister of Trade, Digby Jones, who was also supported this afternoon by participants in Birmingham's conference.
David Davis also attacked Mr Johnson because he was concerned about the headlines of the newspapers, not about a strong policy.
Speaking to “MillOnline”, Mr. May ally in the Cabinet of Ministers added that he was simply “noise” because he was unable to be a full leader.
The opposite response came when the former foreign secretary again attacked the Prime Minister's "Chequers" plan and called it "unsatisfactory" and "totally absurd".
Mr Johnson also added that he had a sincere belief in the project, and here she did not agree with the withdrawal at the referendum two years ago.
He also called on the government to support ambitious projects such as the construction of a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland.
However, Mr May resigned that her critics were playing political games, claiming that they were not bluffing and ready for difficult negotiations with the EU.
In an interview with Andrew Marro BBC on the opening of the intertwinment, Mr May said: “I believe in Brexit.
The former Lieutenant Minister for Trade, Lord Jones, now acting independently, has received the approval of the crowd in praise of the prospects of "Brexito".
People spread when he expressed his opinion on Mr Johnson, who supposedly answered "sweep business" to the concerns of businessmen.
Without a specific name, Mr. Johnson, Lord Jones has made it clear that he is "a man and an aggressive man".
“The business is very important, so when he said “sweep business”, the former Secretary of Foreign Affairs has shown that there is actually a small and aggressive man,” he said.
"I totally disagree with him."
Lord Jones also praised his speech in the hall by observing Mr May's reaction to the Salzburg leader's meeting heard the EU leaders' trailers next to the plan of her office.
Ruth Davidson, the leader of the Scottish tools, also criticised Mr Johnson for being a senior official of government during the Brexit negotiations.
The May ally ally in the Cabinet of Ministers said that intervention is not very serious and Mr Johnson does not have enough supporters among the branches in Parliament to be able to expel the Prime Minister.
They said: “Now such news is not very dangerous.
He noises, but he does not have enough supporters in the parliamentary party, and he knows that himself.
We see a significant contrast between David Davis, who has expressed his opinion respectfully, and Boris, who fulfils his personal ambitions."
The business secretary Gregas Clarkas criticised Mr. Johnson, who attacked the entrepreneurs looking skeptically at Brexitto.
Speaking at the conference in Birmingham, Mr Clark said that Mr. Johnson was "fullly wrong".
He said: “I am surprised that something might think like this at all.
There is no successful economy in the world that does not have a successful enterprise."
In an interview with Sky News, Riga on Sunday, Davis acknowledged that the coming months would not be easy because the EU would try to force the United Kingdom to grant many benefits.
However, he believes that the government must not give up and seek a similar agreement to the Canadian Treaty, but not the one proposed by the Cabinet of Ministers.
When asked how Mr Johnson succeeded in leading the mayors, he did not miss the opportunity to invade the former foreign secretary.
In his offer to build a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland, Mr Johnson said: "One of the British policy's weaknesses is that of politicians with fantastic ideas."
He added: “Our communication is chaotic, and many of his ideas are suitable for headlines, but not for strong politicians. ”
Bulgaria spent 80 million pounds of European taxpayers money on poor restoration
Bulgaria spent 80 million pounds of money on European taxpayers for the poor restoration of ancient castles, which now appear to be built from “scourage and cardboard”.
The Balkan country has spent 80 million pounds from the European Regional Development Fund.
Instead of returning the previous greatness, the restoration was a fascination.
In the vicinity of Krakra, local authorities in the territories near the fortress promised to reconstruct works.
The Bulgarian Government has released tens of millions of EU unschooled medieval castles for restoration.
The Balkan country has spent 80 million pounds from the European Regional Development Fund for restoration of ancient castles and fortifications, but instead of returning their previous greatness, it has been agile for construction work.
After the costly reconstruction, it seems like built from “screw and cardboard”, so it is no longer attractive for tourists.
For example, monumentalists were impressed that in the Middle Ages of Pernica, the western Bulgarian city of Pernica, Krakra and the Roman fortas Trayanoviv Vrata near Ihtiman were reconstructed using polymer concrete, most commonly used for the building.
According to The Telegraph, the EU and the Bulgarian government have accepted private agreement that this failure must be learnt.
“Stella Duleva, an architect and monumentist about Trayanovi Vrata, is in the state of the cavalry.”
She held her 16 centuries and is now ruined."
These responses were received after the restoration of Krakra forto in Pernike, and therefore the local government promised the withdrawal of the deliveries in 2019.
Pernica's fortress, due to the false modifications, has been released "pils from the cardboard".
The Byzantine Yailata fort is called a “street fortification” because it has been restored from smooth white blocks that do not fit into the fasade affected by weather conditions.
These unsuccessful efforts are in line with the new doubts about the way in which the European Union makes use of the development funds.
The crowd of stylising batikers on the way to this year's event "Distinguished Gentleman's Ride"
Hundreds of stingy-suited motorcycles from all over the United Kingdom went to the streets on windsurfing motorcycles in order to collect money for the Movember Fund.
The event is called "The Kilnaus gentleman's trip" and is organised annually to raise money and raise public awareness of prostate cancer.
This year, they are selling in London and in 40 other parts of the United Kingdom, including Manchester, Cardiff and Edinburgh.
This year’s events “Distinguished Gentleman’s Ride” take place in the United Kingdom and 650 other cities in the world, bringing over $5.5 million to date (4.2 million £).
The official site of the event says that this year, 120 000 people “encouraged their ties, tied their ties, leveled their interior suits, sat on their classic and amber-style motorcycles and allowed them to collect funds and raise awareness about male health, namely prostate cancer and male mental health.”
Mark Hawwas organized the event "Distinguished Gentleman's Ride" in Sydney for the first time in Australia.
The idea was inspired by the photo of Don Draper, a director of the series “Mad Men”, in which he sits on a classic motorcycle with the best of his row.
In London this year, hundreds of batters, including a proud dog of the tax breed – Sergeant Pipira, took the Tower Bridge.
Tennis sharp Boris Beckeris revealed a cure for skin cancer
Boris Beckeri thanked doctors who successfully removed skin cancer.
The Beckeris photos barely see a small patch at sunglasses.
"It was a routine check and it looks worse than it really is" he said to the German newspaper.
After they discovered that they had been treated against skin cancer, tennis legend Boris Beckeris was photographed with a patch on the nose.
On Wednesday, he published a Twitter message on his health: "I would like to thank Martin Mayr-Brune and Dr Kati Maier from Munich who managed to cure me."
The 50-year-old photos made on Sunday just show a small patch on the sunglasses.
“I visited dermatologist on Monday who removed basic cell carcinoma from me,” said Beckeris to the German publication “Image”.
"It was a routine check and it looks worse than it really is."
Basic cell carcinoma is the most common form of skin cancer, occurring in 75% of cases.
In time, there is a high probability of recovery.
Beckeris currently differs with his wife Lilly Becker (42) and they reported divorces in May.
The tennis star has won six important awards in the competitions of the units, the 13 "Masters Series" titles and the Olympic gold medal at the double match.
He has recently seen entertainment with his friends in 185 Oktoberfest in Munich.
Body volumes did not slow down on the unknown train platform for 24 years.
On the train platform, because of the lack of knowledge about the body, the British Attitude decided not to remain silent.
Jessica Mayho, who won the silver medal this year at the British Athletic Championship, says he was attacked on Friday afternoon at Lids Station.
A 24-year-old and five-foot 11-inch taller Mr. Mayho said that while the train was waiting, it was driven by a man who had been blinded in words.
About 17.00, a man attacked on the platform called "Stor."
However, a rising sporting star who wanted to stand in the British team in the Tokyo Olympic Games in 2020 was disfellowshipped to a man.
Says Peter Mayho, a West of Kitley’s city in Yorkshire: “I was able to keep the eyes open until other people were on a full - scale.
Such people can be frightened and can no longer trust themselves, but it's a MY body, MYA's "mechanism".
After the announcement of Twitter’s adventure, the young Athletica received great support in the social media.
Andy Lewis, a kavalier of the Order of MBE, wrote: “Stor!!!!
Is he drunk or blind?
It's a fool – Jesse, it's all right with you.
Don't let your knucklehead ruin your mood."
Gavin Gray added, "I'm disgusting.
Not only for him, but also for the neighbors who ignored him.
I'm glad you're okay.
You're an example for the new generation.
You showed yourself to be proud of yourself, and you could be dissatisfied!"
At the University of Lids, Mr. Mayh took an interest in teens, encouraged by her senior sister nurses.
Since then, she has been able to win the second place at the Mulder British Senior Championship, which took place in Birmingham in July this year.
She earned the British Championship medal just one month after the victory in the Nordic English Games.
Atlette refused to comment more widely on the event.
If at least 50 million user accounts are broken, Facebook will have to pay a fine of EUR 1.25 billion
With the security gap, the criminals could reach at least 50 million Facebook accounts.
However, large-scale breakage has only been reported after three days – Friday.
Facebook is now a huge fine under new European data laws
After at least 50 million accounts have been broken, Facebook may have to pay a fine of $1.25 billion.
Criminals were able to access accounts due to a lack of security, so many sensitive personal information could be disclosed.
However, Facebook only announced the hacking on Friday, three days later, and until yesterday, it was not possible to tell how many British accounts were broken.
As long as the search for applications continues, the Irish Data Protection Commissioner, who checks the compliance of the web giant with European data, has criticised the company as its central headquarters in Dublin, saying: "Not complete notification."
Facebook is a huge fine under new European Union data laws, as companies may be required to pay up to four per cent of global turnover.
Last year Facebook earned 31,2 billion pounds income.
The criminals reached accounts using Facebook function “Review How” to give users the opportunity to see how their profiles look to others.

In the MG Baltic case, the record continues: the accused discussed Gabriel Landsberg
The hearing was opened during the discussion (in November 2015) between former Vice President Raimondo Kurllianski and former "worker" Vytautas Gapšios.
When listening to the record, it is difficult to understand exactly what the accused are talking about.
It is true that the record hears that Mr Kurllianski and Mr Gapšys speak of a Christmas festival, and the name of Gabriel Landsberg, the current Conservative leader, has been given several times, but what exactly is said is difficult to understand.
Indictments against both natural and legal persons
In the case of political corruption, three legal and five natural persons have been accused: the Labour and Liberals Movement parties, the MG Baltic Group, the former leaders of liberals and "workers" E. Masiulis, Vytautas Gapšias, former parliamentist liberal Š. Gustavius, Member of the Seimas G. Steponavičius and former vice-president of MG Baltic.
For the Labour Party, suspicions of bribery and trade are submitted, Liberal Movement is suspected of bribery, trade influence and abuse, and MG Baltic is suspected of buying and selling these parties.
Officials suspect that politicians began or took up bribes with the then Vice President of MG Baltic R. Kurlianski, and subsequently proposed or supported initiatives in favour of the Group at the Seimas and other institutions.
The former Chairman of the Liberals Movement, E. Masiulis, is suspected of the influence of trade, bribery and illegal enrichment which the former vice-president of this party, Mr Steponavičius, has submitted to him for alleged abuse by former member of the Vilnius City Council Š. Gustavi.
Mr Gapšys is suspected of having a bribery and trade effect, Mr Kurllianskis - the impact of shopping and trade.
Survey: Who has the greatest chance to win the second round of the presidential election?
The survey on the second round of elections included four candidates on the top of the ratings - economist Gitans Nausėda, the candidate-president Saulius Skvernelis, and the two candidates who participated in the first elections of the Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) party - the Seimas Member Ingrida Šimonytė and the diplomat Vygaudas Usackas.
It is true that on Sunday, I. Šimonytė received support from TS-LKD in the elections, and V. Usack withdrew from the election struggle.
As the figures show, if the elections were to take place in the near future, in all cases, the President's second round would win Mr Nausėda, but the Chief of Vilnius, sociologist Vladas Gaidys, says that it is too early to draw conclusions.
"Differently (from others - DELFI) Naussēda, but it's very important to see whether about the party talking, or about people, how dynamic is.
These Šimonytė doubles ranged from one study to another, and Nausėda was stopped by growth, and Usack was even reduced.
This growth is very important to you," the sociologist says.
Moreover, looking at the results of the survey, it is clear that a significant percentage of people are not yet determined, vote for what they are or think they do not go to the elections at all.
If I. Šimonytė and S. Svernelis were to break down on the second round of the presidential elections, the fight would be tense - I. Šimonys would vote for 32.7%, for S. Skvernelis 30.9%.
True, even 36.4% of people replied that they would not vote for any of these candidates, or they did not know for which to vote or go to the elections.
Sociologist V. Gaidys again stressed that we have not yet seen a full picture, because all candidates have not yet been declared to be less successful Lithuanian lecturer.
"If we look at last year's elections, there are many parties in Lithuania where their candidates?
For example, where was the candidate for social democracy? For 30 years he was a candidate, isn't he now?
When he comes up, he'll see how he's making himself available to other candidates.
So that side of Lithuania, which is less successful, is less reflected so far," said V. Gaidys.
In turn, Politicalologist Mažydas Jastramskis, Vilnius University Institute of International Relations and Political Science (VU TSPMI), says that so far, it is still very early to draw conclusions, and all three candidates, who have left the fight, look in parallel.
"I can say from my research experience that these differences do not mean anything.
The difference of 5 percentage points does not indicate any advantage for the applicant.
The only thing I could see is that Nassėda looks good before Usack (...) again, bearing in mind if they come to a real vote.
Blowing against Svernelis also looks good, but we compare now with apples and potatoes because, for example, Nausėda has already declared that he will participate, Svernelis has not announced.
In addition, the survey was carried out before the original Conservative elections, as it would look after them?", says the political scientist.
According to him, Mr Nausėda has a small plus, but when all candidates are announced, he can melt.
"The situation is quite equal.
Wearing, Skvernelis, Shimonytė - results in a round.
I would like to remind you that half a year before the 2003 presidential election, Rolandas Paks had 5% support for voting in favour of him, and then won the elections.
It's not possible to make any predictions," said Mr Jastramski.
DELFI reminds that candidates for presidential elections have already announced economist G. Nausėda, Member of the Seimas I. Šimonytė, philosopher Arvydas Jezatis, economist, Member of the Seimas Aušra Maldeikienė, Member of the Liberals Movement Petras Auštrevicis, Member of the Seimas Naglis Pušeis and Member of the European Parliament Valentinas Mazuronis.
Iran accused Israel of trying to hold an cyberattack
"The regime whose history of using cyber weapons is clear from cases such as the "Stuxnet" virus (a release), this time trying to violate Iran's communication infrastructure," said Mr. Mohammad Javada Azari Jachhi, Minister of Information, via Twitter.
He referred to the Stuxnet virus attack that caused damage to Iran's nuclear facilities in 2010.
It is believed that this malware was developed by Israel and the United States.
"On the watch of our technical teams, they're left empty hands.
We will continue to talk about this hostile action in international fora," said Mr Jachromi.
Minister Hamide Fattahi said that on Monday of the technical team, many attempts to penetrate their systems were recorded, but the attackers were "made a firm break".
In the wellness club "Impuls" a man became evil, his recovery failed

A base - sailed man (born in 1945) suddenly became ill, mad under the water.
The man was quickly pulled out of the water, but he was already unconscious.

Next to the former people - the client who sailed on the common track and the pool overseer - responded immediately, pulled it out of the water and started to relax.
The man was constantly repented until he arrived.
Club staff immediately called for emergency medical assistance, which arrived within 5 minutes.
When the doctors arrived, they restored the man’s pulse and breathing and moved him to the medical car.
When we went to hospital, doctors tried to stabilise a man’s health, unfortunately, after 20 minutes we received information that the man did not survive.
We express our sincere sympathy for the family of the deceased man because of the loss.
According to the preliminary data, the event could have been caused by the customer’s health problems.
According to the information provided by the family doctors, he had diabetes.
We recall that, in the event of serious health problems, it is always very important to take a responsible look at your options and to consult doctors and health club professionals.
All wellness clubs in the pool are equipped with a watchman, whose main task is to monitor the pool, its access and the security of customers, and from other employees it is distinguished by bright clothing.
Such pool supervisors shall have radio stations that allow immediate contact with the administration and the registry, response to their requests or call for assistance.
The staff training relating to the security programme is held four times a year - much more often than required by law.
During their course, employees develop theoretical and practical knowledge, learn how to act in the event of an accident, monitor whether workers are properly complying with the procedures and internal rules.

Gražina lost his son in Norway: he replaced even four families and no longer speak Lithuanian
According to LNK's press release, the Lithuanians lost the right to care for their son four years ago and are seen with it by the judgment of the Norwegian Children's Rights Service "Barnevernet" and the court.
The woman's story caused something international scandal that all the media followed.
The people of the country prepared pickets for a boy's return to Lithuania for his grandmother both in Lithuania and Norway.
However, publicity to Gražins and her family has not helped to restore a son of Lithuanian citizenship.
Today, she tells us how she has been separated from her son for the last few years, and how her and her child’s meetings are held after two years.
At the time Gražina lost his right to care for his son, he was 8 years old, today 12 years old, early in his teens.
In the first two years, Gražina never saw a son, but it was forbidden.
Later, the Greeks were given the right to see their son twice a year, just one hour a year.
During the last hearing, which took place a few months ago, the number of meetings of the Lithuanians has been increased to three times a year and extended to two hours.
Meetings with the son every time remind us of dating in a hard-shed prison - are monitored by officials, and the going to them is a secret operation.

Eligijus Masiulis will not return personal money from the trap
On Tuesday, the appeal court announced that it rejected the appeal against the accused’s lawyer.
The order shall be final and not subject to appeal.
In the case of political corruption, the former head of the Liberals Movement, E. Masiulis, appealed to the Appeals Court, asking him to refund any personal money - money taken through search - from his money and the money of his spouse.
In total, more than 242 thousand euros have been taken from Massiu.
The provisional restriction on the right of ownership shall be subject to such monetary restrictions and shall be continually extended.
The Vilnius Regional Court last extended it on October 15.
E. Masiulis did not ask the Appeal Court to repay all the money - he seeks to recover EUR 800 from his spouse's wallet and his wallet - EUR 690, USD 130, USD 1600.
A former policy says that the latter money was allocated to a planned trip to the USA.
E. Masiulis’ lawyer, Mindaugas Blivs, asked for this money to be repaid on Monday at the Court of Appeal because the spouses had worked well on well-paid works and had the opportunity to have such sums.
The prosecutor Justas Laucius requested that the appeal be dismissed.
"The ruling of the Vilnius Regional Court is legal and reasoned, there is no limit to the more assets indicated in the accusations submitted.
The Court rightly held that it constituted the grounds for confiscation of assets, as well as the extended confiscation of assets," said Mr Laucius at the hearing.
On October 15, the Vilnius Regional Court decided not to return more than 242 thousand euros to the accused in the case of political corruption, E. Masiulis.
This money has been found during the cracks in the case of corruption in the former politician's home and in the car.
The Chamber of three Judges has stated that it appears from the case-file that property rights are limited only to funds which constitute the subject of criminal offences against Mr Masiulis.
"In view of the extent of the restriction, it should be concluded that the right of ownership of the accused is not subject to a disproportionate or restriction for an excessive period of time," states the decision of the judges Nijole Ziimkiene, Jurgita Kolyčienė and Fire Trumpul.
The judges pointed out that Mrs Masiulis was accused of committing serious crimes, that the criminal proceedings were of a substantial and complex nature, and that therefore, in order to ensure the possible confiscation of assets and the extended confiscation of assets, it is necessary to extend the time limit for the accused’s temporary limitation of ownership.
Prosecutors state that Raimonds Kurllianskis, former vice-president of MG Baltic concern, gave a bribe of EUR 106 thousand for taking decisions that are useful to the Group in Seimas.
Both accused people believe that the money to be found at E. Masiulis - EUR 90 thousand - was a loan from R. Kurllianskis.
According to the file, there were 242.4 thousand euros, 130 pounds of UK pound, and 1.6 thousand dollars in search of E. Masiulis.
E. Masiulis and his lawyer have repeatedly tried to recover money, but the courts rejected their requests.
Former policies have said that some of these funds belong to other persons and were intended to invest in real estate or be the money of his family.
He also claimed that there was no evidence that funds would be received in a criminal way.
In the past, the Court of Appeal has announced that the accusations made by E. Masiulis show that these funds could have been obtained by accepting a bribe of more than EUR 100 thousand.
Legal protection claims that the remaining cash taken through a shake could have been from undeclared sources of income, undeclared, unapproved documents and perhaps not legal income.
In the case of political corruption, charges were submitted to three legal persons - the Labour Party, the Liberals Movement, the MG Baltic Group.
In addition to E. Masiulis, in the case of the former "worker", the accusations were submitted to Vytautas Gapši, former parliamenter liberal Šarūnas Gustavis, Seimas Member Gintars Steponavičius and former Vice President of MG Baltic R. Kurlianski.
Mr Kurlianski is accused of giving the bribes to former Members, Mr Masiulis, Mr Gustatinis and Mr Gapšis.
The Americans record dangerous Russian exterminator manoeuvres
At the time of taking over 25 minutes, the U.S. Naval Force said that Russian SU-27 rushed straight ahead of the plane.
The Russian aircraft ran through it for the second time, using traction accelerations, and took a turn with a swing.
Passengers reported a history of the first approach and earthquake during the second approach.
The Russian army has the right to exercise exercises in international airspace, but this interaction was irresponsible.
We expect international standards that ensure security and prevent incidents that are consistent with behaviour, including the 1972 agreement on the prevention of incidents at sea and above sea (INCSEA), - the US Naval Force has said in its report.
'Insecure action increases the risk of inappropriate calculation and potential collisions', is noted in the report.
The Russian Ministry of Defence recognised the incident, but believed that Russian SU-27 held a safe distance from the American aircraft.
Parents' costs are not reduced and continue: only EUR 50 per month is allocated for extracurricular activities
According to a survey conducted by Baltic Research, a survey conducted at the end of August revealed that a third (32 percent) of parents in their school-age child's "buying" was less than EUR 100 before school this year, a fifth (21%) released between EUR 101 and 150, three out of ten (29%) – between EUR 151 and 200, and less than one fifth (18%) spent more than EUR 200 on the preparation of one school at the end of the summer.
Parents whose children began to go to the first class in this school year spent an average amount of around EUR 220 for their children's school basket, while other parents, whose children have already completed their first class, gave a lower amount for their child's training - on average about EUR 160.
However, as the school year falls, there is also a reduction in costs, as parents often have to break down money for child teams and corepetists.
Depending on the nature of the activity, the price of a group may vary from 20 to 100 euros in the country.
Parents who have children of school age were asked to tell the average monthly amount they plan to give to their one child's second employment.
Four quarters (23%) of those surveyed planned a monthly allocation of up to 20 euros, another quarter (26%) said they had paid up to 50 euros, three out of ten (31%) of the child's second employment is between 50 and 100 euros per month, and a sixth (17%) of the parents indicated that they were planning to allocate EUR 100 or more.
It is true that in Lithuania, children of school age are awarded a basket of non-formal children's education, which is EUR 15 per month.
However, this money can only be used for a single group, and if the cost of the activity is higher, the difference must be borne by the parents.
In the case of a child visiting several teams or having several school-age children in the family, expenditure on post-school activities may double.
Justina Ambrasienė, the head of the consumer loan company "Vivus.lt" marketing, saves children's teams with small or medium income families, especially when several children are growing in the family, can become a small challenge.
At the beginning of the school year, parents began to get money for exercise, calendar goods or new sportswear.
Now the main concern is how to take children after school without spending any money on it.
We note that parental spending is particularly increasing in August, when it is necessary to prepare it properly for the new school year, but it is also continuing to be higher than in the summer period because parents tend to invest in the employment of their children.
Often, if they lack funds and take a responsible assessment of their possibilities, they are determined to borrow," says J.Ambrasienė.

This drawing looks very funny, especially because it fits also the trolleybus wheels.
When the wheels turn on the turn, it seems that this is part of that car.
When we painted the wheels white, we made them like a retro style, it was a very sounding whole combination.
Until the trolebus tires had been painted, it really didn't look so charming," said the street artist earlier to the portal.day.lt.
And on October 27, a set of paintings lay down on the third trolleybus.
It's made of white, yellow, orange, brown, but it's mostly blue.
This color is dominant.
On the left side of the trolleybus body is shown one house of K.Donelaitis, on the right - central poster.
"Vabals" is the best thing I've ever had," Morfas took the third troupe by the artist Morfas.
Buy New
"Kauno dienos" reminds us that last week Kaunas bus company "Kauno busi" and Polish company "Solaris Bus & Coach S.A" signed a contract of 29.4 million stating that Kaunas will buy 85 new trolleybuses.
"The Kaunas is investing the largest amount in its history for the renewal of public transport.
This contract will allow you to change the old "Škoda" brand trolleybus for all of us for many years and offer the most comfortable services to passengers.
New low-level modern trolleys will have more seats, efficient cabin conditioning and heating, high-quality information systems, video surveillance cameras, ergonomic driver's workplace.
New machines and parallel network renewals and street repair work will make the trolleys run more reliable, much faster.
And, of course, the modern design of trolleybuses is very embellishing the city," the CEO of Kaunas Busi said at that time, Mindaugas Grigelis.
The first new trolleybuses will reach Kaunas in August of next year, and all old trolleybuses will be replaced by December.
Christmas sensation: Queen Elizabeth II invited Mother of M. Markle together to celebrate
Hercogiene Meghan has stunned the British royal palace.
This is demonstrated by the special gesture of Queen Elizabeth II: The British monarch Christmas was invited by the mother of Sasex Hercogiene Doria Ragland, a British media publication in his palace of Sandringham.
Even parents of Duke Kathe have not received such honor.
In Kate’s parents, Carole and Michael Middleton, as well as their other family members, have so far been invited only to traditional Christmas services with their royal family.
The unnamed source for the newspaper Sunday Express revealed that the invitation to Dorija Raglabd is a sign of "the honor of the Knight Meghan".
Dory's being at the royal wedding in May, she's been in peace.
The invitation to celebrate Christmas together also raised speeches that Mr Ragland is planning a longer stay in Great Britain.
It's guessing she wants to help her daughters before and after her birth.
Meghan and her husband, Prince Harry, should be born first in spring 2019.
In the Žalgiris Arena and again, the exhibition "Women World" will take place.
The exhibition "The World of Women" has already been held for the 16th time since the autumn raid and for more important weather, and the women are declaring the long weekend because even four days of hottest news of fashion, style and beauty are already here on 8-11 November in Kaunas Žalgirio Arena.
Over the years, we see how the face of the event is changing, the exhibition means not just that of shopping, but that of giving the tradition time to yourself.
Often it becomes a meeting place of friends and a reason to spend a day with a sister or a mother.
Four days of the exhibition have special power: every woman here can learn the secrets of charm, learn tricks as it seems to be brighting daily, find indispensable products, hear or try various procedures that hinder the aging process of the skin.
All of this, too, is promised by 415 participants who will be waiting for visitors on all three floors of the arena.
Seminars on beauty and health will take place for three days, and on Sunday representatives of the fine sex will be able to hear tips for a unique image from a styler and blogger Victoria Saklytė's lips.
A large number of women in business are confronted with marginal situations in which stress becomes a barrier to stable emotional and physical conditions.
For this reason, Kaunas Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Crafts and its business women's network were born with the idea of organising a conference "Versli and Happy. In the stress", in which discussions and practical examples will encourage you to help yourself in difficult situations and will encourage you to look at your life more creatively.
As every year, I am surrounded by events for beauty masters.
Exhibition long-term partners, the Association of Hairdressers and Beauty Professionals, will give two days to learn the subtleties of hair painting and modelling from the international Academy "Vinokurov & frids" formed by the Charizmatical duo - S. Maslov and R. Sakalauskas.
The goal is to develop further the field of bride design contest and mastery fight Art Battle, which will not leave indifferent.
As a surprise on the cake will become the sacred fiesta "With birthday, Lithuania" of representatives of the beauty world, where it will be possible to see an unseen show from body painting to dance on the occasion of the century.
Another tradition of Women's World is the presentation of the latest collections of designers on Friday's "The Fashion and Beauty Show" where the most stylish will be chosen.
And handicraft supporters will be welcome at the Dekostudija creative workshop, where you can create original items for home interior or decorated gifts more interestingly.
The last day of the exhibition is especially welcome for all the longest ones, as the traditional visitors will be delighted with the World LONG-HAIRED WORD 2018 competition, where new record of the longest cash register is recorded each year.
Prime Minister: after the introduction of ethical pay, teachers' salary increased by 117 EUR
Since the introduction of the ethical payment model of September, the average salary of full-time teachers has increased by 117 euros, according to Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis.
"Do you early say how much it (new order - BNS) has advantages or disadvantages.
The fact is that those people who have a full workload - their wages increased by more than EUR 117 on average - said S. Skvernelis to journalists in the government on Monday.
He called "democratic law" the Lithuanian Association of Education Workers (UPD) plans to implement a strike on ethical payment, but stressed that the strike should not interfere with the education process.
"In a democratic country, all forms of protest allowed, possible.
If you think you need to strike, it's their right of self-determination.
But once again, they don't want children, students, to suffer in this place.
If the strike occurs, it must be done in accordance with the laws in force," said S. Skvernelis.
The Seimas adopted a model of ethical pay for teachers in June and has been introduced in stages since September.
The schooling of teachers was replaced by hourly training – the teacher's establishment is 1512 hours a year.
The working time of the teacher is divided into three parts: contact hours, i.e. lessons, preparation for them and work for the community.
This reform, led by Andris Navickas, calls the union absurd, angry that it adopted the 'buldozer' principle and proclaims an indefinite strike starting on 12 November.
The LFS requires that this "minimal" wage system be abolished without delay and that an ethical model be introduced, with a maximum of 18 contact hours per year.
It is also about increasing the constant proportion of the official salary by 20% and reducing the number of children in classes.
Among other innovations, there is criticism of the introduction of a new methodology for allocating training funds, because, according to the trade unions, there is insufficient funds for training in homes, for sharing of classes into groups, for qualification, for education aid, and for classes in large cities, as they have been the case.
The Ministry of Education and Science claimed that the ethical training of teachers will allow adjustment of teachers' workload and reimbursement of all work for the school community.
It is foreseen that the teacher’s ethate will be able to cover up to half of the total number of hours per year, the first two years – up to 40% of all hours.
It is estimated that the working time of teachers is 36 hours per week, of which no more than 24 contact points per week for compulsory teaching.
In May, the two-hour strike initiated by the LHRS contributed about half a hundred schools of general education, kindergartens and non-formal education, about 1,000 educators.
In total there are about 53 thousand educators in Lithuania.
Calling for readiness: the crisis can be expected within 2-3 years
The slowdown in economic growth and even the crisis can be expected in the next 2-3 years, but both the Bank of Lithuania and the Government of the country are much more prepared for these processes than a decade ago, the "Verslo position" interview was said by Vitas Vasiliauskas, Chairman of the Board of the Bank of Lithuania.
"To argue that the crisis is just behind the corner, I certainly could not, but there are signs of economic slowdown.
This year our country's economy grew by more than 3 percent, and we are planning to grow by 2.8 percent next year.
The main message that I would like to say to society and business - let us be prepared for everything," said Mr Vasiliauskas.
In his view, there are no equal crises and therefore they need to be prepared differently.
The difference between the crisis that occurred decades ago is that the government, at that time, thought that the income generated by the growing economy would be everlasting and that expenditure was planned.
As a result, after the crisis in 2008, the costs had to be greatly reduced dramatically.
Now, according to Mr Vassiliou, the situation is different, and the crisis is better prepared.
"The truth is, we see that the assessment of the situation of the Bank of Lithuania and the Ministry of Finance is different.
We believe that we already exceed the potential and need to press the brakes.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Finance does not think so," said the Chairman of the Board of the Bank of Lithuania.
The preparations of the country's institutions for the upcoming crisis V. Vasiliauskas evaluates 7 out of 10 points.
According to him, the small and open economy, like Lithuania, is very heavily affected by external factors.
The current exodus of the great elephants - the US, China, the European Union - will undoubtedly affect us as well.
We must therefore be very careful.
With little economy to say that we are dealing with everything, it is possible, but I do not believe it," said Mr Vasiliauskas.
What will be the future for those who have received large loans?
According to V. Vasiliauskas, the European Central Bank has clearly laid down a short-term strategy, and decisions on interest movements can be expected not before the summer of next year: 'At present, the main goal is to try to manage expectations'.
The trial, which raises the greatest concern for the President of the Bank of Lithuania, is a fall in labour in our country.
The decline in labour force is also, to a large extent, a result of the decline in the competitiveness of the economy.
It is also a fall in bread eaters.
Migration has allowed this process to be slightly balanced this year, but does not know whether it is a long-term trend," said Mr Vasiliauskas.
ELTA recalls that the Bank of Lithuania and the Ministry of Finance forecast that the country's economy will grow by 3.4 percent this year, and the next year by 2.8 percent.
The Swedish Conservative leader will try again to form a government
The conservative leader of a conservative moderate party in Sweden, which has been in the political impasse for two months after the elections, will have a second chance of forming a government, announced by the President of Parliament on Monday.
The Balanced Party of Ulfo Kristersson belongs to the Alliance of the right-wing four centurion parties, which received slightly less votes during the 9th elections of September than the coalition of the previous governing centre left.
It was difficult for both blocks to bring together a majority of those who refused to negotiate with the anti-immigration Swedish Democratic Party, the source of which is the neo-Naonian movement.
The first attempt by Mr Christersson to form the government on 14 October was unsuccessful.
On 29 October, the Prime Minister Stefan Lofven (Stefan Liowan) announced his failure to test.
In an attempt to force the party to reach an agreement, the President of Parliament, Andreas Norlen, said that next week he will propose to the Parliament as a candidate for Prime Minister, thus pushing the first vote since the beginning of the government-building efforts.
"In advance, it is unclear whether various parties will accept Ulf Christersson as Prime Minister," said A. Norlen.
However, he stressed that 'the process must move forward and the dynamics between the parties must change'.
'The negotiations of the State must end,' he added.
The date of Parliament's vote is still unclear, but Mr Norlen said that there was 14 November between possible dates.
In Sweden, the President of Parliament can instruct a candidate four times to form a government with which a parliament would meet.
If all four attempts are unsuccessful, the country must organise new elections.
The current appointment of U. Christersson is the third test of A. Norlen.
Some moderate parties and groups of Christian democrats from the Alliance's partners pressure on Mr Christersson to accept the support of the extreme right-wing Swedish Democratic Party, but he still rejects this opportunity.
The Swedish Democratic Party, which received 17.6% of the votes in the elections and is the third largest party, ignores all major parties of the current system for a long time.
The ultrasound party, which has successfully used voters' anger during the elections for immigration after nearly 400 thousand asylum seekers arrived in the country since 2012, demands influence in the decision-making process in exchange for support.
However, liberals and centralists of the Alliance are strongly opposed to such an idea.
Since 2014, the Swedish Social Democratic Party (SAP) with the support of the Greens and the informal Left has managed, while creating opportunities for cooperation between the blocks, only if it maintains the Prime Minister's post.
The Alliance and the Swedish Democratic Party rejected this opportunity.
A delegation from the Afghan Government will take part in peace negotiations in Russia
The delegation of the Kabul Government will participate in the international negotiations on the peace process in Russia this month, announced by the officials on Monday.
The Taliban in turn continues to consider whether or not to participate.
Russia announced on Saturday that it would hold such a conference in Moscow on 9 November, although the US is currently trying to enter into bilateral negotiations with the Taliban on the termination of the 17-year conflict.
The High Peace Council of the Afghan Government, which is responsible for the efforts of the fighters, will send four representatives to the Moscow meeting, AFP said to the news agency Sayed Ihsan Taheri.
However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Afghanistan has avoided answering its delegation to this conference, which will focus on the initiation of peace negotiations between Kabul and the Taliban.
We are still in agreement with Russian officials, - said the representative of Sebaghtullah Ahmadi. - We welcome any peace efforts led by Afghans.
Taliban representative Zabiullah Mujahid said that the movement is still under discussion as to whether to go.
Moscow also invited representatives from the USA, India, Iran, China, Pakistan and the five former Soviet Central Asian republics.
Pakistan, a long time ago accused support for the Taliban of Afghanistan, "must be involved", AFP said Muhammad Faisala, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs.
The US Embassy in Kabul has not yet responded to the request for comment.
The meeting in Moscow was originally scheduled for September, but it was postponed when Kabul requested that the process be led by Afghans.
The negotiations will take place in a sensitive time.
The newly appointed U.S. Peace Envoy Zalmaylzad (Zalmayi Khalilzad) is trying to convince the Taliban to negotiate the end of the war and to fear that the multilateral meeting in Russia could fail this effort.
One US Government supervisory authority last week indicated that Kabul's government in Afghanistan has weakened in recent months.
President of Cuba met North Korea leader in Pyongyang
The leader of North Korea Kim Jong Unas, and the President of Cuba, Miguel Diaz-Canel, both of whom are hoping for the abolition of US economic sanctions, agreed to expand and strengthen their strategic relations, announced by the North Korean state media on Monday.
Mr Diaz-Canelis, who arrived in Asia on his first international journey after his arrival in April, arrived at Pyongyang and his wife on Sunday.
He was met at the airport by Kim Jong Unas, and the leaders entered into the city through the crowds that greeted them.
North Korean state media reported that leaders held negotiations at the state guest house Paekhwawon, highlighted the overall socialist history of their countries and promised further solidarity.
The official media did not provide much details, but indicated that the atmosphere of negotiations was friendly.
A meeting with Kim Jong Unu could be seen as a warning to Washington, whose efforts to make significant progress on the issue of North Korea's denuclearisation are increasingly intense.
Pyongyang, who recently also sought Moscow's favor in bed, is strengthening rhetoric before this week's meeting, planned by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and North Korea's chief negotiator Kim Yong Cholo, Kim Jong Cholo, in New York.
By weekend, Pyongyang criticised the United States for its irrevocable sanctions, a political tool which Washington also used extensively against Cuba and Russia.
North Korea mentioned that it could further develop the nuclear weapons programme if Washington does not change the course.
Sanctions are an important item on the Diazo-Cannel agenda.
Last week, when visiting Moscow, Diaz-Canelis discussed an arms contract with Russia worth almost $50 million (EUR 43.8 million) and received a similar promise from Vladimir Putin to expand political, economic and military relations.
Both Presidents then issued a joint statement condemning the US 'interruption in the internal affairs of sovereign states'.
The US economic embargo for Cuba, originally introduced in 1958 and subsequently extended, remains in force.
Sanctions against Russia have been imposed on the annexation of Crimea and support to separatists in Eastern Ukraine.
Mr Diaz-Canelis has to leave Pyongyan on Tuesday.
He will visit China, Vietnam and Laose.
In storage areas, are the cars insecure?
On Saturday, a woman contacted police officers asking her to find out the case of fraud.
According to Klaipeda, in 2006 a car of the "Hyundai Santa Fe" brand was left on the site for storage at the end of September.
She observed the publication on the website on 3 November.

Record: At least 157 days pass by Britain
The British Atlas landed on Sunday from the sea to the coast of England, which became the first man to travel along the coast to Great Britain.
The 33 - year - old Ross Edgley (Ross Egel) spent 157 days in the water and over 2 883 miles [2883 km] away.
He sailed in six hours, and he would sleep on the board of the support team that accompanied him.
The last mile the sportsman overcome accompanied by hundreds of colleagues' swimmers.
He went out to the coast in the Margeite located in south-east England - it was here that Edgley started his journey on 1 June.
The sportsman, who was about to guess within 100 days, said to the loved ones who met him on the shore, "I'm sorry, I'm late."
He said that when he went to the shore, he felt a relief first.
"I was very concerned that my leg would not withstand it," said the atlas.
The Association of Open Waters of the World Travel has indicated that Mrs Edgley, in this endurance test, supported by the producer of "Red Bull" energy drinks, has repeatedly faced extremely unfavourable weather conditions, and has also been slowed down by jellyfish even 37 times.
The organisers declare that Mr Edgley twice improved the record of the longest voyage with breaks, which until now was 73 days.
He also reached a new record, probably overcoming the distance between the nearest and northern British points - Lands Ando's bribe and John O'Grouts.
This distance was overcome by the sportsman in 62 days.
Macabrian Clebonic Forest Secret: One suspect already detained
It was a piece of a scarlet by a passerper, because the murderer was unscrupulously buried.
Only in such circumstances was the crime known, because the victim of murder was not loved, and his disappearance was not reported.
According to the outset, he was not older than his age.
Like his suspects, he's killed.
One of them was allowed to arrest three months in Kaunas District Court last week.
The second one who is suspected of fleeing abroad, where he is hiding from the punishment for another crime, is sought.
Until he is found, law enforcement agents are not inclined to comment more on the circumstances of this crime.
Valinskienė: For my children I would agree with many
In the new building rock opera Love and death in Verona, the ranks of the most prominent performers in the country are expanding.
Inga Valinskienė joins the Artists team, who is entrusted with one of the most important roles of the project - a woman of course will play a girl in Juliet.
Povilas Meškėla, who will take care of the singing of the performers, became an important part of the team.
"I think that the history of love has been created in many and very beautiful, but "Romo and Juliet", it seems, will always remain a symbol of these stories and will be built on various scenes for a long time.
It will be interesting to become part of one of these things," says Valinskiene, who has come to the test of the shoulders.
Although a woman is well-known on the stage, she has a number of roles in various performances or musical activities, and the children have not yet had a date to play.
"The time to play Juliet has already passed, I. Valinskiene smiles.
- I'd probably be happy to have adopted such a proposal at my time."
It is true that the character of the trainer, V. Schexpyre, is no less important in the drama, some critics are even considered to be the most important.
It is not only a mediator, a helper - its way and tone of speech, a feminine attitude to feelings and the resulting solidarity with lovers gives more and more colours to the plot.
In addition, she was trained important because she is one of just two women in the drama "Romeo and Giulijeta".
"My way and style is not very close, but sometimes it's just more interesting.
Create a different character than you have - a fun part of the creative process.
I don't know what the final result will be, because it will depend not only on me, but also on the interpretation of the director," says Mr Valinskiene, and reveals that being at the head of Juliet's school would probably do the same.
- I think the cord listened to her heart.
This is the way most women do.
I would probably do that."
The legendary Kęstutis Antelius rock opera "Love and Death in Verona" is designed according to the famous "Rome and Juliet" drama of Shexpyro.
A work based on real facts tells a tragic story of love for two young people, Rome and Juliet.
The sad end of history is determined by the uncertainty of where the conflict between the families of young people - the Montek and the Kapuletes.
"All history is possible at all times.
Parents who are opposed to the choice of children have always been and will be.
Only today are solutions to such problems - more varied - asked if Rome and Juliet's history could be repeated today, says the future teacher, Mr Valinskienė.
- In my own name, I'd make my children agree with a lot of things, including the Marche."
The key roles of the actor and director Ramūnas Cicēnas in the directed rock opera - Romeo and Juliet - will be performed by Ieva Zasimuskaitė and Justinas Jarutis, Vidas Baeikis, Kęstutis Cicēnas, Mindaugas Pa money, Marius Jampolskis, Paul Šinkūnas and Aidas Barkauskas on the stage.
The latest presentation of the rock opera "Love and Death in Verona" will be presented to the audience at the end of December.
The first new colourful work will be launched on 28 December by the viewers of Vilnius Siemens Arena.
The day later, on December 29, rock opera will be shown on Klaipeda's "Svyturio" Arena.

"Skamp" presents a song whose video has already refused to display one TV
The group "Skamp" mentioned 20 years of activity this year and started building music again intensely.
The only anniversary concert "Skamp20" taking place on December 26 at Vilnius Siemens Arena, of course three successively, presents new works.
This time - it's Love Me like There's No Tomorrow and a bold song video.
"This piece is about love, so I thought that all kinds of relationships should be captured, regardless of age or sexual orientation," Erika Jennings reveals the idea of a new song and video clip, which is convinced that any form of homophobia in 2018 is not normal.
In the video of the new song Love Me Like There's No Tomorrow, there were ten different orientations and age pairs: "We have always supported LGBTQIA communities and we believe that one day we will no longer need to discuss this," says Viktor Diawara, who created music of the piece before the beginning of the year during family holidays in Israel.
True, because of this video clip "Skamp" has already been able to have negative reactions - he does not want to display one of the most popular country's wires.
This tells us a lot about our society.
Television will not show the clip, because it will kiss people and it is a wrong content for children.
And the fact that, at any time of the day, TV can be used on screen for the fights and other examples of violence is the right content?" – E. Jennings asks rhetoric.
The Erics are also Willius Alessius: "I would like to see more people who are handy and kissing, regardless of their social situation, gender or age.
We are raising children and their tendency to grow in an environment with as much tolerance as possible and as little sex as possible.
We want a new song and video clip at least to clarify the day and give them a smile."
Since 1998, "Skamp" group has been famous for the bold texts of songs, which spoke on unpopular or sensitive topics.
The best songs from all the group - old and new - will sound loud and wide in "Skamp20" concert already on December 26 at Vilnius Siemens Arena.
It welcomes everyone with their families, and children under 10 years of age are free of charge.

Presidency: LRT is not political property
As the Seimas intends to return to the examination of the conclusions of the Commission which has examined the activities of the LRT, the Presidency is concerned that the rulers simply seek more political control of the public broadcaster.
"The public broadcaster is not a political property, and the fundamental principle is that independence from politics to maintain it," the president's advisor to "the Radio of Knowledge" in Mindaugas Lingė explained.
However, the counselor stressed, it is now possible to see the opposite process.
"It is possible to see that those (political. - ELTA) influences want to have more.
This is something we value quite critically," said Mr Ling.
According to him, the proposals made by the LRT Commission in the Seimas are quantifiable and questionable, because for peace to the broadcaster’s independence.
Although Mr Lingė stressed the need to improve the governance of the LRT, this should be done on the basis of expert assistance and on the basis of specific aspects that hinder the smooth operation of LRT.
He stressed that already now the international institutions stressed that the activities of LRT should not be supervised by political authorities but by competent authorities.
On Tuesday, the Seimas intends to take a decision on the conclusions of the panel which examined the activities of LRT.
This conclusion was a matter of great criticism.
The proposals to change the management of the LRT have been highly skeptically evaluated - reducing the powers of the Council and linking its members with the terms of office of the appointing authorities.
In view of this, the European Broadcasting Union was concerned.
In January, the opposition group of Members of the Seimas applied to the Constitutional Court for whether the special parliamentary committee investigating the activities and finances of the LRT is in conflict with the Constitution.
For those who work abroad - good news from Mr Karbauskas
The Seimas started to discuss an amendment to the Law on Declaration of the Place of residence submitted by Ramūnas Kabauskas from the Lithuanian Peasant and Green Union Group, according to which citizens who work and pay taxes outside Lithuania would be exempted from the payment of compulsory health insurance contributions.
After submitting the draft, 56 Seimas Members supported the draft on Tuesday, before it was 9, held 25 Parliamentaries.
After discussion in committees, the draft is to be discussed in plenary sitting of the Seimas on 6 December. The Seimas also decided to request the Government's conclusions.
Under the proposed project, persons who pay social insurance contributions in the Member States of the European Union, States of the European Economic Area or in the Swiss Confederation shall, by decision of the National Social Insurance Fund, be exempt from payment of compulsory health insurance contributions in the Republic of Lithuania.
Living and working outside Lithuania data submitted and validated by the Board of the State Social Insurance Fund ("Sodra") and the State Tax Inspectorate are considered to have left Lithuania.
This is about services that people do not use.
There is additional possibility of recording the fact that a person has left", R. Carbauskas explained from the Seimas tribunal.
Such proposed legal regulation would, in the opinion of the Conservative of the Seimas, be unfair to citizens living and paying taxes in Lithuania.
"Parts of Lithuanians living abroad abuse it," A. Matula noted.
Social Democrats Algirdas Sys believes that in this way we call on citizens not to comply with their obligations.
He felt that it would be possible for smart people to use the health system free of charge.
After the proposed amendments to the law have been adopted, persons who have left to live in other countries pay social security contributions, no debt accumulations and the burden on administration of Sodra debts will be reduced.
Currently, Lithuanian citizens who have actually left Lithuania but have not declared in accordance with the procedure laid down by legal acts in the Register of Residents of departure are charged monthly contributions to compulsory health insurance (PSD) and, if they are not paid, their debt accumulates.
Mr Duonėla has been convicted of fraud, but has been convicted of counterfeiting
Vilnius Regional Court has left the judgment on the attempt to cheat on former prominent sportsman Alvydas Doonėla, who has been convicted of counterfeiting.
The court verdict published on Monday came into force immediately.
Mr Duonėla has been sentenced to six-and-a-half years in prison, and has been sentenced to execution.
This year, the multiple-time champion of the rowing of Lithuanian midwives was sentenced to the Vilnius City District Court.
He was sentenced to six and four years in prison.
After examining the case against the sentenced person, Vilnius Regional Court removed one accusation, but the same sentence remained.
The former sportsman will also have to pay nearly EUR 760 to the Fund for the Victims.
Prosecutor's office, A. Duonėla, charged that in 2013 he counterfeited a lex, which he lent to the dental office "Dalecija" (about EUR 58) of his former wife, Daliskaite.
The spouse only learned about this in December 2016, when he received requests to pay for the debt.
A former spouse said money for clinical purposes was never borrowed or signed by a man.
According to the judges of Vilnius Regional Court, there is no objective data in the case proving that A. Duonala would have recorded non-realistic data that it would not be the loan of UAB "Dalecija" to A. Doonėlai 200 thousand litas.
It is acceptable to accept the arguments put forward in the complaint by the sentenced person and his defender, and there is no objective evidence of this in the case.
Having thus established that Mr Duonėla had only used a fake true document for fraud and found that this attribute - the use of the counterfeit document - was a composite part of fraud (in the case in question, an attempt to fraud), Mr Duonėla was justified in accordance with Article 300(1) of the Criminal Code, without demonstrating that he participated in the commission of a criminal act," says the Vilnius Regional Court judgment.
Firefighters led the earth’s dug-headed kittens, hearing three days of obscuration
As announced by the Kaunas County Fire Rescue Board, it has been reported that for three days the price is falling, which is buried after the change of thermal pipelines.
When the firefighters arrived, they also heard the cat's abomination.
It was found that a few days ago heat track repair was carried out.
It is likely that there could have been earths encamped to two pots when laying a route under the sky.
Firefighters restored the heat track overlay at a depth of one and a half metres and sprayed the tube for cats.
The son of Antonino Scalia claims that his father would not be surprised by liberal protests on Kavan Augh's
On Sunday, the son of Antonino Scalia, the judge of the Veļonis Supreme Court, said that his father would not be surprised by the protest of extreme forces against the nominated judge Bretta Kavanaugh, because Scalalia thought that the Supreme Court was too interfered with the affairs of the modern world.
“In general terms, he would not be surprised by the nomination to the Supreme Court because many people refer to the Roe before the Wade case – at least as the left-wing one,” said Christopher Scalia, recalling the famous case in 1973, after which the constitutional right of women to abortion was established in certain trimesters.
The Roe case has, in one case, abolished the right of all States to regulate abortion themselves and some States, in their response to this decision, have immediately tried to limit the right to abortion.
"My father often said that in Roe v Wade and other cases, the court actually tried to solve the cultural problems, although they had to be dealt with during the elections and the legislative process," he added during his show release Fox & Friends."
"In an attempt to speed up the process, the Supreme Court has caused even more damage, so nominations to the Supreme Court and disputes regarding approval lead to a more profound response, because judges take up a role belonging to legislators."
Nebraska Senator Republicor Ben Sasse expressed a similar opinion at this month's meeting on the approval of Kavanaugh, repeating that Congress often gives too much power to executive agencies, which are in principle not accountable to anyone, and that the resulting bureaucratic issues are left to the Supreme Court, so judges must take up work that the senators refuse.
The Capitol hill police arrested and accused hundreds of protestors of the illegal approval process of the candidate intervention.
When asked whether Kavanaugh could avoid a counter-reaction by the unconfirmed accusations of sexual misconduct he committed several decades ago, Scala claimed that it would probably not be possible to avoid noise.
In response to the statements that Kavanaugh shouldn't take office in the Supreme Court, because on Thursday during the survey of senators, he responded hotly and sometimes inconceivablely, Scalia questioned whether all judges were a calm character.
"The judges are often angry," said Scala about the worse disagreements that sometimes arise in controversial cases.
“Truly, Judge Kavanaugh must have responded more aggressively, but this was a different situation.
He tried to defend his good name against unapproved accusations."
On Thursday in Senate Courts Committee, most of the party's votes (11 versus 10) were allowed to participate in the entire Senate vote.
The senator of the Republicans of Arizona, Jeff Flake, stated at a dramatic moment that he would give his decisive vote to Kavanaugh only if the FBI was given a week to investigate the misdemeanour of the current alleged accusations to Kavanaugh.
The investigation is still ongoing, and President Trump said that the agency has a wide range of powers and can question "what it wants".
"Schiaparelli" clothing collection – fantastic finishing
Is surrealism possible?
Schiaparelli tried to answer this question.
The Paris Fashion House, which was founded almost a hundred years ago by Elsa Schiaparelli, presented its first collection of ready-made clothes and handbags.
This collection is almost as incredible as Elsa Schiaparelli's famous boot-shaped hat.
Excently, a long - fostered image of fashion houses appeared this time as very modern.
In aesthetic decisions you will find sensitivities, lobsters, hearts and eyes.
Schiaparelli created his first composite in 1930 and was the first designer whose models marched under music.
She and her friend El Salvador Daldi have designed to reconcile art and fashion, and now this idea has been taken over by Calvin Clein and Rafas Simons, in collaboration with U.S. artist Sterling Ruby.
The legend of Skland is that Dali and Schiaparelli, together with the motif of Omar, wanted to use their evening dress before the demonstration in real mayonnaise, but did not have the approval.

“We wanted to return to the idea of cooperation that is inseparable from the history of Schiaparelli”, said Bertrandas Guyona, who has been working as creative director for the last three years, spoken at the Fashion House salon in Vandom Square.
In developing his collection of ready-made clothes, he relied on Schiaparelli’s friendship with Manu Ray and, in collaboration with My Ray’s Foundation, created clothes according to well-known works of art.
The image of the famous artist's eyes “Student tears” is shown on the T-shirt with Perpex tears, and red lips from “Observatorija Time: Inspirators” with silkography are embossed on a straight cullet dress with a collage.
My Ray's "Static tears" on the T-shirts of the collection
One of Elsa's stranges was a suspicious impression of the letter S. Her branded color – “Skying Rosary” inspired her perfume “Skying”.
The first "Schiaparelli" curated by Guyon, with a key hole called "Clap".
Her retail price will also be fantastic – 5000 £.
Yesterday, a temporary shop was opened in the store on the left shore of the ancient city where the surrealist side of the Paris fashion week was shown and for 100 € could be purchased for Virgilo Abloho carpets from a collection of Ikea soon to appear.
After half an hour of opening, more than 500 young fans of Abloh went out in a row on the quay, and it was not possible to buy one of his works at a more favourable price than his male clothing created by Louis Vuitton.
Ablohui this project contributes to a wider audience than that for which luxury fashion or designer furniture is available.
“No one has any property anymore, but the knowledge of a particular chair can help you to have a conversation near the dinner table.
This is what one thousand-year-olds think," he said recently.
The audience in the Maris district realized that this event in the garage would not be common when the models began to run through on skateboards.
The collection of free, colorful male and female cloaks by Andreas Kronthhaler, a male and female designer of Wyvana Westwood, was based on the portraits of the skaters of Jessica Fulford-Dobson Kabul.
Some women (and several men) who were in the sandals, who were walking on skateboards, however, they walked on their own boots with stunning heights.
After watching the show in the first row and wearing a collection dress with horse motifs and orange chords tied through the waist, he joined his husband, who bestowed a flower bouquet on the last bend on the podium.
Strong twin connection in photos
Peter Zelewski, who lives in London, was born in Detroit, as a street photographer, when he started to take pictures of twins four years ago.
“As a portrait photographer and man, I have always been admired by twins and their extraordinary connection, which everyone speaks of,” he says.
The photographer did not plan to create the whole project, but he said, "after photographing the portrait of the first twins, he was no longer dependent on the way back."
The upcoming book "Dives" of Zelewskis will contain 44 photos and stories of identical twins.
This project is more visual, he says: "This is not a documentary or scientific project – I wanted to take a picture of the affected and sensitive portraits of people."
Sisters declared their failure to trust in the trade union leading to wage negotiations
Members of the Royal Care College, dissatisfied by the trade union transaction with the National Health Service on salaries, declared after the vote the lack of confidence in the union and accused it of specifying the claims for the increase in pay that had been expected.
This unprecedented decision has been taken after a prolonged discussion in the Royal College of Sickness, when his former Secretary-General, Janeta Davies, admitted that their salaries would increase by 3% this year, once the 1 % salary limit was abolished.
In the absence of the expected rise in wages, the members were angry and forced Davies to leave office, then petitioned, and held an urgent meeting in Birmingham on Friday, after which they expressed their distrust with the college council.
“The honest and open debate in Birmingham helped to clarify the relationship, so the college will only be stronger,” said Maria Trewern, director of the Royal Care College.
“The gathering is clear, and the council and administration of the Royal Care College understood the message that had been sent to her.
In recent weeks, the Council has already sought change in the organisation and has sought to listen to and involve members; we will continue to do so."
The meeting will take place next week and the members of the Royal Care College are expected to withdraw.
"The basis of care is trust", said the National Health Service nurse for the Guardian newspaper.
“The actions of the Royal Care College have destroyed confidence in her, so the Council has to step aside.
I hope that she will act in good faith and listen to the request.
I wonder if other trade union members will also seek restructuring."
State official of the General Trade Union in the National Health Service Rachel Harrison said in August: “Guardian has earned salaries, the employees of the National Health Service from all over the country have understood an unexpected rise.
So they were angry."
Prior to the unusual meeting, the Royal College of Care admitted that it made mistakes in the 2018 wage negotiations and had been poorly informed about them.
However, it is also stated that the campaign of the Royal College on abolishing the limitation on wages forced the government to abandon this restriction and to promise to gradually increase wages by 6.5% over three years.
The vote was held following an independent study, which found that the college was inclined to go down in negotiations and that Davies was accused of being underestimated after the transaction.
It is argued that the Royal College of Care provided information that was not in line with the facts and that the members were therefore unable to make a reasonable decision on the transaction and did not consider the alternative.
The college has published controversial information on whether all employees will receive a 3% increase in their salary.
In a short report before the college meeting, the representatives were mistakenly told that "a 3% increase and an increase were planned in the progressive implementation of the reform".
Indeed, wages should have been gradually raised to 3% and only some of the highest-paid workers would have reached an increase immediately.
“Almost all the information on the implementation of the transaction submitted to members after the meeting was wrong (the worst of all the attempts to simplify it)”, said the representative of the electoral reform service who carried out the investigation.
"As far as the decision-making parties are concerned, the differences between the existing system and the proposed transaction were not understood and explained in a concise manner and the main advantages, including 6,5 and 29% of the calculations referred to in the campaign, were not clearly identified and therefore it was not possible to take a reasonable decision."
78% of the votes cast voted in favour and 3.74 % of the members of the Royal College of Sickness took part in the vote.
Lindsay Lohan shocked Instagram's live broadcast viewers trying to rob children from their families
Lindsay Lohan was criticised for the direct broadcast of Instagram, through which she followed the homeless family on the street and tried to separate his sons from their parents.
At the beginning, the actor proposed to give the family a seat, but the situation was quickly complicated.
“Good for everyone! I want to show you what family I met,” she told the viewers – these refugees from Syria, I am very concerned about them.
They really need help.
Do you want to go with me?
Come on, I'll take care of you," she said to the family before turning to one of the children, "Do you want to sleep at the hotel?
See the movies?
It'd be fun to see the movie on TV or on the computer."
When parents refused, Lohan responded in opposition.
“Your children should not be on the street, have difficulty working and do everything about them to improve their lives.
"If someone offers them home and accommodations, as I am now, you should agree.
They're coming back to you.
I'm not going anywhere without you.
Now I know who you are.
Don't laugh with me."
When the family tried to withdraw from Lohan by going to the street, the actress followed it by further direct broadcasting through Instagram.
“See what’s happening is trafficking in children, and you’re ruining Arabic culture.
You children, even though they don't want to come with you.
Boys, don't worry, I'm with you and now we're seeing the whole world."
The transmission ended with physical confrontation – it seems that the mother hit Lohan.
Video clips have spread to the social media and some users have taken an interest in whether this could not be compared to an attempt to seize them.
"The Independent" contacted Lohan representative for comments.
A third of the British think they will never pay all the debts they have
Almost a third of the British people believe that they will not be able to cover their debts during their lifetime, and one in 10 believes that they will not even be able to reduce them.
A study conducted by Equifax and Gorkana, the results of which only reveal The Independent, has shown that the British, especially those in the 18-24 age group, feel that they will have debts for their lives, and only half of them expect to get out of them.
Last year's report, published by the Institute for Fiscal Research, shows that students who have completed their education remain around 46,000 pounds of debt, and that the poorest students remain in debt with more than 57,000 pounds.
Most graduates (81 percent) will never pay their full debt, so during the first 30 years they will work under debt.
Public debt is growing: According to the National Statistics Department, the United Kingdom family debt is in record size and the British spends an average of 900 pounds each year more than they earn.
But is it worth worried about this fear statistics?
Are all-ever debt just a new normal way of life for young adults (and society as a whole)?
An example is the purchase of cars, which are another big purchase, by purchasing houses (if such a success smiles).
This week, Auto Trader has predicted that in a decade all new cars will be purchased at a cost, which will be the usual way to purchase vehicles.
Director of EQ Investors and certified financial planner Jeannie Boyle believes that the expectations have indeed changed.
"Today it is really normal to have debts: credit cards have been popular, interest-free refinancing, student loans and high-speed loans," she said.
"The generation of our grandparents was ashamed to have debts."
Today, student debt and housing price debt have become a normal phenomenon.
This statement is also supported by Moira O'Neill, the Head of the Personal Finance Division of International Investor, who believes that the results can be worrying.
"If you borrow a huge amount that exceeds four or five times your income, it may seem that you will not have any additional debt", she explained.
And so people fall into trouble.
Interest rates have been low for many years, so people with large loans or other debts need to consider security what would happen if the rates were to rise."
It must not be surprising that the financial industry's commentators do not have any doubt.
Brian Brodie, the Managing Director of the loan agency Freedom Finance, says: “Schools are not taboos.
A loan for the purchase of a house repair or a new car is no longer considered to be the last option.
Due to low interest rates, many people have contributed savings to fixed-term deposits, from which higher returns are generated, but not so easy to achieve savings.
As a result, the middle class is increasingly borrowing.
Over the past six months, about half of the new loans have been received by customers with an excellent creditworthiness assessment."
Richard Haymes, head of the financial problem resolution department of Equifax TDX Group, is of the opinion that such expectations – not to get out of debt for the rest of their lives – are really worrying.
He says: “In August, inflation was the highest in six months (2.7 percent), interest rates rose and employment grew low, so many people are worried about borrowing without a realistic plan to repay their debts.
Our analysis has shown that this year the number of people's bankruptcies will increase by 17 percent, with record consumer lending as the main factor for this."
Debt may not be a matter of much concern until a person is working and earning, but it is not clear how unpaid debts will affect his well - being in the old age.
A study by the Economic and Business Research Centre, together with specialists from More 2 Life loaning funds, has shown that over the past four years, unguaranteed debts increased by more than a third, more than twice the average of the country over 55 to 74 years.
This age group usually borrows through credit cards and spends 30 percent more each month than earns.
Boyle added: “More than one in 55 years of age chooses to pay debts from pension funds, and this will affect their life in retirement.
In most cases, they are the only savings they have "must" saved.
In addition, people think that by using their wealth they will pay out later, but when they change their assets, they do not receive as much money as they expect.
If the price of the assets falls, this situation will only become worse."
After poisoning to half Serena Williams sing “I Touch Myself” to draw attention to breast cancer
Serena Williams published a video in which she sings the classic Divinyls song “I Touch Myself” with her hands covering a naked breast.
Tennis has shared the clip on its Instagram page and explained that the video was created to encourage women to check their breasts themselves.
“In this month of the fight against breast cancer I recorded the version of the world hit I Touch Myself in order to remind women to check themselves regularly,” wrote Williams.
“I came out of my comfort zone, but I wanted to, because this problem affects women of all races around the world.
The most important thing is to identify as early as possible, which helps to save many lives.
I hope that I will be able to remind women of this."
He continued: “This music clip is part of the project “I Touch Myself Project”, which is implemented in honor of the famous Chrisy Amphlett – it died of breast cancer and gave us its hit in order to remind women of their health first."
The project supported by the bottom-up trikotage brand “Berlei for Breast Cancer Network Australia” (BCNA) started in 2014 after the death of 53 years of Amphlett.
The video published by the tennis star in its Instagram account has received more than 1.5 million reviews and numerous fans praises for how the tennis player painted the song.
“The warmest wishes behind this clip and your courage to do this.
Thank you, Serena," wrote one fan.
Another added: “Serena, it’s FUTURE.
20 years ago, I had breast cancer and found my node myself, even when my mammographs did not show anything.
You just have to check it out.
Thank you for not afraid of leaving the comfort zone – you're a real dance!"
For “Berli” project “I Touch Myself Project” has also released a new snake skin pattern vest “The Chrisy”, inspired by a rock star.
100 percent of the profits from the sale of the vest will be sacrificed to BCNA.
When checking for yourself, it is important to know what signs and symptoms should be looked for.
The signs of breast cancer are not only nodules but also abnormal size or shape of the breast, rash or wounds, discharge from the spine, skin surface inserts, persistent pain or skin texture changes.
In addition, swelling at the arm or keystones, swollen veins, and a spatula may be warned of a cancer.
It is recommended that women check their breasts monthly.
If you notice any evidence of breast cancer, you should contact your family doctor immediately.
If your family doctor determines that your symptoms need to be assessed further, he will send you to a breast cancer clinic.
Adam Driver made the entire SNL filming group quatto
Adam Driveris was a guest star of the week "Sturday Night Live" and actually tried to make fun.
The best release jokes are usually not related to a specific actual event – just like a new exhibition entitled “Career Day”.
The day of U.S. high school, when students bring their dads, and a teenager, Mortdecai (Pete Davidson), reluctantly agrees that his father, the old oil magnet Abraham H. Parnassus, would speak.
Parnassus, whose mega-manic personality could be inspired by Daniel Day-Lewiss’ character Daniel Plainview from the film "Bus blood", tells the characters about how the oil industry was controlled.
"I've got seven months too early," says Parnassus for the students.
“Incubator technology has just been invented, so I was put in a cast iron pot and heated in a pizza oven until I learned to walk.
My bones were not hardened, but not my spirit.
Be strong and crush your enemies!"
Davidson and his colleague, Actor of the SNL, Aidy Brryant, play a teacher, as soon as they're outrageous and can't look at Driver in the eye.
However, the performances of the actor of the Star Wars are just coming up and he begins to tell about the personal war with another oil magnet H.R. Pickins.
"I've spent your granddaughter!" he's a scent.
“I filled her belly with my sturdy seeds and ruined your boy – it’s my ultimate craving, H.R.!”
Parnassus in less than five minutes became the same memorable character of Adam Driver as Kylo Ren from two films.
"Be damned, H. R.!"
Kendrick's Lamaro Songs: There have appeared on the Internet eight unheard tracks
It seems that many missing Kendrick Lamaro songs were taken away.
On Saturday, eight unheard works have been expanded on the Internet, whose parties were sung by SZA, Busta Rhymes, Jay'us Rockas, Isaiah Rashad and Abiso Soul.
I don't know where the songs were spread, nor is the whole set name "Bad Kid Hill City EP" and the cover illustration (which is probably created by the fan) not official.
It may be that only demonstration and unfinished versions of songs have been evicted, sounding as if they were recorded at different stages of Lamar's career.
“Gang Member” could belong to the “Good Kid Fashion City” era, while “Heroin” produced together with the SZA, is more similar to the sound track “DAMN./Black Panther”.
The following songs are distributed in the kit:
"Gang Member";
"The Only Nigga";
"Want In Life";
"Loved Ones" (su SZA);
"Own This City";
‘Heroin (with SZA, Jayumi Rocku, Isaiah Rashad and Ab Soul)’;
“Look Over Your Shoeers” (with Busta Rhymes and Michael Jackson);
"Swimming Pools Alternate."
The Independent contacted Kendrick Lamaro on a comment.
Conversation with the musical "Čikaga": There are no tickets left in Klaipėda, invite to Vilnius or Kaunas
Lithuanian desire to see the music theatre "Čikaga" of Klaipėda State does not pray.
For this reason, the most popular Lithuanian musician ever prepared for another round through the country's largest arenas.
However, about 1.5 months before the appearance, the halls begin to grow up.
The organizers announce that all tickets to the musical are already sold in Klaipeda Švyturio Arena, and tickets to the performances of Kaunas Žalgiris and Vilnius Siemens Arenas.
In the port city, tickets are no longer available for some time, so we invite all who want to see this indifferent misplaced musical to go to Kaunas or Vilnius, where there is still some tickets.
The demonstrations will take place in December, so when you come from there, not only will you see our musical, but also will have a great opportunity to see the flowers of the largest cities of the country," Laima Vilimienė, the head of the Klaipėda State Theatre, will suggest the way to the music fans.
In December, Čikaga’s viewers will meet some changes in the composition of the performers.
One of the main musical roles was first entrusted to Actor Thomas Žaidai.
Talenting and well-known actor from the TV screens in Čikaga will fit the unique Billy Flynn - the best and most influential Chicago lawyer, who will change people's fate without hats.
Since the museum "Čikaga" of Klaipėda State Music Theatre is adapted to larger spaces and arenas, the composition of the performers who appear in it is also higher than that of the work shown in Broadway.
In Lithuanian Čikaga, almost half a dozen artists appear.
The main roles of women are entrusted to the charming soloist of Klaipėda State Music Theatre Beatai Ignavičiūtė (killer Velma Kelly) and to the charming soloist of Kaunas Music Theatre Gabriele Bielskyte (killer Roxie Hart).
The museum "Čikaga" depicts the criminal world of Chicago in the third decade of the 19th century, which turns prison walls into starry hills.
It is a musical satir of criminal justice that tells us about two murderers seeking attention and recognition.
The puzzle has a sexuality and irony.
No matter where the main heroes - Roxie Hart and Velma Kelly - the meaning of life is to light up in a bright star.
Their life - it's life on the first page of the message, on the title, the glossy, the glory of the alley...
On 13 December, Čikaga will be displayed in Klaipeda Švyturio Arena, on 18 December - in Kaunas Žalgirio Arena, on 20 December - in Vilnius Siemens Arena.
Tickets are distributed by "Tiketa".
Living room furniture in Kaunas
The website can be described as a representative house area where we spend time with our friends, welcome guests, etc. Therefore, it should be arranged in such a way that it is convenient not only for the owners of the apartment or the house, but also for guests.
Depending on the size of the site, walls, ceiling decoration, host taste, appropriate furniture should be selected.
The website should not only be beautiful, but also comfortable.
It is best to get help to invite an interior designer to optimally fill the space so that it is not overloaded or vice versa - too empty.
It is advisable to first set the main point of the site, i.e. the item you will combine with the furniture and other details.
This may be a fireplace or other important site interior accent.
It would also be nice to create a chat room where guests could communicate in a comfortable way so that their furniture, etc, would not interfere with them.
Sofas, chairs should be placed close to each other so that your guests can sit down and talk.
So the arrangement of furniture must encourage communication, unite people, and not keep them from one another.
Don't put furniture at the wall.
The size of the room depends on what the distance should be from the walls.
Although the room is small, still leave at least a little space from the wall, do not place the furniture next to it.
If room space is large, leave even more space from the walls.
In fact, the higher the distance, the better.
Create balance when placing the furniture
Consider the various details that will be on your website.size and location.
All elements shall be compatible with each other.
The living furniture must be compatible with the interior details.
A small contrast is possible.
He will live the site's interior, but it should not be too large, because the interior will become unconconconferent.
We can always consult interior designers.
When you create your own interior, if you do not have the necessary knowledge, you risk moving to extremes: or you will create bored interiors because you will be afraid of experimenting, erring, inappropriately choosing or reshaping into improvisation.
Proper lighting
This is a very important thing.
After all, different light reveals the space differently.
The lighting shall be located at different levels: ceiling luminaires, wall luminaires, floor lamps.
Prosecutor’s Office sued the conviction of LKF’s heads
Vilnius Regional Prosecutor’s Office appealed the legal sentence of Vilnius Regional Court to former heads of Lithuanian Basketball Federation (LKF).
As reported by the Prosecutor’s Office on Monday, the complaint states that the municipality of Panevėžys did not have a legal basis to contribute financially to the reconstruction of the municipal budget of the private hotel in Panevėžys.
During the pre-trial investigation, it was found that in 2010 a contract for the purchase and sale of services between the Lithuanian Basketball Federation and Panevėžys City Municipality was concluded in order to find the possibility to finance the reconstruction of the hotel.
The prosecutors claim that the services which the municipality of Panevėžys had to provide to the municipality of Panevėžys under the contract were not planned and could not be provided because the services to be provided had already been financed by the State and the sponsors, some of the events had already taken place before the contract was signed and had already been paid out from other funds, and some of the events had already taken place after the VAT invoices had been issued: the money was transferred to the accounts for the events which had not yet been carried out.
Vilnius Regional Prosecutor’s Office argues against the judgment of the Court of First Instance highlighted the conclusion that the State itself entrusted and entrusted the municipality of Panevėžys with the task of reconstruction of a private hotel, as no state obligation for a particular hotel was present, but the proposal to the municipality of Panevėžys to resolve the issues of the development of hotels required for the championship as soon as possible.
According to the Prosecutor’s Office, the court has not rightly stated that the heads of LKF and Panevėžys municipality have tried to comply with the State’s obligation without having a legitimate road to do so, as the evidence in the case shows that there was a possibility of holding competitions for the European Basketball Championship group in other cities, without prejudice to the law.
The Vilnius Regional Prosecutor’s Office shall, by way of appeal, request the annulment of the conviction of the Court of First Instance and, in the present case, the adoption of a new - accused - sentence on seven natural persons and one legal person.
On October 15, the Vilnius Regional Court judged the General Secretary of the LKF, Mindaugas Balčiūnas, in full respect of all incriminal crimes.
This case relates to preparations for the European Men's Basketball Championship in Lithuania in 2011.
The charges against Balčiūns have been put on account of abuses, fraud and other crimes.
The Prosecutor’s Office M. Balčiūns accused him of agreeing, in his post as Secretary General of the LKF, with the Federal Financial Officer and the Executive Director, to draw up, on behalf of the Federation, the acts of transfer and other acts of false financial documents and accounts for the services provided to the municipality of Panevėžys by LKF.
According to the information provided by the officials of the Special Investigation Service (STT) Panevezys Board, funds of the municipality of Panevėžys could be fraudulently and fraudulently defrauded for the benefit of LKF and subsequently used for reconstruction of the hotel "Romantic" of the company "Via Unica".
Dalia Kuklerienė, head of this hotel, was accused of giving TV as a bribe.
All those who have been tried with Mr Balčiūn have been excused.
The prisons in this case were submitted to eight natural persons and one legal person to the Lithuanian Basketball Federation.
Remote workplace - like Bermuda triangle
The number of people injured or killed at work in Lithuania between 1992 and now exceeds the total population of the city of Alytus and reaches about 83 thousand.
If the requirements for a particular physical place of work and its safety are clear, this is a very different, new Bermuda triangle, which makes the choice to work remotely - from home, public spaces, or even other countries.
According to insurance specialists, although the Law on Safety and Health at Work provides for the provision of remote-working workers from other employees of the company with different safety and health conditions, the diversity of modern forms of work may raise a number of questions, reports press release.
In the event of an accident in the household, compensation is paid by the employer for the first two working days from 80% and for the rest of the period Sodra.
If it is found that an accident happened during work - since the first day of incapacity for work, Sodra compensates 100% of the salary.
When assessing the statistics submitted by the State Labour Inspectorate and the damage administered by the CTA, it is obvious that an absolute majority of accidents and various injuries occur in the workplace.
In most cases, these are various physical activities where the risk of injury is greater: care is taken against devices or equipment, concentration or coordination is lost.
However, the offices, which are now concentrated on most of the most demanding, best-paid professionals, are facing their own challenges caused by the freedom of mobility granted by employers," said Jevgenija Krikšūnė, Head of the Department for Human Resources Management of the BTA.
The legislation in force in Lithuania recommends that employees' duties and liability limits be clearly regulated, working time, location and functions should be defined, and that this also applies to the formation of work remotely.
If this is done, it is easier to determine whether or not an accident occurred during work.
It is true that there are different situations and inconsistencies, each case being examined individually.
Employees are also often heard about the fact that, for example, when travelling to or from work or during working meetings for accidents occurring, the employer is responsible.
However, there is a great deal of nuance and reservations in this case, and I would encourage both workers and employers to initiate interviews, to find out and to the maximum extent that they can identify the situations that are actually considered to be accidents at work, and to which the status of domestic injuries will already be present," the expert advises.
J. Krikšūnė states that, in these times, when a computer and mobile phone connection and a stable Internet connection is often sufficient for the performance of a job function, the employee will not necessarily work in the place and time specified in the agreement.
Workers are mobile, they can choose not to work at home that day, but to drink coffee while enjoying the sun in the coffee shop or park.
It's gonna be a job or not?
What if the hours discussed are not in accordance with the agreement?
There may be very uncertain situations, the circumstances of which help to explain the investigation being carried out, initiated by Sodra or the State Labour Inspectorate," says the specialist.
According to her, in financial terms, the main difference between the event at work and the household is the amount of unemployment benefit.
J. Krikščiūnė admits that I had to informally hear unpleasant experiences when employers try to conceal the real circumstances of accidents or injuries and try to persuade workers to seek medical attention outside work, take responsibility for themselves, thus delinquishing financially.
This is an unfair, disrespectful view of the employee and should not be tolerated.
On the other hand, the mobility of people already mentioned encourages the search for additional instruments that could help businesses in similar situations: this is also the employer's insurance of civil liability for damage to workers, the acquisition of accident insurance, insurance in the event of disability or even death, and health insurance is also relevant," says Mr Krikčūnė.
Mobile signature system is in operation again
After the deletion of the malfunction on Monday, the mobile signature system is again operating in Lithuania, BNS confirmed the representatives of the service provider Estonian IT company "SK ID Solutions".
This company reported the disturbances on Monday morning, the inconvenience was experienced by the customers of Bite, Telia and some customers of Tele2.
The disruptions were also recorded in Estonia, but representatives of SK ID Solutions could not comment on the situation in that country.
Lithuanian regbio collection - Polish lessons
The Lithuanian regby team that debituates the European Triphyon Division has so far been so difficult to level up to competition at higher levels.
The Triphy division on the Old continent is the third according to its capacity after the Six Nations tournament and the European Championship.
There's a team of 13-18 ratings on the continent.
The Lithuanians of the competition started in October with solid victory in Šiauliai 30:10 against the Czech team.
And last weekend the Lithuanian national team visited Łódź, where it did not match the Polish team - 0:33 (0:12).
Although Lithuanians were self-defenced, in the battles the rules were often violated and Polish refractories broke out with blows of fine.
The fines of 3, 10, 27 and 37 minutes were implemented by Wojciech Piotrowiczius, which gave them a 12-point victory.
In the first chair, Lithuanians had 10 minutes of playing without a yellow card received the Nautvydas Mazylis.
In the second chair, guests held several attacks, but they failed to complete them effectively.
At that time, Poles managed to break our defenses.
Maneusz Plichta, followed by Krystian Pogorzelskis and Matheusz Adamskis, has been subjected to the imputation of the ball on the perceptible area.
Lithuanian team coach from Kar Ntando Manyosha, who played in addition to a number of important players, acknowledged the competitive advantage and claimed that such matches provided a lot of valuable experience.
"The Poles played very well and prevailed in all the components of the game.
Our goal was to stand up for as long as possible in this game.
We just got up to this higher level, and we have to get to know it.
We won the first match before the Czechs, but now we met very powerful rivals and had to recognise their advantage.
The Polish national team gave us useful lessons," said a specialist from PAR who has been standing next to the Lithuanian national team for four years.
The next match "Trophy" will be played by Lithuanians on April 6, 2019 at home with Portuguese or Romanian.
The Dutch and Swiss teams still competed in this division.
Joseph Blazerne became the adviser to the Minister for Culture
Minister of Culture Lianos Rūkotės-Jonssons started working as adviser to Joseph Blazerin.
Mr Blažans informed the Minister about matters of advisory archives, libraries, museums and cultural heritage management.
J. Blažan, the director of the Lithuanian Literature and Art Archive, professor of the Museum Department of Communication of Vilnius University, has acquired a scientific degree in the field of art science at Vilnius Academy of Arts.
According to the report, the minister's adviser is the author of many scientific articles on conservation of cultural heritage and values.
The Japanese coast guard is looking heavily for the missing island
Esanbe Hanakita Kojima - this name was given to the little island in the north of Japan in 2014.
A small, pointless and undervalued island, which was, in principle, unsuitable for life, was very important for Japan.
What is so important is that the area that is missing now is under intensive surveillance - will it still come to fruition?
Why does Japan need this island?
Don't stand up.
It is likely that the ice and submarine landslides over and above the water surface were covered with this island for all time, even though it was almost two feet [two m] away.
It is almost clear that the island simply collapsed, but at least its traces are expected to be found.
When no one knows exactly when the island was gone - it was so useless that nobody was going too much of it.
Perhaps the first of the disappearance of Esanbe Hanakita Kojima was learned by Japanese fishermen who sometimes used the island as an aid to visual navigation.
Its disappearance is not a tragedy even for these fishermen, because there are better ways to catch where it can be fished and where disputed Russian waters begin.
That was exactly what Esanbe Hanakita Kojima meant.
This narrow strip of the earth was the western edge of the Cyrillic Hall.
This is the island chain, which Russia calls the Courole Islands, and Japan is the northern territory.
The conflict with some such breaks has continued since the middle of the 19th century, but the full force has risen in the 20th century.
There are natural resources in these areas, but also historically Japan believes that islands should belong to it.
The demand is that the Japanese explore these islands since the middle of the 17th century.
They first formed a map, carried out more detailed surveys, registering a large number of small salads.
The agreements between Japan and Russia signed in 1855 indicated that the latter were in Sachalin and that Japan was in all the Cyril Islands.
Thus, these two states survived until 1905 when the Russian Empire defeated Japan in the war in Sachalin.
In 1945, the Soviet Union made use of the situation in Japan and opened the Curles Islands.
Japan, by the way, does not make great claims on the entire lingerie, even though it was the first to be there, but would like to have four islands - Iturupo, Kuanashi, Siktotan and Chabomai.
Japan feels that it has a historical right, because the islands were the first to investigate and they also belonged to Japan under the 1855 agreements.
In 2009, Japan proposed equal distribution of these four islands, but Russia did not even consider accepting such a proposal.
Japan is quite close to the northern territories, but now the island that is disappearing is like a lost geographical link.
There's gone that physical marker about Japan's presence in those waters.
This is a great loss, which is why we are looking for island residues.
However, even if they were found, Esanbe Hanakita Kojima will not be in line with the simple definition of an island - that must be on land.
This means a slight reduction in the Japanese territory and a significant reduction in the Exclusive Economic Zone, calculated from the shores.
It's just interesting what the island's search mission expects: it won't be lost or gone.
Unbelievable drama in Lithuanian-Polish boxing team double
More than a week, the final version of judges had to wait for what became the winners of the cross-border meeting between Lithuanian and Polish boxing teams.
Nine Polish and Lithuanian doubles were held in Poland.
The four eyewitnesses won the Lithuanians, as well as the Poles.
The result of the decisive double is the final decision of the long-standing panel of judges and the competition secretariat.
The national meeting started with the victory of Lithuanian boxers.
Many-time Lithuanian champion Marius Vyšniauskas (weight category up to 52 kg) confidently 3:0 defeated Jakukas Surma, soon Edgars Kurdelis (up to 60 kg) after the persistent struggle 2:1 over Radomir Obersniak.
Two victorious victories followed: Damian Dorkacs (up to 64 kg) 3:0 overcame Mant Dunzh, and Philip Wachala (up to 69 kg) 2:1 overcame Simon Ban.
Vytautas Balsys (up to 75 kg) returned to Lithuanian team.
Lithuanian 2:1 defeated Bartos Golebiewskis.
In the next battle Piotras Szczukowski (up to 81 kg) in the third round, the clear victory over Eedars Kasmotis was overcome and the result became equal to 3:3.
The brothers Joculus followed in different ways.
Robert Jokulys 3:0 (up to 91 kg) defeated Andrzej Colton, and Arvydas Jokulys (over 91 kg) had the advantage of Adam Kulik in the first round.
The main discussion was the fight against Tado Tamašausko (up to 91 kg) and Michalo Soczynski.
It was due to the final result of its cross-border meeting that the publication took more than a week.
One judge gave victory to the Pole, two judges to the Lithuanian, but due to a technical error, the point for one judge to Lithuanian was counted to M. Soczynski.
After a long dispute, the victory was left to the Polish boxer - 2:1.
The leaders won the result at the Lithuanian-Polish National Assembly 10:8 (two points for victory).
They were able to bring Lithuanians back to their home for the truncated defeat of the last match.
At a meeting in Marijampolė in 2015, Lithuanian boxers won as many as five battles out of six and won the result at 10:2.
The meeting of the Lithuanian national team leaders in Poland was a general rehearsal before the Lithuanian boxing championship, which will take place in Šilutė on 14-17 November.
After the country's priority, a new Lithuanian boxing team will be formed, which will defend the country's honor at the World and European Championships next year.
How does a dog determine, by trace, the direction in which a man went?
You already know the dog's ooster is extremely sensitive.
They can smell hidden explosives, drugs, blood, other animals, and some even recognize diseases by smell.
The well-known trackers in movies are well-known dogs, but their work is much more difficult than you thought.
How do they determine the direction in which the owner of the trace went?
Indeed, this is much more complex than you think.
The tracking of parentheses consists of three stages - discovery, direction detection and tracking.
The second stage is much more difficult than the other two, because having reached traces it is difficult to decide which direction a man took.
After all, there's no difference between the different steps, not a second, so their smell doesn't vary greatly, is it?
Not really.
In 1990, a study published by the University of Oslo described experiments during which a dog had reached a 90 - degree angle on the path that a man passed through.
Tests carried out on grass and asphalt.
And in many cases, dogs have easily identified the direction of human movement even when they have tried to mislead them by walking backwards.
Can you imagine the complexity of this task?
The difference between the characteristic odour of the adjacent traces is very small, and with time it decreases even more.
However, scientists say that this is not as strange as dogs could say and which part of the foot touched the ground first.
This is because their ooster is an incredible tool.
The dog’s brain is dominated by areas responsible for the ooster (as the regions responsible for sight dominate our brain).
The dog’s nose has 125-300 million odour receptors.
Overall, the dog’s ooule is at least 40 times more sensitive than humans, but their ability to interpret different smells is even more important.
The researchers then conducted similar experiments and traced the bicycles, but it was much more difficult for dogs to track their direction.
This is due to the fact that bike cancers are not segmented as traces of the passing man, making it more difficult to isolate different places for comparison - this is not natural for dogs and therefore requires more time.
True, dogs are not the strongest owners of the ooster.
This title is likely to come to bear.
The female bears follow the ready - prepared females for hundreds of miles, and the brown bear smells the animal as much as 30 miles [30 km] away.
Private forests promise to regulate cuttings
Minister of Environment Kęstutis Navickas on Tuesday in the Seimas will explain the felling of forests.
At the end of August, public dissatisfiedness arose as a result of the forests in Labanoro regional park.
The month has been halted by the deforestation of these forests.
The Minister has acknowledged that investigations into cuttings in Labanor have shown that there have been no severe violations.
However, the Ministry of Environment has already introduced a part of the restrictions, taking into account the recommendation of the working group to strengthen deforestation in state-owned forests.
The Minister promises that other legislation for forest felling will be prepared by the end of the year.
The same restrictions are being applied to the boundaries of state forests, which are also applicable to private forest holdings.
Agnė Jagelavičiūtė revealed the strategy of building 170,000 followers
We need to give people what they want, and join together what they want, in the LRT TV program "Culturing with Nomeda" says Agnė Jagelavičiūtė.
According to the stylistics, so she gradually formed a huge crowd of fans.
"In the beginning, you beat a man's taste, you're heading to yourself, and in the course of time you're a little drunken taste," says A. Jagelavičiūtė.
A. Jagelavičiūtė has more than 170,000 followers in his feisbukas account - it reached this figure using a particular strategy: "In the beginning, you can hit a man's taste, set your pace to yourself, and in the course of time, a little bit of a drink of that taste."
Stylist A. Jagelavičiūtė claims to be beyond uncertainty, thus showing his face as he is - authenticity and ability to find the best way of presenting is the most important criteria of popularity on social networks.
She notes that human culture is no longer present in social networks, because many interserves are coming to them to make someone feel sick or to read the comments of other people who are living around them: 'For example, it was a time when I wanted to go out with everyone and make a curse - I don't have it now.'
"Frequent life is the worst thing.
And in social networks, there is a great deal of this.
Feisbike is still a little less than an instance," she says.
A. Jagelavičiūtė, who has an education in interior design and oil painting, says that he sends a specific message on social networks - he talks about the emmancipation of women.
It also promotes the production of magazines and sees works in its work.
"I can't say that fashion magazine is a pure art expression, but I know it's really a lot there.
I believe there is a lot of creativity in my work, just like vanity.
I'm on the balance - it's my key to that huge number.
I don't want to create a false life.
It's better to give people what they want, and to quietly put on what they want," says A. Jagelavičiūtė.
One of the most difficult events involving young people is classical music concerts.
Their popularity was raised by well-known people in life stories: talking about behind the scenes, failures, and life-related events, thus remaining authentic.
This is the strategy that Mr Jagelevičiūtė proposes to apply to the whole culture.
According to her, culture is not suitable for anyone, without any entertainment and showing true values.
"How a boring teacher against students is there a chance?
If we do not find a way to present that art, do not advertise without advertising, there will still be nothing.
When we're real and we're gonna get a reader, maybe something's gonna change.
Once it's gone, the second, the third, and the second, it's a addiction," she shares her insights.
Three people disappeared after the helicopter in the Gulf of Lituya north of June
On Saturday, after the helicopter accident north of June, the search for three people was started in Alaska.
One man was saved after a Friday disaster, and the other three were not found.
The helicopter collapsed near the Gulf of Lituya, northwest of June.
It was found to be Airbus H125 on a distant journey to Grand Pierre Texas.
100 ft off the shore was found on Friday.
According to “Associated Press”, one person saved was 14 years old.
She was reported to have a mild hypothermia, but there were no other problems.
Two adults and two adolescents flew into the fallen helicopter.
According to KTVA, David King (53), Josh Pepper (42) and Andrew Pepperd (11.
It was found that Senior Pepperd is the director of Davis Constructionrs & Engineers, a construction company in Alaska.
I don't know what the accident caused.
The National Council on Transport Security stated that an investigation was initiated.
"I will crash the helicopter, which was completely new – just received from the plant, was flying two adults and two teenagers", says a report from the coastguard officers, based on the KTVA.
The pilot was identified as having 40 years of experience in fixed wing aircraft and helicopters, including in Alaska.
According to Anchorage Daily News, family friend Jeff Brodsky said that loved ones “have not yet lost hope that a miracle will take place. ”
As of February 17, 2016, rescuers re-launched the search for an experienced alpinist who disappeared in Scotland on the Mount of Nevis in Fort William.
On Saturday, three people were sought in Alaska after the helicopter accident.
"I have experienced sexual violence"
President's advisor, Kellyanne'a Conway, revealed sexual violence on Sunday morning.
Conway commented on the direct disputes between Judge Bretto Kavanaugh and his accused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
Conway was thrilled to reveal that he had been subjected to sexual violence himself, and defended Kavanaugh against his leader, Jake Tapper, claiming that the judge was accused of sexual violence by ignoring the facts that were unfavourable to the charges.
“I feel very sorry for the victims of sexual abuse and violence.
I experienced sexual violence myself," Conway said CNN on Sunday in the State of the Union.
“I am the victim of sexual violence and I do not think that Judge Kavanaugh, Take Tapper, Jeff Flake or anyone else is responsible for this.
We must be responsible for our own behaviour."
Conway argued that the news network must be ashamed of a comparison of Kavanaugh with Bill Cosby, who was sentenced last week to prison in the state prison in Pennsylvania from three to ten years.
Conway was also criticised by the Senate Committee of Courts because he was unable to eliminate former President Bill Clinton, who had had oral sex in his office and lied to the people of the United States.
The survey showed that Kavan Augh's and Ford statements divided the U.S. society
The Americans disagree on the statements made by Bretto Kavanaugh and his accused Christine Blasey Ford – the accused claims that she was sexually attacked by a judge when they were teenagers.
I think that Ford or Kavan Augh lie almost coincided: 38 percent of those surveyed say that Kavan Augh was probably or certainly lying with evidence, and 30 percent said the same about Ford.
The Senate Committee of Courts listened to both parties when Ford sent a letter to senator Dianne Feinstein with detailed accusations against the judge.
After receiving the letter, both Ford and Kavan Augh said that it was ready to speak before the committee.
When giving the statements, Ford claimed that 100 percent were sure that at the eve of the 1980s it was tried to attack Kavanaugh rather than another person.
In her emotional opening speech, 51 - year - old woman said that she felt a civil duty and could not remain silent.
"I'm so scared," she said.
"I'm here because I think it's my civil duty to tell me what happened to me when Brett Kavanaugh and I studied in high school."
Ford and two other women were accused of sexual abuse, Kavanaugh said that "nothing was sexually attacked in high school, college or ever later".
“All the way you could tried to find someone that would stop me voting for my nomination, no matter how unrealistic or disgusting it is,” he said.
"It's the simplest fucking last minute."
The results of the survey conducted by YuuGov on 27-28 September, which surveyed 2607 people, are not surprising: the people concerned differed from the people who believed in different parties: the democrats believed in Ford (73 percent), and the Republican – Kavanaugh (74 percent), although the Ford statements believed more Republicans than the Kavanaugh – Democrats (14 percent compared to 11 percent).
Founder of the exhibition "Body Worlds", called the Death of Doctors, wants to be cut and displayed at his own exhibition
A German scientist who has invented plasticization wants to become an eternal part of his exhibition "Body Worlds".
Guntheris von Hagens has developed an innovative approach that allows us to demonstrate the bodies, skulls and organs of the world in an exhibition that has brought us both ingest and ingest, and controversial assessments.
In 73 C.E., a man who had suffered death told his wife, after his death, to plasticize him to become a permanent exhibit at the Exhibition "Body Worlds", which will be opened this week in London.
“In a way, this will be the completion of his life’s work.
I now understand that I will have to do this because I will thus express recognition and love," Angelina Whalley said to the newspaper The Observer.
She said that the man gave strict instructions on what to do with his body, and the whole process would take about a year.
Muscles, nerves and arteries must be removed and silicone injected into the body and placed in the right position.
“He said to me, “Angelina, you can freeze me up to -25 degrees Celsius for a year, but then you’ll have to add your hands, otherwise I’ll freeze it. ”
So I'll be able to mourn for a year, then I'll have to do it."
Then he will join the exhibition in the pavilion of London next to other bodies that are frozen in the right positions, such as riding a horse or playing cards, by wearing an integral soft fan from his image.
Von Hagens became famous in the United Kingdom for a broadcast on British live television (this was the first public display in 170 years).
More than 47 million people have visited "Body Worlds" exhibitions around the world since 1995.
Peters Tabernalis, the founder of Budy Worlds London, said that 100% of the exhibition, covering about 28,000 square feet, was presented by the exhibits who were giving their consent because they wanted to help the living, light them and help to see possible problems."
“ We see and read so many terrible things that we are afraid of death.
None of her, death is common to us all, and I think that "Body Worlds" shows that there is no need to fear", said Tabernalis.
Ronaldo's lawyers threaten to bring an action for challenge against rape
The Portuguese football stars Cristiano Ronaldo’s lawyers said on Friday that the German magazine, which printed the statements by an American who was “enviously illegal” that Ronaldo had been raped in 2009, would be sued.
One of Ronaldo’s lawyers, Christian Schertz, stated that the article of the magazine “Deer Spiegel” was “inadmissible statement of private accusations” and he will seek legal compensation of the magazine to his client.
The application was sent to Reuters, a company representing Ronaldo, in response to a request to comment on Friday's online published "Der Spiegel".
Gestifte did not answer specific questions about the content of the Deer Spiegel statement, which Reuters could not independently verify.
Den Spiegel first made accusations in April 2017.
One of the most popular athletes in the world, Ronaldo earned five times the title of the best player in the world.
This summer he moved into Italy's Juventus from Real Madrid; the Italian club refused to comment on De Spiegel's statement.
The magazine announces that the alleged rape took place in the hotel room of Las Vegas in June 2009 – this was said by Leslie Stivallas, the attorney of Kathryna Mayorda who brought accusations.
Stovallas told the magazine that Ronaldo and Mayorda had agreed out of court.
Mayorg agreed to sign a confidentiality agreement for Ronald's paid $375 000.
Stovallas did not immediately respond to Reuters e-mails regarding comments, and Mayorga did not respond to calls on the home phone.
However, Stovallas told the magazine Deer Spiegel that he had lodged a civil complaint in order to cancel the confidentiality agreement.
Mayorga’s magazine Deer Spiegel said that it no longer has a contract, because it still feels the consequences of the night nine years ago.
"I have suffered serious crises," she said.
“ And again, accusation of rape.
I was praising him, and I accused myself of signing it."
Sustainable business ensuring the independence of creators
Are you ready to try “Self-Publishing 3.0”?
The new White Paper published today by the Union of Independent Creators on the "#selfpub3.0" website explains for the first time how to join other business makers, become independent and start a sustainable creative business.
The founder of the association of independent creators Orna Ross, who has been recognized for the first time by one of 100 most influential people, will explain at the Digital Book World 2018 conference why developers should allow the methods of “Self-Publishing 3.0”.
“Share trends, such as the growing personal brands, responsible consumption and reading of mobile phones, create conditions that are particularly favourable to the business of creators, together with digital publishing technologies,” says Ross.
However, these opportunities can only be exploited by independent and creative thinkers who understand the value of intellectual property.
“#selfpub3.0” encourages developers to create several closed sources through websites that create the conditions for successful publishing and media.
Direct sales, subscription models, focused assistance, broad dissemination models and other sources of income, such as online training and related entity activities, can be earned.
“#selfpub3.0” also encourages the dissemination of books in a wide range of formats, using retailers and other services to the widest possible audience.
The main aim of #selfpub3.0 is to encourage a change of mindset and to learn how to manage your creative business, so that intellectual property, which is the most important creative property, is not transferred unwisely to another enterprise, such as a specialised publishing house or an independent publishing service provider.
According to Ross, this is how developers can increase their income, influence and impact, and these methods must be taken into account not only by every creator of the digital age, but also by publishers; it also stressed that the real independence of creators, like other people, is ensured by commercial and creative freedom.
The future is here.
And its prospects for independent developers are now the best.
The book “Self-Publishing 1.0” describes computer publishing and printing according to request.
The topic “Self-Publishing 2.0” is the sale of e-book readers and telephone books in online book shops.
Now the new “Self-Publishing 3.0” era begins, where independent publishers will be taught to start a viable and sustainable business.
A union of independent creators is the only global non-profit organisation that unites authors who allow their books to be printed.
The Union's objective is to develop the skills of independent publishers, promote ethical activity, help beginners sell books and encourage developers to carry out a sustainable digital business that will ensure their independence.
Presidents of the country and of the central bank warned the Italian Government of the planned deficit
After hearing the populist government's plans to significantly increase the deficit expenditure in the following year, the Italian President and the head of the central bank warned on Saturday that the country's debt had to be managed.
On Thursday evening, the Steering Party (the opposition to the Five-star Movement and the right-wing North League) presented a motion for a deficit of 2.4% of gross domestic product (GDP) and three times the objective of the previous administration.
This report confused the market on Friday and encouraged the sale of bonds and hit the banks' shares.
Moreover, such plans do not align with and monitor compliance with EU fiscal rules.
In his appeal to the audience in the President's Chamber, which mentions the 70th anniversary of the constitution, President Sergio Mattarella mentioned that according to the country's framework laws, "the budget must be balanced and the debt must be managed".
“We will protect our citizens’ savings,” he said.
At a later conference in central Italy, the President of the Bank of Italy, Ignazis Visco, said that a further increase in the country's debt, which is the largest of all the major economies of the European Union, was no longer possible and represents 131% of GDP.
“Italy must give priority to public and private investment and to manage and reduce public debt,” said Visco, based on the State News Agency “Ansa”.
"School shall be progressively reduced."
Head of the North League and Deputy Prime Minister Matte's Salvinis answered to Mattarella's words that the debt increased due to the strict requirements imposed by Brussels for a year.
“Be calm, Mr President,” said Salvinis in his statement.
“The state debt has been exacerbating for years because of European budgets imposed, and we are finally changing plans and seeking better future and growth.”
In the past, contrary to Mattarella or Visco, Louis Di Maio, the leader of the five-star movement, said that money stolen in the past would be returned to people's budget, but added that the government did not seek to oppose the EU or financial markets.
The Management Party pressured Mr Giovannis Trias, who had not joined the group, to support their planned deficit expenditure.
The Italian media claimed that Mattarella supported Tria's failed attempt to maintain a budget deficit that would not reach 2 percent of GDP.
The Presidents of a Party and of the Central Bank shall not directly influence economic policy.
The president of the 77th century may reject the law and return it to Parliament, but only once.
Then the parliament can adopt the unchanged law again and legitimise it.
Official information: Indonesian tsunami sensors spent huge waves
The Indonesian geophysical agency withdrew the warning of the tsunami 34 minutes after its release, and a severe earthquake later took place, sending huge waves toward the northeast coast of the island of Sulawes, where hundreds of people died and thousands left without houses.
Car dunes under the tsunami of Pala, Indonesia, 29 September 2018.
At least 384 people died during the earthquake and tsunami of 7.5 miles (940 miles) from Jakarta.
Officials said on Sunday that the number of victims would likely increase.
On Friday, many people gathered for the festival at Palais Beach, which was hit by the waves of six feet [18 feet] high by dark noises.
The Geophysic Agency (BMKG), on Saturday, was critical in the social media: many people wondered whether the warning on the tsunami was withdrawn too early.
The Agency stated that it had carried out a standard procedure and decided to withdraw the warning according to the data of the nearest flood sensor at about 200 km (125 miles) from Pala.
‘We do not have surveillance data from Pala.
Therefore, we had to decide on the data we had," said Rahmatas Triyon, Head of the BMKG earthquakes and tsunami centre.
The nearest flood gauge, which shows changes in sea level, only identified the “non-significant” wave of six centimeters (2.5 inch) and did not notice huge waves at Pala.
“If we had a flood meter near Pala or had data from there, of course, the situation would be better.
We have to think about this in the future," said Triyon.
According to officials, the tsunami hit Pala and the surrounding areas at a high speed – hundreds of kilometres per hour, but it is not clear whether it occurred before the warning was revoked or later.
Residents inspect the bodies on the street in search of their family members after the tsunami in Pala, Indonesia, 29 September 2018.
“On the basis of videos distributed in social media, we believe that the tsunami took place before the official cancellation of the warning,” said Triyon.
The peak earthquake of 9.5 points occurred on the second day of Christmas 2004 and caused a huge tsunami that killed some 226 000 people on the Indian Ocean, including 126 000 victims in Indonesia.
The pictured city of Pala, which is home to 380 000 people, is near the narrow gulf in the northeast of the island of Sulawes.
According to the Indonesian National Disaster Reduction Agency (GNPB), the tsunamis destroyed the city in 1927 and 1968.
According to the geophysical researcher Batptste Gomberto of Oxford University, the earthquake should not cause the tsunami.
On Friday the earthquake occurred due to a horizontal break – adjacent tectonic plates moved horizontally, not vertically, as usual for tsunamis.
“It is believed that there was a landslide in the sea that pushed out a lot of water and caused a tsunami,” he said, adding that the wave power moving toward the shore was able to concentrate in a narrow bay.
A representative of the disaster relief agency, Sutopo Purwo, said to the correspondents of his team that his team “will have to send easily understandable public warnings” when a warning about the tsunami was suddenly withdrawn.
According to the Ministry of Transport, text messages with warnings were sent repeatedly to the population, but Nugroho said that the power and communication lines of the earthquake area had been interrupted and there were no slides along the coast.
In the social media, the Indonesians questioned whether the BMWG had to cancel the tsunami warning, and they were offended that the information had not been provided in time.
"I am disappointed... The alert has been cancelled... And the tsunami has still occurred..." - Twitter user@zanogiccy sent a direct message to the BMWG.
Golf: The "Mollywood" duet is going to beat ticket sales records
On Saturday's occasion, Francesco Molinaris and Tommy Fleetwood became the first double of Europe to defeat all four pair match-makers, and will probably be recorded in history, as representing Europe is already the leading result at 10:6 against the Ryder Cup final.
By winning the result of Tiger Woods and Bryson Dechambeau in 5:4, they became the first European couple to win all four match.
Only Americans Larry Nelson and Lanny Wadkins managed to do so in 1979.
Trinitting results are 3:1, 5:4, 4:3 and 5:4 not all of them.
The couple three times won 14 important titles of Woods and twice won against Patrick Reed.
They also won the victory against Jordan, Spieth and Justin Thomas, the U.S. team this week, which won three other competitions.
Molinaris and Fleetwoods will have the opportunity to become the first Europeans to win five points out of the five available.
Fleetwoods has already earned most points in Ryder Cup unit competitions as a newer European.
A couple of young fans who mentioned "Mollywood" as a large group of young fans did not appear at first sight to be able to lead the European team forward.
The young men of the Ryder Cup, such as the Fleetwood, are not expected to perform such a performance, and Molinar did none of the previous six matches, and in four went down to rivals.
However, there was also hope: Fleetwoods was the first in Europe last year, knows Le Golf National Square as its five fingers and won the French Open tournament in 2017 and demonstrated decisive temperament during this year's U.S. Open.
Molinaris is a new British Open champion and is regarded by many as the most consistent gamer of the European tournament – a useful feature in a square where tall grass can cause destruction, as shown by American failures.
These game features and harmonious game in the square made them insurmountable.
“Now I feel a little empathy, but only Saturday”, said the relaxing Fleetwoods, playing with a wide smile face for the whole weekend.
This afternoon we have shown well, we have been playing stablely and well.
If we join in history, that will be a special achievement.
I'm just glad we tried for the team."
The Molinari also rejoiced.
“It was great to play with Tommy,” he said.
"But we have to fulfil our duty, not just to access record books, so tomorrow we will have to struggle hard for the 4.5 point that we need to win; it will not be easy."
Ritter's hot!
The Irish village has turned into a medieval battlefield
The Claregalway Castle, which was located in the west of Ireland, was a powerful, main fortress of the 15-century family originating from the English wheel and was remembered this Saturday as its origin.
Riterių double sword at Claregalway Castle in Golveja, Ireland, 29 September 2018
A completely restored house with a tower is converted into a medieval battlefield, where many enthusiasts from all corners of the world restored contact fights and games that were popular many centuries ago.
Mr. Carlos Dornāns, dressed in Rither I, and Donna Dornan is patrolling in the Claregalway Castle's largest art at the Middle Age Battle Festival in Golveja, Ireland, September 29, 2018.
“This is a great weekend departure and something unusual,” said Denise Fitzgerald of Ker, who had become the master of the tavern for the weekend.
“In this way, we returned to the simplest things.
I try to do everything as needed," said the theatre employee who is the first time involved in the armed fighting festival.
Officially hung fighters were in the field, and although their swords were bequeaks, the helmets of some were folded, and one wounded his lips.
The horsemen showed their skills by riding and cutting cabbage and aubergines in half.
The metal castings were used to make weapons, and the spices were sold to make medicines, and the craftsman’s weeping and painting wool.
The participants, who were deeply disposed and very proud, tried to feel the roles.
“I think anyone can wear a suit, but the feeling of being in the role is art”, said Helena Stackpoole, who played ice Eleanor Fitzgerald and had a unique opportunity to use his fashion design knowledge.
“All suits are hand-made.
I've already been sewing my belt for two years, and now I'm sending a dress and I just grabbed 800 pearls on her sleeves.
It is important to me," she said.
After the earthquake and the tsunami in Indonesia, the number of deaths rose to 832
According to the National Disaster Reduction Agency, the number of people killed on Sunday after the earthquake in Indonesia and the tsunami in Sulaves Island increased to 832 and the area affected is larger than originally thought.
A representative of the Agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, said at the news conference that many people were stuck in the cracks after a 7.5-point earthquake on Friday, causing six meters (20 ft) high tsunami waves.
FBI appealed to the second woman accused of candidate Kavanaugh
The FBI agents investigating the case of a candidate to the U.S. Supreme Court in Britto Kavanaugh appealed to the second woman accused of having a sexual attack, which was revealed on Sunday by the lawyer of this woman.
The report by Mr Deborah Ramirez, lawyer, John Clune, states that the investigation carried out by the FTB in the Cavanaugh case will not only include the individual accusations made by Dr. Christinea Blasey Ford at the dramatic Senate sitting this week.
Ramirez accused Kavanaugh of showing her his penis at a party where she was drunk and which took place in a conjoint of Yale University, when they both studied there.
U.S. President Donald Trump handed over the pressure of the moderate Senate Republicans and ordered the FBI to carry out a study after the Thursday Senate meeting, in which Professor Ford of the University of California made detailed accusations that Kavanaugh attempted to rape her at a party in 1982 when they both studied at school and were teenagers.
NBC News reported on Saturday that the White House had limited the scope of the FTB investigation.
The short one denied this and published a Twitter message: "I really want them to question all the people they need at their own discretion."
A representative of the White House, Rajas Shahas, said that the Senate had established the extent and duration of the FTB investigation (the study should be completed within a week).
“The White House allows agents to do what they are taught,” said Shahas.
United Kingdom will not withdraw environmental or animal protection standards after "Brexito"
Minister of Environment Michael Gove said on Sunday that the United Kingdom will not refuse environmental or animal protection standards to allow trade to take place after Brexito.
The Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs of Britain, Michael Gove, arrives at the Dauning Street in London, 24 September 2018.
Speaking at the annual Conference of the Conservative Party, Gove said that it would be useful for the United Kingdom to be aware of its quality foods and that the government will publish a food strategy this year.
Europe recovers Ryder Cup in unit competitions
Francesco Molinaris earned his fame on Sunday by returning Ryder's cup to Europe: the Italian defeated Phil Mickelson at the 16th well and earned a point that made it possible to achieve the desired result of 14.5.
Mickelson gave up his first ball in the water, and when he was able to survive Molinaris in the water, he won all five match per week, even though none of the previous six had survived.
The European victory has already ensured that the Italian strike on the start-up ground and the continent's victory lacked one point, while Henrik Stanson and Sergio Garcia's first match and were hit by at least half of the point.
At the beginning of the day, they had the result of 10:6 and had to earn four and a half points of a possible 12, so that they could recover the trophy and establish their rule at home, which lasted from the 1993s.
Prior to this, the team was only able to cancel the four-point difference and win the team's match: this was done by the U.S. team in 1999 in Brooklyn and Europe in the 2012 "Medina's miracle", but no one expected another amazing return.
Justin Thomas, Webbas Simpson and Tony Finau gave Jim Furyk's team the hope of winning the first match, but then the points of the European team spread throughout the square.
Thorbjorn Olesen broke Jordan's Spieth, and his teammate, John Rahm, Tigger Woods, lost four times from four important titles.
Ian Poulter, the best player in the Ryder Cup, was, probably, most of the ovations this week, when the best player in the world, Dustina Johnson, landed him on the 18th rafterfield and brought Europe closer to victory.
Then it was necessary to wait for the match to end first, and it was Molinari's game, which caused a wave of joy in a crowd that was the largest in the history of the event.
RT World News: German police guarding Erdogan used the neonacio name as a code word
According to the local media, secret officials in eastern Germany who kept Turkish President Erdogan on his visit to Berlin this week used the sadly famous name of the Neonazi extremist.
The Ministry of Home Affairs of the region claimed that the criminal police of the Land of Saxony in eastern Germany investigate two members of the elite anti-terrorist group SEC.
The men were assigned to protect the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan during his long-awaited journey to Germany.
Officials had to work in secret, so they had to use the code name according to the protocol.
They have chosen the Uwe Boehnhardt, a sad narco, belonging to the NSU group of extremists, who at the beginning of this century killed eight immigrants from Turkey, one Greek national and a German police officer.
The local media informs that a strange code name was found when two policemen requested permission to have the internal documents needed to carry out the task.
The officers in charge quickly and cancelled the police.
Petrica Kleine, Chief of Criminal Police of Saxony, responded to the news.
He said that the decision to use Boehnhard's name was "the most foolish one" and thus "the visually ignored sacrifices and their loved ones".
The Minister of the Interior of Saxony, Roland Woller, agreed to this statement and named the decision as “flying, fearing and totally unacceptable”.
The Erdogan Friday visit to Berlin led to many controversial assessments in Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel was criticised for accepting a manual accused of growing authoritarianism.
Merkel said that this visit was very important, “in the event of disagreement, it must be decided upon in person”.
The public first heard of the NSU in 2011, when the bodies of Boehnhardt and his fellow Uwe Mundlos were found in an eastern outstretched house in Germany.
It is believed that one of them killed another and then committed suicide after an unsuccessful attempt to rob a bank in the city of Eiznacho.
A third member of the Neonazi group was soon arrested, the last living remaining Beate Zschaepe.
In July of this year, the German court sentenced her to death for 10 charges of murder.
She denied her contribution to the murders, but her lawyer said that the accused was morally guilty because she did not try to stop the murders.
After the NSU scandal, the German security agencies received many criticisms.
The judges, activists, and relatives of the victims believe that the group had many more associates.
It also became clear that the German internal intelligence agency BfV infiltrated a large number of informants into the NSU and constantly impeded the investigation of group-related murders, attempts to kill and robberies.
Musk goes from the Head of Tesla and will have to pay a fine of $20 million to the Securities and Exchange Commission
Elona Muskas agreed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to bring him to court for fraud with Twitter messages, in which he said he would make Tesla a private company.
Muskas will have to withdraw from the manager's office, but the Director-General will remain.
The documents of the Agreement state that Muskas is to be removed from the Board of Directors of Tesla within 45 days and will not be allowed to return to these posts for three years.
In addition, he will have to pay a fine of $20 million.
Everything started with a Twitter message that was too careless or intentionally written misleadingly, so Muskas will have to receive confirmation prior to saying or publishing about Tesla "in any format, including, but not limited to, social media (e.g. Twitter), company website (e.g. company blog), press releases and calls to investors".
Tesla will have to pay another $20 million because Musko's initial Twitter messages have not been checked.
In a complaint by the Securities and Exchange Commission, Muskas is accused of misleading investors on August 7, by means of a Twitter message in which he claimed to have found funds in order to be able to make Tesla a private company whose one share would be worth 420 – so the company's securities cost more than 10 percent.
Muskas soon withdrew his words saying that Tesla would remain public and angry with investors.
The Securities and Exchange Commission decided that Musko’s initial statement “was wrong and misleading because it did not submit the facts”.
Muskas himself explained in the blog record that this error could be justified: after the meeting with the representative of Saudi Arabia's independent property fund, he felt that he had managed to reach an agreement on the funds.
It is reported that Muskas and the Securities and Exchange Commission had come closer to a milder punishment – Muskas would have had to abandon the position of President for only two years and not accept guilt, but Muskas refused this agreement on Thursday.
On Friday, the price of Tesla's securities fell and, most likely, it changed its opinion again and agreed with stricter conditions.
However, under a new agreement, like the old one, Musku does not have to confess to the blame for misleading investors.
A patriarch of Alexandria committed to support the Canonian Church of Ukraine and encouraged the unity of orthodox
Theodore II of Alexandria, the patriarch of the Order of Ukraine, stated on the basis of the canonical church of orthodox Ukrainian belonging to the patriarch of Moscow.
He spoke in response to the separation of the Russian Orthodox Church and Constantinopolis patriarch.
Theodore arrived on Thursday II in the city of Odessa in the south of Ukraine and met with the highest church representatives and believers in orthodoxism.
The Patriarch of Alexandria is one of the most respected orthodox hierarchs, descending only to the ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople.
“I came to tell you, don’t refuse orthodox faith and canonical churches,” the patriarch Theodore II said.
Before his visit to Odessa, he met with Polish orthodox church metropolis, Savva, who also supports the Ukrainian canonian church.
They also called for the prevention of conflicts arising from attempts to legitimise Ukrainian church autonomy.
“We will always support those who seek the unity of orthodox,” said Theodore II.
The Orthodox Church recently suffered a major crisis after the decision of Constantinople's patriarch to recognise the independence of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.
The latter belongs to the Russian orthodox church, also known as the Moscow patriarch.
Constantinople decided to send exarches to Kiev, thus violating the rule prohibiting one church of orthodox to intervene in other matters.
The Eczarchs are special members of the patriarch who formally occupy a higher position than the metropolis Onufriy, who is the current head of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church belonging to Moscow.
Moscow's patriarch responded wrongly to Constantinople's actions and withdrew all the common church services and membership of organizations led or co-chaired by the Constantinople representatives.
It is argued, however, that this decision advised Constantinople not to act in opposition, nor is it considered that both churches had completely discontinued the bonds.
Of the three churches in Ukraine, the other churches recognize only one – the Ukrainian orthodox church belonging to Moscow's patriarch.
The majority of Ukrainian clergymen recognize its authority, but the government has always openly supported one of the divorced churches – the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Kiev, which is located in the 1990s.
This religious movement even has a patriarch on the publication of the director of the Philerates, who is seeking official recognition of the Orthodox Church, full independence and equality with Moscow's patriarch.
Damascus opened, for the first time in three years, the main trade transition between Syria and Jordan
According to SANA, the Syrian government has declared opening a crossing with the border of Nasib border border with Jordan, which has been closed for three years as a result of military action in this territory.
This can be done because the fighters on the Syrian side abandoned the lands near the city of Daraaa.
Nasib is the most important trade link not only between neighbouring countries, but also between the Gulf of Lebanon and the Persian Gulf.
Key thoughts from the UN language of Lavrov
While visiting the UN Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sergey Lavrov attacked the West on “political blackmail and brutal force” and said that diplomacy should not give up to dictatorships and unilateral sanctions.
Minister at the UN General Assembly said on Friday that some Western countries are putting pressure on others when trying to maintain “the positions of world leaders”.
He did not name specific countries, but he said that they were using "political blackmail, economic pressure and brutal force".
The world must pay a high price for the selfish ambitions of a small group of countries.
Lavrov, who has represented Russia in the UN for a decade, said at the meeting that the culture of diplomacy and negotiations is being changed by dictatorships and unilateral sanctions, which are being imposed without the support of the UN.
The Minister said that the sanctions imposed by many countries are "unlawful or ineffective" and reminded Cuba of the US blockade over many years.
“But history hasn’t taught us anything”, said Lavrov and added, “The German supporters tend to blame only if it is “very likely”.
We remember how often such unjustified accusations justified interference and wars, such as the 1999 bombings in Yugoslavia, the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the 2011 intervention in Libya."
Of course, Lavrov mentioned not all the Western invasions and reminded us of the Syrian seven-year war as one of the most recent cases.
The failure of extremists could have been disastrous for the whole country and opened up opportunities for the construction of the "terrorist caffet" regime.
Lavrov praised Astana's peace process, which was initiated jointly by Russia, Turkey and Iran, and claimed that this process helped to prevent an Islamic state (IS, previously known as ISIS) and other groups wishing to attack all of Syria.
The most important thing now is to restore war-demolished country's places and help refugees return safely.
Lavrov returned to the battles of the great forces and said that the UN was indeed founded "on learning from World War II".
The Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs recalled that in 2018 it was 80 years since the signing of the Munich Treaty in 1938, in which France and the United Kingdom agreed to allow the Nazis to annex the Czechoslovakia part of Germany to soothe Hitler.
Although the then British Prime Minister Neville's Chamberlain said that the Munich Treaty "will bring peace for this time", a year later the war began.
“Miunchen's betrayal” shows how far you can lead “egoism of the countries and disregard international law”, said Lavrov.
"The dictatorship and force of the colonial era must help in the historical archive or in the waste bin."
Moscow believes that constructive dialogue can solve all the problems of the world, Lavrov said.
"If you have questions or reservations, sit down and talk, reveal facts, listen to your colleagues' arguments and try to reconcile your interests."

RT World News: Israel's nuclear weapons are surrounded by mist, and Bbibi has a finger to Iran
The Israeli Prime Minister stated in a speech by the UN General Assembly that Tehran has secret nuclear weapons.
It may be that Israel himself hides something who accused others.
“Provided” Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu revealed news on Thursday – has shown high-exposed photographs of places where Iran allegedly considers nuclear materials.
Tehran quickly replied that Tel Aviv would take care of its "non-declared nuclear weapons programme".
Although Israel has never recognised (but has not denied) nuclear weapons, RT journalist Murad Gazdiev tried to find out whether Tel Aviv should actually search for a logs in his own eye.
Scottish Government: No complaints to Alex Salmondo before January
The Scottish Government claimed that by January of this year, no complaints had been registered against Alex Salmondo.
Two accusations of sexual harassment against the former first minister in January, even though he strongly denies them.
In March he was informed of the investigation.
Salemmond, who resigned from the Scottish National Party, was an anti-Scotch government against the complaint process against him.
In response to the claim that one complaint was first dealt with in 2013, the Scottish Government stressed that no complaints had been registered before January.
A representative of the Scottish Government said: “The Scottish Government received two complaints against Alex Salmondo in January.
We could ignore them or hide them.
In the past, the former Deputy First Minister did not get any complaints about Alex Salmond and, as we have already said, the first minister first heard about the investigation from Alex Salmond in April 2018.
We are convinced of the legitimacy of our processes and will strongly defend our position.
The Scottish Government will endeavour to obtain as much information as possible within the time available.
However, as we have already said, at this moment, for legal reasons, we cannot comment more on Mr Salmondo's case."
A representative of Alexo Salmondo said: “We will not comment on anything, because our petition is now being discussed before the secretary’s regular hearing and we hope that a decision will be made soon.
We'll talk to the court.
Our aim is to prove that the Scottish Government's appeal procedure against Alex is illegal."
Glasgow shocked the result 29:13: "Wariors" player Lee Jones spurt
Glasgas regained the winner's title in Guinness Pro14 by earning extra points and winning "Dragons" in Scottsun stadium, while coach Dave Rennie does not conceal satisfaction, but believes that the game could have been more accurate.
After the unexpected defeat of the Soutern Kings team in Port Elizabeth last Saturday, Rennie's long-changed teams asked to try and, although she was able to collect the necessary points to remain at the top of the A conference, the wind and rainy air matches were certainly not smooth.
“I think we defended perfectly tonight, played on the right side of the square and our strategy was good,” said Rennie.
“We have to play more accurately and have been able to take advantage of more opportunities.
The conditions were unfavourable.
We have created many opportunities, and this is something we are pleased about.
We need to play more accurately, but 40 or 50 points earned today would not have been a good result.
We had to try.
We won extra points, but we have to make more effort to play at home with Zebre next week and with Saarcens in Europe next week."
Although the air was winded, Glasgow team early began to earn points, but TMO got all the balls lost by Huwo Jones, including his capture of Nico Matawalu internal transfer to the left corner.
It was a long time for frustration: the left column, Olis Kebble, broke out in the middle for the fourth minute, and Adam Hastings, easily got the welding.
"Dragons" reduced the difference when Arwelas Robson received a fine, and security turned another player into a player immediately after 20 minutes of markup and the Victims gained a point.
The match after a fairly calm first side ran almost half an hour: Glasgian attackers consistently attacked the "Dragons" line, then judge from South Africa Stuart Berry took a 22-minute sentence on the side of the west of Hastings.
Warriors took it to the ruins, but lost the ball after a smooth transfer, because the left edge of Matawalu that had been hit could not control the ball and it was transferred to the left.
The second test was carried out two minutes after the interval: Hastings killed the Dragons line and wisely transferred the ball to run for Lee Jones.
The ball was returned to Hastings to his position, and the result of the match was 12:6.
The first minute of the second half of Glazgui was very successful: Lee Jones caught his second test ball, and Hastings helped him.
However, after failure, Warriors did not give up – after just four minutes they took the ball in the middle of the square and the "Dragons" center, Adam Warren took him to the gate, making points, and later took Joseph Lewis after the open game with Robson.
Warriors quickly returned to the leading position and, at 54 minutes after the fourth test, gained additional points when Huwa Jones crossed to the right and Hastings failed to pass the ball (this was the third failure of four tests).
The Glasgow maintained a comfortable higher position and carried out the fifth test a few minutes later – Dunbar transferred the ball after the fight with George Horne, and Hastings gained points.
Kebble has been published as the best match player, but Rennie has praised Hastings.
“They obviously hindered us playing, but we opened up at the middle,” said the coach.
“ A few feet away, but he was slippery and was still able to walk away.
He's in good shape and trusts himself."
Ayr United won the Morton score 1:5: Ayr's five-star Ayr crashed the host team
Lawrence Shankland and Craig Moore deserved two wins, while Declan McDaida added another and thus helped Ayr stay at the top of the championship table.
Ayr went ahead after Shankland's drive, shot out of six yards after Michael Rose's angle impact on McDaid.
At the 35th minute of Morton's first test, when Charlie Telfer took the ball out of the double Robbie Crawford on his own site and sent him through the "Ayr" gatekeeper Ross Doohan to the far country.
Players from Grenook's fourth second seat minute had the chance to get out of the way when Doohan crashed Gary Oliver, but Michael Tidser released a weak fine which he easily got caught.
"Ayr" for the 74th minute exceeded the rivals, when transfer of the substitute McGuffie's long distance was taken out of the air and the other substitute player Craig Moore was sent to the gate after falling on the ground.
Moore transferred the ball to Shankland that beat 17 wins this season.
As the fans gushed, Moore returned to his fourth half of the edge of the site, and McDaid sent the jumping ball to the gate.
The "Alloa" and "Falkrik" match ended in 0:2: the first youth wins in the league
“I’m glad to feel a relief, I’m happy,” rejoiced Ray McKinnon after the very need of the first Falkrik victory in the league and earned season points.
The attacker Zak Rudden (18 C.E.) borrowed by Rangers (18 C.E.) earned his victory in both chairs and pushed the host team "Alloa Athletic" to the bottom of the championship and freed the club from pressureful troubles.
“It was an important game for us”, said McKinnon.
“We probably deserved more during the last three matches, so it was great to make three points in a tense situation.
I'm glad we got the first points.
It wouldn't have taken anything, but it was important for us to win."
Rudden sent the ball to Patrick Brough for the 26th minute and earned the victory from the middle of the second row of the gate, when Diamond Petravičius slowly kicked the ball over the gate of Neil Parry.
“We wanted to defend ourselves strongly, but failed,” said Jim Goodwin, Head of Wasps.
“Hearts” fans’ petition for semi-finals resulted in more than 11 000 signatures
“Hearts” had a petition about the “Betfried” cup semi-finals schedule signed by more than 11,000 people.
The Syrians are angry with the decision to hold both semi-finals on the same day and on the same stadium.
According to the Scottish Police, SPFL decided last week to hold the Aberdeen-Rangers matches at 12:00, and Hararts-Celtic – 19:45, which provoked the anger of both Jambos and Sons.
“The Everything News” together with “Aberdeen Everything Express” asked for a fair solution to the fans.
The so-called "Super Saturday" decision was condemned by "Aberdeen" and "Hearts": both clubs made statements that criticise the schedule.
On Thursday on the site of the exchange.org a petition has been announced that requires one of the matches to move to another location or date.
The man is accused of breaking two women in Kent's village
Two women in six and eighty died in the crime scene.
According to the police representative, another man, who has also gone through the 70th century, has been hospitalized and is in stable condition.
The 28th anniversary of the same street remains arrested, and on Monday will be judged for two murders and one attempt to kill Medwoy Masters in the court where he will participate in the video.
The police haven't named the victims yet, but they think they knew the suspect.
The villagers claimed that they were shocked by such an event in the village, which they claimed to be “empty and friendly”.
In 31 C.E. Sophie Moorey-Brown "Press Association" said: "We live here for five years and have never heard of any bad events – it is always very quiet and pleasant to live."
Royal archives and musical creators of “Hamiltonas” light the world of King Jurgis III
After the Queen presented a project that opened the large archive of documents gathered during the third year of George’s administration, it was believed that letters, blogs and languages would help the public to get to know the kings that were considered to be a little bit a bit better.
Now these documents will reach a different audience – the Royal Archives decided to cooperate completely with Westend's music.
Academics who wanted to reveal the true face of the king invited the musical “Hamiltonas” Jurgis III actor to review the most important documents from the reign of the Queen Proproprosenel.
Researchers try to make old manuscripts accessible to a wider audience, so a crowd of fans will be able to access digital documents.
The members of the royal family have already publicly approved the creation of a musical, and the Duke and Duke of Sasex will watch the performance twice, although the ancestors of Prince Harry are constantly shown on the stage.
Michael Jibson, who plays the King of Vestende, said that the documents made a reflection and helped to get to know the king whose image was created by the musical "Hamiltonas", the film "Karaliaus Jurgis madness" and the series for children "The Horror Stories").
“We've fallen in love with nice letters”
U.S. President Donald Trump did not name enthusiasm after trying to reduce tensions with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Unu, and said at the meeting of his supporters that after their correspondence they had "in love".
Mr Trump and Mr Kim said that they would pursue Korean Peninsula nuclear disarmament, which they discussed at an unprecedented meeting that took place this year in Singapore.
Before moving to a new stage of history after many years of public disagreements, the leaders of the countries changed their threats and insults, as North Korea wanted to create a nuclear missile capable of reaching the US.
“I’ve been tough like him.
We have always spoken," Mr. Trump said at the meeting in Western Virginia.
“And then we fell in love, you know?
In fact, he wrote nice, great letters to me."
Lekavičius and Panathinaikos got into the semi-finals of the Greek Cup

The Lithuanian square spent 14 minutes, earning 4 trails (2/2 dit.), regaining one ball and carrying out one result transfer and twice running out.
The most successful of the "Panathinaikos" series was Nick Calathes, who earned 15 points.
Squirrel's Shirmany: everything was decided by the party's "Greek"
Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis says that there was a lack of democracy in the internal elections of conservatives, and the party leadership actually appointed Ingridas Šimonityt as presidential candidate.
"The very "democracy" celebration was nevertheless strange, in soft words, when the party cream, the summit decided and actively supported one candidate.
Perhaps there was no chance for the second candidate to win even the theory," S. Skvernelis said to journalists in the government.
'Conservers have appointed their candidate, with that we welcome them,' said the Prime Minister.
The Prime Minister nominated by the State Greens said that Mrs Šimonytis should be seen by voters who remembered her work in the government of Andrius Kubilius.
S. Skvernelis does not comment yet on whether he will participate in the presidential election himself.
Lithuanian Peasant and Green Union intends to approve its candidate next year.
Ramūnas Kabauskas, the leader of the Management Board 'states', called the elections for conservatives 'a failed experiment' due to the low activity of the parties.
"First of all, we need to welcome the experiment, which has absolutely failed.
Only 55% of the party's members participated, with only around 20 thousand voters in total.
Knowing what money needed to be spent on the organisation of those elections, it is therefore clear that this has not worked," said Mr. Carbauskas to the news portal delfi.lt.
"I think that the costs will not justify the result, because the result is no one, the party decided that their candidate is - it's okay, but who would spend so much money," he added.
At the weekend of the internal elections, 79% of the Conservatives' party members and their supporters voted for Mr Šimonytė's candidacy.
Lithuanian salaries are laughing for Estonians: one area can change everything
According to a study carried out this year by Baltic States, wages increased mostly in Estonia.
Lithuania and Latvia have only a small drop away from their neighbour, according to the press release of the company.
"After listening to 850 companies and examining changes in remuneration in the Baltic States, we see that the monthly salary before tax increased by 81.8% in Lithuania this year, while the average annual salary increased by 7.7 percent, while the annual salary with accessories increased by 10.5 percent.
Latvia has very little over us - there has been a little more annual salary rise here, but as in Estonia, a smaller number of employees compared to our country," says Povilas Blusius, a representative of the company that organises salary investigations, and adds that with such wage developments, the country's general economic indicators which dictate them should also be taken into account.
In Estonia, wages grew at the fastest pace
Although salaries in Latvia and Estonia rose to a lower proportion of employees than in Lithuania, the increase was higher.
In Latvia, annual wages increased by 71% of the employees of the companies surveyed and reached slightly more than in our country - 11 percent.
In Estonia, 73% of employees have recovered this year and on average 13 percent have increased.
Changes in workers' performance also have a significant impact on wage developments, as transition workers can receive much higher pay than in previous jobs.
For those who have not changed their jobs in Lithuania in recent years, the annual remuneration has increased by 8.8 percent - this is more often paid and accessories paid in other Baltic countries.
In the neighbourhood of Latvia, the annual salary increase for these employees was only 3.6 percent.
Estonia remains the leader in the Baltic States, not only by increasing average wages for new workers but also for long-term workers.
For those who did not change their place of employment or duties, the remuneration has been the fastest: a monthly rate of 6%, an annual rate of 9 percent, including the additions.
According to the expert in the field of remuneration research, such trends are often dependent on, or combined with, the general economic indicators of the country: inflation or GDP growth, their forecasts, state monetary policies, prevailing market trends.
For example, forecasts of the coming economic crisis are encouraging businesses to behave more cautiously, less invest.
The dominant and fastest-growing sectors of the country, such as information technology, construction and pharmaceuticals, may also be more attractive to general statistics and may be less vulnerable to changes.
The biggest tax burden for Latvians
When comparing wage growth, it is also important to take into account the different tax systems in these countries.
In Latvia, employees pay most of the taxes depending on the salary - even 31 or 34%, which can increase to 42.4% for more earners.
In Lithuania, there is a constant 24 per cent tariff, so with higher salaries in Latvia, employees can have the same or even lower tangible gains than in Lithuania.
In Estonia, a similar tax rate is applied, as in Lithuania - 23,6 percent, so we find the most favourable tax treatment for the labour force in the Baltic States.
In the IT field - most competitive wages
According to a survey conducted in all Baltic States, almost regardless of the level of responsibilities, the positions of IT specialists remain among the best paid.
The opposite situation in retail trade is that of the lowest market indexes in this area, so employees earn lower than the average market income.
Compared to last year, the fastest wage growth was made for engineering professionals with higher positions, as well as risk management professionals.
This year, the rise in remuneration did not exceed some of the IT positions, which increased the monthly salaries of the organisations' information security professionals to as much as 14 percent.
Meanwhile, wages in retail trade remained relatively stable.
However, some companies have successfully restructured their remuneration systems and have increased their annual salary by about 2 percent due to bonuses.
According to paying specialists, wage growth dictates the need for the most demanding specialists: demand for system analysts continues to grow in the Baltic States.
Ariana Grande suffers again: the ex-inhibitor does not stop laughing
After divorces with Ariana Grand, the disgusting Pete Davidson pours out his pain by creating jokes about their relationship.
By participating in "Sturday Night Live" he chose to laugh about how he is going to get out of a serious relationship too soon.
The fans say that it is true that, just three weeks ago, Ariana and Pete cancelled their engagement, which took place just a few months later.
Pete has tried to create scenarios that mention his failed relationship, but this will appear on the screen a little later.
There are rumors that the humorist who has come out of his former relationship provokes Arian himself.
Such jokes are painful to her and not to her heart.
At least this is the case with the foreign news portal TMZ.
White or brown: Which sugars are recommended by a dietist
White or brown?
Which sugar to choose?
Surveys at shopping centers have shown that although Lithuanians still usually choose white sugar, it is surprising that many nationals refuse this ingredient that has been called white death.
That sales of brown sugar are also not hidden by the representatives of the marketing networks.
According to the representative of "Maximos", the brown sugar is becoming more popular and the people buy it more and more, although common white sugar - according to choice is still earlier.
Organic sugar is also growing in specialised organic stores.
One of the most popular products there - coconut sugar.
According to dietist Dali Vaitkevičiūtė, the main difference is the price, and the harmful effects on health can have both.
"The red unrefined sugar is three times more expensive, but from a health point of view these sugars multiply, using their excess is harmful to the body," said Mr Vaitkevičiūtė.
Dietologist suggests that the daily amounts of sugar be reduced gradually.
Once this has been done, the benefits are all to fall down and unwelcome kilograms, improve and health.
The month in a consistent way with less sugar will be easier to give up.
"Every habit we make is about a month's time, so when we have such an experiment, let's say, in a month's time to drink some sugar-free product - coffee or tea, we'll see how positive it will work and I think everyone can give up some effort," the idealologist advises how to give up sugar.
Doctors say that sugar can be called white death without any need - abuse of candy can lead to obesity, diabetes, cancer and other diseases.
Therefore, it would be worth trying to consume as little as possible, in view of the fact that this product is added to many foods, even to bread.
Another step of "Lietkabel": Lipkevičius borrows to another LKL crew
Panevezys "Liekabelis" team said farewell to Vytienė Lipkevičius - the attacker is lent to Prienai' Skycop's crews.
In this Betsafe-LKLK season V.Lipkevičius dropped 6.4 points in 22 minutes, regained 2.8 balls, performed 2 successful transfers and collected 8.5 utility points.
FIBA Championships in the league 29 years in 198 cm tall ate statistics reached 3.8 point, 2.5 back ball, 1.5 resultant transmission and 4.8 utility score in 21 minute game.
In the near future, Liekkabel will announce a new purchase, which will strengthen the composition.
S. Buškevicas joined the trainer staff
The chief coach of the Panevezys "Lietkabel" team, Nenado Chanak, has become an assistant to Lithuanians' well-known Sandis Buškevicas.
During the 2005-2006 season, 41-year-old Latvians played in Vilnius Lietuvos Rytas, and in 2014-2017 worked as a senior coach assistant in this club system.
Last season S.Buškevicas trained the Jekabpils team.
Director of Sports Jonas Vainauskas called Stepon Babrausk to his staff, but he is still going to continue his basketball career.
The invitation was also received by Vytenis Jasikevičius, but no agreement between the two sides could be reached.
S.Buškevica's trainer staff will work together with Robert Cuncaitis and Algiman's Bruce.
The Latvis will join Lietkabelis on Tuesday and will be on Cido Arena during the FIBA Championship League match with the Dižon JDA, but we will not get out on the bench, because the registration ended 24 hours before the start of the match.
The reduction in biofuel prices is not for everyone.
In 2019 more leafy trees will be crossed in Lithuania to reduce biofuel prices, says the Minister of Environment.
According to Kęstutis Navicko, it wants to "act" biofuels prices.
"We have a huge accumulation of certain species.
We need to balance [...].
The concentration on soft leafboards is because it can have some impact on biofuel prices," said K. Navickas at the Seimas on Tuesday, presenting the situation of deforestation.
According to Navickas, this year the price of wood in Lithuania increased by about 20%.
According to the Minister, the next year the pine will be slaughtered as much as this year and the spruce will be less than 80 hectares.
According to him, in Lithuania wood has been harvested more because of favourable natural conditions.
"Other years shouldn't be," said K. Navickas.
Now 10,2 million ha of forests are state-owned and 800 thousand ha of forests are private.
Combating food prices - a dubious obligation: will encourage buying only in your own area
The proposed obligation for public bodies and organisations to acquire 50% of the food from local producers is among the measures presented by the Ministry of Economy to reduce prices, reports the news portal 15min.lt.
"The Law would apply not only to small traders operating in regions, but also to other suppliers of goods and services.
For example, printing services or office supplies could be supplied to the buyer by the local companies that won the tenders," said the Minister of Economy Virginijus Sinkevičius.
Egidijus Mockevicius, President of the Meat Processingers Association, has no doubt that this provision would discriminate against some of the entrepreneurs, and it would be difficult to control whether the law is not being used by pedagogues.
The measure of inconsistency is also criticised by Valdas Sutkus, Head of the Business Confederation.
Macron calls for Europe to be protected from Russia and the US
French President Emmanuel Macron called on Tuesday to create a 'real European army' with the potential to protect itself from Russia and even the United States.
Mr Macron, who has been calling for the creation of a common European Union force since his arrival in power, says that Europe needs to reduce its dependence on American military power.
Recently, he gained a valid argument following the announcement by U.S. President Donald Trump that Washington would withdraw from an important Cold War Treaty on the nuclear force.
'We have to protect ourselves from China, Russia and even the United States,' Mr Macron said to the radio Europe 1.
This is the first interview given to his radio since the beginning of his work at the President's post in May 2017.
"How do I see President Trump declaring that he is drawing away from an important disarmament treaty created following the missile crisis that struck Europe in the 1980s, who will be the main victim? - Europe and its security," the French leader said.
The aforementioned missile crisis was triggered by the non-strategic nuclear proliferation race which led to the deployment of ballistic missiles in Europe by the United States at the end of the Cold War.
This crisis was a key factor in the US and Soviet Union's conclusion in 1987 of the Mid-range Nuclear Treaty (INF).
'We will not protect Europeans unless we decide to have a genuine European army,' said Mr Macronas, who wrote on Monday evening in Verden in north-east France, visiting the President this week's battlefields of World War I before the end of the 100th anniversary of this conflict.
According to Mr Macrono, in the situation of 'where Russia, which is at our borders, has demonstrated a potential threat... we need a Europe that better protects itself and not just depends on the United States'.
The French leader has become the main initiator of the project to set up forces in nine European countries capable of carrying out a rapid joint military operation, evacuation from the military zone or providing assistance in the event of a natural disaster.
The defence ministers of these nine countries will meet in Paris for the first time on Wednesday to discuss details of how these forces will function.
The European Union has also set out to significantly increase its defence budget since 2021 and to allocate around EUR 13 billion to research and development over seven years.
The current EU defence budget is less than EUR 600 million.
However, Professor Bruno Alomara, professor of French military schools, who are preparing high-level officers, said that the vision of Mr Macron's about a closely united European defence is difficult to implement.
"The idea of creating a culture of a common strategy is not bad," he said to the news agency AFP.
- But there is a huge gap between European defence, which Emmanuel Macron is dreaming of, and reality is a huge disagreement between European partners."
Lukashenko NATO threatened with missiles: we are not idiots
The President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, said on Tuesday, that his country would need a new armament if NATO continued to mobilise forces at the Western Belarus border.
"If NATO continues to scare by deploying bases in Poland or anything else, Belarus will need a more effective weapon, especially missiles," A. Lukashenko, who met a group of American analysts in Minsk, is quoted by the State News Agency BelTA.
The Head of State also noted that Belarus already has its own missile manufacturing industry.
'Lastly - you have noticed, and we do not hide - we have developed our missile industry and produced our very accurate (compatible) missile weapons,' the President said.
Last week, Lukashenka stated that Minsk and Moscow are looking for an appropriate and low-cost response to plans to build a base in Poland and to call it the honor of US President Donald Trump (Fort Trump).
"Of course, we're worried about this.
If, let us say, in Poland, they will be prepared to spend millions of dollars in order to deploy ... some short fort there, of course, we are not idiots and, of course, we are responding to this," said Mr Lukešenka, in his presence in the discussions of the main group of the Munich Security Conference in Minsk.
"We are taking care, with our main ally, Russia, to consider how we can respond to all this and how to find an appropriate response to the minimum costs", he added.
The Western relations with Moscow have been strongly driven by Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014.
Their relations are also the result of Moscow's role in the Syrian conflict and this year's fight in Great Britain, it is believed that Russia's special services have attempted to poison former double agent Sergey Skripal nerve paralysing material.
The tension between Moscow and Washington accelerated even further by the announcement by Mr. Trump that he planned to withdraw from the Cold War agreement on the regulation of nuclear weapons.
Russia warned that that step could disrupt the system of world security.
A man who executed a dead execution revealed how he killed his wife who was extortioned by a football player
Brazil was stunned by a crime during which a violent execution was carried out on the footballer Daniel Correa Freitas in that country.
The sportsman was killed at the 18th birthday of the girl.
The 24-year-old footballer was found dead in the city of Parana in the south-east of Brazil.
The execution was declared to have been carried out: genitals cut out, severe injuries in the neck area are also reported.
Edison Brittes Junion, who killed the football player, acknowledged his fault and claimed that he did so because he raped his wife Cristian Brittes.
The Brazilian who executed the rupees later on television gave a detailed account of the fate of the night.
"The man had already gained momentum when I realized that I had not seen my wife Cristianos for a long time.
I went to our bedroom, but the door was locked.
When I had not broken the door, I saw Daniel and my wife lying in bed naked, who sought help.
I was deadly mad.
Together with my former friends at the party, we pushed him into the field to the car.
That's where I had a knife with which I'm a deadly appalled my wife's extortioned husband.
I was very angry, I couldn't do anything to myself at that moment," said the murder.
Together with his friends he cast a dead body of the footballer near the river, where police officers are looking for the main raven crime tool.
The Brazilian civil police arrested E.B.Junior, as well as his wife and daughter who celebrated his birthday.
It is said that the incident of police officers still lacks evidence that a woman was raped during the party.
True, the recent dissemination of the last messages and pictures of the football player on the occasion of the "WahtsApp" can help the study progress.
The football player sent one of his friends through "WhatsApp" two pictures in which he took himself into bed, next to a sleeping woman who, as appeared later on, was a murderer's wife Cristiana.
"I can sleep here.
There are many women sleeping in different rooms in the house.
I'm gonna eat the mother of the rebel, even though her father is somewhere nearby," the football player wrote to his friend.
Daniel Correa Freitas, a club owned by Sao Paulo, was lent in this season for the second time to the race "Sao Bento" in the Brazilian league.

Alabama "Hurts" can no longer make use of the suspension option
Alabama's spare vowor Yalen Hurts will not be able to be suspended for this season after Saturday.
Hurts has been involved in the sixth match of Crimson Tide on Saturday before the weaker Luiziana team, which is the fifth player's match this season.
This year, NCAA has applied a new rule, which allows the player to be suspended in four matches.
This month, Athletic reported that Hurts was planning to do this because of the controversial invading assessments and team training staff's response to them.
Tua Tagovailoa replaced Hurts at the beginning of the season, but Crimson Tide trainer Nick Saban said that he was still planning to use Hurts skills.
Last season Hurts helped Alabama to enter the match on the title of the national champion against the Georgia team, but in the second half was replaced by Tagovailoa, who contributed to the outcome of the Crimson Tide victory 26:23.
The former attacker of the South-East Conference, Hurtsas, started the last 28 Alabama's match and entered the season with a record result of 26:2.
On Saturday's competition, Hurts completed 22 out of 31 transfers during the first four episodes of Crimson Tide, ran 276 yards, scored four times and once took over the ball.
He also ran 15 times with the ball and ran 54 yards.
Owens: Desza has to sign the agreement immediately
Desa Bryant, a former attacker of Cowboys, said he was soon returning to the NFL.
Terrell Owens, a member of the Swedish Museum, said that it would be a little late for Bryant.
In response to a question asked by Twitter about the signing of a contract with a team, Bryanta announced on Friday a word "Twitter": "Immediate."
Three times selected at Pro Bowl matches Bryantas does not belong to any team since he refused to pay in mid-April.
Bryant, who may have refused a contract with Baltimore "Ravens" and has been regularly associated with Cleveland "Browns", said just before the season that he wants to improve before signing a contract with the team.
In August, Owens, who is in the museum of professional American football glory, is still talking about returning to the NFL, the site TMZ said that Bryant should try to return to sport as soon as possible.
“He has to join the team and prove to everyone what he can”, said Owens for the site.
“All the surveyors believe that he is no longer successful, and he is no longer as good as he thinks.
Now he must enter the team for any pay, accept a one-to-two-year contract - it's totally irrelevant - and show everyone what he can."
Bryant in the Dalas team in 2017. 69 times caught the ball, ran 838 yards and earned six points.
In 29 C.E., the player in his career – 23 matches – did not run 100 yards.
After signing a five-year contract worth $70 million in 2015, Bryant did not run 1000 yards in any season and did not catch more than eight-point mouse balls.
"If the managing director or owner thinks your skills are deteriorating, you will not be able to guarantee or accumulate the amount you want," advised Owens.
He also warned Bryant that he had to get into the team as soon as possible, because later it could not be possible at all and claimed that it would be possible to return to the "Cowboys" that survived difficult times.
“I know. I don’t know whether their relationship would be damaged”, said Owens, who 38 times earned points during the three seasons playing in the Dalas team.
"I think that in the case of Dezo, if Cowboys takes it back and he gets a chance, it will be useful for Deza and the French."
Talked about the establishment of CERN Business Development Center in Lithuania
Representatives of the European Nuclear Research Organisation (CERN, European Organisation for Nuclear Research) who visited Kaunas last week assess the possibilities of setting up a CERN Business Development Centre in Lithuania.
Today, there are ten business incubators in Europe where businesses receive help in commercialising CERN technologies, developing innovative products and adapting them to societal needs.
Although Lithuania has only become a member of CERN last year, the establishment of a business incubator in the country has already been stopped.
CERN representatives visited Lithuanian University of Health Sciences (LSU) and Kaunas University of Technology (KTU) Institute of Material Science and Biomedical Engineering in the Valley "Santakas".
At the National Centre for Innovation and Business (NIVC) guests discussed Kaunas innovation ecosystem and opportunities for young, innovative businesses at the KTU, LSMU, Vytautas Magnus University, Lithuanian Energy Institute, Lithuanian Academy of Sciences, Ministry of Economy and business.
The visit of the CERN delegation is very important, because if CERN's business development centre is established in Lithuania, it will be the only one in Central and Eastern Europe and will have a major impact on the scientific and business innovators in the region.
"This incubator would encourage the application of knowledge and technology accumulated by CERN to important problems such as new technologies and artificial intelligence would be used for disease diagnosis and treatment of major data processing," says Dr. Leon Balaševičius, prorector of KTU science and innovation.
CERN incubators, like other business development centres, provide assistance in business development, provide information and expert advice in the application of technology in product development and in the search for sources of financing.
The difference is only that CERN incubator is more educated.
This centre includes experts from various fields in Lithuania: information technology, materials engineering, as well as specialists from the medical field.
CERN is best known for the largest and most powerful particle accelerator in Switzerland, the LHC, The Large Hadron Collider.
However, CERN is conducted not only in quantum mechanics but also in other areas, from cryogenics (very cold temperatures for substances) to particle monitoring and radiation studies.
These technologies and research work have an impact on many areas of public interest: medicine, security and industrial development.
"Vilniaus combustibles" has a new manager
The producer of rubbers, AB "Vilniaus džotinė" has appointed Rokas Mituzs as the new director-general, who will replace Raimonds Pilkis in this position.
Mr. Pilė, who has managed the company last year in summer, will continue to act as the financial director of "Vilniaus degasta", according to a report distributed by "Nasdaq" on the Vilnius Stock Exchange.

The company’s sales income without excise duty amounted to EUR 4.956 million and decreased by 13,16% compared to the first quarter of last year.
There are more than 100 people working at Vilnius Burnt.
STT suspended R. Ača - Business Knowledge
Remigijus Ačas, former director of the regional administration of Raseiniai district, was suspected to be bribery.
He's under arrest.
Special Investigation Service (STT) reports that the officials of Šiauliai Board conduct a pre-trial investigation of possible corruption in the Raseiniai district municipality.
"Remigijus Ačas, the director of the administration of the Raseiniai district district, is suspected to be bribery.
The circumstances under examination are due to the unclear conduct of the public procurement, in the position of the director of the municipality R.A., the possible exceptional favour of one private company to conclude a public contract with a company controlled by the municipality of Raseiniai district.
It is alleged that Mr A. was accepting a bribe of high value (over 250 MGL)," says the STT press release.
BNS adds that this company is "Rase bus park".
On Monday, the officials also stopped corruption by the alleged head of the Raseiniai Municipality-owned company "Raseiniai bus park" Vladislovas Šimaitis.
This was confirmed by the STT representative for press Renata Endružytė.
The STT report states that suspicions are also made to two representatives of the companies who directly bought Mr Ača or who participated in the bribery of various financial operations.
All suspects are detained, in their places of work and in their homes.
Retire LSDD membership
Remigijus Ačas was for some time the director of the municipal administration of Raseiniai district, but in April he lost his post in opposition to his report.
He was also the mayor of this district in 2011-2012. Mr Ačas, a long-standing Seimas Member, has been elected to parliament since 2004, as a candidate for the party "Tvarka ir justice".
However, in 2013 his and this party's knees separated, and in 2016 he was not able to win his own mandate at the Seimas elections.
Now Mr. Ačas is dependent on the social democrats' detached position and led by Gediminas Kirkilas to the newly established Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party (LSDD).
Shortly after this news was produced, the President of the LSDD informed the press that Mr Ačas temporarily suspended his party membership until the investigation took place.
"The actions of the Special Investigation Service and the suspicions made to Remigius Ači are an unpleasant surprise for us, but in all cases law enforcement must take all necessary steps to be able to ascertain the truth.
Mr Ačas temporarily suspended his party membership until the pre-trial investigation took place," said Kirkilas, the leader of the LSDD.
In 2003, he was the Head of the Group of Advisers to the then President, Roland Paks, who was subsequently removed from office by the arrest, counselor on national security issues.
Meras A. Gricius: I did not directly control the work of R.A.
Neither the mayor of the Raseiniai district, Algirdas Gricius, nor the current municipal administration manager Liudas Kavaliauskas BNS said on Monday that there is no information with which particular purchase may be linked to the law enforcement investigation.
Mayor Gricius said that he had learned from the media about the detention of Mr Ač.
'I can't say, we were very isolated by the functions that I worked as a mayor, he (R.Ač - BNS) - the administrative work, and I couldn't say, neither for any reasons, nor for what public procurement was done in this case,' the mayor said on Monday.
He also claimed, for the same reasons, that he did not wish to assess Mr Acho's former administration of the municipality.
I would be afraid to say something about his activities, because directly I did not control his administrative work, as far as I had been delivered for public procurement, and for competitions, he said that such public procurements and public procurements had taken place, and then what was visible in public space, contracts were concluded, which I already saw as a mayor.
I therefore cannot describe how he led the administration at the time as its director," said Mr Gricius.
He himself said that he was not involved in public procurement and that he did not influence them.
In the team of Minister of Culture - a new adviser
Minister of Culture Lianos Rūkotės-Jonsson's advisors team was supplemented by Doc. dr. Joseph Blažans.
He advises on the management of archives, libraries, museums and cultural heritage.
The Ministry of Culture announces that from 2016 until now he was the Director of the Lithuanian Literature and Art Archive and the Docent of the Department of Muzeology of Vilnius University Faculty of Communication.
By the way, in 2017 students of the VU Communication Faculty selected Mr. Blažans the best lecturer of the Faculty.
The new adviser to the Minister is the author of many scientific articles on the preservation of cultural heritage and values.
Left does not stop
The CIA recalls that in May of this year, Minister of Culture Rūokytė-Jonsson left the team of the adviser Dr. Viktor Bachmetjev, who advised the Minister on information policy issues of the public, and was also responsible for media literacy and strategic communication.
On 2 October, Renaldas Augustinavičius announced his resignation from the Vice-Minister of Culture.
He was responsible for cultural heritage, archives, museums and libraries.
Then Mr Rookytė-Jonsson said that her new vice-minister would be fueling the same areas as Mr Augustinavičius.
Currently, in addition to Mr Augustinavičius, the task force of the minister's advisers is Rita Grumadaitė, Evaldas Stankevičius, Egidijus Gailiūnas, Rusnė Tinkevičienė, and Eglė Saudargaitė.
S. Gentville: EUR 90 million of fines are threatened by inoperative GPIS business
Simon Gentvilas, Vice-President of the Seimas Environment Protection Committee, says that Lithuanian producers and importers may have to pay nearly EUR 90 million at the end of the year due to poor functioning of the product, packaging and waste accounting information system (PPIS).
"The systemic crisis in the packaging industry is becoming an increasingly realistic scenario in the run-up to the end of the year and in the absence of a normal functioning of the GPSIS system.
It is unofficially stated that certificates attesting to the management of packaging waste have been issued only 1% of the foreseen recycling tasks," Mr Gentville states in the press.
On 7 November the Seimas shall initiate an extraordinary meeting of the Committee on Environmental Protection, in which it intends to discuss the situation, to ascertain why the functions of this programme are not functioning, why the module of the programme is not actually implemented and how the Ministry of Environment intends to address the problem.
"Without the necessary legislative or legislative initiatives, manufacturers and importers run the risk of receiving huge environmental taxes again at the end of this year," says Mr Gentville.
In his view, the weaknesses and inaction of the GPSIS accounting system signal a serious crisis in the packaging waste management sector, which can be compared to the Metroil crisis.
Uncertainty about tasks
Some experts also warn that part of the companies can fail to meet the national targets for recycling of packaging waste for 2018.
In view of the indicators published by organisations for recycling packaging during the first half of the year, experts argue that some organisations may not be able to manage the required amount of packaging waste in 2018.
As a result, some businesses may no longer be able to benefit from the tax exemption and would receive a tax on a certain amount of their packaging placed on the market during the year.
The GOC wrote that two of the three producer organisations currently in operation reject such concerns and one does not comment.
Kęstutis Pocius, Director-General of Green Point of the biggest organisation VšĮ, said that at least formally how to overcome the tasks depends on the problems of the Product, Packaging and Waste Information System (WIS).
The Green Point plans that this year all types of packaging management tasks, except glass packaging, will be overcome.
Although the Green Point glass task will not be overcome this year, the organisation promises to compensate members for the losses they will cause.
Experts doubt the benefits of food vouchers
Experts question the benefits of this innovation when the government plans to share vouchers for food products for the less prosperous people and thus encourage family or farmers’ trading business.
They agree that the new system would create an additional bureaucratic burden.
Marius Dubnikov, Director of the Tax Commission of the Confederation of Lithuanian Business, says that coupons are alive and the problems are not solved and the Government should focus on increasing people's incomes.
"Sistem seems rather strange and as if taken from older textbooks.
If we want to help society to acquire something or have more purchasing power, we need to direct all the capacity to increase people's income, and people themselves have to decide whether to buy in one shop or another," said BNS.
According to him, the Government, by proposing food vouchers, would apply to people with lower incomes.
"In the image of people with lower incomes, as if a voucher on which it would be written on the pallet, we, this government, gave you a voucher, and be in favour of us.
It sounds like some pre-election promises, where you want to write your signature very clearly to them," an analyst said.
According to him, the food voucher system will require additional investment and will increase the administrative burden, as it will need to monitor who and how it allows them to be protected from counterfeiting.
The chief economist of Swedbank, Nerijus Mačiulis, says that one instrument would not achieve the two objectives of supporting low-income residents and small entrepreneurs.
"If this is the support for small entrepreneurs, the aid for vouchers shall compensate for price differences and the population may buy more expensive goods in smaller shops, the difference shall be compensated by the State from the budget.
Then it's support for business, but not support for the population," said Mr. Mačiulis.
In his view, such a system would probably not have a significant macroeconomic impact and would not substantially alter the competitive position of small shops and, on the contrary, create an additional bureaucratic burden and may make it more difficult for new entrants to arrive.
"It is similar that it would be a rather bureaucratic instrument with high administrative costs, and it would also be quite uncomfortable for the population, they should shop in not a larger shop with a larger range closer to home, but look for a few specialised shops with a smaller range", an economist said.
According to him, coupons are used in other countries when there is a limited volume of goods or services and need to be provided to all in the same way or to some social group.
The residents then receive coupons free of charge and can spend them on food.
According to Mr Mačiulis, they are also used in the labour market, providing temporary tax relief to businesses through the employment of long-term unemployed or, for example, former prisoners.
This practice, Mr Mačiulis said, has been successfully applied in Lithuania.
Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis said on Monday that the government's new food coupon system would help the poorest people, increase competition and encourage small businesses or farmers.
Prime Minister Dārmantas Malinauskas BNS said on Monday that the idea is most focused on farmers and family businesses, while buyers with coupons could get a 20%-30% discount.
According to him, the number of vouchers would be limited so that farmers would not be abused.
According to him, 3-5 vouchers would allow people to benefit from 10-15 euros per month.
According to him, although the state budget for the programme is not yet available, it could be financed from this source, perhaps European Union funds.
"Not all that is currently foreseen or not foreseen in the budget will be in the final stage, but it will change in the Seimas, so happens, can be funds transferred from one line to another, and from ministries, there can be exchanges of financing.
There is always a struggle of priority, what would be the decision - whether by refusing something, finding another additional source of income and so on," said Mr. Malinauskas on Tuesday.
To date, the extent and from which the innovation can be applied is decided.
