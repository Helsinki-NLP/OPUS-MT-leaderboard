A 28-year-old chef found his dead at the San Francisco supermarket
This week, a 28-year-old chef was found in a shopping mall room that recently moved to San Francisco.
But the victim's brother says he can't imagine anyone who would hurt his brother, saying: "His life finally started to improve."
A man found at the Westfield supermarket on Wednesday was identified as a 28-year-old San Francisco resident, Frank Galcia, said a representative of the San Francisco Court Medical Bureau.
The San Francisco police announced that his death was a murder and that investigations are under way.
Upura's brother Luiss Galcia tells San Francisco's transmission to ABC KGO that Frank had previously worked as a chef in Boston, but six months ago he was at his dream restaurant "Sons & Daughters" in San Francisco.
The representative of "Sons & Daughters" informs that the news of his death shocked and shocked them.
"We are a small team, working as a united family, and he will miss us very much," said a representative.
In this difficult time, we will think with Frank's friends and family.
Luis Galcia says that Frank was at the beginning of his night in hostels, but in recent times life has finally improved.
"He moved into a new apartment and met a girl," Louis tells the radio station KGO.
Louis Galcia says she doesn't know who would hurt his younger brother.
He was a good person with a wide heart.
"He always suspended his family, preparing a delicious meal and preparing lunch", said Luis Galcia
He never wanted to engage in a dispute.
He was the brother that adapted the rest.
"Taking into account everything that went wrong in the world, he was like a rough diamond that flashed every day," he says.
Anyone who has information about the event is asked to call SFPD Information Number 415-575-4444.
Young Doctor strike: invite for new protests
The representatives of the new doctors ask their trade union to initiate protests in the dispute on the new treaty.
The British Medical Association (LMA) Committee of Young Doctors (JMC) is going to request advice to support wider protests in early September.
According to JAC, ministers have failed to dispel doubts about the Treaty.
In July, young doctors and medical students rejected the contract offered by LMA.
58 % of all members who took part in the vote voted against the contract.
In a message published on Thursday evening on Twitter by Elena Makrta, JAK's board member, the government continues to remain silent on this issue and therefore the offer of the agreement has been rejected.
She said: 'In view of this, as a result of the vote by the JAC, the proposal for a treaty has been completely rejected and a decision has been taken to request a new formal discussion to discuss the most important issues.'
In response to the government's silence, JAC today formally requested a meeting with the LMA Council to authorise the development of new treaties to enter into force in September.
As a result of the dispute, young doctors participated in six strategies, including for the first time in the history of NHS.
Following the vote rejecting the terms of the contract proposed by the LMA, recommended by the BMA, the representative of the new doctors of the LMA, Dr. Johans Lawana, would resign.
Before meeting with 54,000 young doctors and medical students, he had told BMA members that the offer was good and would be accepted.
After the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt informed us that the agreement would be concluded with English doctors.
Russia and Turkey: The Rejected Alliance?
The gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to raid and announce the end of the eight-month-old war on economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted Turkey's leader at St. Petersburg Castle, the impression arose that this partnership is more necessary for Ankara.
But both of them shouted.
Vladimir Putin's smile looked artificial and did not cause warm emotions, even taking into account his usual restraint.
On the other hand, Rage Tajjips Erdogan named Putin at least five times as his "Dear friend", a cool meeting.
I got a bit lost.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only improve to pre-crisis levels, but strengthen even further.
The following day, a newspaper reported that Erdogan behaved as if nothing had happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm causes conflicting feelings.
However, the glaring storm of Putin shows that the Russian leader has never forgotten anything.
The first thing he mentioned in his speech was to get the Russian aircraft to the border of Syria.
At that time, Moscow reacted sharply.
Putin accused Ankara of having stabbed into the back of Moscow.
The deal was even more painful given that it came from a friend.
Restoring true loyalty will be very difficult, perhaps impossible.
Since November, Russia's public position has changed.
For months, government - controlled television has spread aggressive accusations against Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed that there were guilty Turks at all.
The most serious accusations were that the Erdogan family itself had profited from the illegal trade in oil with the Syrian State-controlled part of the Islamic State.
He denied it, of course.
However, the main message of the St. Petersburg meeting is that it is time to forget the past.
After all, this meeting was held only because Putin received the apologies of President Erdogan.
Russia could perceive this as a kind of victory.
The benefits of Ankara's peace settlement are obvious.
First, Erdogan needs all possible friends after the failed coup in the last month in which he was tried to demolish.
The countless terrorist attacks have also shaken his position.
There are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have caused severe damage, in particular the ban on charter flights, which generally provides for an annual influx of several million Russian tourists in Turkish resorts.
The number of tourists fell by almost 90%.
Russian tour operators and charter companies have also been relieved by the restoration of regular flights.
They hope for a holiday fever in the Mediterranean at the end of the season.
This week, national TVs are planning a fall in the prices of fruit and vegetables, as imports of fruit and vegetables from Turkey will be restored.
As the local newspaper Vedemasti quotes, "The travelers for them, the tomatoes for us."
However, the visit also had other political motives from Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West for, in their view, the weak reaction to the attempt of coup.
We can also look at the dissatisfiedness with the extended EU accession negotiations and with Putin's intervention, which is keen to take advantage of the situation that Turkey has alienated from the West.
The Russian leader undoubtedly won extra points in the eyes of Ankara, expressing support for its elected government after the coup attempt.
Note that Moscow is well aware of this, because it is itself deeply rooted in fear of a change of regime in the country.
The summit, which took place in this luxury maritime castle, gave Russia and Turkey the opportunity to present, as a analyst named it, the "rejected alliance", two countries that feel excluded from the West, unite forces.
However, despite the public unity, there are still significant differences of opinion between the two countries.
The main disagreements concern Syria, where Russia presents itself as a carriers of peace, but in fact Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
After more than three hours after the initial negotiations, without wishing to disclose the information, both Presidents announced at a press conference that they had not discussed the matter.
The Turkish President purposefully avoided questions about the clashes between the two countries, while President Putin wanted to highlight them.
There is no clear consensus on how both countries can find a common language on the issue of Syria.
However, after months of open hateful relations and potential disasters, when a NATO member Turkey hits a Russian combat aircraft, the situation has improved, as both leaders have at least resumed negotiations.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland
Brand SKB will have a support role in the future, as announced by the Executive Director of the Bank.
Outside Scotland, SKB will no longer be available.
Ross Makevans tells the BBC channel in Scotland that SKB brand was associated with the bank's ambitions on a global scale.
It has abandoned these ambitions, because eight years ago the bank had almost gone bankrupt and needed financial assistance.
Meanwhile, the experts in the branding strategy have used the SKB brand to protect other consumer financial brands.
The Bank received millions of pounds from international sports sponsors, starting with the rebuff of the six United Nations and ending with the Wimbledon tennis champion Andy Murray.
However, it has now been decided to put other national brands at the forefront.
The Scottish Royal Banaka will be available to Scottish customers, but it will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all SKB references, outside the head office and in the official stock exchange list, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
Now smaller private financial brands such as the Costs, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank will also be taken into account.
Makevan was interviewed during his trip with customers and employees on Inverneshira.
He told the BBC Scottish Channel: "SKB will become our investor brand and our employees are working with, because now we are becoming more than brand bank."
In time, the bank itself became a global brand and SKB became a global brand.
Now I say that we no longer have global ambitions, we have local ambitions.
Each of these brands will represent something unique in its industry and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
SKB has already announced that it will not continue to sponsor "Sešių UN" and involve various brands in sports sponsorship.
"It is time to become a brand bank, because we have long asked ourselves how to become a better bank for your customers?" says the Executive Director.
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical if we announced that we would become a great bank for our customers and develop these brands.
But thanks to hard work and focusing on the needs of our customers and not our own needs, we have obviously made major changes.
We can revive these brands again, so I think that now is the time.
Frankie Detori won the 3000th victory, first place in New Harbor with a horse Predilution
Detors ripped the Champagne by winning their 3,000th victory twice when finalizing the first race in New Harbor.
On Friday, J.F.F.E., Frankie Detori won his 3,000th victory in Britain's history, gaining first place in New York City.
He reached this by winning the second victory in these races, which took place in his home city, with a Predilution trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey, who has achieved such a result in the horse sprint race.
He has joined Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Pigot, Pete Edter, and Willie Carson.
The three-time champion jockey Detori, who previously won with the horse Ghayyar, said, "This is something special."
I'm very moved because my family is here.
I'm very happy that it happened in New York City, because I've been here for 30 years.
This is not a big race, it is not a Royal Ascota, but a normal Friday evening with 20,000 people.
I feel relieved and grateful.
After winning the Detori and Predilution are expected with the cowardices and engagements.
Two jockeys have reached this record in the race with obstacles - the champion Richard Johnson and the final 20-time champion Sir Antonio Mckoy, who set up several records in his career, winning more than 4300 wins.
Lester Pigot, a nine-time derivator, won 4493 wins during his career.
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of today and is no surprise that he has been successful by just a few can achieve.
He is stylish and powerful, but his tactics distinguish him from other jockeys.
He is a fantastic racing representative, his enthusiasm and the harizma for years attracts fans of this sport.
A few weeks ago, I said to Frankie that he had already won 6,000 wins if he didn't just participate in the weekends and big races.
However, speaking seriously, it is a real pleasure that Frankie has been winning the UK race for 30 years on a regular basis.
He is a happy, wonderful British race, and he is a great jockey.
Frank Detori noted this achievement with his own brand - flying jump.
From the finish of the wind to a flying jump, Frankie Detoria has had a face of British horse racing for 20 years.
This has been a journey of adventure.
He has won numerous big races, including the famous "The Great Seven" in Askota in 1996, and has experienced an accident on the aircraft and discretion in the use of the preparations.
Three years ago, it was difficult for him to return after six months of discretion, but he demonstrated his power of character by challenging those who questioned him, returning in their best form.
And he could take part in the race for a while - Detori has previously said that he would be willing to continue taking part in the race up to at least 50 years of age.
The President of Russia Putin dismisss Sergey Ivanov, Head of Administration
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly released Sergey Ivanov, Head of Administration.
Ivan has been among the closest humans of Putin for many years.
Currently, 63-year-old politician has been appointed Special Representative for Nature and Transport.
The President's statement states that Putin 'has decided to release Ivan from the duties of the Head of the Russian President's Administration without mentioning the reason.
Mr Anton Vaino, who was his deputy since 2012.
The 44-year-old Vaino is a former diplomat.
Vaino was born in 1972 in Tallinn, Estonia, graduated from Moscow State Institute of International Relations, and later worked at the Embassy of Tokyo.
According to the Kremel website (Russian language), he later led the President’s Protocol and the Government’s Staff Administration.
After his appointment, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
In my opinion, the main work of the administration is to support your work in the office of the President of the State by drafting laws and monitoring the execution of your decisions.
Putin told a Russian broadcasting company on Friday that Ivan intended to leave office and recommended Vaino as his substitute.
Do the smile convince you?
This step embarrassed Moscow.
Sergey Ivanov is an ancient and close ally of Vladimir Putin and, like Putin, he worked for the Soviet security service at the KGB.
He was one of Russia’s most influential men.
In the meeting broadcast on the state television, both men stated that Ivan had resigned from office on his own initiative.
However, despite the smiles that are directed at cameras, it is rare for such an explanation to be convincing, especially before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the outcome of the fight against power?
Nobody knows that.
However, the official statement that the man, who was considered as a possible president, suddenly wanted to become the head of Russia's environmental policy, is received with a big skeptic.
In the remarks published on the President's website, Ivanov says to Putin: 'This is the fact that at the beginning of 2012 I asked you to entrust this difficult position, I could even say, problematic position, for four years.
It turns out I've been in this post for four years and eight months.
Ivan was appointed in December 2011.
Formerly Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and former Head of the State Security Service of the KGB, like Putin.
In the late 1990 ’ s, Putin led the Federal Security Service, the successor of the KGB, and Ivan took up his post as deputy.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivan the number of the five to whom he trusted most.
At the end of Putin's second term, Ivan was considered as a potential candidate for the post of Russian President, as reelection of Putin for the third term would be anti-constitutional.
At that time, however, Putin’s close ally, Dmitry Medvedev, became President.
Putin became Prime Minister, and three and a half years later he returned to the office of President.
A fallen fish in a garden in the city of Banfa
A man in Banfa asks for help to find out the conditions under which a species appeared in his garden in Banfa.
Kevin Bein thinks 75 fish could be sand eels that have been removed with the waterroom.
Mr. Beain, who lives about 500 feet [500 m] from the sea, made the video on the Periscope, hoping that someone could know how those five centimetres of fish came into his garden.
Cross of Queensphere: The bridge is now connected to Faif.
Currently, the GBP 1.35 billion project is expected to be completed in May 2017.
The engineers have connected the northern part of the Queensphere cross and the viaduct, which means that the bridge is now connected to Faif.
The first of the four connecting parts is completed, which means that the bridge construction is approaching the end.
The Faif bridge has a length of 600 meters and weighs 30,000 tons.
It consists of 10 000 tonnes of steel, 20 000 tonnes of concrete and 46 support cables.
Currently, EUR 1.35 billion of projects are planned to be completed in May 2017.
Economic secretary Keit Brown had come to the construction site today and was one of the first to climb the bridge.
He said: "This is a symbolic and historic moment in the construction of the Queensphere bridge."
In this project, we see an unparalleled engineering solution where only over 30 000 tonnes of cement and steel were used in the construction of these parts.
Despite the huge weight and size of the bridge, connecting the bridge and the viaduct is an extremely delicate process that requires huge precision.
In total, more than 79% of the bridge deck has already been constructed and the final section of the bridge will be located today, meaning that all parts of the bridge are ready for laying.
Michael Martin, project director for the fourth bridge connection, says: "The first connection is a very important point in the construction of any bridge."
In this fantastic project, the first connection is a high-end engineering industry.
After the last stage of the road and its connection to the northern tower with the support of the north tower, we were set up to connect the northern part of the road to the part of the land or viaduct.
This was done by moving the part of the viadekt of the northern passageway to the south in 700 millimetres.
It was a huge and, at the same time, very delicate operation.
It is huge because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6000 tons and had to be drawn at a slope of about 3 %.
The delicate, because the tolerance in both directions with which the team worked was just a few millimetres.
Luckily, it worked well.
Simona Bilsa acquires gold in the exercise of women.
Forget stress.
Forget the excitement.
Simon Bais is not worried about it.
Dynamic jumps.
Without effort, they perform exercises on the beam.
Unable on the floor.
It's perfectly perfect.
And finally, the Olympic champion.
On Thursday, a 19 - year - old American gymnasium won a gold medal, fully demonstrating the difference between himself and the rest of the world on the Olympic stage.
Her total score of 62,198 were superior to the result of the silver medal winner and her teammate Alija Raismone and the bronze medal winner Alija Mustafina.
On Thursday, U.S. sportsman Simona Bilsa took a training on the ball in the individual multi-flying final for women in the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Bilas became the fourth American in a row, who won the title of the multi-leader champion and the fifth best gymnasium, gradually strengthening his reputation as the best of his generation in history and perhaps the best gymnastics.
When the final result was reported, she shone in tears, because a long road to this moment was over.
This achievement ranks him next to such unrivalled athletes as Michael Felips, who raised his sport on a different level.
Bilsa has dominated her sport for the last three years by obtaining 15 medals at World Championships, including 10 gold medals, performing as excellent, accurate and ambitious combinations of exercises that the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lu Reton called her "the best gymnastics she ever saw".
In Brazil, she was faced with a final test, where she was to a large extent faced with hopes placed on her rather than on other athletes.
She would be disappointed if she returned to her home in Spring, Texas, with no gold medals.
The U.S. sportsman Simona Bailes (left) and Aly Raisne are surrounded by the individual multi-faceted final of the 2016 summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which took place on Thursday.
The first gold medal of Bilas won on Tuesday, making special random coordinators of Martha Carolji farewell parties.
Although Baal claims that in his long journey to the tops of glory there was nothing to expect, it is not true.
Part of her performance in free movements, which includes her special acrobatics transition, is accompanied by Latin music, which would fit perfectly on the street next to the Rio Olympic arena.
It's not a coincidence.
A girl who had been adopted by her grandparents when she was still a baby, and who was discovered by the coach Amy Bourman’s mother in a tour to the gym where the terrors of Būrmane took place, has now become a force to count on.
She has not lost her match since the summer of 2013 and the wins series can continue as long as Bais wants it.
Although Mustafin was slightly led during two rotations, it was just an illusion.
Balanced log and free movement - part of the competition where Baal will defend his champion, is still ahead.
She came out front with a result of 15,433 on the beam and strengthened the control with a result of 15,933 free movements
Rasanne gently embraced her while she was waiting for results that were only formality and she burst into tears of joy when the dream she had ever recorded in her notebook was fulfilled.
The result of Raizones was a small reverence for four years old events, when she shared the third place with Mustafin, but she lost her fight for the bronze medal.
This time the captain of a 22-year-old team, who the Americans call 'old-age', came up under strong leadership.
After her performance in free motions, which dispelled her doubts about her return, she was able to devote to the crowd of air kisses.
Meanwhile, the 19 - year - old Pale Twitter record that she published this week has a completely different meaning.
Mahai Brown, six-year-old, survives shooting in Philadelphia.
The police say that a 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, stating that this is already the second six-year-old who was shot in Philadelphia this week.
Grandparents of CBS to the Philadelphia News Channel confirmed that it was Mahai Brown.
Grandparents say that Brown was shot several times, including in a circus, in the leg, in the hand, and in the abdomen, but he was still conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
His grandmother Delores Melendez tells the television story: "Her little body was just a break-up of bears."
I can't believe it.
A boy in critical condition has been hospitalized and has already suffered several surgery.
The family informs him that he will certainly recover.
He had to start in the first class at the local primary school.
Brown is one of the four people shot in the city of Jermantown.
Three men were also shot: two 29 - year - old men and one 32 - year - old man.
CBS Philadelphia reports that one in 29 - year - old men is in a critical position, while the other two are in a stable position.
The canal says that the child was found in the front seat of the machine near the 29 - year - old victim’s critical position.
The other two victims were not in the car and the police were investigating whether one of them was an attacker.
The investigator told the CBS Philadelphia canal that several shooters were likely involved in the fire.
At the site of the event, there were found cartridges of armour that belong to a variety of weapons.
It looks like it's been a long shot.
Shells were found on both sides of the pedestrian housing.
"So it looks like there were several armed shooters who actively took part in the fire," says Antonio Ginaldi, captain of Philadelphia police.
The damage is also caused by a number of homes and cars.
No one has yet been detained and police are reported to check surveillance cameras.
On another day, a humiliated bullet hit a 6 - year - old girl in her hand while she was playing in front of her home in the Vestouklein district.
She is slowly recovering, but the police are still looking for the perpetrator.
Why do we need Simona, Gabby and Laurie?
I call it the Annual Women's Olympic Skillful Team for a number of reasons.
Firstly, I have been on all the Summer Olympics since 1984, and the U.S. team has never been so good.
Secondly, this team includes three diapers, Simon Bailes, Gabija Duglas, and Laurie Hernandez, which are inspired by many young girls of new origin.
People may be proud that this team also includes Allie Rasanne, Jewish and Madison Cocian, Catholic.
Finally, this team truly represents America.
It has also strengthened the participation of black and Latin American athletes in this sport.
For the last four years, an American American is the best practicer.
Last year, Simon and Gabija took 1st and 2nd places.
These are impressive results.
In the previous Olympic Games Gabby Douglas became the Olympic champion surprisingly, and America was able to enjoy.
The world has now seen incredible exercises performed by the threefold world champion Simon Bailas, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez in an unprecedented but masterful exercise.
On Thursday, Simon became the fourth American man in a row, having gained a gold medal in an individual multi-faceted battle for women.
Her teammate, Elia Raisne, received a silver medal.
We have seen the best sport that can bring, but the situation in the rest of the country is completely different.
Simona, Gabija, and Lauria got into the Olympic selection just like Elijah and Madison.
They are an Olympic Pioneer because the next Olympic exercise team will include only four athletes, and this is a coach at Martha Carola's last year's coach work.
In fact, gymnastics is a precious sport. Vingrovers are mainly trained in private sports clubs, and are supported by parents who pay for exercise, premises, travels, uniforms, hotels (terners, athletes and their families) and other expenses.
Most of these athletes are located in areas of cities that can afford this sport.
In these clubs, athletes take away all of their workouts, and it is a costly and long contribution to lightly owned families.
Amy Bourman - Simona Bailes coach and Magija Hainija - Laurie Hernandez coach has trained her athletes since both girls started to work with light-leader.
We must provide young girls who are inspired by Simona, Gabija and Lauria, with cheaper exercise opportunities.
I set up my own diaper organization 20 years ago.
My organization finds itself in Harlem, and we offer over 15 000 young people in the city (mainly black and Spanish) exercise courses free of charge or at a low price.
In September, we will discover the branch in Detroit (my home town) to provide local youths with the opportunity to get to know this great sport.
The ease of action develops the coordination of strength, flexibility and body, as well as teaches hard work, discipline and ambition.
This combination provides a long life with good health and success, both in school and at work.
This team will inspire thousands of young girls to train in light school and it is fantastic.
This type of sport is very important, especially for young girls.
This is a very exciting time.
Thanks to Simona, Allia, Gabija and Medison for the excellent "Meeting Power" demonstration, obtaining the golden medals of the Olympic Games and motivateing countless young girls of different origin to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
After Jeremia Hunt’s offer was rejected, young doctors plan to increase the number of strikes.
Ministers hoped to end the dispute by reaching agreement on changes to the agreement with British Medical Association, but it was rejected by 58 percent of the 37 000 new doctors who voted.
In July, Hunt announced plans to conclude the contract, stating that NHS is in a fragile state and that further delays would only harm employees and patients.
The first new doctors have already signed a new agreement that changes the conditions for work on night shifts and weekends in order to improve working conditions during out-of-standard hours.
On yesterday evening, Dr. Elena Macourta, representative of the new doctors, said that the new doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed Treaty, in particular that it will exacerbate the labour crisis and that it does not create a level playing field for all doctors.
The remaining eight weeks until the first group of new doctors sign the new agreement, so progress must be made as time remains high.
The efforts of BMA to resolve the problem through negotiation have been faced with the government's unwillingness to engage and sometimes full silence.
This happened despite the fact that last month, as yet, Jeremy Hunt said, his door is always open.
Jeremy Hunt must act quickly, stop working and cooperate with new doctors.
If he doesn't, then the new doctors are ready for new protest campaigns.
During the last strike, more than 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits were carried out at the end of April, while nurses and advisers were trying to replace the doctors who had gone to picket.
Ministers hoped to end the dispute by reaching agreement on changes to the agreement with British Medical Association.
BMA wants to raise the rate for working on the weekends for 54 000 new doctors to be covered by the new contracts.
The NHS Employment Executive Officer, Daniel Mortimer, called on young doctors not to go into stress.
Mr Mortimer explains that strikes do not solve anything, but only increase the pressure on the burdened workers and worry, create stress and delays for patients, carers and their families.
In the last two months, we have spoken with the new Committee of Physicians and, together with the Ministry of Health and other institutions, have responded positively to their questions about guardians and rapporteurs.
Employers hope that active cooperation on other important issues, such as placement of workers, flexible training, additional training for those returning after a career break, training costs, mutual recognition of training programmes, termination of studies and gender pay inequalities in medicine - shows that employers, English health education institutions and the Ministry of Health are serious about implementing the agreements concluded with the BME in November, February and May.
The risk of heart attack may be reduced by 2 pounds per day.
Thousands of patients with a history of heart attack could be treated with a medicine of 2 pounds a day, as official representatives recommend that they be taken more in people and for a longer period of time.
Anti-fungals Ticagrelor reduces the risk of re-occurrence of heart attacks in people with heart disease.
This medicine is already prescribed for use 12 months after the heart attack, reducing the risk of repeated heart attack.
The NHS-represented NICE is recommended to use this product 4 years after a heart attack to further reduce the risk of heart attack in people with cardiovascular problems.
However, it is recommended that the NICE, which is currently responsible for NHS, should be used 4 years after the heart attack to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular events.
Every year, some 140,000 people in England experience heart attacks, and one of them experience repeated heart attacks or strokes.
Heart attack and stroke are caused by the accumulation of fat in the heart wall to form obstructions.
If the obstruction ruptures, it can cause a clot by blocking the blood flow to the heart and causing a heart attack.
Conversely, if a clot separates from the blood vessel wall, it can get further into the bloodstream and block blood access to the brain leading to an infarct.
People who have had a heart attack are more at risk of having repeated heart attacks.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British firm AstraZeneca and marketed as Brilique, reduces the risk of developing blood clots.
The new NICE guidelines, published today, are recommended for people to take 90 mg of Ticagrelor for 12 months and for 3 years at a dose of 60 mg twice daily with aspirin.
Professor Kerola Longson, Director of Health Technology at NICE, explains: "Despite medication is available to prevent the recurrence of heart attacks, more than a quarter of people who have had heart attacks experience another heart attack or stroke that often has severe consequences."
Fear of repeated heart attack may have a negative impact on the quality of life of a person.
Evidence suggests that Ticagrelor, in combination with aspirin, effectively reduces the risk of repeated heart attack and infarction in people who have already experienced it.
While recommending preliminary treatment with Ticagrelor, we are happy that we can extend treatment opportunities to thousands of people who thus benefit from it.
Given the limited information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor, in particular the risk of bleeding when using this medicine for more than three years, it is not recommended to use it for longer than this period.
Political culture promotes fraud in Muslim communities during elections
According to a management report, former Mayor of the City of Taurerhamleta Lutfur Rahman was dismissed from office in the context of corruption.
The government report reveals that the culture of political correctness is opening the eyes to large-scale fraud in Muslim communities.
Former Minister of Government Sir Erik Pikl criticises the police, the election officers and the city councils that they ignore the signs of fraud in the election process, because 'fearing ethnic and religious interests'.
The former Secretary of Communities, who has now become the head of the anti-corruption organisation, says that the intimidation of voters for religious reasons is so widespread that the police should be allowed to deploy guards at the election stations to protect the frightened voters.
He also recommended that voters should produce an identity document when voting to prove their true identity.
At the moment, voters must only indicate their name and address.
He even recommends marking voters' fingers with special ink to avoid double voting.
The rapporteurs must also provide greater protection, says Sir Eriks.
He felt that the press should have greater access to the documents and decisions of the Council adopted by the informal committees and working groups.
He says: "A mint is not only to prevent fraud in elections, but also to protect local authorities from the culture of increased corruption and fraud, which goes hand in hand with it."
The report was commissioned by Dauning Street after a scandal in the context of the Tayerhamlet City elections.
Last year, the Special Election Court decided to abolish Mayor Lutfur Rahman from the city due to corrupt and illegal activities.
The Court found that Rahman "cinically distorted" his Muslim community's religious view and silenced his critics by being accused of them in racism and Islamophobia.
"Rahman has conducted his election campaign with the belief that the religious duty of believers is to vote in favour of him."
Some 300 votes were forged or questionable, because one man had voted several times.
Sir Erik also points out that there are signs of fraud throughout the country.
He pointed out that it was particularly worrying that postal fraud was being carried out, where older members of Muslim communities were forced to vote for the candidates they wanted.
Sir Eriks suggested a number of measures to improve the electoral system, including the presentation of an identity document, in order to identify a person.
His report states: 'The evidence shows that vulnerable members of ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, are being forced to vote for the oldest candidates selected by the community, in particular those in Bangladesh and Pakistan.'
"We are concerned that the authorities in the regions do not draw attention to these problems as a result of the political corrigendum, because they might be prejudicial to ethnic and religious interests."
Sir Eric set out 50 recommendations on how to improve the electoral system, which includes a ban on political activists working with votes handed down by post to prevent the "collection of votes".
The report under examination by the Teresa Maya also calls for a more thorough check-in of the registration in order to prevent electoral fraud in the area of immigration and benefits.
Consider requesting voters to produce an identity document before the vote.
Select voters' fingers with special ink to avoid double voting.
systematically verify the nationality of the person in order to ensure that the person has the right to vote.
Set three-year limits for requests for automatic voting by post.
It shall be prohibited to allow political campaign participants and activists to work with votes cast by post and by post for voting by post.
Ensure that the police have the powers to appoint guards to the electoral districts.
Make changes to the law to facilitate the prosecution of persons for intimidation in accordance with the 1983 Human Rights Act.
Prohibit photographing at polling stations.
To require only English (except Wales) to be used in electoral districts.
Strengthen training to ensure that voters go to the electoral urns on their own.
Sir Eriks often criticises Metropolis’s police, expressing his inconceivability that there are no charges in the Taurerhamlet case.
He says: "The police court only disqualified Luftur Rahman and his representative for the activities of corruption and fraud."
He was convinced that he was guilty of a standard of evidence of criminal law on the basis of irrefutable evidence.
He also criticises the inefficient election of the city council voters in the election registration stations.
Sir Eric points out: "The court decision made last year is a wake-up call.
Our country is known as the birthplace of parliament, but the worrying and hidden proliferation of electoral fraud and the disappearance of institutions are not threatening this good reputation.
Tradition with the cyclist - Kate's counterpart and other Rio Olympics' peers
The fans of the 2016 Rio Olympic Games were thrilled by the French biker Paulin Fernando Prevot, who had been recognized by the fans as extremely similar to the Duke of Cambridge.
However, a 24 - year - old biker is not the only sportsman who is fighting for gold this summer, who, according to media, is proud of his reputation.
For this reason, in honour of Rio Olympics and all the famous faces that are currently on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympics players that are quite similar to Hollywood stars.

He also noticed a storm in the social media and admitted that he had been compared with Leonardo Di Caprio since his childhood.
"I personally don't see a big parable, except for a beard," Brady says for Hoffington Post.
"He's a handsome guy, so I perceive it as a compliment."
This year, one of the most popular pairs of Olympic Games in London 2012 will undoubtedly gain even greater popularity: the striking similarity between British remote Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neal Patrick Harris.
The Russian handset Alija Mustafina, thanks to her large, expressive eyes, is compared with Gloria Estefan, an American singer from Cubian origin.

Recently, a Twitter user with real joy declared that "other Internet users agree that Hope Solo and Jeffer Karpenter actually look identical."
The U.S. football star and the serial "Dexters" actress are actually very similar to face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons refer to Cary Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to the smile of Laura Linney. The golden medal winner Gabija Duglas boasts with a beautiful, wide smile, similar to that of the stars Gabriela Unijona.
The commentator on the CBC Olympic Games apologises for his comment that the Chinese swimmer is 'ending as a pig'.
Bairona McDonald's analysis of Ai Yanha's 14-year-old finish at the fourth place at 4x200 m free-style studio for women, called an indignation storm in CBC viewers.
The Canadian channel CBC was forced to apologize, because one of its commentators commented that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer had been "drived out of the race, said it alone" and "completed as a pig".
Commenter Bairon McDonald thought that his microphone was turned off when 4x200 m free style boards for women in the finals presented their personal views.
McDonald, who was included in the CBC commentator team to give comments to lively, said: "It's the little fourteen-year-old from China can't keep up with."
"Too blind, she went out of the competition, groaned alone and ended up as a pig."
Thank you very much.
The result of the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhana in the second stage was 1:57.79, it is 1.61 seconds slower than the result of the Canadian Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to reach China.
The viewers throughout Canada immediately responded on the Internet because they were shocked to hear such a tone and expression.
Emmet Mcfarlain wrote on Twitter: "Did a direct commentator on CBC just said that a 14-year-old swimmer from China "ended like a pig"??"
The idiot did not realize that they were still in the immediate ether.
Ai Yanha from China's 4x200m free-style final women were named "a little fourteen-year-old from China who doesn't keep up with."
Bairon McDonald was critical because many requested clarifications.
Twitter users were unable to believe by hearing Bairon McDonald's insensitive comments.
Twitter user Sarah Paradise wrote: "Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You're representing CBC and Canada, and because of you, we all sound like a racist.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who was then leading the CBC live, apologised for McDonald's comments, saying: "We're sorry that the comment on the results of swimming was given in the immediate ether."
It was a failure in the choice of words, and we are very sorry that this has happened.
CBC apologized to more than 90 people who had responded on Twitter to this comment.
McDonald’s colleague Scott Russell had to apologize for him.
Then CBC copied the apology of more than 90 Twitter users who complained about McDonald's comment.
The channel also quickly published apology and a statement.
We very much regret that such comments were made and came into direct ether.
Yesterday we immediately responded and apologised to all live viewers and followers in the social media.
For the sake of clarity, the comments of Bairon were expressed in favour of the swimmer's performance and not addressed to her personally.
But they were, in any case, unprofessional and unsuccessful expressions, and Bairon was deeply sorry for what had happened.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald personally apologized to the immediate ether and tried to explain that he did not think his comment would be seen as a personal attack.
He said in CBC's Olympics live: 'I would like to take a moment and apologize for the comment I made yesterday on women's free-style competition.'
I am talking about the swimmer's performance, not about him personally.
Needless to say, I did not intend to show respect, and I really regret it.
Primark buyers are shocked by a woman who shamefully hangs in the middle of the underwear store.
The merchants felt uncomfortable when a woman started to dress up to hold the panties in the middle of the store.
As she got even worse, she took them to make sure they were standing up for her and then dragged them back into her shelf.
She continued to look for clothes at the Falkeston Bouvere Place shopping mall and retained four more panties.
Prime shop Bouverie Place in Folkestone shopping centre – the place where this woman held underwear and then put it back into the shelf.
At the time, Jenny Davidson, a mother of two children, also found her in the shop, who says that the unknown woman was wearing her clothes and leaving her shop without buying anything.
She points out that people were unable to believe their own eyes.
She stood in the middle of the shop, took her socks and trousers from the shelf, and measured them right there.
She did not even try to find a more discreet place to measure them, but she simply held them there.
Everyone looked at her wearing panties, and apparently she didn't like them, because she just put them back into her shelf.
She measured three more panties until she decided that none of them likes them and left the store.
He would not feel like anyone would watch or think about a person who would buy the clothes she holds.
Miss Davidson (33 years) says from Kent: "The idea that someone will buy clothes that have been retained by another person and that have not been washed after."
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms Davidsone adds: "I assume that after her departure the store's employees took out of the shelves of the store - which is also acceptable."
I can't imagine that I could buy a new underwear and find out that another woman has retained it and hasn't been washed out afterwards.
Primer's representative pointed out that Price was known for an incident that took place on Tuesday, 9 August.
The particular clothes are removed from the shelves of the shop.
How to protect yourself from firearms by using Krav Maga
The world is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer.
To find out how to protect ourselves in the near distance from attackers with guns, we talked to the Krav Magas Master of the New York City Ron Mizraki.
Whether you are attacked from the front or back, this video shows you how to protect yourself and gain authority over the attacker.
Mizraki shall be indicated if the attacker strikes from the back, then it must first turn to see the attacker clearly and avoid the shot path.
Then the gun should grab between its forehead and its should hit the opponent's face with its free elbow.
Then follow a shot with a knee over the groin and while the attacker gets stiff in his pain, take away his weapon, tap his face with a gun lock and step aside, continuing to put the gun against him.
If the attacker draws close to the front, the situation is similar: the shot path must be avoided, the weapon must be captured and the evil one be put to fire.
At the same time, pressure must be applied to the gun and a blow must be made to the opponent in his chest and finally to remove the weapon and set aside by continuing to aim on him.
Sounds difficult?
Watch the video to see how Mizraki does it.
But remember, if you're not a Krav Magas master, it's safer to give your money to the robber.
A family of Vandals excavates the social house of Saltash Cornwall and is on the street.
The family of Vandals is located from the place of residence on the terrorization of neighbors, causing damage to the social home of 50 000 pounds.
Tanja Skeldona and her partner, Shon Trebilkoks, were just a victim of property in Salta Kornvol because several complaints were made about them.
When they were forced out of their property, shocked representatives of the housing service found that the property had been completely demolished.
Holes were broken down in the streets and walls, and waste and walls were covered with graffiti everywhere.
The family is now removed from the property and is more likely to live in a private ownership.
Donna Makuvoja, the owner of the Cornwall Housing Service, says that there is a concern that it will not be possible to renovate a dwelling.
She says that the people who lived here have been extremely difficult and that she believes that they cannot live there.
In the present case, a number of factors should be assessed, as this property will no longer have a good reputation in Cornwall in the future.
This family is famous and their name is well known.
The couple had three sons who periodically owned, and the police said that their terror was like violence, street destruction with baseball bats, intimidation of the local population, drug abuse, drug sales, and loud blasphemy and blasphemy.
The 47-year-old Skeldonne, whose name was the property, was fined in June for antisocial behaviour.
Wastes were disposed in several demolished home rooms.
In a home where drugs may be marketed in advance, several floor boards have also been removed.
The neighbors say that they have been on the street regularly and are constantly called the police.
They were removed from their property by Cornwall’s Housing Service when they were given 11 weeks to get out of the house on a voluntary basis.
The desperate neighbors were very happy about the disposal because their lives were absolute in hell.
One said, "They didn't care about other people."
We lived next to them for 20 years, it's always been crazy.
I can't believe how often we've seen the police here.
We couldn't sleep this morning.
We woke up because it was so quiet here - we haven't used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, it'll be wonderful here.
Adams Fitzpatriks, the head of the Neighbourhood Protection of the Cornwall Housing Service, said that the family did not cooperate with local security authorities.
The family lived here for 20 years and is regularly called by the police.
A variety of old and unusable objects were found in the house - growing garden.
He also said, "It is a pity that the tenants did not show any responsibility for their behaviour, because ejection from the house is always the last step to consider in the Cornwall Housing Service."
This was a very difficult case, because their behaviour was extreme and their neighbors were very hard to look at their behaviour.
I appreciate the work that my entire team has done in this case, members of the police and the community of Devon and Cornwall, who were courageous and cooperated with us in providing the necessary information.
I hope that this event will make life easier for neighbors and will show that anti-social behaviour is unacceptable.
Fitzpatrik said that all three sons had lived here in different periods of time, but all were about 20 years old.
A dirty mattress left on the floor of one of the rooms after leaving.
The staff of the service will now have to clean a waste pile left in the house.
In 2014, the police house searched and found over 70 grams of marijuana, pounds, accessories and 1700 pounds of cash.
Skeldone is only recognised as responsible for the storage of Class B drugs with a view to their distribution.
She insisted that the money was intended to commemorate her son Lee Scheldon, who died in the car crash in 2013.
After being abandoned, they know that they currently rent a private property in Plimosta.
Many of the walls of the house were covered with graffiti.
The police say that they will continue to put out tenants who violate their rental contracts.
Angela Krava, a representative of the Demon and Cornwall police, points out that this disappearance is a clear warning to other tenants who continue to violate the rules.
She also said, "This is a warning to those who believe that they can behave as they want and it will have no consequences."
Devon and Kronvola are not acceptable criminal and anti-social behaviour for the police, and the police will continue to work with our partners to protect local communities.

Cannes mayor ban burkins for bathing suits in the beach.
The mayor of Cannes in the southern resort town of France has prohibited the wear of burkini swimsuits in the beaches of this city, which almost completely cover the woman’s body and very resembles the hydrotherap, announced by local officials on Thursday.
The mayor of Cannes, David Lingar, has signed an order that "access to beaches and swimming is prohibited for anyone who has no bathing clothing, respects good customs and secularism" as a fundamental principle of the French Republic.
"A patchwork that outwards religious affiliation at a time when France and cult sites serve as the target for terrorist attacks can create a risk of public order disturbances (sleeping, clashes, etc.) that need to be addressed," states the Order.
"We are not talking about a ban on wearing religious symbols on the beach, but about external clothing, which is related to trust in the terrorist movements, which war with us," explained the municipal municipal service manager Tjeris Miguel.
He added that the burkinai bathing costumes on the Cannes beaches have not been seen since July 28, when the right member of the central party Republicans signed this order and it came into force.
This week the Aquapark in Marseille cancelled a planned private event for Muslim women who would have dressed burkins in bathing costumes, because the conspiracy for this event was expressed by politicians from both the right and the left.
It is prohibited in France to wear headgees of Muslim women covering the face, but there is no prohibition on religious symbols or related clothing.
On 14 July, 85 people were killed in a terrorist held in a nearby resort town of Nice in Cannes, for which the Islamic State group took responsibility.
On 26 July, two invaders who had sworn their trust in the Islamic State brutally murdered the priest's church in north-west France.

Lucavsala has started the festival "Cuban".
Thursday, August 11, evening Lucavsala was given a start to one of the last summer festivals - there will be "Cubāna" until Sunday night.
On the first night, groups such as "Enter Shikari" from Great Britain, which was expected last year, but not from the program disappeared, American punk "NOFX", DJ Maxim from "The Production" group and others.
In the coming days of the festival, the programme includes the famous words "Guano Apes" and "Garbage", a pancroka legend "Ramones" drummer Markijs Ramons with "Marky Ramone's Blitzkreig", "Brutto&Lyapis" with the Belarusian head Sergey at the forefront of Mihaloks, the popular Greek actor and singer Vahtangs Kikabīdze, Ukrainian "Vopli Vidoplyasova" and a series of other, but a full programme can be viewed here.
This is the second year when the festival "Kubana" takes place in Latvia.
Last year it suffered financial failure and enormous damage, but it did not stop the organisers from rehearsaling: they added a long mark to the name, included a group of Latvians (al Day Long, Friday evening 19:15) on the stage, and announced that the festival has now become "closer and gained local color next to such Riga symbols as its panorama and cats".
Whether or not these efforts will be justified, it is too early to judge, because the festival was just running, but as Delfi Entertainment took place in the first night, at least for the moment, the huge crowds of people have failed and the number of visitors was similar.

President, who remained in the shadow: Gustav Zemgal - 145.
On Friday, August 12, 145 years are open since the birth of the second President of Latvia Gustavs Zemgals.
Zemgall proclaimed Latvia, but unprofitable has remained in the shadow of the first described President of Latvia Jānis Čakste and the last President of the pre-war period Kārlis Ulmanis.
None of our own nationals has defended democracy and the rule of law as much as Zemgal, Arnolds Auziņš writes in a book dedicated to Gustav Zemgal ten years ago.
During the conversation with the "Delfi" Auziņš stresses that Zemgal is one of the politicians in the rare high positions who have experienced a sense of humor.
The others are so stiff, always very correct.
He taught us not to be like this. Today, he could be like Raimonds Vējonis.
"He was the one who was close to the people," says Auziņš.
Modern politicians know bad history, they referred to Kārli Ulmanis as the right leader, but rarely who knows how uncomplicated he was.
The only man on whom he did not cry was General Balodi.
Even if he was kind and smiling in his pictures, he was naturally hysteric.
"The poor with his sense of humor and democraticness leaves the opposite impression," said Auziņš.
Professor Aivars Stranga, Faculty of History and Philosophy of the University of Latvia, agrees with Auziņa's assessment of Zemgal as a calm and balanced stateman.
He also noted that Zemgal respected minorities, regularly invited Jewish representatives to the President's Palace.
"At that time, it was not an ordinary act, after the Zemgale Presidency Albert Kviesis took over this tradition," says the historian.
He was such a quiet and well - balanced person who had long had to talk to him to become the president.
He didn't want to do that. He simply didn't do the praises.
He also regarded himself quite critically because he did not know French, but he felt that the President should certainly understand it.
"During the Presidency, the fundamentals of French language were learned," explains Stranga.
Zemgale did not allow himself to be told to stand again; he did not like these high positions at all.
In all respects, he is a very respectable person in the history of Latvia, already before he was in a serious position at the President's Palace - he was a very requested notary.
Zemgal also led the famous Zemgal cashier at Suvorova Street 3, where the stocking and lending society was located.
He was always progressive.
There was no great respecter of Ulmanis, but he did not publicly object to him either.
"It has been said in private talks that he does not really like Ulmanis's activities," says Strang.
He lived a quiet life, there is no suspicion of irregularities or corruption.
How does Zemgal remember today?
It is a shame, but to a large extent he is associated only with a street in Riga.
He was an absolute democrat, and his views were central.
"There were no major shocks in his time, that is, he could be associated with such a real stable Presidency," says Strang.
During the Presidency of Gustav Zemgal, from 1927 until 1930, the visit of the Latvian State to Sweden was also taking place, which indirectly meant full recognition of Latvia in the neighbouring country and inclusion in the Northern European democratic nation family.
On May 28, 1929, Zemgal visited Stockholm.
The response visit of King Gustav V of Sweden to Latvia took place on June 29, 1929.
The second President of Latvia was born in 1871, but forever passed away in January 1939.
Just ways to help your child deal with anger attacks.
I often have to face the fact that the anger and anger of a child are regarded by my parents as something wrong and unnormal.
When a child openly shows his anger - we don't know how to react, "Econet" says psychologist Jekaterina Kesa.
The specialist encourages a little conversation about these natural and human feelings - anger and anger, which everyone periodically experiences.
Aggression - it is already a physical activity directed against another person, and it usually appears when you feel angry.
When we, adults, are angry, anxious - we usually know what happens to us and how to deal with it.
We can express our anger and anger in ourselves: express, suppress, hide, keep in touch, tell our friends or other loved ones about it; we can be angry with the sofa, smoke a cigarette (it's not the best way to do it!), go on a shower, get a bullet around the table and do other things that we don't normally do.
We are not turning our aggression against others, because we know different ways to deal with these emotions.
When children get angry, they don’t understand what happens to them, how to name them, and how to communicate with them.
They can say, "Go away!", "You're a fool", "Bad mom", "I can't see you", "I won't dare you" - and very rarely, when you can say, "I'm angry with you."
Children live in a magical sense, they are completely located right here, at this point, they are spontaneous and truly showing their feelings, and often they are also in the midst of various emotions.
It is very important that parents do not prevent their children from showing feelings, including anger, or being ashamed of that, but on the contrary - to help their child.
Do you need a pause in your relationship?
A long day in which everything has not happened as you would like, or just a bad mood - there are so many reasons why I would like to have a moment, a day or even longer "off" from around the world.
Is it possible to encirculate relationships for a moment and to apply a little bit?
Does this, however, indicate that each partner has its own path?
Ladies and gentlemen, different ages share their views.
John (23) is short and concise: "In my view, if you need a certain date in your relationship, you are not with the real person".
Meanwhile, Edward (30) has discovered a scheme that may help someone.
If you feel that your partner starts to fall to your nerves for every little detail, then surely this is the right time to study other hunting fields to see if you're missing, thinking about, or even not even want to see her again.
So the answer is - yes, holding a stop can help you save time and understand how important you have the other half.
Casper (29) reveals his theory.
I think that we should keep one another on a daily basis, because if you spend time with a person 24 hours a day, seven days a week, disputes are inevitable.
They are caused by the fact that you notice every detail the other does, and it begins to fall into the nerves.
People are starting to bother each other, especially if they don't even talk about anything anymore, just what you've done in the day.
My personal experience makes me think so, so I haven’t had a relationship for more than a few months.
If you think for a moment that else or another one is better, then why is that woman with whom you are together worth someone who can think that there is not enough good here and there's a paradise field behind the mountains?
Thinking alone is a little treason.
If not, it is not.
"I have, therefore, slightly condemn those who do not." says Edmund (46).
Karl (33) has a completely different view.
I think everybody needs a moment to breathe.
You can't look at each other's eyes for a moment, all the time, morning to evening, and rejoice at the unfailing love of each other.
Come on!
There are so many things - friends, work, parties.
It's all time.
Of course, a friend or wife too, but if both of them know how to keep it in balance between family life and the rest of the world, it can live up to the edge of the grave.
That's it and that's it.
Martin (27) says this: "It is a pity to say - it is necessary or not, it may or should not be taken into a pause, but one thing is clear: it does not have a whole relationship, something is lacking."
If this question is raised, it must be borne in mind that there will be some change in the near future - on the right or on the wrong side, it will depend on itself.
I think, while you're still young and crazy, while you're in need - something all the time, but when everything remains serious and the relationship goes into a completely different phase, rest cannot be about.
You decide to spend your whole life together!
"If you are not able to withstand each other now and once again need a rest, what will happen when you are pensioners who comment on how passing cats will be worried or contentious about the day when the garden is better served", explains Kristaps (19).
All the names of the lords have been changed.
Rozentāls, with his thrilling and thrilling personality, was the first to awakened the interest of Latvians in sculptures.
"In this sense he was the first love of the Latvian nation, which will remain unforgettable forever," wrote Roman Suta about the old master of Latvian painting.
Also in 2016, when the old master reveals a comprehensive retrospective exhibition in the restored main building of the Latvian National Museum of Art, it is clear that Rozentāls is the first love of Latvian art.
The exhibition was opened on 12 August, but it will be open to visitors from 13 August until 30 October.
The National Museum of Art of Latvia, with a wide history in the newly celebrated Great Exhibition Hall, honors painter Janis Rozentāls (1866-1916), whose 100th birthday on an international scale is included in the UNESCO calendar of holidays.
The retrospective exhibition, which features more than 150 works, is one of the central events of Janis Rozentāls’ annual program.
Most of the works of art are made from a collection of the Latvian National Museum of Art, which convincingly represents the main stages and genres of classical creative activities, stylistic variability and variety of techniques.
In addition, exhibits from Aksel Gallen-Kallell Museum, Museum of Writing and Music, Liepaja Museum, Tukums Museum and several private collections in Latvia and Finland have been used.
The atmosphere of the century-old turn is revived by the presence of photos, and the mobile application of the exhibition reveals some art talks with photographs by the painter with his camera for creativity.
The Finnish-Latvian Friendship Society "Rozentāls-seura", named on behalf of the Latvian classic, simultaneously offers the first stop of a small informative travelling exhibition "With a view in Finland, with a heart in Latvia".
A similar exposition with content presentation in English, Finnish and Swedish will be opened at the "Virka" gallery in Helsinki in autumn.
Matt Leblank looks forward to returning to the "TopGear" show.

For the time being, nothing is official.
"If it happens, BBC will announce it," Leblanz revealed in his conversation with television critics.
The question of the future of the "Gaze in Gryde!" originated in July when Leblanca's couple Chris Evans announced that they would leave the program.
After leaving, Evans admitted that Leblanz and "Gaze in the floor!" was "how was created to each other."

The day in Riga will pass without precipitation and the sun will mostly shine.
However, the air will not be warmer than +18 degrees.
The U.S. model business backstages in his interpretation have gained perversely sophisticated photosession glaciers and the intolerantness of a horror film.
Basically, very provocative, on sophistication and banal vulgarity balancing work, in which it is difficult to draw a border line between the European art house film and the Hollywood genre of product territory.
The film with Vigo Mortensen highlights in the main role whether parental conceptually chosen life models (environmental, vegetarianism, alternativeism and isolation from consumer society's embarrassment and values) bring blessings or destructiveness to their children.
After the death of his wife, the father of six children is confrontationed with questions about the correctness and true values of their lives.
A moving, smart live film by Matt Ross won this year a Cannes Festival Award for a director.
Of course, sharks do this just as they attack beautiful girls - in the Jocks it was a swimmer, in this case a brave surfer, represented by Blake Laiwiley.
He asked for her to be a great hero.
This survival solor can be compared with the demonstration of James Frank's performance in the film for 127 hours and Raien Reynolds' game in the film Apraks alive.
Mila Kunis, the main figure of his role, may well be blamed, whose transformations from the sample into a creative and family values heir of the Teju, seem to be only created by a totally desperate Hollywood scriptist fantasy.
The Islamic country in Syria has destroyed 2,000 civilians.
According to the Office of the SRSG on Children and Armed Conflict, he was responsible for recruitment and use of children and adolescents.
"We did not shoot at them because they took civilians with them when they fled to Jerabulus," said a press representative from Kurd Menbiza's Military Council.
After two months of battles, the Syrian Democratic Forces (QSD), led by the United States, the Kurd-Arab Alliance in the north of Syria, announced on Friday that Menbžia was released from Jihadis.
Islamic State Menbici took part in 2014.
The QSD has driven most of the "Islamic state" fighters from Menbiga last week, but part of it has stood up and shown strong resistance.
However, they left the city on Friday, taking themselves with them prisoners.
Islamists go to Gerabulus, on the border with Turkey.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) also reported that the Islamic State has robbed some 2,000 people.
The SOHR reported that Islamists have stolen the cars of the city's inhabitants, forced people to start in them, and then led them to Jerabulus.
In the past, Islamic national fighters have also been the object of mass abductions.
In January, Islamists conquered the territories of the Deir ez Zora Province in the East of Syria, killing more than 400 civilians, including women and children.
Later, about 270 of the prisoners were released by Islamists.
The extent to which Islamic state fighters have fled Menbiga is unknown.
A press representative of Kurdu Menbiza's Military Council reported that QSD managed to save 2,500 people who were held captive by Islamists in Menbiga.
According to the information collected by the SOHR, at least 437 civilian people, including 105 children, lost their lives in the Menbij City battle.

Koļegova refuses to stand as Head of the SRS.
Inga Koļegova, Head of the State Environmental Service, decided to revoke his candidacy for the post of Director General of the State Revenue Service (VID), and informed LETA agency at the Ministry of Finance.
Koļegova points out that the consultation of her nominations has led to more contradictions between the ruling coalition parties.
It seems that the real causes of the discussions are related to the visible, but more often invisible interests of politicians, and they have nothing to do with assessing my professional capacity.
"I don't agree with this," emphasises that I have already been an applicant for the Director of the SRS.
If her candidacy was confirmed by the government, it was clear that this would not be a convincing vote and would not allow the SRS to work and make the necessary changes with the support of all the governments.
Without it, it would not be possible to conclude Koleegova.
'I have, to the public at least, emphasised that I do not want to be politically dependent, but that at the moment, my whole accession process is too politicised,' the official explains.
"Thank you for the confidence and support shown to me, it is the experience that I see as a benefit", writes Coleegova in her application to Reizniece-Ozola.
On Wednesday, the arrangement stated that during the meeting with Koļegowu, there were "significant contradictions" between the explanations of the candidate and the information available in the public registers regarding the costs of the dividends of SIA Pallogs, because the decisions of the members of Pallogue meetings, which are publicly available, intend not to share the profit.
Currently, the Head of the SEN is responsible for the duties of Deputy Director General Dace Grey.

Even when she is going home after having served in common, she decided to leave her children at the shop in circumstances that were not yet clear.
The police immediately informed the orphan, which will also decide on the future fate of the children.
The Freeport of Riga has implemented all VK recommendations regarding the Russian island project.
The Freeport Authority of Riga has implemented all of the five recommendations of the State Audit Office (NC) regarding the development of the project Infrastructure for the transfer of port activities from the city centre to the Russian island, the portal Dasa.lv informed the company.
Approval of the project is planned at the next meeting of the Board of Freeport of Riga.
In order to implement the recommendations in line with the opinion of the SC, in preparing the documentation necessary for the implementation of the recommendations, the Riga Freeport Authority also led following the conclusions of the legal and operational audit of the international auditor Deloitte in the Freeport Administration of Riga and the recommendations made to improve the management of the project at the next stage of the project.
Information on the implementation of the recommendations has also been sent to the SAC today.
Despite the fact that the Freeport Authority of Riga does not agree with the opinion prepared by the SAC on the usefulness of the Russian island project, we take a very responsible approach to the implementation of the project and the funding provider - the European Commission (EC).
I would like to emphasise that all the planned construction works within the project have been fully completed within the set deadlines and in the planned scope.
"In order to prove to all those involved in the implementation of the project, including the EC, the LC and also the LC, that the main goal of the Freeport is to successfully implement the project, we have fully implemented all the LC recommendations on project management and monitoring issues", says Sanita Kaire, Project Manager of the Russian Island.
The long-term plan for monitoring and monitoring achievement of the project's objective was complemented by the main planned activities of the parties concerned and the time limits for the necessary decisions, the definitions of meetings and regular reports and their deadlines, the tools for monitoring the planned construction process and the definitions of the most significant border points.
The approved action plan to achieve the project goal by 31 December 2018, in line with the recommendations of the SAC, was supplemented with performance monitoring activities, thereby reinforcing control of the time limits of other parties involved in the implementation of the project from the Freeport of Riga.
A project management plan has been developed to improve project management and reduce potential risks by defining the areas of project management and identifying the developed documents providing a control and monitoring mechanism for each of them.
A project management structure scheme has been developed to increase the project capacity, reflecting the planned structure of the project management team, staff qualification and functions.
In order to improve communication between the Freeport of Riga Authority and the parties involved in the project, a project communication plan of stakeholders has been developed, defining, in addition to the parties specified in the project action plan, stakeholders, principles, forms and periodicity of information exchange for successful completion of the project.
On the other hand, in order to improve control of the use of funds, the need for the conclusion of a service contract or the opening of procurement and the rule of law will need to be further justified.
Within the framework of the project, the Russian island has built port infrastructure that meets world standards – four new deep-water quays, railway ports, as well as engineering communications.
Constructions co-financed by the Cohesion Fund have been completed and put into operation at the end of last year, achieving the envisaged savings of €10.6 million.
The threat has resulted in increased airport security in Slovakia.
After receiving non-specific threats, Slovakia increased security measures at several airports on Friday, announced by the Ministry of the Interior.
"In view of the threat, we have reinforced security measures at international airports in Bratislava, Poprad and Košice", the press representative of the Ministry of Interior of Slovakia told news agency AFP on Friday.

The meeting will discuss the consequences of the British Brexit referendum and discuss the future of the EU without Britain.
Slovakia is the EU Presidency in January.
German researchers discuss "the number of victims of the Berlin Wall".
According to a new study, the number of deaths by the Communists in the south of the former East German border could be much higher than thought before, but doubts about the actual number of victims have still not been allayed.
According to data from the Berlin Wall Museum's Checkpoint Charlie, on Wednesday, 1945 to 1989, 1841 people were murdered by the Communist authorities of Western Germany trying to get out of their controlled area.
The museum has been studying the deaths associated with the border for years, and then adjusts the number of victims.
This year, 11 more deaths were added, including among the victims a six-year-old boy who drowned in trying to get to West Germany through the then Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
The victims of the Berlin Wall are also the deserter of the Soviet army.
"The final amount of damage caused by the dual evil of communism and socialism is not yet fully documented", admits the museum director Aleksandra Hildebrante.
"Our task is to ensure that the graves of those who died in an attempt to escape from a Communist controlled country are maintained and not lost," emphasised the popular statement by Hildebrant.
However, other researchers have already questioned the new figures.
In an interview to Süddeutsche Zeitung, "Skaitlis 1841 is unconvinced", says Johen Štata, expert of East History of the Free University of Berlin.
He, together with other researchers at the Free University of Berlin, is currently reviewing possible suspicious deaths at the border, and so far, they have only confirmed 260 cases.
In the past, researchers found that 138 people had only been murdered by the Communists at the Berlin Wall.
In view of those who died trying to escape the Baltic Sea or enter the West through the territory of neighbouring countries, it feels that the number of victims could reach about a thousand.
However, this is still much less than 1841.
One of the reasons for the differences in the number of victims could be different methodologies.
The Checkpoint Charlie Museum also lists all cases of suicide by East German border guards, whether directly related to their service.
The museum also lists cases of non-direct violence.
"If the elderly died of a heart attack between 70 and 80 years after the border control had collapsed, it must have had the consequences of this "homicile border", Hildebrante considers.
However, she is convinced that a distinction must be made between the old people who may have died as a result of their past exposure and those whose death is caused by prolonged hot waiting on the bus at the border.
Regardless of its victims, record keeping is not easy because the Communist East German authorities do not collect such statistics, and researchers have to produce documents in various scattered archives, according to the Schtata.
However, the Štata Group has recently acquired new documents and could therefore come up with an estimate of the number of new victims in the near future.
Mr. LPF President, Mr. Rio has gone to Rio with the accreditation of a coach; it is a surprise.
In recent days, Caspar, the president of the Latvian Floating Federation (LPF), came to the Olympics of Mr. Riodeaniiro with accreditation of the coach, but feels surprised about it.
On Wednesday, the big austories were caused by the statements by German Jakukovsky, the coach of Alona Ribokova, who, following the Olympic swimmer, decided to go to Rio de Janeiro, while the coach had to stay at home.
Initially, swimmers Aļona Ribokova and Uvis Kalniņš, coaches Jakubovskis and Daivs Collins were approved on the list of drivers, as well as the president of the Federation Mr.
The Latvian Swimming Federation applied for five participants for the Olympic Games, and before the departure Aldon Vrubļevski claimed that German would have and be looking for tickets.
"However, obviously for objective reasons he was not," Mr President said, saying that this did not affect the outcome of the Ribacova.
At the request of the federation, the coach of Uvja undertook to help her.
Sir, who is himself a member of the Executive Committee of the CPs, was harshly criticised for the activities of the CPs, and the blame for the organisation that oversees Olympic sport.
In my view, it is unethical for the LOK Executive Committee to approve five persons and not to take one of them.
"I don't know why it wasn't enough for the Swimming Federation," Mr President said that there is no public appreciation for the work of the Federation and their presidents, reminding them that the presidents of the Federation do not receive salaries.
He also criticised Jakubovskis himself, saying that before the London Olympics, when Ribakova was not approved among the participants, he appealed to the International Water Sport Federation (FINA) and invited Latvia not to send a sportsman.
Sir, he could not tell me why he was under a coach’s accreditation at the Olympic Games, which he was likely to have come to Jacubovskis.
"I was announced as the president of the Federation ("the key"), but for unknown reasons I received coach accreditation and now I am nowhere."
The situation changed daily and the number of available accreditations changed.
Until the last moment I think Germans would be, because I had no other information.
According to the information available to the LETA agency, a few days before the beginning of Ribakova, she had a eye-to-eye conversation with Poni and the swimmer had tears in her eyes after it, but the President himself said that it was a daily conversation with the desire to taste athletes before the start.
Mr. He recalled that the LPF oversees five types of sport that are part of the Olympic Programme and four of them also undergo training for children in Latvia.
The President of the Federation said that it was also very important for Latvia to raise issues, and he also talked about such programmes when he was in Rio de Janeiro for almost two weeks.
He praised the work of the Federation and said that in 2018 the World Cup phase could follow in Latvia.
The arrival in Rio de Janeiro is not my holiday, I work here, I spend my time and my efforts to implement the four-year programmes.
The mill will inject 600 000 drops of baby.
During the period of the AS Latvenergo fish stocks recovery programme this week, in Daugava near Mangalsala is entering salmon and mat puppets, and this year more than 600 000 annual salmon and mat are to be introduced, grown in the farms of Bior Tomes and Doles.
The Latvenergo agency LETA informed that the introduction of fish will continue for the coming months as well: 6 300 000 juveniles and larvae of different species are introduced each year in the water catchment areas of the Daugava basin.
In the spring and early summer of 2016, lingerie and weeds will be released, in June, July, summer drops, August and September - zandards and vimbas will be released.
Maris Kuņickis, Director of Latvenergo Production, said that care about the environment is one of the cornerstones of sustainable development of Latvenergo Group.
"For the protection and propagation of fish resources, every activity is aimed at environmentally friendly activities, in close cooperation with the scientific institute Bior, both for the production and introduction of juveniles in the Daugava basin and for the pursuit of other activities," indicated Kuņickis.
This year, more than 600 000 annual baby salmon and spring drops will be introduced in the Daugavas’ grīva.
For the second year now, young fish have been marked before they enter, cutting the fatty hair.
Today, the cargo contains 25,000 drops of juveniles with an average weight of 31.3 grams.
Every year the entering of juvenile fish and larvae is conducted in a scientifically-based composition of species and figures in the Daugava River and its catchment areas.
The reproduction of fish resources in the Daugava River and its basin water bodies shall be carried out by Bior in accordance with the regulatory enactments on the basis of an expert examination of the losses caused by Latvenergo's economic activity and concluding what compensatory measures are to be taken to ensure the diversity of fish resources.
On the basis of that examination, the State Environment Service shall decide on the amount and type of compensation.
The annual amount of Latvenergo compensation for fish stocks in the recovery programme is EUR 1 035 000.
In the spring of 2016, Latvenergo, in cooperation with the association "Our Fish", has placed for the fifth year a nest of 400 artificial fish spawning at Kaubala and Ikšķiles.
Cooperation with the Society in promoting the natural spawning of fish is an additional supported initiative of Latvenergo within the framework of the programme for the recovery of fish resources.
Placement of artificial spawning nests in the water reservoir is an important measure that contributes to the protection and reproduction of fish resources in Daugava.

The distance from here to Riga is about 150 km, but only a few minutes walk to smile in the face and light.
"Please don't look for the program because we have deliberately chosen not to publish it in advance, so people don't go to one particular event or artist, because the true taste of Sansusī can only be taken by spending all three days in Sansussy", invites the initiator and host of the festival, operabariton Armands Siliņš.
The festival gate is available on Friday at 5 p.m. and the first concert is 7 p.m.
Of course there will be software on the spot with all the information.
For those who have to choose one day, we recommend Saturday because it is the most saturable, from 9 a.m. to the next morning.
"The names of artists are available on the website www.sansus.lv", the story Armands Siliņš.

Reids claims if Klinton is elected as President, she will appoint Garland as a judge of the Supreme Court.
The leader of the Democrat Party of the Senate, Harry Reids, is convinced that if she becomes President, she will designate Merik Garland as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.
The Party of the Republic of the Senate has blocked the approval of Garland since March when they were nominated by President Obama.
Mr Mitch Maconnel, the leader of the majority of the Senate, told that the next president would choose who would replace the current Supreme Court judge Antonin Skali.
On Thursday at his conference, Reids announced that he was convinced that Clinton would choose Garland.
The representative of Reida later said that he had not spoken personally about this subject with Clinton and that it was just speculation.
He praised Garland and said that the Clinton team would not want to "show a boat" with another choice.
Garland is the General Judge of the Appeal Court of the United States District of Colombia.
Reid said that the Republicans blocking Garland's nomination are "littles" and act in the interest of the President of the Republic's Party candidate Donald Trump.
He also said that Trump was not suitable for the work of the President.

Greenland shark is the longest-lived vertebrate animal - video view

The French court rejects the request to dismantle the Jeungu shops in the refugee camp.
The French court rejected the request made by the authorities in Kale to dismantle tens of self-made shops and restaurants in "Jungļu" camp, where several thousand refugees live.
At this week's court hearing in Kale, the authorities indicated that the country should dispose of 72 self-made shops, where people sell goods such as cigarettes and energy drinks in the camp area, offer hairdresser services, tea for 50 cents (40p) and simple meals for some of the euro in restaurants.
In Kale, the Prefect Office indicated that these self-established companies should be dismantled, as they form a shadow economy and do not pay taxes, as well as the risks of fire and sanitation.
The representatives of the Humanitarian Group explained to the court that these small businesses were important, as the food provided by governments and support groups did not meet the needs of a camp where the population continues to grow.
They also pointed out that self-made shops and restaurants often offer free shelters and food for those who need it most.
The Lille Court ruled that there is no legal basis to expel people who have created 72 self-made shops, but it understands the concerns of the Prefect in Kale.
Justice Jean-Fransua Molla said that food, coffee and restaurants play a bigger role than simply providing food to people who live "extremely in poor conditions".
He pointed out that these places were peaceful places to meet refugees and volunteers.
One of the places at risk of demolition is the camp café "Jungle Book Kids", which provides more than 200 free meals per day, English and French, and provides advice on asylum issues to hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors without adult support.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition about the protection of children's cafes.
A letter addressed to the Guardian states that the liquidation of the café "could be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old."
On Friday, two charities "Helping refugees" and "L'Auberge des Migrants" said that the number of inhabitants of the Jungle camp has increased to 9000, which is the highest indicator since the rapid influx of migrants in summer.

The impressive performance of the British team during the regatta 7 series ended on Thursday, when in the exciting finals at the Deodor stadium Rio Fiji, the state-run of the state-of-the-art destroyed them with a result of 43:7.
Fiji demonstrated masterclass in ball management, bombs playing with the foot, supporting the game and brutal power game, fighting gold - the first Olympic medal in its history.
The Saxon brought an honorable peace prize - a silver medal that was then the third medal of Britain. The British selection can be proud of its success in the first Olympic regbeath 7 tournament in New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The great battle in the semi-final, in which the Box team suffered defeating the result of 7:5 in the first half of the day, probably played for the United Kingdom in the final.
But in any case, Fiji's selection is now in its best form to win a team of 15 men.
Although unlikely, however known comfort for Britain would be the fact that at least one brit got a golden medal. It is the chief trainer of Fiji's sample, Ben Ryan, a former English coach from Wimbledon.
This was an exciting adventure for Britain.
Eight years ago, under the leadership of Ryan, they lost all the games regatta to the 7th series stage of Adeline.
This time they lost only one game.
The root is painful, but growth is amazing.
Fiji was impressively started a match, repeating Britain’s techniques of joy after.
Captain Tom Mičell and his fellow members were like contact with a number of opposite buses, and the World Series champions took the lead at 5:0 when Osea Kolinisau gained the first landing.
In the last four minutes, Jerry Tuwai also increased his victory by selling the ground on the right wing.
Outcome 12:0 and the British team did not even really touch the ball.
Michel’s great force did not allow Leoni Nakarava to reach three points, but only had a small impact on Fiji’s outcome.
In the seventh minute of the game, Jas Veremlula was caught ground in the right corner, strengthening the predominance over Great Britain to 17:0.
After that, Nakarava even increased the victory even more and by the end was more than a minute... the end of the first half-life.
Vatemo Ravouvos was avoided by some barren British techniques and crossed the line with points.
Land provided a result of 29:0.
It seemed that Fiji was born to play regby in 7 machos while the British were still studying.
In fact, it is also true.
The British team made a profound mid-term change by breaking the Fijii player line... full of four minutes, which was good after the first half-time standards, until Joshua Tuisova, after having played a fantastic team, got a few more points for Fiji's team.
Dan Norton managed to score for the British team, carrying out a landslide in the left corner and achieving a result of 36:7, but the game had already been lost, while the fans of the South Sea islanders sang, vicined flags and dances.
No wonder Fiji is a happy life - style.
Matthew William made Fiji more sweet with another grounding game to end.
In response to the final whistle of the game, Fiji could begin to celebrate, but the British could just sit down at the grass after the defeat.
In the first half of the day, semi-final Fiji won Japan with a result of 20:5, while the British were far above South Africa, where both teams won a very heavy battle on land and the South Africans lost only a few points.
In the first half, Kyle Brown put the box under the command of the teams, and in the second half, Dan Norton crossed through the line and took the ball between the poles, providing the British victory.
Marcus Vatson, who is the brother of England regbby-15 player, gave the team a victory and another silver medal at the end of the game.
The fight against cancer was inspired by Helen Glover and Heter Staning.
It will be the most emotional gold medal in these races and it is already expressing much.
From the first to the last cancer, the golden moment of Helen Glover and Hetere Stanning played a special role in the Estacio da Lagoa track.
Although there are only two athletes in the boat, they accompanied by Robin Williams’ echo, which inspired them to obtain the second Olympic gold medal by rowing couples, becoming the first women in the history of British sport, which has made such a success.
They were clearly dominated because for the 39th time they won an untimely, unprecedented victory.
Both great athletes with swan elegance slip on the water surface do not fully reflect this triumph.
There is a whole team behind every gold medal that works hard for athletes to continuously improve their performance and their major contribution to success by a trainer who did not know 30 months ago whether he would experience this day because he was diagnosed with cancer.
According to him, it disappeared as quickly as it appeared.
I had a bladder cancer that is one of those that can be operated and that happened.
If it did not, it would spread throughout the body.
And the situation would become uncontrollable.
It's changing your vision a little bit.
William's cancer was discovered in December 2013.
This trio succeeded in allowing William to start a recovery procedure at the beginning of the season of 2014 and reducing the cut-off time to a minimum if it could be said.
I needed income, so I had to recover quickly.
It stimulated recovery.
I was in the hospital and went off at 6, 10, and even 15 feet [15 m] away, although the doctor said that I would have enough steps.
It all started.
Airing itself is a challenge, but this time it was even bigger.
After winning, the first thought was about William, who was very worried all morning and talked more than normal in the impact of anxiety.
Staninga, who served at the Royal Artilles Unit in Afghanistan, said: "This was an emotionally heavy week, but it means a lot to me."
It just confirms how much it means to us and how much I, Helen and Robin have worked.
The three years of Helen and Robin have been great.
Without Robin, we would not have achieved anything, so thank him enormously, he is the best coach in the world.
I can't imagine a better trainer or a better coach.
Helena Glovere and Hetere Staninga have not lost their race for five years.
The couple achieves such an enormous speed that competitors cannot compete with.
Even in the last 500 meters, when teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover were overstated.
We felt every minute.
Helen shouted, "Save your rhythm, keep your rhythm."
Do not lose focus is really important.
We managed a good start, but at the same time we had no high expectations.
On that day, we had no intention of breaking down the record, but simply going out well and winning the race, and we did it.
A couple of years will rest to decide what to do further.
The following month will be Glover and television adventure-seeking Steve Basz wedding.
For now, she just wants to enjoy a moment.
I didn't mean these were my last race.
That would have been too much pressure.
In London, I needed about six months to realize that I was the Olympic Champion.
It was a new experience and I was very concerned.
This time it took about four minutes.
She said, "The feeling is fantastic."

Koļegowu SRS is headed "to the last".
According to him, now Prime Minister Maris Kučinskim (the Union of Farmers) and Minister of Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola (the Union of Farmers) already have "proportionately important" to approve the candidates nominated by the Minister of Finance in the post of SRS.
Rajevskis said that both Kučinskik and Reizniece-Ozola in this government, certification of the Head of the SRS is "the first big decision", which can affect the future of him as politicians.
If they now come to a change in the position of the SRS lead candidate, this will have a negative impact on their image in the public administration.
The agenda for the meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers next week includes the issue of the transfer of the Head of the SVD Koļegov to the Director General of the SRS, as evidenced by the government agenda.
Ināra Pētersone, the Minister of Finance, Reizniece-Ozola, retiring from the management of the service, and the tender for the post of Director General of the SRS ended without result.
On Thursday, August 11, in an interview Latvian Radio allowed – if she was offered to stand as a leader, she could agree.
The Minister of Finance admitted, however, that other candidates for the post of Head of the SRS have not yet been examined.
Raivis Dzintars, Head of the Saeima Group of the National Association, also acknowledged NA’s continued support for the SRS.
In Spain, the risk of a reduction in the deficit could not be undermined by the creation of a government.
A month ago, on 12 July, the European Commission (EC) presented its opinion that Spain and Portugal had failed to take sufficiently large steps to bring the deficit rate down to 3% of GDP requested by the euro area.
In spite of the austerity measures implemented, the Portugal budget deficit at the end of last year was estimated at 4.4% of GDP and 5.1% of GDP in Spain.
However, the European Commission decided not to impose economic sanctions on both countries, while setting fiscal targets for the near future.
One of the reasons why the EC did not introduce sanctions against these two countries is the growing Euroscepticism in many countries of the European Union.
Additional sanctions would only multiply such a negative mood.
The critics note, however, that the EC is not consistent in its decisions, starting with the agreement on common rules and then unable to apply them in life.
So, for example, Jens Wademann, President of the German Bundesbank, has pointed out that Europe is losing confidence in itself, creating the public perception that European Union rules are recommended rather than binding.
The EC has now proposed and approved an extension of the correction of the deficit by the end of this year for Portugal and for Spain by 2018.
The European Commission promises to examine progress made by both countries over the next few months, pointing out that both Spain and Portugal should be prepared to introduce additional austerity measures if circumstances so require.
Preliminary forecasts show that the target for Portugal could be achieved within the required timeframe and that the deficit could already fall to 2.5% of gross domestic product this year.
This means that, within the framework of the Stability Programme, the government of this country must implement austerity measures of 0.2% of GDP this year.
These measures should be included in this year's budget, with an additional focus on controlling the costs of purchasing goods and services.
In the case of Spain, the situation is much more complex.
This year the deficit should be reduced to 4.6%, to 3.1% next year and to 2.2% of GDP in 2018.
In addition, consolidation measures should be 0,5 % of GDP annually in the next two years.
In particular, the fact that for eight months now, the Spanish political parties have failed to reach an agreement on the creation of a government makes it increasingly possible for Spain to organise early parliamentary elections for the third time in the year.
However, opinion polls show that the third election would also not change the political scene in the country.
The most popular party is still the current People's Party, led by Prime Minister Mariano Rahoy, whose wish to get a little of 33% again.
Only socialists have increased their popularity slightly, while the popularity of the parties "Podemos" or "Copy" and "Ciudanos" or "Pilsoni" has slightly decreased against austerity measures.
The People's Party wants socialist and Ciudadnos' participation in the government yet this month, otherwise it will not be possible to adopt and submit to the European Commission for approval the draft budget for 2017.
As announced by the representative of the Parliamentary Group of the People's Party, Rafael Hernando, if the government fails to set up and the parliamentary elections will still be held for the third time, Spain will become a laughter for the whole of Europe.
The cleanliness of beaches in the Gulf of Riga is critical.
A fifth year’s survey of the beaches has revealed that, unfortunately, the number of waste sites is increasing each year, and the majority of bathing sites are being blamed.
The most contaminated bathing areas are in Riga.
The city’s idea explains that bathing areas are maintained daily, but it is quite difficult to fight dirty visitors.
In addition, waste left on land during rains can be flushed into water, thus seriously damaging its quality.
Excepting Liepaja beach and separate places in Kurzeme, cleanliness of beaches elsewhere in Latvia is critical.
Such a statement this week has been disseminated by the "My Sea" campaigns volunteers.
During the fifth year, when we measured the road along the Gulf of Riga, the activists concluded that the number of waste left by the population has increased by one hundred metres.
Unfortunately, this assessment of criticism has taken place this year.
"We can see that this will be the year when the number of waste on the beach of 100 meters may even exceed 200 units", says Jānis Ulme, representative of the expedition "My Sea".
Called by the Radio of Latvia, he was on the beach of Tūja, where voluntary travel along the Gulf of Riga will continue.
This year, among the various municipal waste and picnic remains, activists had to collect even the lamps of daylight that are left in the sand of the sea.
The participant and organiser of the journey, Ulme, says that it is the citizens who are responsible for pollution.
"The main source is the beach visitors themselves, because more than half of the total amount of waste is plastic, different wastes, starting with bags, plastic pieces, which are already in the process of degradation, can no longer be identified, and butts, bottles, corks," says Ulme.
The most dirty beaches include bathing areas in Riga.
For example, in Daugavpils every 100 meters, nearly 800 units of waste are collected on average, which is critically high.
The organisers of the campaign also explain that it is also a mockery and not a sign of warning or ban that is everywhere.
"The average figures for all three Riga bathing areas together - Daugavgrīvu, Westbuļļļļi and Vecāķi - are unfortunately big and far above the desired goal or goal, which Latvia has been moving towards, to reduce the number of waste units to 135 units by 2020," the environmental defender concludes.
With the cleaning of swimming places in Riga every day, during the hottest summer days even twice, explained the representative of the Council Uģis Vidakis.
However, the fight against dirty visitors is very difficult.
We are returning to the cultural issue of these people.
"For those who land, drink alcohol, smoke and do all things that cannot, even special signs do not work," says Insidekis.
It therefore calls on the police also to report the pollution to bathing visitors.
The police can be called, to point out these violations safely, and thus fight all.
Perhaps you may put some new warnings on you, but as I said, it is unlikely that this will change the situation as a matter of course.
"That's how all together just need to turn and be intolerant to such offenders," he emphasises.
Meanwhile, water quality measurements have already been carried out this summer for the fourth time by the Health Inspectorate, which can impose a ban on official bathing areas.
This year, like other years, water quality is good and satisfactory everywhere.
The current situation is that all 56 bathing areas have always been of good water quality and there are no bathing restrictions.
"For the last time we will take the analysis at the end of August", said Mr. Normunds Kadikis, senior environmental specialist.
During heavy rains, land-based waste can be flushed into water.
This may in turn affect its quality, as indicated by an environmental specialist.
Rotations at the Russian elite continue - Change of head of Putin's administration.
Did they leave their position?
Vladimir Putin announced to the Russian media that Sergey Ivanov had wished to leave this position and would in future be the President's special representative for nature, ecology and transport.
In front of the television camera, Putin said to Ivanov: "Prime Sergej Borisovič, we are working together with you for many years and doing it successfully."
I am satisfied with the way you perform your duties.
I remember well about our agreement not to use you in this post of Head of the President's Administration for more than four years.
Therefore, I am aware of your desire to change the field of activity.
And I hope that in your new position, you will make full use of your knowledge and experience.
However, it is stressed that the leadership of the President's administration is very important and made Ivan one of the most influential people in the country.
In view of the forthcoming elections of the State Council in Russia next month, the rumour that this step is related to the fight for power at the Russian political elite.
Ivan was also referred to as a possible substitute for President Putin, and the claim that he himself wanted to hold the office of Presidential Representative for Nature and Transport has created doubts.
According to the archives of Lsm.lv, Ivanov is the General Assembly of the KGB and the Federal Security Service.
Ivan was an old and close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He started his career at special service in 1975, where he met Putin.
Later, Putin became the head of the Federal Security Service, Ivan became his deputy.
The first President of Russia, Boris Yeltsin, was appointed Secretary of the Russian Security Council at the end of his reign.
In 2000, after Putin’s arrival to power, the "Information Security doctrine" developed by Ivanova was approved, which included the revitalization of state censorship mechanisms in Russia.
In 2001, Sergey Ivanov became the Minister of Defence of Russia, but already in 2005 he was Deputy Prime Minister Mihail Fradkov and was responsible for the development of Russian defence companies and arms exports.
Now, after leaving the Head of the President's Administration, Ivan will also retain his place on the Russian National Security Council, where the new Head of the President's Administration, Vaino, will also work.
Vino comes from the elite of the family Soviet party.
The position of Head of the President's Administration, Vaino, has been recommended by Ivanov himself.
My name and I have known Anton Edwardovič for a long time.
From the time you were working under the guidance of the government.
And for almost five years, we have met practically every day.
"I am therefore convinced that, according to all professional and personal qualities, he is ready for this work," said Ivan.
The crown comes from a family belonging to the elites of the Soviet party.
His grandfather Carl took high positions in the Estonian Communist Party, including his first secretary for ten years until 1988.
The Internet edition "Medusa" with reference to the book "Estonian self-determination and independence" writes that in the late 1980s Karl Vaino had asked Moscow to give permission to use force against demonstrators.
However, he has received a refusal and has soon lost his position.
A short time later, Vaino has moved to Moscow.
Anton Vaino has graduated from the Moscow Institute of International Relations and is managing Japanese.
However, he has left the diplomatic service to work in the President's Protocol Administration.
It has already been reported that Russia has been shaken by the arrests and even arrests of a number of high-ranking officials, including the replacement of governors and federal representatives of a number of regions.
According to political scientists, President Putin transforms ruling elites before the elections in 2018.
One of the main features is that more and more representatives of force structures are attached to leading positions.
Jūdo Kgalonis Nikiforenko loses his first Olympics in the battle.
This was a fight in the first round, and the Latvian judo Knife has finished his participation in the Olympic Games by finishing 17th place.
Coach Oleg Baskin admitted to the Latvian Television that the hope of Niikiforenko was very little, and that was already clear before the competition.
He also discovered that the judo cricket had suffered a trauma in the fight.
Significantly, in order to reach the Olympic Roadmarks, Nikiforenko had to start in a different weight category than usual - i.e. in the weight category up to 100 kilograms.
Azerbaijan’s cgalon was more than 25 pounds [25 kg] harder.
It has already been reported that Jevgenij Borodavoko has held up to 100 kilograms of weight against Ryonosuki for two and a half minutes until the opponent succeeded in a pure victory.
Consequently, Latvia has finished the judo race in Rio.
Dreams disappear in Rio sand.
The Thursday was entered by Jugany Borodavoko.
Yes, he had a better titled opponent, but ambitious men can at times be surprised.
He didn't.
The task of Arthur Nikiforenko was even more complex, because the experience is smaller and the opponent is also respectable.
The result is similar, although he held his face for about one and a half minutes longer than Borodavoko.
Unfortunately, in recent years, Latvian judistors have not had the most ambition.
Gunārs Ķirsons and his financial stand Vladimir Šestakovs, who left Latvia Alexander Jackevičs, were not coming "Golden Score" since the leadership of the Federation, and the development of the judo is following the downward curve.
Jackevich, who consults Kazakhstan's jeans here, and Vsevold Zelion's heirs don't see.
But if they don't grow, they won't.
And that's the prerogative of the Federation.
Therefore, as from another galaxy "Rast Panorama", the President of the Latvian Judo Federation said that Rio would fight medals.
Flight far from reality.
In the evening, we were eager to wait for the beach volleyball match Samoilov/Schūdiņš - Evandru/Pedru Solbergs.
Intriga like in the "death" group - the losers end of the game.
Latvia's duet had a small derogation - could also lose, but with no more than four points in two faces.
The tension was still grown in the long previous game.
No one wanted to die, this feeling turned over the windy card to the length of the match.
Players had additional problems with the wind.
At first, it seemed to be our ally - which is more comprehensive -.
But he didn't.
It was quite easy to play against Latvian duet here.
Serve so much to Samoilov and wait for him to rupture.
Canada was flooded, Cuba was flooded at the end of the first six and at the beginning of the third, because the load was not a joke.
At that time, he was able to fish, because there was little work, but when it was, he did it for glory.
The Brazilian Samoilov and Shmēdiņš could be won in two sessions because first they took control of 16:15, but then they remained on 16 to defy the point limit.
But it was also possible to lose with 0:2, because the second six had a deficit of -4, but also because of the wind, it managed to win.
The third one has already run on the Evandree's service sign.
The chain was created - a service that was unconvinced, the second, often flying too close to the net, and Samoilov remained very few options for a successful attack.
If there was a foreign Samoilov on the cube, then he was more successful this time, and only a loss on Sasai would be unprofessional.
Kreili was also wrong, and quite symbolic that the last ball block tricked him.
Command's gone.
This time there was no success: in the third six alone, two Evangelical attacks nearly flew out of the card, but the ball did affect the line.
Two trips were next to the line.
The video also decided in favour of the opponents.
In the first two games Evandre was wrestling with the services, and it was very productive against ours.
It all went together in a loss on the table.
The causes of the failure must now be examined calmly.
Perhaps we should have lived like many in the vicinity of the stadium, not with the delegation in the Olympic village.
The journey took two and a half hours.
Perhaps a little bit of self - confidence was given by a seven semifinal series.
Maybe you shouldn't have played in Klagenfurt, but come here faster and get better acclimatised.
Perhaps there was a mistake finding the top of the sports form.
So far, more questions than answers.
The games are over for our big boys.
The dream of the medals is over.
What's next?
Some remains of World Cup tournaments and Jurmala Master.
The disgust with Samoilov has never been friends and will not be, because there are too different personalities.
But that is not necessary either.
When the Olympic medals have collapsed, the idea of divorce can also arise, as the fault will be sought not only in itself, but also in a partner.
A divorce is not difficult, but it will be more difficult to find a worthy partner in Latvia.
Both brothers play a kiss, but John and Thomas have already tried and divorced, while Michael Samoilov is still too green to begin conquering the world's peaks.
You can try Harald Regzie, Alexander Solovee, Edgar Toču to return to Martin Pļaviņa, but it won't be better than this option, which not once proved itself in the World Cup stages.
The cocacabane sand didn't make them laugh this time.
That's it.
Of course, it should also be taken into account that beach volleyball is becoming more popular, entering the circulation of new pairs, and only the rare plant is less than two metres.
This does not guarantee success yet, but is an essential argument in the fight against victory.
We don't leave any longer.
Both athletes and journalists have the opportunity to stay in the places offered by gaming operators, as well as to choose their own.
The U.S. basketball team lives on a cruise ship, some tennisists don't stay in the Olympic village.
Also, some beach volleyball players have found a hotel in Copakaba.
This time, for journalists, we were offering quite modest accommodation prices.
Therefore, the choice also fell to the rent of the apartments.
The risk is because sometimes they may be uncomfortable from a logistics point of view.
This time the risk is justified.
Together with Vladimir Vladimirovičs rent apartments on the border of Copkaban and Ipanem.
The beach is 200 meters in half an hour's walk.
The area is quite safe, because the fwell is quite unusual, but you can't lose alertness here either.
Vladimir Vladimirovic is not what some think about, but the most professional sports journalist in Russian media Vladimir Ivanov.
P.S. Looks like another medal dream was dreamed on Friday morning.
At 100 meters on the race and high jumps Laura Ikauniece-Admidiņa left her personal record.
But there are five more disciplines.
After 10 years break "Porgy and Bess" sounds in Liepaja.
In Latvia, opera "Porgijs and Bess" was first introduced in 1973 at the National Opera of Latvia.
Since then, the internationally recognized masterpiece has not been reinstated.
This is why the organizers of the Cesis Art Festival and Liepaja Art Forum have decided to give the audience the opportunity to enjoy the masterpiece of George Gēršvina in close cooperation.
"We are delighted that after ten years of last time, when Liepaja was able to enjoy the opera production, this great version of the opera studio "Porgijs and Bess" by George Gēršvins is pleasing to us in the new, newly discovered concert hall "Lielais dzintars"" says Baiba Bože, the director of the concert hall "Lielais dzintars".
Opera "Porgijs and Besa" is a vivid musical story about love, its volatility, passion, as well as domestic tragedy and simple everyday joys.
It reflects African-American vitality, music and rhythm.
It is this lack of consistency in this opera that makes it so live.
"And yes, this love story is extremely powerful, extremely beautiful and really deep in some way," says director Viesturs Kaiišs.
What I like most - listening to or playing this opera is always such stoppoints - famous melodies, famous motifs, but these transitions from one character to another, enlightening one person or another person, or choirs, or orchestras.
"This is the most exciting, this construction", the opera is appreciated by the music director of opera "Porgijs and Besa" and conductor Andris Poga.
The visitors of the Opera agree that this is a great event.
They are delighted to hear this world’s famous Gēršvina opera.
Happily, you can feel the breath of the world in Liepaja.
"Executing professional", opera is appreciated by visitor Edgars Lamas.
The concert event was special because for the first time in the newly discovered concert hall "Lielais dzintars" the orchestra was played on the bead, and for the first time, the opera concert tour took place.
The site near the Museum of Art could be named after Janis Rozentals.
The vice-president of Riga Andris Ameriks Rozentāls told us that the museum's own address in the future might not be 10a of Krišjānis Valdemāra Street, but Janis Rozentāls Square 1.
Museum director Māra Lāce admitted that re-registration of the address would create a heavy bureaucratic burden, but generally this idea is welcomed and therefore agreed to the proposal of the municipality.
The city of Riga has set a basic stone for this idea in 1936, creating the monument of Burcards Dziņš to Janis Rozentals, which stands at the museum.
Vilhelm Purvitis, the museum director at the time, was one of the initiators for the creation of this monument.
This further action could thus be purely logical.
I'm still a little nervous, but Wilhelm Purvitis, where are we going to make his name?
"But if you, Mr. America, promise to think," Lāce said.
It was said that after extensive reconstruction and modernisation, the National Museum of Art officially opened its doors this May.
This week, VEF will finally start reconstruction of the Culture Palace.
Pili will be renewed by SIA "Velve" for about 11 million euros.
It is planned to renovate several premises of the castle, including two rooms of viewers, as well as the building adapted for people with reduced mobility.
Riga Council intends to attract EU funds to the project in the amount of six million euros, however, Oļegs Burovs, Director of the Property Department of Riga City Council admits that for the time being there is no clarity about European funds for the project.
"Despite the political will to start repair work at the VEF Culture Palace by attracting European Structural Funds, we are waiting for a decision for months, real action by officials from the Ministry of Finance, whether or not money will be allocated," says Burov.
Last December, we were told that everything depends on Brussels.
Two weeks ago, the Ministry of Finance received a letter from the European Commission that you decide yourself that Brussels does not take a decision here.
Now we see that another round of discussions is emerging, then we will see what we can expect in the coming days.
"I would like to say that the Riga City Council without doubt guarantees that this process will be started and completed within the deadlines", said Bourov.
As reported earlier, more than a year ago, in March 2015, VEF Culture Palace collective organized a concert of reconnaissances before the immediate renovation of the building.
Although the year has passed, the renovation of the building was still not started and continued to work collectively under inappropriate conditions.
In the strategy of the Property Department of Riga City Council VEF Renovation of Culture Palace is divided into seemingly independent sets of works of reconstruction, where each will ensure the implementation of different functions of the castle.
First - increasing the accessibility of VEF Culture Palace and improvement of the surrounding territory.
It is intended to arrange the surroundings and engineering communications, as well as to restore the facade of the building.
Second - improvement of VEF Culture Palace service supply.
It plans restoration of interior, walls and ceilings of the building, improvement of stage and sound recording studios, as well as order internal engineering communications of the building.
Third - Improving working conditions of creative amateur collectives, which include plans to improve workshop equipment, space heating and ventilation systems.
Before the 40th anniversary of "Līvu" you can get acquainted with the legendary rock band at the exhibition in Liepaja.
The exhibition will feature various objects that characterise "Līvus" - photographs arranged on the line of time to reflect the group's activities from the beginning until 2010 when it is announced the end of the group's activities.
The participants' stage costumes, musical instruments, awards and concert recordings will also be shown, as well as other things not yet seen for the wider audience that reflected the creative activity of the "Livi" group.
The exhibition will be supplemented with items from Liepaja Museum collection.
Visual presentation of the exhibition was made in collaboration with fashion artist and painter Elita Patmalniece.
Musicians who have been involved in the "Livi" group and their relatives also responded to the call and shared both objects and memories.
The beginnings of "Līvu" can be found in 1972, when a vocally instrumental ensemble, led by Juris Pavyols, is created in Liepaja Culture House.
Ansamblis participated in the festival "Liepājas dzintars" in its original composition in 1972 and 1974, as well as in the views of the city and Republic.
In 1976, there was a fateful meeting when Juris Pabritols met with Eriks Ķigele and the Metalurgs in the Culture Palace, inviting the group to join Ingrids Gūtmanis, Andris Krūzins and Jānis Grodumu.
Over the years, the composition of the group has been felt many times.
Participants have joined, others have gone their way, some have returned.
However, the main thing - the desire to confirm that Latvian rock music is able to live and exist - remains unchanged.
"What to see was not enough - jeans, maidens and bardains, these boys differed significantly from the common stereotype of the singer," the musician Klaass Vāvere says about the band.
The group has been composed of outstanding musicians such as Igo, Vilnis Krieviņš, Modris Šterns, Valdis Štarks, Laimi Rācējs, Tālis Rācēnieks, Ainars Virga, Aivars Brīze, Guntars Mucnieks, Dainis Virga, Tomass Kleins and many others.
Entry to the exhibition is free of charge.
The exhibition is open from August 19 until October 30.
On August 27 at Liepaja concert hall "Pūt, vēvņi" will take place the 40-year anniversary celebration "LIVIfest 2".
For the first time in Bulgaria, inflation is observed over the 8-month period.
In July, Bulgarian national statistics showed 1% of monthly inflation.
This is the highest since 2012 and the first indicator above zero since the October of last year when it was positive (0.2%).
The annual average inflation after PCI in the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous year was -0.8%.
In July 2016, the consumer price index was 101.9% compared with the previous year and the monthly average inflation was 1.0%.
Since the beginning of the year, inflation was -0.2 % in July 2016 compared to December 2015 and annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2 %.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016 there was a price increase for the following categories of consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); entertainment and cultural events (6.3%); hotels and restaurants (1.2%); household goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell for clothing and footwear (2.2%), household appliances, household appliances and regular home care (0.5%); health (0.1%).

Zbigniew Stankevičius: The time is coming, and the truth is rising.
The archbishop of the Catholic Church of Latvia Zigņevs Stankevičius emphasizes in an interview to Independent that if we want to gain strength, it must place the Gospel message at the heart.
For the power of truth is greater than that of evil.
Many are already on their way to the Fescinating Festival of the Virgin Mary in Aglona.
What message will believers receive there this year?
In recent years, Pope Nunny has expressed his desire to lead the main church service in Aglona.
The key message content is therefore his responsibility.
It is also a tradition that the bishop John Bulis is leading the Cross Way.
He himself will make his message.
I conduct the TV service the previous day.
Last year I turned to Pope Francisco's encyclic Laaudato sis and updated the common house in it, the Earth theme in the context of Latvia.
This year... of course, I've been watching what's going on in the world and I'm trying to respond to it in my speech.
My approach coincides with the church’s recommendation that the Gospel message be placed in the center of life.
It must be shown that the Gospel responds to the most painful problems of human life and gives him inspiration for a further journey.
Then it speaks people.
But in the Lampa discussion, you said, "you should come back to understanding the perfect man."
What do you understand?
Does this mean that a person is turning away from the church message?
And does the church have such a return resource today?
The Indian capital is surrounded by a man dying from the side of the way.
In the capital of India, no one knew about a man dying from the road - it turns out that he lays down an hour on the road and then robbed, informs the BBC.
A man identified as Matibal has been reported to drive a crick in one day and worked as a guard in the night.
You went home at 5:30 a.m. when he was hit by a light car.
The surveillance camera record shows that the driver got out of the car to look at the victim and then left.
In an hour, when no one knew about a bleeding man, he was robbed by a garrison.
Around 90 minutes after the crash, the police arrived and the victim was brought to the hospital where he died of injuries.
Inga Koļegova, the Head of the State Environment Service, rescued the government from falling, considers Ojārs Skudra, Associate Professor of the Faculty of Social Sciences of the University of Latvia, to refer to her candidacy for the post of Director General of the State Revenue Service (VID).
An explanation by Kosovo of the withdrawal of the candidacy in the conflict-management coalition is that she has prevented the fall of the government.
In a conversation with the agency LETA, Scuta said that it was hard for him to imagine that, at the meeting of the government next week, "Unity" would support the candidacy of Koļegov.
Thus, if the Ministers of Unity voted against, but Koļegov was still approved in office, it would lead to a government demission.
The expert also considers that prior to notification of withdrawal of the nomination, Koleegova has consulted both Minister of Finance Dana Reiznieks-Ozolas and Prime Minister Māri Kčinski.
At the same time, it is also a concessions to Unity, which strongly opposed her candidacy.
When predicting whether it will be possible to find a suitable candidate by means of a tender, Skudra admitted that there are two options: either a compromise figure will be selected, or the institution as the executive director-general will continue to lead Dace Grey.
At the same time, he points out that, if the Minister of Finance claimed so far that another candidacy was not considered, it was a hint for Grey, that she could not participate in the competition.
LETA has already stated that Koļegova, the Head of the State Environment Service, has decided to withdraw his application for the Director-General of the SRS.
Due to the opposition by the Unity, the government postponed on Tuesday a week the approval of Koļegov for the post of Director-General of the SRS.
Following a government decision to postpone the decision to set aside Koleegova, it was still ready to become a leader of the SRS.
Later, however, she changed her mind - in her presentation on Friday to Minister of Finance, Dana Reizniece-Ozola, she pointed out that she had withdrawn her consent to transfer to the Head of the SRS and that she was not an easy choice.
The press secretary of Prime Minister Māra Kučinska Andrejs Vaivars has explained to the agency LETA that a new competition will be held for the vacant post of Director General of the SRS.
In the center of Riga there was an accident involving a police car.
In the center of Riga, this afternoon there was an accident involving a national police car.
The police car, with sound and light signals on, hastened to the highest category of call until Krišjānis Baronas and Dzirnavu have hit another car at the intersection.
The police explain the circumstances, but initial information indicates that the other force has not missed the police car.
A woman was hit by an accident.
This year the number of inhabitants in Riga has decreased
At the beginning of this year there were 638 784 inhabitants in Riga, which is 0.34% less than in 2015, when 641 000 inhabitants were officially registered in the capital, the agency LETA was informed by the Central Statistical Office (CSP).
In terms of population, the capital of Latvia ranks 30th place between the capitals of the European Union (EU) and large cities with a population above one million.
According to Eurostat data, the share of women in Riga is highest: the capital of Latvia is convincing in the first place among the largest European cities with 127 women per 100 men.
All three capitals of the Baltic States have the highest proportion of women in the largest cities of Europe: 123 in Vilnius and 121 in Tallinn per 100 men.
Warning pictograms shall be placed at the LNMM.
In the coming days, warning signs - pictograms will be placed next to the Latvian National Museum of Art (LNMM), the representative of the Property Department of Riga City Council told LETA.
Today, the museum has successfully finished repair of the damage to the high-speed glass caused by skateboards.
Warning pictograms will be displayed in the coming days.
Its citizens will be told that the cover is tending to be slippery during rain and snow, it must not be allowed to move around by cars, as well as to visit bicycles, roller slides and rollers.
Usackov also wrote about the above-mentioned social network of Facebook, who pointed out that no safety hazard was caused by damage, but that "no one looks," and the skateboarders "will come out."
Celebrations for children and parents – new children's playgrounds are installed in Riga.
In this summer season, Riga Municipality has installed two more playgrounds in the city, Kipsala and Chiekurkalns, which are already available for children.
On the beach of Kipsala there is a large, multifunctional toy ship with various climbing elements, bridges, games, rubs and slides.
Playground is intended for children of all ages.
The field also includes swings and various elements of balancing.
The fantasy world is full of attractions for small sailors on the banks of the Daugava River with a view to the passenger port and the cruise ships there.
In turn, a playground, a trampoline, a stepway, a balance bridge, swing, a toy bomb and other elements of the game, as well as a exercise area with rings for force and coordination exercises, co-ups and other sports elements, are built in the playground between Čiekurkalns.
The rubber covered under the floor is covered in different colours.
A new coloured pavement is applied to the playground from the street.
The reconstructed section of the road has been discovered in trees.
Minister of Transport Uldis Augulis, management of SJSC Latvian State Roads (LVC), as well as representatives of local governments "Biders" Ltd. today opened the border of the reconstructed state main road Russia (Grebņeva) - Rēzekne-Daugavpils-Lietuva border (Medumi) (A13) from Medumi to Lithuania border (156.4-163.km).
Roads are a state visit card, especially border roads, so special satisfaction is to discover a reconstructed section on the border with our southern neighbours.
This is another example of the fact that, thanks to the co-financing of European Union funds, the situation on the main national roads is improving.
"As the forecasts show, during this planning period the available funds for roads will be realised already in 2018, and we need to think about continuing the most burdened roads in very good quality, as well as ensuring the mobility of citizens in all regions of Latvia without European Union funding," said Uldis Augulis.
The Minister of Transport also indicated that proposals prepared by traffic experts on sustainable financing of Latvian roads will be presented to the government in the near future.
In the construction phase from Medumi to Lithuania border (156.4-163,05.km) SIA Biders started last year and this year they continued after the technological break.
The costs of reconstruction are EUR 13.5 million (including VAT), co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
"The reconstruction of the road is complete and repairs will start next year from Medem to Daugavpils itself, therefore the entire road from the Lithuanian border to Daugavpils will be arranged", informed Jānis Lange, Chairman of the Board of LVC.
The country's main roads are the most burdened, and by 2018, we plan to make all major roads in the country in good condition.
The next task will be to maintain them in good quality, to ensure periodic maintenance and to replace the asphalt surface every 7-9 years.
"It will, of course, require adequate funding, and all travelers will look forward to the proposals developed by the expert group to arrange a road financing system," noted Lange.
Within the framework of the project, road connections and lighting are arranged in the center of the Wooden Woods.
Significant land works have been carried out: in four stages large recitations and large-scale rocking and dulling works have been carried out, smoothed the longitudinal profile of the road, which has so far been very uneven.
Public transport stops have also been renewed and the public transport area has been newly constructed.
In the past, the road had insufficient load capacity and the terrain was not transparent due to hilly valleys, as well as the old road to the common terrain.
In the following construction season, it is planned to renovate the road section from the border of Daugavpils to the now reconstructed section (144,80-156,40 km).
This year, LVC plans to carry out various kinds of works in more than 1100 kilometres of state road.
Information about all the repairs planned on the national road network is available on the LVC website www.lvceli.lv.
"To achieve the desired weight reduction results, it is very important to make the right choice of food combinations", admits Lithuanian dietologist Laura Romeraite-Kukliekeriene.
In addition, it can easily be accomplished during the summer season when fresh fruits, berries, and vegetables grow in our own gardens.
A thoughtful combination of dietary products can help not only to reduce excess weight, but also to contribute purposefully to various body processes.
Macaroni and vinegar are a successful combination because they provide a lasting feeling of sata and help fight with fat.
Studies published in the European Journal on Clinical Nutrition have shown that the vinegar has a beneficial effect on blood glucose levels and helps us to feel mundrs.
The cayenne pepper and protein-rich food, such as poultry or protein cocktail, not only creates a feeling of sata, but also reduces the legs after high meals in the next meal.
This combination of foods can also increase the amount of calories burned after a meal by up to 35%.
Research shows that cayenne pepper can help to get rid of fat in the abdomen.
Eggs contain a metabolic enhancer, a choline, and the pepper is a good source of vitamin C.
By taking sufficient amount of this nutrient, the levels of cortisol can be reduced, hence the accumulation of fat around the mid-body.
Oat flake foam, with fresh berries added, is another delicious and fat - engulfing meal for breakfast, which is worth including in your menu.
Oat flakes and berries contain fibers that, according to Canadian scientists, control the sensation of gel - a appetite stimulating hormone - and thus hunger.
In addition, berries contain polyphenols, which are aids in weight reduction, and also prevent fat formation.
Vegetables and proteins are also able to perform miracles in weight reduction.
Such a combination can create a sense of being.
Vegetables contain water and fiber, so they contribute to the sense of sata.
At the same time, the proteins slow down the digestive process and give a sense of taste for a longer time.
You can eat chicken with salads for lunch or cook a protein cocktail from the finished mixture and enjoy it along with your favorite vegetables.
Some combinations of products are avoided.
In the fruit there are sugars - monosaccharides or disaccharides - one or two molecular compounds.
On the contrary, the starch in the vegetables is a polysaccharide.
The fruit is broken down in the stomach mechanically, while the chemical is not broken down until it reaches a third or fourth degree in the gut.
The starch is divided into three different stages, beginning already in the mouth.
It is therefore essential that you do not eat the sweet food immediately after a meal.
To eat the sweet food immediately after a meal, it is “locked” in the stomach together with other dishes where it is not chemically digested and begins to blow.
Do not eat bread, potatoes, peas, bananas, dates or other carbohydrate products together with lemons, limes, oranges, grapefruits, pineapples or other acidic fruits.
The enzyme ptialine contained in saliva only works in an alkaline environment.
Fruit acids not only inhibit carbohydrate digestion but also contribute to its fermentation.
Do not eat eggs and meat, nuts and meat, cheese and eggs or cheese and nuts, meat and milk, eggs and milk or nuts and milk and similar protein-rich combinations in one meal.
Their processing requires various digestive juices, each with different strengths, characteristics, and the time to arrive in the stomach.
Watermelons, honeysmelone, muskmelone and other melons must always be eaten separately from other dishes.
Melons are not digested when they are in the stomach together with other foods.
Fat in combination with protein rich products.
Fat makes a successful combination with starch, but the same thing cannot be said of fats and proteins - fat prevents protein digestation.
Proteins can be combined with a very small amount of fat.
If a large amount of protein-containing products is consumed, avoid fat use.
This also applies to freshing - it is not recommended to combine large amounts of nuts (containing proteins) with a whole avocado (containing fats).
This combination prevents effective weight reduction.
How better to prepare?
"The preparation of food, heat treatment results in a significant loss of nutrients - about 15% to 55% of the initial nutrient composition of the products", says the dietologist.
In most cases nutrients go to a loss by cooking foods in water.
However, the nutritional value of some foods increases with direct cooking.
After cooking vegetables, the remaining liquid is recommended for soup preparation - in this case you will not lose the nutrients remaining in water and you will be able to eat them later.
It is recommended that vegetables are prepared, including by evaporation.
Thermal treatment significantly increases the bioavailability of lycopene in tomatoes.
The level of lycopene is increased by 25% when tomatoes are consumed for 30 minutes.
The thermal treatment also significantly increases the bioavailability of betacarotene found in red, yellow, orange plants such as tomatoes, carrots, sweet potatoes and spawn.
The thermal treatment of eggs and meat removes the natural characteristics of its proteins, making them more digestable.
The thermal treatment of meat and eggs also makes iron and other minerals contained in these products easier to absorb in the body.
It should also be borne in mind that the freezing of products can reduce vitamin C content from 10% to up to 90%, whereas fibre freezing does not affect.
Beans in combination with tomatoes may increase the uptake of iron in the body, which in turn leads to better brain and muscle function.
Our body hosts up to 33% less non-blooding iron found in plant products such as beans, leaf greens, cereal products than bloody iron found in animal products such as beef, fish and chicken.
You may significantly increase the absorption of non-blooding iron in the body by taking products containing non-blooding iron with sources of vitamin C, such as oranges, tomatoes and berries.
Vitamin C helps to change non-blooding iron so that our body absorbs it more easily.
Iron is needed for the production of haemoglobin, which ensures oxygen supply to the muscles and brain.
To derive maximum benefit from salads, add healthy fat, such as olive oil or linseed oil.
When preparing the sandwich bag, add the vitamin D rich salmon or sardine-free yogurt, which is a good source of calcium.
Vitamin D increases the amount of calcium absorbed into the gut and plays an important role in bone formation.
Oats (as well as other full grain products) together with sources of vitamin C such as strawberries, broths, raspberries, raspberries and other fruits or berries, help to stabilise cholesterol levels and avoid arterial obstruction.
Snapchat Anime criticises the effects of Asian caring
Snapchat's representatives say that this filter has been inspired by animation, but some commentators claim it is racistally insensitive.
With this lens effect, Snapchat allows 150 million users to change reality every day in a completely absurd way and play with their identity.
You can turn yourself into an pineapple, dog, or image that would fit in the painting of Roja Lihshtenstein.
Lens are vague imaging distorting instruments that generate more than 30 million modified selfy per day.
Any error quickly becomes public.
The effects of Snapchat lens have been criticised in the past, claiming that the application promotes too black people or light facial tones as a benchmark of ideal beauty.
This week, the new lens effects were published, allowing users to create gingerry eyes, gingerbly teeth and round cheeks, and some critics described it as a racist Asian cartoon – the "yellow face".
The question was also asked whether such contradictions do not indicate that the company has more diversity problems.
News and public negativity broke out on Wednesday, when the publications "The Verge" and "Moterboard" told that lens effects have been removed from application.
The company explained that the object of the lens was to depict the images of Anime rather than to frame people of Asian origin.
However, these effects reminded those who had experienced racism of the painful stereotypes.
Others strongly denied the similarity with Anime.
The Twitter record of the American art student Grace Sparapani, from Korea, received a lot of resonance. In her e-mail she points out that lens effects were "abject and uncomfortable not to say more."
She added that it was difficult to see the obvious similarity between Asian cartoons and lens effects.
This indicates that the lens effect is not simply a yellow face, but a yellow face in the sense of racism.
Snapchat is not the only company that has fallen into these cultural traps.
American culture is also involved in the endless fight against diversity and inclusion, ranging from business meetings to Hollywood and devices that we use in our daily lives.
And Snapchat's great youth audience, which represents different races, unlike older people, is more sensitive to such things.
If Snapchat lenses create an image that offends users, "We don't notice such things today," Katie Jou, 25 years old, said in a Thursday interview.
On Thursday, the company "Medium" product manager Jou deleted his Snapchat application and advised others to do the same.
In her article Medium and her telephone interview, she explained that she felt that racial problems were caused by Snapchat’s employment policy, which did not sufficiently support racial diversity.
Jou criticised the management of the company, which consists mainly of white men and then concluded its article with reference #DeleteSnapchat.
"This means that the company does not have a variety of races, so such decisions are allowed. Whether the company is composed of some other racial representatives, but they do not take on a position to express their views safely and comfortably," says American Jou, an American woman from China.
Others agree with her view, while Snapchat did not respond to her complaint.
The company does not disclose how many employees are represented by different races, stating that it is a private company.
Snapchat refused to discuss the origin of its employees, but its representative found that the company had hired a staff specialist who would focus on representing also racial minorities, which were not widely represented and which would facilitate their inclusion in the company.
On the other hand, I won't renew my Snapchat account, adding: "I wonder if they really need more users like us to understand that it's not right."
The Congress Chamber declares that the reports on the Islamic State had been distorted by military officials.
In a statement issued on Thursday, the Assembly Chamber noted that the U.S. Central Command had broken down the reports depicting the war against the Islamic country in Iraq and Syria far more optimistic than is actually the case.
The analysts of the Central Command Intelligence are generally dissatisfied with the provisional report of the Task Force set up by representatives of the Armed Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Defence Financing Sub-Committee of the Republic of the Republic of Lithuania, stating that their leadership controlled reports on American progress in the fight against the Islamic State.
The Central Command, known as Centcom, is a military base in Tampere, Florida, which oversees US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The latest news of this report shows that intelligence reports, endorsed by senior Centcom leaders, reflect the US's fight against terrorism better than is actually the case. Facts were regularly distorted by better results than other intelligence analyses.
Ken Calvert, a representative of the Republic of California, says: "Centcom's actions are unacceptable: our soldiers are those who suffer when our policy makers receive false reports."
The management errors of Centcom shall be sought under the senior management of the organisation.
This 10-page long report reflects in detail the existing problems in the reflection and analysis of the efforts of the Central Command to prepare for Iraq in 2014 and 2015.
Although this does not provide conclusive evidence that senior officials of Obama’s administration were forced to distort the reports, it shows that the leadership of Centcom has put some pressure on analysts to show a more optimistic view of the threats posed by the Islamic State (also known as ISIS or ISIL).
The report indicates that in the first half of 2015 the Central Manager's press releases, statements and reports to Congress showed the situation in a much more positive light than it was actually.
In addition, Centcom's representatives publicly stated that the recovery operation in Mosula could start already in April or May 2015.
Mosula is the second largest city in Iraq, still under the control of the Islamic State.
In his report, the representative of the Republic of Kansas Group, Mike Pompeo, says: "A investigation of more months clearly confirms this."
As of mid-2014, until mid-2015, key officials of the U.S. central government distorted the reports depicting the threat of ISIS in Iraq that was weaker than they were actually.
A working party in the Republican Republic was formed to find out that analysts were concerned that information about the Islamic country was broken.
As the investigation continues, the report published on Thursday will follow new findings in this case.
The General Inspection of the Ministry of Defence carries out investigations into the activities of the Centcom Intelligence.
On Thursday, the members of the Democrat Party of the intelligence management committee made their own report, in which they agreed with some of the conclusions of the Working Party Group of the Republican Party.
In his report, the Democrat Representative, Adams B. Šiffs, said that between 2014 and 2015, Centcom too limited the preparation of intelligence assessment reports in relation to ISIS and Iraqi Security Forces.
Mr Sifo explains that this process was "stopping the dissemination of information", made the ethics of analysts worse and "distributed the facts that were not correct."
But Siff and the members of the Democratic Party added that there is no evidence that the White House has put pressure on Centcom analysts to draw up reports in line with the ' pre-defined or political stance'.
The Daily Beast published the preliminary results of the convention inquiry on Thursday.
In August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon General Inspectorate initiated an investigation following complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lieutenant Lieutenant-General Patrick Evans said that the Pentagon would not comment on the convention report until the investigation continued.
He also added that experts sometimes interpret complex data differently, and the Ministry of Defence and the Intelligence Authority call for a constructive dialogue on vital national security issues.
The investigation is not limited to the question of whether the American bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is successful (a statement by more and more representatives of the Ministry of Defence).
But last year's accusations cast doubt on whether President Obama can fully rely on reports by the Central Authority on military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and other hot points.
The criticism of Islamic intelligence reminds us of more than ten years ago when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hūkers published a study stating that George W. Bush's administration started the Afghan war with too little thinking about its possible consequences.
Hūker also played an important role in the opening of the Islamic State's intelligence issue.
Last year, official representatives reported that the Hūmer team discovered that, contrary to public reports, air flights to the Islamic National Oil Works had not significantly undermined the financial situation of the terrorist group, as they had built temporary plants to sell oil on the black market.
The Times of September reported that this discovery was not outside the borders of the central government.
At the time, General Loid Ostin III of Centcom received sharp criticism, as many lawmakers believed that war reports described the situation too positively.
In April, General Austin retired and became his seat General Joseph Votell.
In the U.S. due to Britain the women's field in Hockey wins in the U.S., thus getting the fourth win in a row.
The day after the victory over Japan with the result of 6:1, on Thursday, Katie Bama got the first two gates for the U.S. women's field hockey team, when the Americans won the Indian team with the result 3:0.
Five gate gains in two games are an unforgettable achievement, but 27 - year - old Bama said that she could not remember if it was ever successful.
She said, "I have no idea."
I am not the number of people who count their gates.
But she knows that the American score in the Olympics is 4:0, which gives them an unsorted Great Britain, which, on Thursday after winning Japan with a result of 2:0, remained unwinned.
The United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday to play the last match in the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for a quarter of the finals and the game will only determine which team will take the first place in the group of six teams and which second.
The first prize winner will avoid a meeting with the strong Dutch sample, which is the second group leader.
In spite of this, American girls have already called a surprise storm four years ago to take the last place in London between 12 teams.
There was also Bama in that team
She grew up in Blūbel, a field hockey for the first time took her hands at the age of 3 (his older twin sisters were already involved in this type of sport in Dressel) and joined the national team when she was 16 years old, becoming the newest player in the history of the sample.
She wasn't on the 2008 Olympics because she didn't get to the final.
But 2012 was a failure for her and her team.
The following year Englishman Kregs Parham was appointed as a trainer, and everything changed to the right.
Bama called it "cultural, mental and physical changes."
In London, we did not invest as much work as we did now.
We have changed everything.
On Thursday's game Bama revealed the result by getting the gates during the first half-time with the back wire from the close distance.
India started the game without winning its account, but their selection was very strong and held a minimal result of 0:1 until the end of the third period, when Bama repeatedly caught the gates.
She entered the ball in the anti-manic zone around the left side of the square, then noticed to be on the middle side of the square and broadcast the ball in the anti-man gate, putting the Americans at 2:0 direction.
In the middle of the fourth period, Melissa Gonzales received another gate.
This was the first U.S. gatekeeper Jackie Briga dry game, putting one gate into each of the first three games.
She's scratched.
And also Bama.
"We're going very well right now," Paham said, "but how good it is, will show you the game Saturday.
The most depressive meal in the depression period is "Saint Food"
In March 1933, just after being elected president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in the oval room to hold the meal.
President Roosevelt enjoyed fine culinary delicacies, such as a goose liver paste, or a fuagra, and a soup of Merilland turtles.
On that day, however, his meal was much more modest: full of eggs in tomato sauces, potato puree, and dessert - a plum bottle.
Jane Ziegelmane says: "It's a way to show solidarity in the preparation of food with people who had found themselves very hard."
Her husband, Andrew Kou, adds: "This is also a message for Americans, as they should eat."
The couple from the Brooklyn Heights district are food historians.
The last book of the Kou "Golden Slugs" describes the Chinese cuisine in America, but Ziegelman in her book "97 Abels" describes life through food rental in Manhattan East.
Their new joint work, "Saint Food," published on Tuesday by the publishing house Harper, is the story of American food during the Great Depression.
In expressing a certain degree of solidarity in the culinary, they held a meal together by the reporters "Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop", a simple lunch meal located in the region of Flatyron, operating since 1929, when major depression began.
Mrs. Ziegelmane, aged 54, ordered a sandwich with processed cheese and olives, while Kou, aged 57, ordered turkey, potato puree and vegetable salads.
When the reporter ordered the fake thief, the couple admitted that his choice was very appropriate to the conversation about the meal of the Great Depression .
Mrs. Ziegelmane said that the counterfeit thief was very popular.
There was peanut, liver, and beans.
They were prepared from the basic ingredients and other ingredients that enriched the meal.
Imagine what it is to eat so many peanuts, so that they are at noon.
Mr. Kou got away.
"It seemed safe that the belly was full of lead," he added.
During the predepression years, the American lunch table resembled the Swedish table, especially in rural areas.
Women prepared to eat to their husbands and breakfast, lunch and dinner were served freshly prepared dishes.
During World War I, the Americans directly sent food to Europeans. The "Saint Food" describes how the Americans adapted to the circumstances when America was suddenly no longer a land of abundance.
"At the time, food became the main focus of the American people on everyday life," says Mr. Cou, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about this topic.
Just as important were the new budgetary diets: unknown dishes such as counterfeit hares and stews became everyday, the spawns were "a great way to use surpluses," said Mrs. Siegelmane, because the chefs could hide the unattractive ingredients under creamy sauces.
The fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruit.
Meat, which for years had been the main ingredient of American meals, has now become an extremely rare product.
At a time when the number of calories and the nutritional value of food were more important than the taste, new, still invisible formations were born.
In an ancient poem, Mrs. Ziegelmane found a recipe for the preparation of bulbs filled with peanut butter.
Mr Kou adds: "It was not a popular supplement to the dinner table."
Mrs Ziegelmane stresses: 'It was surreal'.
Groundnut butter and brew onions are incompatible.
Many home food recipes applied to difficult times.
Domestic economists such as Louis Stanley, the head of the Federal Office for the Household Economy from 1923 to 1943, defined state eating habits that had not been experienced either before or after the Great Depression.
When publishing articles and recipes in newspapers and magazines, they suggested that householders become "economics" and accept challenges such as turning pasta and carrot mix into a delicious meal.
"Saint Maltīte" is a feast of historical delicacies.
It is particularly interesting to bear witness to the Government's attitude towards its hungry citizens, for example, President Herbert Huver's "allow me to eat cake".
Although he publicly talked about his simple childhood and eating in Aiova, he was actually eating as a fine millionaire about whom he had become.
Mr. Cou says: "He liked European cuisine, such as fish with cucumber sauce."
He ate in an almost yellow guest room, wearing a lunch jacket.
He was completely alienated from reality.
President Roosevelt would have made the same mistake unless his wife, Eleonor, had recommended that he set an example with his eating habits.
The book tells us that Roosevelt has replaced a householder who did not teach us how to cook, so the White House became a place "where not only one of the most inexpensive dishes in Washington was served, but also the worst dishes".
Once the state’s economy recovers, most of the culinary writings of the depression era disappeared.
But we continue to pay attention to the calories and nutrition, as well as to the way science is used in cooking, Mrs Siegelmane added.
The couple say that when they wrote the book, they got a greater understanding of the eating habits of Mrs. Ziegelmane’s mother, such as why she could not throw away her food.
"She was really afraid to throw out the food," said Mr. Cou.
Mrs. Ziegelmane said: "She actually injured people."
On one occasion, there was an incident with the windcrites.
After we had served at the Eisenbergs, a couple of writers pulled out a dessert made from a bag at home: a plum bottle that President Roosevelt used to eat on lunch.
"It is a plum cream," said Mrs Ziegelmane, adding that at that time there was a widespread habit of giving a chic name to modest dishes.
It does not contain foam, only dried plums, slightly flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone immersed in the brown mass of the spoon on the plate.
Surprisingly, that was not so bad.
Mr. Cou was eating some more colossals.
Listening to an experienced "economicist", he said to his wife: "Breed slice of crushed hazelnuts."
Gilead will receive a refund for legal expenses in the fight against Merck for Hepatitis C patent
The judge of the district has decided that "Gilead Sciences Inc." has the right to obtain reimbursement of the costs of the legal services it has paid in the case of the termination of the Hepatite C patent against the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc."
In June, Gilead was entitled to a fine of 200 million pounds for the destruction of two Merck’s patents, which threatened it in connection with the successful Sovaldi and Harvoni tablets, when the US federal judge found violations in Merk’s activities, such as lying after swearing and other unethical acts.
On Thursday, U.S. district judge Bets Labsons Fryman pointed out that Gilead was entitled to claim compensation for the legal expenses incurred in defending it.
Merck is trying to gain market position against Gilead, which dominates the market with the new generation of hepatitis C medicines, which is effective in 90% of cases of liver disease.
The case was started already in 2013, when Gilead and Merck appealed to each other to obtain ownership of the newly developed active ingredients sofosbuvir, which is the main ingredient of Gilead medicine.
The U.S.-supported forces claim that they have completely taken over control of the city of Manbidja from the Islamic State.
Under his control, the U.S.-supported forces have completely taken over Manbiga's northern part of the country at the Turkish border and the last Islamic State soldiers have abandoned the city, announced on Friday the group representative.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDS) are currently cleaning up the city from the last opponents' fighters who have not left the city yet.
They've released more than 2,000 hostage-to-civils who had been captured by the fighters, Reuters told the news agency Sharfan Darvishs of the Manbiga Military Council associated with the SDS.
"The city is now under our full control and we are searching for fighters," he informed Reuters Agency.
Clinton's income reached 10.75 million dollars in 2015, and a couple paid the federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
Hilaria Klinton published the 2015 tax return, which shows that the candidate for the office of President of the Democratic Party and her husband earned 10,75 million dollars this year and paid the federal tax rate of 34,2 percent respectively.
During 2015, Clinton contributed 1 million US dollars, mainly to its charity organization in Clinton. Former President Bill Clinton earned some 5.3 million dollars in performance as a speaker and former Secretary of State earned 3 million dollars of income from his book on work in the State Department, which was published in collaboration with "Simon & Schuster".
The ally of the Clinton elections - US Virginia State Senator Tim Kein and his wife, Anna Holton, have published their tax return for the past 10 years.
In 2015, they paid the federal tax rate of 20,3 per cent.
"Hilary Klinton and Tim Kein continue to set new standards of financial transparency", said Jenifera Palmieri, partner of the Clinton campaign.
On the other hand, Donald Trump is hiding under various pretexts and excuses so that promises to disclose his tax information do not have to be fulfilled.
The publication of tax information paid is a record for the US presidential candidates, but it is not demanded by law.
New York Business Tramps and his lawyers refer to the audit of the State Revenue Service as a reason not to disclose tax information.
"Your move", in your Twitter record, the tax information of the Democrat Party candidate was reported by Clinton’s campaign partner Ian Sams.
On Thursday, Trampa’s special advisor, Michael Kohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish tax information before the audits were completed.
Trampe critics, including Mits Romny and other Republican candidate for the office of President of the Republic 2012 claim that his refusal raises questions about the extent of his real estate, the amounts of donations and other business obligations, including commitments with Russia.
Clinton put oil on fire, publishing a video on Friday, where several influential Republicans request Trump to publish his tax information.
She returned to this issue again during her economic talk in Michigan on Thursday.
She announced to the crowd: "He refuses to do what the other presidential candidates have done for decades."
Politico says that during the 1990s, Trump has paid very little or no tax for two years and, on Friday, the author of New York Times business column said that many accountants and lawyers believe that nothing has changed today.
Federal tax rates are an important issue in these presidential elections.
The idea that everyone earns more than $1 million a year is to pay a tax of at least 30% is promoted by the billionaire Varena Baffet's proposal.
This proposal is also supported by President Barack Obama.
Last week, during Klinton's speech in Omaha, Nebraska, where his "Berkshire Hathaway" conglomerate is also located, Baffet called for Trampe to exchange tax returns.
Baffet said that he was also audited by the Revenue Service and that Trump was afraid of voters, not tax authorities.
The Klintone campaign has published tax information by 2007.
Klintoni now lives in Chaakava, New York and has paid an average federal tax rate of around 32 per cent between 2007 and 2014 and a total tax rate of about 40.5 per cent.
The 2015 Clinton Tax Report shows that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income is wage.
Their main investment was the Low Cost Index Fund, from which Clintons received $109,000 in dividends.
The report was prepared by Kevin Dravbaugh, editor John Otis
Jewish film director criticises in Berlin about excluding Israel's long-range code at the request of a Arab director - RT News
The Jewish French director of the film broke up a storm in the social media when he discovered that the Israeli long-range conversation code was not available at Campinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin.
Claude Lancman, director of documentary films about the Holocaust "Shoah", concealed his disappointment with the Berlin Kempinski Bristol hotel and addressed an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his recent visit, Lancman tried to find an Israeli long-distance code on the hotel's list.
However, this country was not included in the list with countries to which you can call directly from the hotel number.
How is it possible that Israel was wiped out and destroyed in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany?
It's Lancman.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers to call this country through its call centre.
The director requested an explanation from the hotel staff.
Lancman writes that the answer "they have shocked".
The hotel administrator explained that "it was an informed decision of hotel management".
The reason for removing the code was even more outrageous to the film director.
"The vast majority of the guests are Arabs and they asked for the Israeli code to be cleared," Lancman quotes the explanation of the hotel employee.
Suddeutsche Zeitung states that the Israeli ambassador to Germany Jakov Hadas-Handelsman has called this case a "great shame".
We are surprised and shocked at this incident.
This in itself is a great shame.
And the fact that this is exactly what has happened in Germany is that it is in this network of hotels that it is even more humiliating.
No clarification is required.
The official said: "We hope that the hotel will draw the right conclusions".
This event was also very resonated on the Internet, where people called it a scandal.
Others believe that Kempinski was simply used by Arab clients.
Another entry was said to be "fear", indicating that the hotel is located on the Kurfurstendamamm street next to the synagogue.
The publication Der Spiegel says that the hotel itself quickly rejected all the accusations, stating that it is all a "understood" and apologies to Lancman.
"We have not received a direct order to remove Israel from the list of country numbers," Suddeutsche Zeitung quotes Kempinski's representative.
And adds that the code was once again added to the list.
The police use rubber bullets and tear gas against protesting Brazilian students.
On Thursday, a meeting took place between students and police in the city of São Paulo in Brazil, where the students gathered for demonstration against the reforms of the government's education system.
The police used rubber bullets and tear gas against students.
The problems began when the law enforcement tried to expel students, which resulted in police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstration to show their dislike for the reforms of the education system.
The proposal by the Governor of São Paulo, Geraldo Alckmin, is intended to close almost 100 public schools, while 300 000 students will be transferred to other schools in order to save their funds.
Some demonstrators drew graphs on the walls with messages against the interim president Michael Temer.
This protest took place only a few days after the previous protest, when the students gathered in demonstrations with the aim of expressing their support for the suspended President Dilma Rousephas, whose empire was voted by the Senate.
Scott Kelums Skiners finish first, bringing the United Kingdom gold medals in cycling
Kelums Skiner from Scotland finished the first men's cycling team in the sprint race at Rio cycling last night. The British team guarded its champion title, which it won in the 2012 London Games.
The 23-year-old sportsman from Glasgow played an important role in these competitions, making the proud legendary Scout of Sir Chris Hoja and placing the victory on the favored New Zealand.
Four years ago, Britain won an amazing victory when Hoi won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated it at the World Championship in London, although Hoy had already finished his career.
The problems were in the between Beijing and London Olympics because of the replacement of an experienced start specialist, Jamie Stafu.
They did it at the last minute.
When Hoy left, he tried to fill Kian Emmadi and Matt Krampton.
British coaches put their hope on Skiner to see the potential he later demonstrated.
Quinde, Keny - champions who started together with Hoja and Skiner four years ago, who installed the Olympic qualification record, but the race was better for New Zealand team.
However, the British trio received gold medals.
Kindée, who had been in contact with her, took the lead, and Skiner guarded her.
The change of strategy played an important role in the victory, as Quindes drove with a larger gear to allow Kenya and, in particular, Skiner to drive faster.
Hode’s race was watched as a representative of the BBC and caught sights of Skiner, Kenya and Hindez when they climbed to the honorary podium.
The 23-year-old glassroom said, "It was an unfavorable honour."
I am doing my best to defend my name.
At the final we set the Olympic record and won the World champions.
It was just incredible.
No better win.
After winning with Kenya and Hyo in the 2012 Olympic Games in London, Hindes confessed that they deliberately fell down to the track after the failure.
He later rebutted this comment and did not have the strength to prove the contrary to the British competitors.
This time, though, there was no incident.
He said: "British flags in the tribes referred to London."
Over the last 3 months, we have become a united team.
We've lost so many World Championships, so the victorious games really were special.
One part of the race will be for a country that won seven out of ten gold medals for cycling in Beijing and London.
If this achievement is the team's progress over the last five months, then the next five days will be very exciting.
In view of the Kenyan outcome, he could indeed repeat the success of Hoja, obtaining three Olympic gold medals.
In addition, Kenny was born on March 23th. It seems to be the holy date of the British, because Steve Regreiv, Mo Farah, and Roger Banister were born this day.
Hoy was also born on that date.
The next race in Kenya is the sprint, which starts today and will continue for the next three days.
The 28-year-old athletes from Bolton said, "Now I'm just just enjoying it.
A team ride is always the best.
Because then you can win with teammates.
If fair, win one is a little lonely."
He said, "If he gets two more gold medals, he should put a round of armor."
On that day, it was the only fight against medals, but it was not the only good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Viggins, Ed Clensey, Steve Burke and Oveins Doul showed the fastest qualification time for four-kilometres.
Their time was 3:51.943
The world record, installed in London in 2012, is 3:51.659.
The first round and the final will take place today in the second half of the day, where Vigins will certainly be at the heart of attention.
Yesterday before his qualification trip, he had disagreement with the Commissioner when the judges called him to measure his height.
On a women's trip, which will continue and end today, Laura Trota, Joanna Rovsela Shand, Elinor Barker and Katija Archibald installed a new record time in Milan 4:13.260.
The British delegation hopes that the British cycling team will win medals in the middle stage of the Olympic Games.
Recalling the outstanding and unprecedented performance in Beijing and London, everyone expects the same achievements as Rio.
Meanwhile, there have been a variety of acts behind the scenes, following accusations of sexuality and respect, resignations by the technical director Šein Saton, and Hojs and Victoria Bendletton also end their career.
But starting the first cycling race, it seems that Britain will, as always, reach its highest level in the right time.
The future of the Portland Cave is becoming uncertain because an ambitious contract is being terminated.
Aluminium ovens and hundreds of its employees' future in Portland have become uncertain in Victoria, as its main customer, energy company, announced the suspension of cooperation.
This Communication is based on the plans of the Victorian Government to stop subsidising an energy company, which is vital for the company to continue its work.
The subsidies that last for 20 years will be terminated in November.
As a result, more than 2000 jobs in the Alkoa Portland plant are at risk.
Up to 2000 direct and indirect jobs could be at risk.
In addition, it will also have unpredictable side effects, as the boiler consumes about 10 percent of Victoria’s electricity supply.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry pipeline, which led to the interruption of the Angresse plant.
The Alkoas Portland cupboard works with losses and can be closed.
These events were caused by the speculations over several years about the rise in the value of the Australian dollar and the cost of production of the factory.
The plant’s energy supplier AGL, which supplies energy from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latroubes, says that the other three owners are likely to terminate their contracts.
Most of the power plants are owned by the Alcoa and Alumia Joint Undertaking, in addition to the parts of the company are also owned by the Chinese CIIC and Japanese holding companies Marubeni Corp.
"AGL looks forward to continuing the operation of the Portland plant, which would mean a future energy supply for the boiler," said its representative.
AGL stated that the contracts were the so-called 'risk-restrictive contracts' intended to enter into force as of November 2016.
The contracts have a 12 month validity period and will therefore remain in force until 2017.
"AGL plans to receive revenues from these contracts also in the 2017 fiscal year," said the company representative.
The potential impact on profits from the fiscal year 2018 is limited by favourable market forecasts for future wholesale electricity prices.
AGL claims that its forecasts have already estimated losses of $1 187 million, with the effect that these contracts will be terminated.
Alcoa states that the decision to terminate the contracts will not affect the ability of Alcoa to continue its activities or to deliver energy to it.
The U.S. company notes that in 2010 it entered into a contract with Loy Yang for 20 years, but it will be stopped in November.
The analysts have expressed their concern about both the possible closure of the Portland melting plant in Victoria and the closure of the Tomagos plant near Newcastle, due to the weak economy of the sector.
The AGL Executive Director Steven Mikelson said last week that according to analysts, Portland uses 600 megawatts and Tomago 900 megawatts of energy per year.
If the two plants were to leave the energy market, the demand for energy would be significantly reduced.
And it wouldn't be good at all.
The Community's legal centre rejects 160 000 people each year.
Every year, more than 160 000 people are being rejected, and the budget is being cut down, the situation may get worse.
Three out of five people in Queensland - mainly pensioners, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those who do not have the means to combat illegal disappearance - are denied free legal assistance and representation.
The Community's legal centre, which has already been overburdened, warns that the decline in funding will only make the situation worse.
As early as June of next year, these legal centres will receive 30% less funding than they have until now.
James Farrell, Director of the Legal Centre of Queensland, said that the latest report of the Association of National Legal Centres states that legal aid is currently refused by thousands of people in need.
Mr Farrell pointed out that if this decision is not repealed, the situation will only be worse.
He also says: 'The legal centre in Queensland is constantly receiving insufficient funding, which means that the aid is denied to thousands of people in need.'
People who are trying to end violent relations, people with deep debts, families who are experiencing divorce, workers who are unfairly released - all of these people have legal problems and this report shows that they do not receive the necessary assistance.
As of June 2017, the federal government will reduce its funding by 30 percent, which means that several more thousands of people in Queensland will have to deal with their complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on the Prosecutor General and the Senator George Brandis of Queensland to stop the cuts immediately so that people in need of legal aid can get it.
Last year, the government revealed its plans to raise the level of legal aid to the national average.
Now is the time to also draw attention to the needs of local communities and their customers and to the government of Palazčuk to invest in this important area.
Donald Trump's campaign was sued by a court, because one of the employees pulled down the firearm
The organisers of the Donald Trampa campaign were sued in court because they had not acted on information that its North Carolina operations manager had turned the firearm against an employee when they were driving a car in February.
This incident was described in a court action brought by Vincent Bordi, a former campaign programmer at the Charlote Court on Wednesday.
He said that he had been waiting for months for an internal review of this case to be launched, but had realized that this would not happen.
Driver Earle Philip "switched his gun, put his right indexer on the light, and opened the gap against Vincent's knee", says the Bērdi in his complaint.
He also claims that by lodging complaints to the local and regional campaign management, Bordi learned that at least four more people had experienced the same.
"Ierocians don't have to shoot to cause damage," says Bordi in his complaint.
Just two days before the case was submitted, the candidate of the Republican Party to the office of President caused a scandal, announcing to the people that the "The People of the Second Amendment", i.e. arms owners and enthusiasts, could act in the event of a wish to win his rival Hilarija Klinton and his elected judges.
The tramp campaigners announced that the media had taken his words out of context and that he had never confounded anyone on violence.
By their request, the leaders want to recover compensation from the campaign organisers for the neglect of monitoring, but from Philippe about the use of attacks, illegal weapon and the creation of emotional stress.
Mr Hupa Hixa did not make any comments at all.
I couldn't get in touch with Phillips.
WCCB - Sharlot's local news agency says that Philip has left the campaign recently.
Nor has it been possible to call his consultancy firm "Innovative Consultancy Services".
The President-in-Office of the Republican Party, Donald Trump, has conducted a controversial election campaign.

New tradition - the parish and sports festivals in Kūļciems.
On Saturday, for the first time, the people gathered for the parish and sports festivals.
After 10 years of celebration, it was decided that the lake festival would be no longer.
A new page is now resorted.
The day began with sports competitions.
This time the race was not traditional and too serious, because, for example, the darts had to be cast into a sleeping target, the boot flies, the human left hand throws, the "balling" had not at all been in any Olympics.
However, each participant could show how strong, courageous, tracked, and tactful he was.
After sports games, everyone gathered in an outdoor estheque, where the parish celebration began.
In the meantime, there was also a “children’s corner” where the little could get their way into the inflatable attractions and get a new image in the beam maker.
A novel that could also become a tradition was a parade of tools, which went to both the tractors and the motorcycling motorcycles.
Inga Kadiķe-Skadiņa, the head of the municipality of Ķūļciems, who wanted a nice rest and a dry time, came to rain, but it could not interfere much.
Blessings continued with the health of the younger inhabitants of Cūļciems.
It's really good that the parish has topped up with five girls and one guy.
With performances, people had a group of amateur art from Engure region – the viewers enjoyed the performances of senior dance sets "Rudens rhythms", performing dances from different nations "Reds" and young dancers "Zelta pearls".
And it's nothing that the wet stage had to slip.
Of course, the famous actors duet Jānis Jarāns and Dainis Porgants, who were once again Mildiņa Nabiņa and Skarīte Krāniņa, as well as Berzciems friendly wives from the fishing farm "Dieniņa".
The party was played by a group called "Brūģis".
Britain must sustain the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow.
Not only will Heathrow contribute to prosperity and growth in local regions and London, but also throughout the country.
This, in my opinion, makes Heathrow very attractive, just as in London in 2012, where we invested a huge amount of work, so that all regions in the country would benefit from the Olympics.
Stratford and Realtenda won an enormous amount of the Olympics.
And we will do this again by providing local people and businesses with business opportunities near Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new business opportunities, 40 000 new jobs and finally put an end to the youth unemployment in the vicinity of Heathrow.
Like the London Olympics in 2012, there will be people who believe that this challenge is too great and that the expansion of Heathrow is too ambitious.
At that time, people said that Britain would never be able to prepare for the Olympics in time and that it would be a global failure.
Skeptics were wrong in 2012 and they would not be right either in the case of Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow has overcome everything so far.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that will benefit the entire society and not individuals.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs, economic growth of 211 billion, with soils for both employment and experience at this airport and throughout the United Kingdom.
A great team is working in Hītrova, which has created an investment programme of 11 billion pounds worth of infrastructure, from time to budget starting with the terminal 5, which has been named five years from place as the best airport in the world and ending with the terminal 2, which has been built between the two more intensive runways in the world.
Now they are ready to create a third runway, which will be financed with a private investment of GBP 16 billion.
The 2012 London Olympic Games were a great success, and I am sure that this will be the expansion of Hijtrov.
It is time to revive the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, ensuring our trade future and creating a new employment environment with which Britain could be proud of.

In Switzerland, a woman goes to the highway trying to commit suicide.
In the middle of the night, he went to the highway.
The police are trying to find witnesses to an accident when, on Thursday morning, she took several cars to the highway.
The accident occurred on Thursday shortly after midnight on the A1 road near the canton of Vo, Morge.
According to the canton police report, a desperate desire to commit suicide was for the woman to learn about the road to the dark, where he was hit by several cars.
Clearly, by trying to kill themselves, the 49 - year - old Swiss victim, several cars, including a heavy car, came together.
She died at the site of the event.
Several drivers involved in an accident have already given evidence, while others involved have not yet been ascertained, says the police, asking to refer to the drivers involved and the accident witnesses.
A criminal investigation was also opened in the case, which is a logical step, and the lawyer Gilles Hofsteller was told by Le Tribune de Gene.
However, it is not yet known whether any of the drivers involved will be penalised.
Was It Possible to Avoid Collisions?
Hofsteller adds: "This will be clarified by the prosecutor."
Two similar experiences over the last 5 years indicate that none of the drivers will be held liable.
In both cases, the pedestrian was on a highway in the middle of the night, so it was decided that drivers could not predict that a pedestrian, a newspaper, would be on the middle of the highway.
Last year, a police officer was justified in killing out of consideration when, in August 2014, she drove a man lying in the middle of the night on the A1 road near Paijerne.
The Court found that a 22 - year - old victim was a drunk and later noticed falling asleep on the road.
The Court concluded that the police officer on the road to the accident was travelling in an appropriate way to the conditions and that the judge admitted that the sleeping man on the road was "a completely unpredictable and exceptional case".
Anyone who has information about a Thursday accident near Morges is invited to contact the police by phone 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
The online subscriptions are collected for the new Head of the SRS competition.
The collection of signatures on the petition portal "Avaaz.org" was launched for the organisation of a new competition for the Head of the State Revenue Service (VID).
In a petition addressed to the ministers of the National Association (NA) and of the Union of Greens and Farmers (ZZS), the public wants a transparent and professional process of nomination.
The petition was created on August 10, and it has now been signed by 55 people.
The designation process of Mr Inga Koļegova, candidate for Director-General of the SEN, is opaque and non-professional.
It recalls the best functional traditions of the Soviet Union.
It discredits public administration and once again makes society disappointed with governments and politicians.
"There is a need for a competition with clear criteria against which all candidates must be evaluated," states the text of the petition.
Its author Jānis B. pointed out that there are no known criteria for the appointment of Koļegova to the public.
Nor is it clear what a candidate's intention to work in the SRS is.
The petition states that the State Chancellery should create a new open competition that actively addresses professional candidates, recruits and offers appropriate remuneration.
The Minister of Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola officially nominated the Head of the Koļeggov SRS last week, this week the government was supposed to approve him in a new post, but all the ministers of the Unity party voted against, so the issue was postponed for the week.
Samoilov: If we lost, then I played badly.
The beach volleyball Alexander Samoilov and Jānis Šmēdiņš hoped for a prize at Rio deignieri Olympics, but without this, there is no difference in the place of closing the competition, after leaving the tournament Samoilov expressed.
One of the world’s most powerful beach volleyball pairs was held on Thursday in the final and decisive game with 1-2 (16:21, 22:20, 7:15) the Brazilians Evans Gonsalvūms Oliveirs and Pedro Solbergs Salgigas lost their membership in the most important sports forum of the four years.
The Latvian athletes won one victory on three match subgroups, but the same ratio was two more pairs.
In the following, the ratio of three pairs of small points was counted, which, after this mayor loss, was most unfavourable to the Latvian duet.
"In the first six we were led, but from 16:15 it was left to 16 points," Šmēdiņš remembered the course of the game.
I don't even know how there were no points in the rest of the Section.
It can't play.
Then, in the second session, everything was all right and at the end of the Set managed to break the game, and it was supposed to be a good foundation for the third.
It started similarly, but after we swapped the parties, the result grew only to one team.
We had too many mistakes in the attack.
In the subgroup, all teams were similar, almost all of them had three faces, so it was important to have small points.
"The manager played more like this, rather than repeatedly returning 3-4 points in a row", said the athletes.
We knew Evandra could be served.
"In the first six we met with it, in the second we made 1-2 points, and in the third at +4 he already left the game," remembered the Smādiņš.
We tried to show the best game.
There was a chance, not a moment.
I didn’t think of the overall situation before the match, but it was known that as many small points as possible were needed.
"If we lost, then I played badly," said Samoilov.
We waited for a good service from Evans, and it also brought us to the end of the first six, but the third was the service that opened him and it was hard to attack.
On the other hand, I made a mistake in hosting directly at Pedro’s service, but that had to be done.
Samoilov told us that contrary to the previous match today, there was no nervousness for athletes.
"We went, played, protection was, but needed a better service reception," said the athletes.
"They played well and at the end they already came to the door."
Before the tournament, we immediately said that the draw was the most uncomfortable it might have been.
We also had the chance to fight for the first place, but we were not even out of the group.
"All of us were waiting for a medal and also we of ourselves, but then there is no difference anymore - 25th or fourth place," said Samoilov, who predicted that the duet will continue to play together in the future as well.
I think that there will be no questions and we will continue to play together, because this is only one tournament.
Samoilov had a third Olympic career in Rio de Janeiro, because in 2008 he started with Martin Pļaviņa, but four years ago he played with Ruslan Sorokin in London.
In the meantime, this was the second start in the Olympics.
"Latvenergo" is also following the process of opening the gas market from the position of a potential trader.
The State Energy Company "Latvenergo" follows the process of opening the gas market from the position of both the consumer and potential trader, said the company's press secretary Ivita Bidere.
"The decision on whether to join the Latvenergo gas market in the future as a trader will determine which gas market model and legal framework will be established."
"For this reason, we are actively engaged in creating and commenting laws, as well as presented our proposals", said Bidere.
The Agency has already written that the Ministry of Economics (EM) in cooperation with the Public Services Regulatory Commission and the energy company "Latvijas Gāze" has developed the Cabinet Regulations Project "Temporary Regulations on Trade and Use of Natural Gas" which will change the existing operating principles of the natural gas market by providing natural gas users with the right to freely choose the natural gas trader from 3 April 2017.
In working on the new regulation of the natural gas market, the aim of EM is to make the trading process of natural gas as simple as possible and user-friendly as possible.
Therefore, as the most efficient and user-friendly service option, a "trader's central model" has been chosen, in which all customer service activities are provided by a trader - one contract, one invoice and one point of information and customer service, leaving natural gas distribution system technical issues to the distribution system operator.
A similar solution is currently in place for electricity trade.
We recall that the gradual opening of the market for household customers - also after 3 April 2017 for household customers who do not want to opt for another natural gas trader - will be able to continue to receive natural gas from an existing trader at regulated prices, thus becoming related users.
"In this case, the obligation to supply natural gas to related customers at a regulated price is set for the public trader", informed the Ministry.
Operators will have to choose a natural gas trader to conclude a contract for the sale of natural gas.
Prior to the conclusion of the trade agreement for natural gas, economic operators will be provided with a fixed period of time by the former natural gas trader at a price fixed by it.
The draft regulations of the Cabinet of Ministers address in detail the rights and obligations of the natural gas trader, system operator and users.
The rules shall lay down the procedures for the supply and supply of natural gas to users, the requirements for the safe use of the natural gas system, the rights and obligations of the trader, public trader, system operator, user and owner of the gasified facility, the arrangements for the settlement of the services received, the amount of late payment interest received, the procedure for switching between traders and the supply of natural gas in the event of disruption; the procedure for the supply of natural gas to the related users shall be provided by the public trader.

Minister of Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola (Green and Farmers' Union (ZZS)) plans to discuss with Prime Minister Maris Kučinski (ZZS) and with the Government's coalition partners the increase of remuneration of Director General of the State Revenue Service (VID) next week.
She pointed out to journalists on Friday that the issue of increasing salaries of the Director General of the SRS must be addressed urgently in order to make this post more attractive for potential applicants for repeated competitions.
The following week's discussion was also made about changing the terms of the tender.
The Minister also emphasised that she does not have to think about a specific candidate who is to be referred to as a vacant post.
At the same time, Reizniece-Ozola expressed the view that Inga Koļegova, Head of the State Environmental Service, would have been a good Director-General of the SRS.
With regard to the current role of Head of the SRS, Daci Grey, who has expressed readiness to qualify for this post, the Minister once again took the view that the new SRS Director-General should have a "outside view" and should not come from the SRS structure.
She also stressed that she was waiting for the Saeima to return from his holiday in order to move as soon as possible on the amendments to the laws necessary for the reorganisation of the SRS.

Koļegova also pointed out that the discussion of her candidacy had led to contradictions between the ruling coalition parties, which were also unacceptable.
It has also been reported that the previous Director-General for Life at the end of June Ināra Pētersone left office.
Oil prices continue to rise; stock exchanges in the USA and Europe, as well as US dollar values, are increasing.
World oil prices on Friday morning continue to rise, with investors' mood having a positive impact on the comments of the Saudi Arabian Minister for Oil Affairs, which reinforces the expectation that the largest oil-producing countries at the OPEC meeting in September will take action to stabilise the global oil market.
The three main U.S. stock indices reached record levels on Thursday, which have not been observed since 1999.
The main positive factor in the market was the rise in oil prices and the strong financial performance of several large companies.
The rise in the price of oil and the strong financial performance of several companies were also a reason for the rise in the European stock exchange indices on Thursday.
On Thursday, the value of the US dollar increased in relation to the euro, to the British pound and to the Japanese yen.
In the New York e-commerce WTI mark the price of crude oil for deliveries increased on Thursday by $1.78 to $43.49 per barrel.
The "Brent" brand of crude oil price for deliveries in October increased by $1.99 dollars to $46.04 per barrel.
The turnover of the canned "Zil Lagona" producer is shrinking by 33.8% last year.
The turnover of the conservative Blue Lagona producer last year was EUR 4.202 million, which is 33.8% less than a year before, while the company's losses decreased by 5.7 times - up to EUR 904.7 thousand, according to the annual financial report published in the Lursoft database.
The company's management report states that in 2015 the company worked for losses due to a number of reasons, including the persistent lack of working capital caused by the departure of Unicredit Bank from the Baltic market, leaving the previous credit line and leaving Blue Lagona with the concluded contracts without the possibility to execute them.
Consequently, the company did not have enough resources to buy cheaper raw materials in large quantities and receive a volume discount.
The withdrawal of the relevant bank from the Latvian market also prevented the company from implementing European Union structural funds support projects, which would have allowed the plant to purchase new production equipment and upgrade the infrastructure.
Similarly, the company’s financial producers in the last year had a negative impact on the rise in raw material prices and on customers’ willingness to pay more for their goods.
"Only in the second half of July 2016 customers recognised price changes and were ready to buy the goods at the new - the highest - prices", says the company's management.
In 2015 "Zila Lagona" also started discussions with potential investors, including evaluation of the company's moving and real estate.
Investors have already been the largest creditor of the company "Unicredit Leasing", where parties have come to know and discuss possible investment plans.
At the same time, the implementation of the restructuring and optimisation plan started in 2014 and 2015 had a positive impact on the company’s performance and development.
This plan included improving and optimising technological processes, leading to higher production productivity and capacity.
"A number of equipment that provides a higher production speed was only purchased," the company's management indicated.
The management of "Zila Lagona" notes that the equipment purchased in 2016 will allow the company's plant to perform orders that were not possible until now.
The first production batch to be made on this equipment will be ready in August.
As the intent protocols for the sale of the product have already been signed, all produced will be sold in accordance with the intent protocols.
The new product will increase turnover by about 300 thousand euros per month", says the company's management.
In August 2016, the company plans to sign a cooperation agreement on deliveries of fish products to Iraq.
"Zila Lagona" in 2016 has sent the first experimental container to Israel, expanded the market to Cyprus and this September will sign a cooperation agreement with a new supermarket chain in the USA.
As a result of all the above measures, the company intends to increase its turnover.
In 2014, Blue Lagona worked with a turnover of 6,347 million euros and a loss of 5,113 million euros.
Blue Lagona was founded in 1997 and has a core capital of EUR 1.156 million.
The company owns two private individuals in Latvia - Mihail Kaidanov (89.11%) and Igor Shirshon (10.89%).
Welcome to 15 visit the museum to celebrate the cinema diva Zāra Leanderi and participate in the press conference.
Riga is a city of the beginning and inspiration of the career of the devout cinema, Zara Leander.
The visit of Zara Lendere to the courtmate Ruth, who was a Swedish ambassador to Latvia, became fateful in Riga in 1924 because she was the one who discovered the unusual low counter for the woman of Zara Leandere, who she tried to debut on the Riga Chamber's theater stage.
Perhaps it was the incidental confusion in Riga that became the fateful turning point on the creative path of Zara towards the world glory.
Riga Sarai Leandrei was associated with warm memories, and she hoped to come to Riga at the guest shows, but unfortunately these hopes were not decided to be fulfilled because World War II started.
Using the form of the show, this meeting will be possible at Riga Festival 2016 and the great role of Zara Leandera will feel great Ieva Kerēvica.

Because of the repair of the village, the man is forced to leave his house at the ruined ceilings.
In the LTV program 4th studio, Dmitrijs Saidjaševs, whose neighbor started to repair capital in his apartment, and since then Dmitrijs from the ceiling cares for the settlement and is not sure that staying in the apartment is safe.
The problem is that my neighbours have carried out arbitrary construction and my apartment has been damaged by ceilings.
Then I informed Riga Construction Board, House Manager and other organizations.
The construction board said that we are not an operational service and that we have no expert.
"The owner of the person must go to the Latvian Engineering Union, and there will be some expert from there", says Dmitry.
The guest expert came, recorded the events and admitted that the cover was in a unsatisfactory state.
But since the first submission of Dmitry to the building board a month later, no one was able to answer the question of life - threatening location in the apartment before the beginning of this week.
This is the law, wait, if you're not satisfied, write to everyone in a row.
"Then wrote to the Riga City Council, but they sent the house to the manager, then the house manager again to the building board, and then there is a impasse", says Dmitry.
After examining all the paper pile, it is clear that the construction work has been suspended, although you can always hear someone working there.
An expert examination must be carried out for a further period of two months, and within six months the owner of the apartment who carries out the repairs must all these defects be rectified.
The independent expert has drafted his opinion, but the building board considers it incomplete and superficial.
The expert has not indicated whether the metal grid in this rigid structure is affected, so it is not certain that the owner of the lower apartment is exposed to danger.
"So we have asked for further clarification from this expert", says Ilze Žūka, representative of the Riga City Construction Board.
Despite the ban on carrying out any repairs in the upper apartment, it is still heard from there that construction continues.
The penalty for arbitrary construction without a building permit ranges from 70 to 700 euros, but in a specific case the penalty may be much more severe.
As long as the expert’s opinion is expected, the building board decided that both apartments should not be operated - both in which construction works are carried out and in which Dmitry apartment is located.
"This is not the case in the construction board practice, when, due to ignorance or simply unwillingness, citizens may have created a threat not only to their property but also to the owner of the lower property, which has resulted in this owner being unable to exploit their property," says the representative of the construction board.
Now Dmitrius has to look for another place to live with relatives, friends, hotel or rent a different apartment.
But the damage Dmitry can try to get out of the neighbor's civil form, which can take a lot of time.
As a result of the lavish construction, it is now prohibited to stay in both apartments until the constructor has reached his conclusion, and this can be expected for up to three weeks.
The damage caused will have to be borne by the owner of the apartment in which the repairs took place.
The owner of this apartment, because it has not been taken into account by the building council, is also threatening the prison sentence for up to six months.
Let's go!

The conversion of the former Kemeri sanatorium into a five-star hotel will cost EUR 22 million.
The conversion of the former Ķemeri sanatorium into a five-star hotel "Park Hotel Ķemeri" will cost 22 million euros, and the LETA agency will be told by the representative of future hotel manager SIA "Park Hotel Ķemeri" Gita Želve.
The building of the hotel is the first stage of restoration of Kemeri's former sanatorium.
The second stage will be "wellness" or wellness clinic, which is planned to be opened in 2022, while the hotel opening is scheduled for May 2018.
Želve notes that the exact costs of the clinic are currently unknown.
But she points out that it would be located in a polyclinic building of the former Ķemeri resort, with an area of about 12,000 square meters.
The clinic will be located on three floors.
The owner of Park Hotel Ķemeri and the planned clinic is the international G Capital Europe fund, which invests in European assets.
The owners of G Capital Europe are several investors who invest in this fund, indicated in Želve.
As G Capital Europe Executive Director George Jones said earlier, investment of between EUR 12 and EUR 15 million is planned to be invested in the creation of a previous resort polyclinic, in total exceeding EUR 30 million.
It has already been reported that the restoration of the cultural-historical park in the area of more than 42 hectares, the restoration of roads and street sections, the construction of an interactive nature tourism facility, the improvement of the territory and the construction of the parking site on Emila Dādaiņa Street, which will contribute to the socio-economic development of Jurmala and the increase in the number of tourists, the Jūrmala Council intends to attract €14.5 million from the funds of the European Union, co-financed by three to four million euros.
By the middle of 2017, design works will start, but construction and finishing works will start in the autumn of next year.
As reported earlier, in the historical sanatorium complex "Ķemeri" is planned to create a 5-star hotel "Park Hotel Ķemeri" and "wellness" or well-being clinic.
However, reconstruction lasted.
The 2010 annual report also claimed that Ominasis regularly communicates with the hotel operator Kempinski, which continues to provide daily technical control at Kemeri, and would certainly be "completed in the reconstruction of the upcoming Kemeri hotel" and immediately starting preparations for opening the Kempinski chain hotel.
In October 2014, Park Hotel Ķemeri confirmed its readiness to buy the assets of the Sanatorium, owned by "Ominasis Latvia", which is insolvent, but later in the month of the auction was declared not to have happened, because the winner had not paid for the purchase within the specified time.
The sale price was determined on the basis of the initial price of EUR 2,86 million for the last outstanding auction.
As the agency LETA informed Ieva Aile, representative of the city council, the municipality, when signing the protocol, has confirmed that with co-financing of the European Union structural funds, the construction of the historic Kemeri Park will be renewed, an interactive nature tourism facility, roads and parking sites will be created.

Russian hackers broke the e-mail of NATO Commander Bradlov.
Hakers, who broke the U.S. Democrat National Committee (DNC) computers, may have made a number of other cyber attacks, also broke the e-mail of NATO European Force former Commander Philip Braidlov and the servers of George Soros Institute Open Society, told Bloomberg on Thursday.
After publishing the information obtained by hackers on the DDCLeaks.com website.
Among other things, there was a correspondence with Bradlov and information about the work of the Soros Institute.
For hackers, the Institute's computers were available for a whole year.
According to Bloomberg, these cyber attacks were carried out by the same hacker associated with Russian speculation, who broke the DNC's emails.
The Wall Street Journal reports that U.S. President Obama's Administration is currently examining the issue of imposing new sanctions against Russia, thus responding to the shutdown of the DNC computer.
In order to impose sanctions, the Administration will officially have to appeal to the servers of the Democratic Party, either by Russia or by the hackers supported by the Russian authorities.
According to the report, the WikiLeaks website published in July about 20,000 e-mails received from the DNC computer system, from which we can see that the leaders of the Democrat Party have tried to harm the candidates of the party Hilarija Klintones, former rival Vermont Senator Little Sanders campaign for democratic nomination in the presidential elections.
As reported by the US press sources, the Federal Investigation Bureau, which investigates the use of the Democrats server, as well as other US speculations, considers Russia's association with the cyber-attack to be indisputable here.
Macartney: The Beatles was threatened by the presence of Yoko Ono.
Paul Macartney admitted that the presence of Joko Ono caused a sense of danger to the legendary group "The Beatles".
The 74-year-old rock star is now maintaining a "good" relationship with the widow of the deceased man John Lenon, but at the time when she went to the group to visit the recording studio, Macarty was frightened by her because Ono was the only woman in the group - George Harrison, Ring Stara, Lenon and Macartney.
When the singer asked about both relationships, he said to Rolling Stone: "They are really good."
We were in danger at that time.
While we were recording, she sat on the boosters.
Most groups could not tolerate this.
We were able to do that, but not very well, because we were very tense.
We didn't have sexists, but the girls usually didn't come to the record study, they let us work.
When John began to meet Yoko, she did not sit in the control room, but in the middle of our four.
The author of "Yello Submarine" also admitted that he is now in regular contact with former Ringo member of the group, and regularly confirms the work plans of Apple's recording studies, but in all other ways "The Beatles" is "completed".
Whether he is still meeting the only one still living as a legendary rock band, Macartney said to Rolling Stone magazine: "Not often."
We meet in social events and parties.
But I don't go to meetings, I feel a little apart from it.
I left Apple during a difficult divorce.
In my place, I sent John Eastman to the meetings and said, "Tell me what everyone says, because I can't suffer sitting on that table."
It was too painful to see a dead pet.
The company now works in such a way that I'm just listening to all the records.
I am part of the approval process.
NASA Climate Model: Venus was once a inhabited planet
Based on NASA’s latest climate models, Venus has ever been a inhabited planet.
Scientists of NASA Godard Space Research Institute have developed a model to explore Venus’s history using tools and algorithms that are also used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether or not the Venus, which has a hot surface, where there is no water, and whose atmosphere consists almost exclusively of carbon, has ever been under conditions similar to the Earth.
Scientists have already said that the slow rotation rate of Venus is explained by the dense atmosphere.
However, recent simulations show that Venus once had a plan, an atmosphere similar to the Earth, and it turned slowly.
The model also looks at Venus's earlier topography.
There were more dry areas on the planet than on earth, but there were enough water and geographical diversity on it to enable life to develop and avoid evaporating water.
In the early days of Venus, the sun was more than 30 percent brighter.
In the simulation of the GISS model, Venus rotation model reveals that the bright part of the day on it lasts 2 months, explained in the press release GISS scientist Antonius Del Genio.
This process heats the surface of the planet and causes the rain, which in turn forms thick cloud layers that act as a umbrella to protect the planet from the heat of the sun.
The result is a moderate climate temperature, which is actually a few degrees lower than the temperature on earth today.
The model represents the history of Venus, which is similar to the theory of evolution developed by scientists in their hypotheses.
Although it was once inhabited, over several billion years Venus has been exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Its oceans were tasted, and the spirits were burned down by the ultraviolet rays.
As the water was completely evaporated, only the thin carbon dioxide atmosphere remained with the deadly greenhouse gas - Venus, as we know today.
Scientists published the results of the new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns from Avalanche trainer's position
On Thursday, Collodora Avalanche coach and vice president of hockey operations Patrick Roy made a call, stating the insufficient impact of the team's decision-making process.
Vice President and Vice-President of Colorado General Joe Sakick confirmed this message and informed that the club would immediately start searching for a new coach.
"For the last three years, I have been energetic, passionate and purposefully fulfilling my duties as coach and vice-president of the operations of the Kolorodo Club," says the 50-year-old Roy in his statement.
During this summer I have been thinking a lot about how I could improve team performance in order to give it the necessary glory and achieve a higher level of results.
To achieve this, the visions of the chief coach and the vice-president of hockey operations must be fully aligned with those of the organisation.
He shall also be able to influence decisions relating to the performance of the team.
These conditions are not met at the moment.
Says who hired Roy on 23 May 2013, thanking Roy for his contribution to the team.
Says Patrick informed him of his decision today.
We appreciate all that he has done for the organization and wish him all the best in the future.
In his first season with Avalanche team in 2013-2014 Roy was recognized as the League's best coach and won Jack's Adams award.
He helped the club reach 112 points and the first place in the Central Division, but in the first round of the exclusion game the team was won by Minnesotas hockeys. Since then, the club has not entered the exclusion games for two years.
"Avalanche" closed the 2015-2016 season with a result of 39-39-4 and remained five points after "Wild" teams without receiving the second special invitation of Western conference organisers.
The famous goalkeeper Roy won four Stanley Cups in his career - two with Montreal Canadiens and two with Avalanche.
The offshore oil platform workers resume negotiations and put a strike
The workers' strikes on the compensation of workers on the North Sea oil platforms have been carried out, as both parties to the dispute have resumed negotiations, and the negotiators say.
Periodically, a strike is held against Wood Group in the North Sea Oil Platforms in which the Royal Dutch Shell operates.
The joint statement states that the trade unions of Wood Group and Unit and RRT have agreed to resume negotiations on the resolution of the dispute.
A number of full-day meetings are scheduled in the coming weeks, starting at the beginning of next week with a view to re-examineing the problem issues.
The trade unions stated that their recent events, organised more than 25 years later, were aimed at a 30% reduction in wages.
Due to negative market pressure, Wood Group reduced wages for employees in the North Sea by 9 percent this year.
Already in 2014 the company reduced the wages of land workers by 10 percent.
The company explains that the additional wage cuts would allow the company to survive the market downturn.
Shell has already reduced salaries for several thousand people and announced plans to stop oil and natural gas operations in 10 countries in order to optimise its work in preparing for a large-scale merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of falling oil prices, and the situation is more complicated by Britain's decision to abandon the European Union.
At the beginning of the week, the Scottish Member, Dave Anderson, met with workers' representatives to discuss one of the most important issues - the North Sea strike plans.
He said that North Sea is vital for the region's economy.
He explains in his report that the North Sea and the country as a whole need an economy that benefits all, and not individuals.
In 2016, nearly USD 1.4 billion is expected to be invested in new North Sea projects, compared with USD 7 billion invested over the last five years.
Kepler is measured by the star rotation rate in the Pleedder constellation.
Kepler’s latest Telescope mission has helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalogue about the star speed in Pleeda Star.
The new data helps astronomers to understand why stars turn at different speeds in this starry as well as how the star rotation rate can be attributed to planet formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other stars, we will get more information about the relationship between the mass of the stars, age and even the history of its solar system," Pasadena Caltech Infrasarkano Process and the Analyst Louisa Rebula of the Center.
The flashing star is 445 years away from Earth.
Many stars in this constellation only begin to grow, reaching about 125 million years of age.
They shall be rotated at the maximum speed.
With peak speeds, these growing stars emit large amounts of stars of wind.
When winds get into the magnetic field of the stars, they slow the stars.
As the stars age, their rotation rate is decreasing.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by determining the time between the apparent occurrence of the stars such as sun spots.
The latest star speed catalog shows that larger stars turn slower than smaller stars.
The glass compares stars with the dances, the larger the dancers perform the pyrute slower than the dancers of small height.
Rebuls says that the Palette Ballet shows that slowly rotating objects are larger and more massive, while faster rotating objects are very small stars.
Thanks to its proximity to the Pleedea Star, it serves as an excellent space laboratory where stars can be compared with turning speeds.
Rebuls says that the Pleede Star helps to create theoretical models for star rotation in both directions of older and younger stars.
We still need to learn a lot about how, when and why the speed of the stars slow down and about their complete stopping process.
Rebul and his colleagues presented in detail an analysis of the speed of Pleede star rotation in three new publications that will shortly be published in the Astronomy Journal.
