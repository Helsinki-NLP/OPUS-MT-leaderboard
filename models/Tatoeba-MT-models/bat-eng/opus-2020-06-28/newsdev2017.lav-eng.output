New questions about California water supply project
Critics and state legislator say that they want to know more about who is paying for the 16 billion US dollar project supported by Governor Jerry Brauna, according to the leading representative of the California Water Administration, that Brauna's administration is offering government funding to complete the construction of two huge water tunnels.
Critics argue that the government funding described by the water administration in Los Angeles metropolis may contradict the State’s long-standing assertions that the different local water administration, not California itself, would pay for Brauna’s vision to dig two equal 35 miles long tunnels to drive water south of the Sacramento River, mainly the Central and Southern California.
Initial expenditure on the construction of tunnels amounting to USD 248 million, which still has to be authorised by the supervisory authority, has already been the subject of a federal audit.
On Wednesday, the state legislators also commissioned a state audit on tunnel construction costs.
On Thursday, the state speaker Nancy Vogel said that despite the water management account of Los Angeles metropolis, the money from the state general budget will not be used to complete the current planning phase of twin tunnels.
However, tunnel opponents and a group of taxpayers were critical, and on Thursday, Suzana Ega, the representative of the Assembly, one of the leading legislators of the state ordered by the audit, asked the State for explanations.
"It's a game with bribes," said David Wolf, the legal director of the Howard Jervis Taxpayers Association.
In my opinion, this involves yesterday's audit (demand): there are many more questions than answers.
The tunnel project has been approved by Brown and some political influential water management and water consumers in Central and Southern California.
Supporters claim that tunnels will benefit the surrounding environment and provide California with safer water supply.
The opponents claim that they are worried that the state will use tunnels to divert too much water from the Sacramento River and the San Francisco Bay, to the detriment of North California and to the further threat of local species.
Metropolis and other water supply administrations, which are expected to receive water from the tunnels, still have to undertake to pay for them because of their insecurity as to whether the investment of giants will actually provide enough water to repay.
The same water authorities also stated this year that they would not pay for the completion of the current preparatory work, unless the project was first authorised by the monitoring authority.
On Thursday, in the monthly review of the tunnel project published by the water administration, the State stated that "the additional funding for the completion of the planning phase will be allocated from the state budget or the federal budget."
After all that the local water administration has spent on the project, including USD 63 million from his water administration, "it is expected that the state will use public money to complete the planning," said Bob Muir, the speech of the water administration in Los Angeles.
He next referred to the question of Vogel, a state speaker.
Vogel said that the State was planning to allocate money to complete tunnel planning at the cost of the existing water network of half a century, the Stata water project.
However, opponents of tunnel construction point to a regulation issued in 2009 which, according to them, prevents the State from spending money on the construction of tunnels until the water supply authorities benefiting from it have committed no payments for them.
"The project contractors have promised to pay for this project, and they have used financial tricks to circumvent these obligations," said Patricia Šeferle, environmental consultant and an old planned tunnel opponent.
This raises questions about where this money was suddenly found.
The focus of the Business Group on China's Cybersecurity Law
The coalition of multinational business groups has addressed China by requesting that the proposed rules on cyber security be changed to warn that they will harm trade and isolate the country.
The letter to the Prime Minister of China, Li Kecjan, has been signed by 46 groups from the US, Europe, Asia and Latin America, showing global concern that the rules could restrict or suspend access to the Chinese information security market.
The signatories include the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the European Forum for Services and groups from Japan, Korea and Mexico.
The proposed rules require suppliers to show the Chinese authorities how safety products work and how information on Chinese citizens will be stored in the country.
The last letter dated Wednesday says that this could make data theft easier and lessen access to Chinese customers.
Chemical explosion in Tiandzhin: the year has passed since the tragedy
Zhang Mengfan claims that society deserves to know what happened in Tiandzhin.
The Chinese leaders are planning silent memories to commemorate the first anniversary of a large-scale chemical explosion in which 173 people died, but not everyone agrees.
John Sadvort reports from Tiandzin.
Almost anywhere else in the world, the anniversary of this scale of disaster would be the moment that the people remember and remember.
However, not in China.
Although the church of the memorial to remember some of the dead firemen is held in the city of Tajina, in another place such memorial measures are excluded.
The controlled media of the Communist Party have been told what they can and cannot say, and some survivors and family members of the deceased are warned not to speak to a foreign press.
However, Zhand Mengfan, aged 23, does not want to remain silent.
"This year, the public should somehow know what happened," he tells me.
I don't want silence.
On August 12, last year, Zhangs was the radio operator of a military fire brigade, which was only a mile away from the explosion epicenter.
"The call was received that night at 22.53, and we started sending my teammates," he says.
They could arrive in 10 minutes instead of the event.
Teams from other parts of the city also rushed to clear the extensive fire chemical store.
None of them drew attention to the fact that a large quantity of volatile and toxic substances was illegally stored, well above the authorised levels and without proper monitoring.
The fire began when it was allowed that nitrocellulose - nail lacquer chemicals - a lot of dried and then lit in summer.
Then it spread into a huge area of 800 tons of ammonium nitrate fertiliser.
In the explosions, windows and a firefighter’s depot were eliminated, where Zhang Mengfan waited for news from the radio station, and the roof was attacked.
This information was not received either.
"When I saw the seed cloud, I fell in despair," he tells me.
I knew what that meant to my friends.
Of his 26 firemen who were sent to the explosion site that night, eight never returned.
Many others suffered severe burns and other injuries.
The largest of the two major explosions were likened to an earthquake, and the wave of the explosion was felt many miles away.
The total amount of losses is estimated at over USD 1 billion, including over 300 destroyed buildings.
In total 173 people lost their lives, of which 104 were firefighters.
The remains of the eight men have not been found.
The official government investigating bodies are clearly blamed for corruption, political relations and the formal secret agreement, which allowed circumvention of the rules and disregarding the security systems.
First of all, such a warehouse was not supposed to be built close to residential homes.
More than 100 officials and management representatives of the company have been subject to some type of disciplinary or criminal investigation.
So, while the government can point to the progress achieved - the thousands of homes and compensations brought to citizens in order, these sensitive issues are still topical.
The tragedy has revealed a gap in a system where rapid economic growth is a priority and a lack of independent supervision is a fact.
The evening’s courage and sense of duty are not dubious, but without fire as a hero, it is not quite a pleasant picture.
It is a firefighter who has been sent out without a prior signal to combat a man-made disaster that could have been prevented.
Zhangs Mengfan no longer works at the fire service, but he will visit the memorial church service in Tiangin.
He will send a message in his heart about his dead members.
I would like to say to them most of all: I have visited your parents, and they are doing well.
Leave your parents to me.
I am now a member of your family.
I will perform your duties as sons.
Cold spring could affect the Scottish rubbing season
The Scottish rubbing season will start later, because the cold weather has reduced the number of birds this year.
Some properties have been shot down because many of the young rubies have not survived in the cold spring conditions.
In recognition of the beginning of the season, the Scottish Games’ Association (SGA) says that the shooting of rubbles provides more work than the Edinburgh Festival.
However, the Animal Welfare Fund OneKind calls for an end to the murder of brutal birds.
Harry Huyton, Director of the Organization, said: "Work that is invested in order to provide a large number of game birds for shooting is huge and undeniably involved in some rather controversial activities."
It is no surprise that society is turning away from this so-called sport and calling on the government to ban the cruel, unnecessary work that only a very small part of the Scottish population enjoys.
Land owners, however, insist that they are committed to maintaining the number of birds and that the shooting of rubbles is important for the development of the rural economy.
The SGA Chairman Alex Hoggs said that the sector provides 8 800 full-time jobs a year in outlying regions and that it was a "rich labour ground" in precarious times.
He said: "In comparison with many European countries, there is not so much "hunting" culture in Scotland, and some people do not know how shooting season affects the country economically."
Hoggs said that the number of jobs provided during shooting exceeds the number of jobs created at the Edinburgh International Festival, at the Flemish Festival, at the tattooing festival and during the Old Year Evening celebrations together.
He added: 'The employment situation in Scotland is currently quite worrying, especially in the oil and gas sector, so game operators and their families want to see the industry flourishing.
We want to work with the Scottish Government to ensure that hard work people can count on these jobs in the future as well.
RSPB Scotland believes that at least eight golden eagles have been killed in the vicinity of the rubble’s habitat.
Many gaming operators admit that the shooting of rubies is not generally popular, but SGA claims that the industry "has taken important steps forward in terms of best practice."
The day of the opening of the rubbing season is traditionally known as "Holy twelfth."
However, there are still many discussions about this type of sport, and the management of rubbing places involves persecution by some nature protection authorities.
On Thursday, RSPB Scotland said that in less than five years' time, in the mountains of Monadliata, southeast of Invernes, eight ringed golden eagles were lost.
The Nature Conservation Charity Fund considers that they have been illegally killed in the vicinity of rubbing places and their satellite bracelets have been destroyed.
The Scottish Minister for the Environment, Rosanna Kaningham, said that these reports are "very worrying and sad."
Mrs Caningham commissioned officials to analyse evidence of about 90 survivors and missing eagles with transmitters to determine whether there was a trend towards criminal activities.
A group of Scottish mobs blame the RSPB for trying to put on fire before the start of the rubble season, and said that there is no clear evidence that birds would even have died in the area of Monadlita's mountains.
Rio Olympics 2016: Britain's Paige For the United Kingdom is fighting a trenches of silver
United Kingdom representative Peyja fought for silver tramples
Briña Peigia became the first British woman to hit the Olympics when he fought silver.
Peyjai (25) to the gold missed 0.425 points, because the Canadian representative Rosanna McLenana had already won the second Olympic title in a row with a result of 56.465.
World champion, Chinese representative Lee Dana was at the bronze, while the other British finalist Catherine Driskola finished in sixth.
I can't believe I've won an Olympic medal.
I'm so happy," the emotional Paige made it clear.
I had no idea that it was a medal, but I was able to show the best performance, so I was so happy that all the exercise and hard work has been paid off.
I am so happy that I was able to start the final with Keta, already one representative's participation in the final would be historic, but we were there two.
Prior to the Olympic silver battle, the highest achievement of Pedge in international competitions was the fifth place at the 2015 World Championship in Denmark.
Trampling was included in the Olympic Games in 2000, and this is the first time that British women have managed to get to the final.
The medal response.
The British team representative Natan Bailey, the only representative in the male competition for jumping on Saturday, was an investigation.
Hannah Velana, who plays for the second time in the Olympic Games, quickly began to praise the achievements of Peydge.
Paige has acquired a bachelor in biology with excellence at the University of Shephilda.
Rio 2016: Fiji's fans celebrate gold medal battle in rebius-7
A 12-year-old boy to see the game sucks half a mile of both sugar cane fields up to the nearest TV.
Fiji, after having won the first Olympic gold medal in its history, begins an unprecedented volume of celebrations
Banks closed, shops solid and the celebrationrs took over Suvas streets, dancing, singing and partying
Fiji gained a golden medal, regbais-7 in the Deodore stadium final with 43-7 destroying Great Britain.
Thousands of people throughout the island country stopped their usual work to see the historic game.
Fiji celebrates the first campaign in its history of the Olympic Medal
Many of the fans were dressed in Fiji’s colours and were able to see in shirts, carrying a national flag and encouraging the team.
On the end of the game a whistle was tasted, the thrilled celebrationrs went out on the streets, enjoying and dancing.
"Some people even stopped their vehicles on the full streets of Suwa and joined the Flags of Fiji to celebrations, not to touch the little congestion they created," reports Fiji Times.
The celebrations will certainly continue at the weekend and next week.
Irish Prime Minister: Finn Harps 0-5 Derry City
Aaron Macenef took two halves of the first half of his sentence for the benefit of the guest team in Finnpark.
Derry City has risen to the second one in the Prime Minister, obtaining a convincing victory with a result of 5-0 in the fight against Finn Harps.
Aaron Macenef under the leadership of the "Confect stripe", successfully implementing the two first half-term sithes, which were awarded for violations against Luke Schubert.
Nathan Boil took the gate at the beginning of the second half, and Shubert exceeded the opponent in the fourth quarter before Keita Vard's late action by closing the opponent's raid in Finnpark.
Derry is on one point ahead of Cork City, and both teams will meet in the decisive game Monday evening at Brendive.
It was Derry's first victory over its northwestern competitors on the side of the sailors, and they were being disturbed by me.
Macenef saved the opening hit in the 17th minute after the Cyran Cole march against Shubert, although the violation proved to be outside the penalty court.
There was no doubt about the second blow of the punishment, by the former King's stripe guard Barry Moloy falling down and Schubert fell down and Macenef got a result 2-0 in the third minute after the break.
Boys set the exact point after Dina Jervis's play with his feet inside in the eighth minute after the game was replayed.
Jerry Dohertie, the merchant City Gatekeeper, had a calm evening, but managed to guard the gates with great success by defeating David Skally’s guests in the best game opening.
Shubert caught the ball by Cole before they got out in 83 minutes, and it was soon followed by the frog’s prank over Richard Brash, the guard of Harps.
It was Derry's biggest winner in the race series and excellent preparation for the final game with Cork.
Check after massive unreplicated tests on the UHI course of the University of Highlands and Islands of Inverness College
The entire 20 students course could have failed the Invernes College UHI's highest media course test.
Most of them were students aged 17 and 18 who hoped to use the mark they received to enter the university.
The Invernes College UHI claims that quality assurance processes are in place, adding that the Scottish Qualification Authority (SQA) is investigating these cases.
The SQA Press Secretary said that the assessment of the highest media in 2016 available across the country is "believed as intended".
Twenty students signed up to the course offered and evaluated by the Invernes College UHI.
Many of the students were young people in rural areas who had been trained online, but often had to go to Invernesa College from their home, such as Lochibera.
One student’s father said that after his daughter published in social media that she had not received any evaluation for her job, at least 10 also made a statement that he had not received any evaluation for her course of work.
He said to BBC News Scotland directs that about five more people, who had learned this course last year at the Invernes College, and with whom they managed to communicate, said that the same thing happened to them.
The situation means that his daughter cannot provide a place at the University of Glasgow, but she will be able to accept another university offer thanks to qualifications acquired at school.
However, her father said that there were others who attended a college-led media course that did not succeed and that were now "forgetting" and insecurity about whether their course work would be reviewed and evaluated with a sign that they would be able to join universities.
The UHI of Invernes College is part of the University of Highlands and Islands.
Diāna Rovlinsone, Head and Executive Director of the Invernes College UHI, said: "We have the results of the examinations and the success of the students is very important."
This is confirmed by the excellent review of her Majesty’s Education Inspection (HMIE) and by the improved achievement levels of her education and higher education in comparison with last year’s experience.
As every year we carry out an overview of all published results compared to the expectations of each student.
In the case of this particular course, standard quality assurance measures were taken and the evaluation authority recently reported "significant improvements in the provision and management of this evaluation" and confirmed that "assessments were in line with national standards."
SQA is currently investigating these cases at our request.
SQA Press Secretary said: "We are pleased that the evaluation of the highest media in 2016 has taken place as planned and that candidates had an opportunity to show their understanding of the subject."
Many candidates have shown good performance and there was a small increase in the A-C achievement rate compared to the same qualification last year.
It was developed according to previous and sample documents and in accordance with our course and assessment specifications.
Brothers placed in prison for the umpteen sword "asin alcohols" in Kilmarnoka
Jason Braden was attacked by a samurai sword, a knife and a nunches
Two brothers were imprisoned in prison for killing a man with a samurai sword after the drug-relatedft in Irish, which turned out to be "asin spirit".
Upuri Jason Braiden (38) was hit several times in Kilmarnok's home on 5 July 2015.
In Glasgow, James Clark (36) will be sentenced to at least 22 years in prison after being sentenced to murder.
His brother John (38) was sentenced to 10 years in prison after being sentenced to less severe charges for murder without a prior intent.
By imposing prison sentences on both men, Judge Bill Danlop told his brothers that they had committed "a cruel, cruel and wild attack."
He rejected any assumption that Mr Braiden had lied and waited for them, armed with a samurai sword.
The judge Danlop added: "You plan together to enter illegally with at least one knife and knife."
Jason Brad may have been a narcodler, but he was a son, a father, and a friend.
You killed him.
After being held in prison by both men, the criminal police officer, who led the investigation, said: "The violent and dreadful actions of Jason and James Clark have resulted in the death of Jason Braiden."
Come on, at the age of 38, and in such terrible conditions, there is a heartwarming situation that the family must experience.
In the past, the Court heard that the brothers from Kilmarnok decided to take up the gold rook they had given him in exchange for drugs to Mr Braiden.
Both of them went to his home, masked their faces with scarves, and armed with knifes and an eastern fight.
The sword used in the murder is believed to have belonged to the deceased.
The neighbors said that you saw Clark attacking Braiden when he sat on the sofa at the window and heard him screaming.
Prosecutor Richard Godard said at the hearing: "The attack on this man was hard, chaotic."
Then the murder site was described as "blood alcohol".
During the Braiden attack, in addition to the injuries of the knife stains, a strong injury occurred with a rabbit object.
Three days later, he died in Kilmarnok at the Crushaus Hospital.
Both brothers did not admit to the murder.
By providing evidence, James Clark, who had previously been tried 38 times, including the attempted murder, said: "I didn't want it, it was an accident."
John Clark, who had previously been tried 23 times, said that he was just engaged to help a brother who, according to him, was attacked by Braiden."
A man was sentenced to prison for shaking and killing his infant’s old son
David Skyler confessed his guilt of murdering a child in his home in Iskkulbreve in 2012.
A man who shunned and killed his infant’s child’s anger in an outbreak because he did not want to eat, was sentenced to seven years and three months in prison.
David Skyler shook Joshua, who was four months old, when he lost control at his home in Eastkilbre, South Caucasus, on 6 December 2012.
The cause of death was determined only by a judicial examination.
Syncler (34) was originally accused of murder, but was found guilty of murder without any prior intent.
At the Supreme Court of Glasgow, the judge Lord Breiseil Sinkler said: "You attacked your baby's son by shaking him, creating the injuries from which he died."
When you shake her, you had to know it, but you didn't discover it.
Only after basic medical examination you are aware of what you have done.
Your wife believed you.
Now she feels transferred and can no longer support you.
Lord Breiseidle described the effects of Joshua's death as "catatrophic" for everyone and added: "Nothing will return Joshua."
In the past, the court found that, on the day the child died, Sinkler and his wife, Curstia, had come with Joshua to swim and shop in Eastkilbreig.
Cērstija Sincler went to meet Mother and Sister on 17.30.
Just 11 minutes later, Skyner called her, who listened to the "shocked".
He said to her, "A man who does not breathe like he does, he immediately comes home."
Then he ended the conversation and called 999.
The infant was immediately taken to the Hērmair Hospital, where he died.
Initially, the cause of Joshua’s death was not clear, but was discussed by a judicial team of medical experts who detected the consequences of pre - death injuries in the eyes and brain, and such injuries could not be acquired by chance.
One of the experts, Dr. Peter Richard, child neurosurgeon at John Redcliffe Hospital in Oxford, said: "This is because the child has been shaken and thus has suffered injury, as well as having suffered more force than daily."
Vice-President Jan Dhugid told the court that Synkler was 'extremely sorry' what he did.
Rio Olympics 2016: Hloja Taton threatens Julia Jefimov's positions
British representative Tatony slips away from his hand in a bronze bath in 200 m
British representative Chloy Taton criticises the controversial swimmer Julia Jefimova's participation in Rio after the Russian representative ran over 200 m on the swim.
Jefimova, which was allowed to participate in the games following a complaint against membership bans due to doping, is fighting silver, leaving Tatoni in the fourth place.
"I would have wanted them to be a completely pure game," said the 20-year-old Velsian swimmer.
I didn't determine who was there.
I'm not satisfied with this, but that's what it is.
Jefimova, who won the second place, learned about her participation in the games only three days ago.
I don't want to see how people get out of sport, but I don't think it's really right.
She did not have to take part in the competition, and a 20 - year - old British representative had to fight a medal.
Rie Caneto won Japan's seventh gold medal in the 2016 Rio game, turning Jefimovo into a silver medal.
Chinese representative Deninga This was at the bronze, only about six-seconds of a hundredths ahead of the fourth one of Tatoni.
Her British teammate, 20-year-old Molly Renšova, finished in sixth.
"A staying in the fourth place is a little disappointment, no matter what you have in front of it," added Taton.
It's a great experience, and I'm a little disappointed about the fourth place.
I'm so close to the medal, and it would have been a dream.
However, meeting with the finals itself is a great experience that I will take with myself in the coming years.
It was a little disappointment, but in the long term it will make me strong, and it makes me more and more seek for a medal, so I hope I will see it closer next time.
In the tap for just 0,01 seconds left the British record of women in the 200m swimming final.
"Every person has to give a second chance," Jefimova.
Jefimova, who said that she was tired of answering questions about her doping past, defended her right to start in Rio.
In 2013, she was banned for 16 months after her body found traces of anabolic steroids.
The Sports Arbitration Court (CAS) stated that athletes should not be denied participation in Rio games because they have already been sanctioned in advance.
CAS dealt with my complaint and I won.
If someone doesn't like it or have any other opinion, they can turn to CAS," she explained.
I do not support doping, and I have never used it.
In the second case, it was certainly not my fault.
Everyone must have a second chance.
When you drive and you get the penalty receipt, nobody's gonna put you in jail.
Bens Grain fights place for 50 freestyle swimming
Previously, a British record was installed to win a place in a male swim-style finish of 50 m.
The Union champion Pearl (21) landed 21.54 seconds to qualify as the fifth best for the Friday final (02:44 BST Saturday).
Your delegation is shameless and gross
The Indian Minister of Sports, Vijai Goel Rio, has had a rather glamorous personality at the Olympics, often inherited in a tribines, encouraging Indian athletes and taking self - self - self - intakes after their beginnings.
However, he and his large company have apparently provoked the anger of the Olympics player because of his uncontrollable behaviour, repeatedly trying to break down to the competition zones without proper accreditation and gross reaction, while being tested, says the Indian news agency Press Trust of India.
Vyyjs Goel, photographed in July, justifies his behavior.
On Wednesday, the organizers of the Olympic Games threatened to cancel Goel’s accreditation if his behaviour did not improve by sending a warning letter after he and his company tried to enter restricted access zones in the venue of the exercise competitions and in the arena, where pricking and ragvanding take place.
"We have received several reports that your Minister of Sport has tried to enter accredited competition zones with non-accredited persons," writes Sara Petersone, the continental manager of Rio 2016 Organisational Committee.
When the staff tried to explain that this was not allowed, the minister’s people together became aggressive and rude, and sometimes passed away to our staff.
"If our protocol team becomes aware of other cases of such behaviour, your accreditation of the Minister of Sport will be withdrawn and his privileges in the Olympic Games will be abolished," said the following letter.
The head of the Indian delegation called this case "the elephant out of the fly" and Goel himself said that he had not done anything bad, writing it down as a "understood".
On Twitter, he wrote: "As far as I know, we have complied with all the rules.
We live in the spirit of the Olympic Games and support our Indian athletes.
Otherwise, India has a whole gloom of this Olympic game, and for the time being, there are no medals.
The hopeless fans in the social media pointed out that Michael Felips had won so many medals - 26 as India has done in its history.
Several prominent candidates have already been excluded, including the shooter Abhinav Bindra, who won a gold medal in Beijing in 2008.
This time he stayed fourth.
Money and opportunity started by the latter," author of sardonian ink and column author Šuba De.
However, some bright expectations remain, as there will still be competitions in boxing, golfing, tennis, light schooling and, yes, badminton.
The only Indian gymist Dip Karmakara will compete for jumps in the final Sunday, showing her terrible double speed "Father of Death", Produnov jump, tried by only a few other gymnastics.
In a country with 1.25 billion people, India’s low number of medals has always been a cause of indignation.
The analysts say that it has countless causes.
National passion is a cricket, which is not an Olympic sport.
India has not invested heavily in infrastructure and in the training of the Olympics - the first training tool of Karmakara was made from spare parts of an old umbrella.
Parents have always stressed the supremacy of academic knowledge about sport.
And the authorities responsible for sport have been taken over by corruption.
The International Olympic Committee has left the Indian Olympic Association for violations of its statute in 2012 because it elected the leaders against whom criminal cases have been initiated.
In Sochi, three participants of the winter Olympic Games in India were even denied representation of their country, flag or wear anything with national symbolism.
They competed as independent athletes.
When people get hurt, JetBlue, a turbulent plane on the Boston-Sakrament route, is forced to land in South Dakota.
JetBlue plane was forced to make an emergency landing on Thursday evening after 22 passengers and two crew members were injured during the tour, reports CBS Sacramento.
Flight 429 from Boston to Sacrament landed in Rapid City, South Dakota shortly before 19:30 a.m. local time.
The airline notes that the injured were sent to hospital for inspections.
JetBlue claims that it has sent its staff to help the injured, a spare flight to Rapidsitiya to bring the rest of the passengers to Sacramento.
Drug Control Agency (DEA) misses the opportunity for medical marijuana
Unfortunately, the answer is: it is unlikely.
This is a lost possibility of further delaying treatment for countless people.
Until today, there is only one Federally-approved source of medical marijuana use for scientific purposes at Mississippi University.
The DEA also announced today that it would now allow other sites to apply for authorisation to do the same.
There is hope that the range and diversity of marijuana available for scientific purposes could be expanded.
Although it will attract attention as a win-up for the study, it will largely be symbolic, because no matter how much marijuana is available, if access to it remains difficult, it does not play an important role.
Imagine a product that is very requested but that is stored behind closed doors.
In response to a demand for goods, someone makes a hard-understood decision to produce it more, but to be, and it never shuts the door off.
This product is marijuana and its location in list 1 contains these closed doors.
A medical marijuana is in such an unpleasant situation.
As marijuana is a substance included in list 1 (i.e. by definition it is "not currently approved for medical use and there is a high potential for its use for unforeseen purposes") there are significant barriers to closing doors.
Potential researchers usually turn to DEA first because it allows for the launch of scientific studies.
Even if an authorisation for research on substances included in list 1 is granted, the authorities must comply with very strict safety rules and have high levels of safety, which may be costly.
There is also an even more subjective consideration of obtaining authorisation from its academic institution to conduct studies on substances included in list 1.
Even if certain representatives of the faculty wish to carry out this study, the management of the university may not want problems or potential side effects due to negative press reports.
So it happened at the University of Arizona, when Dr. Suu Sisley was released from office after trying to advance medical trials on the marijuana.
Sisley finally had to look for private funding for her project, and only in April, seven years after the initial project was initiated, her project became the prevention of the post-traumatic stress of the first medical marijuana trials approved by DEA.
Then after years of struggle with bureaucratic obstacles, the National Institute of Drug Dependency has been the key to the last switch.
At the moment, it is the biggest financingr of the marijuana State of research and is the only supplier of marijuana itself.
Even if more medical medicine is released for free circulation, the Institute will still have to approve all its funded research.
The problem is, however, that of the name 'misuse'.
Dr. Donald Eibram, representative of the University of San Francisco, who interviewed my documentary Marihuan, says that the main task of the Institute is to study the substance in the context of its potential dependence, not as medicines.
He draws attention to an important fact.
Even if the study overcomes all the obstacles listed above, the door may still be closed if the intention is to explore the benefits of medical marijuana rather than the damage caused by it.
Take note: 1.434 works on medical marijuana have been found in the search for rapid (and, to be acknowledged, unscientific) medicine in the U.S. National Medical Library over the last five years.
In the same search, only 57 works were for the benefits of medical marijuana.
Most of the studies were about the damage caused by marijuana, for example, "The poor journey due to the anticholinergic effects of marijuana", "the pancreatitis caused by Marijuana" and "the use of Marijuana and the risk of lung cancer."
This disproportion leads to a completely distorted picture.
The journey to the use of medical marijuana is paved by surprises and hypocrisy, where the sights appear.
While the DEA body is present in list 1 status without taking into account the medical effect, the US Department of Health and Social Affairs keeps the canabionide patent for a wide range of medical purposes at the same time.
DEA continues to identify marijuana alongside heroin and LSD as highly dependent drugs, although DEA's own chief administrative judge, Fransis Jang, opposed it.
Marijuana, in medical sense, is safer than many widely consumed foods.
For example, bypassing 10 fresh potatoes may cause toxic reactions.
By comparison, it is physically impossible to eat so many marijuana to bear death.
Marijuana is one of the safest therapeutic active substances known to humans in its natural form.
When carefully observed, marijuana can be used safely in medical treatment.
It must be said again that this is proposed by the DEA judge himself.
And yet, in almost 30 years, little has changed.
Whether we recognize it or not, we all accept some form of hypocrisy in our daily lives.
Maybe we don't always have the energy to say it loudly, or we're so mute or stinked that nobody seems to have noticed it.
As regards hypocrisy in the context of the federal medical marijuana policy, there must be resistance to present the facts with concern.
The lives of patients, such as Sharlote Fiji, whose seizures are reduced by medical marijuana, and many others depend on it.
The fact that the plant can provide so much benefit and still stay behind closed doors is worth talking at a higher level.
Bloody Beetroots: Donald Trumps "Blonde Berlusconi"
Bloody Beetroots is well known in the context of electronic dance music
Musicians say that Trump is dominated by media like Berlusconi
You know, we're used in Italy to Berlusconi, and for me Trump looks like blonda Berlusconi," the founder of the electronic music pancakes association "The Bloody Beetroots" said CNN.
The President-in-Office of the Republic and the Italian media magnet that became political, both of them are known for their exaggerated personalities, their ability to attract the press's attention and for their modified stories in the media.
As part of "Bloody Beetroots" Rifo is known for his electronic dance music and has collaborated with various artists, starting with legendary Sir Paul Macartney and ending with elektroots' singer Greta Svabo Beč in 2013 song "Chronicles of a Fallen Love".
Rifo was born in the Italian city of Basanno del Grapa, near Venice, in 1977, which coincides approximately with the time of the origin of pancroka, and the figures "1977" are deposited with a musician on the chest.
"English is not my native language, so I don't understand everything about your world," Rifo said, hiding behind the black pay he is familiar with.
I am trying to explore, and I am trying to improve my understanding of your culture.
Rifo called on Americans to watch "Environmentalty", a documentary that explores the Berlusconi Monopoly over Italian media.
The documentary is about how "Berlusconi made Italy crazy," said Rifo, adding that Trump had a similar effect on America.
"You see how a man can completely turn the system and all bend... through his own," he said.
I think Trump's not good for this country.
Two Turkish sailors are in prison on over GBP 500 million drugs
Two Turkish men have been sentenced to smuggled cocaine worth over GBP 500 million on board the North Sea, each sentenced to at least 20 years in prison.
Mamin Sahin and Emin Ozman were found guilty of trial in the High Court in Glasgow after about 100 miles from the banks of Aberdeen on the MV Hamal deck were found three tons of Class A drugs.
The detention in 2015 is the largest cocaine load seized in one approach that has ever been detained at sea in Europe.
He was sentenced to prison for his role in a large-scale drug offence by Mamin Sahin and Emin Ozman.
The significant drug cargo found on board is one of the largest British history
The drugs were found hidden in a specially equipped ski on a tugboat that sailed from Istanbul to Tenerife and then to the North Sea.
It was stopped by the British Navy Fragette HMS Somerset and by the Border Force Brewer HMC Valant.
Sahin (47) was sentenced to 22 years, while Ozman (51) is sentenced to 20 years in Glasgow Supreme Court.
The judge Lord Kinkleiven told men that the amount of drugs was "not only substantial but ambitious", and the drug smuggling has a "destructive effect" on people and the community.
He said: "You were involved in the most commercially relevant operation, including the transport of cocaine by boat, an operation that crossed international and truly intercontinental borders."
He said that the ship's captain Sahin was not at the end of the drug tree, but he played a key role in the crime, while the other captain Ozman had a role "something smaller".
The inspectors boarded the Hamal after being informed by the French customs authorities, DNAED, and when it stopped in Aberden, they took them through a steel plate, accessing a secret section, where 128 connections with weight of 3,2 tonnes were found, as the estimated value on the black market is 512 million pounds.
Last year the Royal Navy was inspected by MV Hamal.
There were three tons of cocaine on board.
The inspection of the vessel revealed that its ballast tanks were shocked to tonnes of Class A drugs
The ship was on its way from the Bosphorus Strait to South America before it was stopped in the North Sea.
Access to this place was discovered under the closet of one of the crew crew crew spaces, and the gap was sealed.
Saquin and Ozman were found guilty in transporting and hiding cocaine on board during the period 20 to 23 April of the last year and in supplying cocaine between 21 April and 23 April.
The two unscrupulous men who have worked in the shipping sector since the graduation of school continue to claim that they are not guilty, yet they take the oath.
Four more men lack evidence for their appeals.
Sahin's lawyer Jonathan Crow, said that the father of two children is "glorified mule."
He said: "A person who was involved in drug trafficking."
Someone who was able to drive the ship.
Looking at the drug hierarchy, Sahin is certainly not at the end of the drug tree, but somewhere below.
The huge amount of cocaine on board means that it had to be brought forward by a roadcracker
The police for days went through the whole ship before the drugs were split into these boxes
She asked questions about his captain's work on "Hamal" in February 2015, the court heard.
Mr Crova said that he was "shocked" about missing important things for daughters (9) and son (13) and "who simply wants to go back to Turkey".
Both men have not seen their families since the arrest in April 2015, as families are still fighting to obtain a visa endorsement.
Ozman's lawyer, Di Mour, said that he "disgustingly" wants to see his family, but knows that in the transparent future it will "not be possible".
Speaking today, the Scottish prosecutor David Harvey said: 'International drug trafficking has no border, and we, whose task is to destroy it, are working more closely together to ensure that we are one step ahead.
"Scottia's success in the persecution of criminals is indeed at a global level, and in this case we have suffered considerable economic losses for organised crime."
The drugs were packed in every gap on the ship, including below the floor.
This smuggling package was found by inspectors in a hidden ship’s laundry room
Mr Harvey added: "Hamal" was identified by intelligence from the French authorities and by swift cooperation with the Prosecutor-General of Tanzania, where the vessel was registered, who also authorised to board the ship.
"Our investigation then came from Guyana, which gave us access to essential data on consignments, to Spain, which provided us with very valuable information about the ship's stops in the Canary Islands.
We also worked with colleagues in Denmark, Norway and the United States to put together specific elements of evidence.
Despite a thorough intelligence of the fact that there is a large amount of drugs carried by Hamal, the British authorities in international waters could not climb on its board without the permission of the Tanzanian Government - something that they had never granted before.
Suu Peitena, Head of the Royal Criminal Prosecutor's Office (CPS) International Justice and the fight against organised crime, said: "As the counselor of the CPS criminal law managed to obtain permission from the Tanzanian authorities to board a ship within 24 hours of receiving intelligence information.
Under international maritime law, British officials shall not be entitled to climb in international waters on board a ship under the flag of another State unless that State grants a special legal permit to do so.
Without the rapid action of our criminal counselor, there would be a great risk that the ship could escape and that we could never call these people accountable.
Photographer Brian Romejön captures the destroyed East Expresa train
Photographer Brian Romeigen from Rotterdam took photos of this abandoned train in Belgium
The images show the inside of the train, the broken seats, the windows with dust and the narrow driver's cab.
It is already known as the Eastern Expresian wagon, but it belonged to the Belgian national railway company
The urban researcher has taken these remarkable photographs, showing the destruction of the remaining passenger train, which once was one of the best ways of moving.
The seasons of its flowers have long since passed, and the train wagon and locomotives have been left to compress the train station in Belgium, where they have become a popular viewer of photographers and adventure seekers.
The photographer Brian Romeigen, 40, has taken these amazing photos, showing the moving inside of the train, the broken seats, the windows with dust and the compressed driver's cab
The train wagon and locomotives are left to compress the train depot in Belgium, where they have become a popular viewer of photographers and adventure seekers.
These trains were a luxury symbol when they were operating under legendary names from 1883 to 2009.
Locomotives were used by the Belgian national railway company about 50 years ago.
After 126 years on rails, the last train of the Eastern Expresam went from Strasbourg to Vienna in December 2009, concluding the famous phase of history.
The Eastern Express was a famous route on Paris - Istanbul.
When it started in 1883 (Operator - La Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits) it was known as "Express d'Orient" in French.
It became an Eastern Expression in 1891 and already had regular routes throughout Europe until 1930.
It should not be confused with the private Venice Simplon-Orient-Express.
There are very few luxury wagons in Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits.
Measuring instruments and open wires are still installed in the narrow driver's cab, which is visible in this photograph.
Romejen said that the car driver's cab is "in fact claustrophobic, and the noise of the locomotives is probably irresistible."
Lost locomotives and wagons have become a popular viewer of photographers and adventure seekers.
After visiting the forgotten train in Belgium, Romeindžs MailOnlineTravel said: "I really could feel how it was used in its flower times."

Thanks to her impressive digestion skills, sights and conversions, Tekstasie and YouTube censone Ketlin Gelove have been brought to the army of fans.
However, her last conversion to Baster Blut from the "Arrested Development" is quite incredible according to any standards.
In the three-minute long video uploaded to her Kiki G YouTube channel, Gelove slowly and continuously transforms itself into a failed image with a hook of hand.
She even uses some audio at the end of the clip from a terrible show, but at the same time excellent performance.
The talented makeup artist starts her video in her, blond women's image.
Then, with her slowed down photo, she slowly turns into a brutal "memmesdule" that has already gone away, and who is Tony Heil Basters Blut.
The Gelovey does this with coloured contact lenses, galoving and pulling contours around the nose and eyes, and drawing the face of the Baster on his head.
Wisely using a slow - down picture, she slowly converts to Tony Heil Bastle Blut.
In her video, she also takes over the personality and manner of the cult TV image, drawing the chin accordingly.
The clips that are placed in YouTube have been watched more than 45 000 times, and very quickly the skills of maker's famous comments have appeared:
"You're extremely talented," one person recorded the video put under Gelovey.
In her video she also takes over the personality and manners of the cult TV image
"I like how you stay in the file doing all this," said someone else.
The videobloger Ketlin Geloveja had already succeeded in transforming the "Park and Recovery" image into Ron Svenson.
She told her YouTube followers that in the future she hoped to make make a make-up every week.

The father in reportedly reportedly expelled from the children's school for wearing T-shirts with lamas
The father of two children was expelled from the children's school for coming to their sports day in T-shirts with offensive inscription.
K a special McBet (36) from the town of Burnley, in Pasashire, says that he "need" by having on a shirt with the inscription "Wait and Dr. Am!"
However, despite the fact that when he noticed his t-shirt and put on his T-shirt vice versa, the next day he found that he was prohibited from entering the school territory.
A single father who works for four years as the head of Park’s primary school in Kolne, Burnley, could not come after the children because of the ban, and even the staff called out social services and police.
K a special McBet (36) from Children says that he was not allowed into the school territory after he had come to the child's sports day in an offensive T-shirt.
Mr. Burnley accuses the school director Sarah Mijley of being too sharp.
He says he is wrongly punished by the fact that, before going to watch his two children's race, errors after rushing into a T-shirt.
The father who no longer works as the head of the school said, "It was a mistake and a disregard for me."
I didn't think about the sports day and rushed on it.
It was closer to the end of the event that we had a father's race, and the director noticed my T-shirt and told us that it was not appropriate.
I'm sorry, I cut it back, and that's where the thing ended.
However, the 36 - year - old man said that he had received a letter from the chair of the school leaders that he was invited to a meeting with the director the following day, but he did not see the need to do so because he had already been apologized.
"Then the school director called me and said that I was not allowed to enter the school territory," Mr. Burnley added.
I learned that after the sports day, some parents were alarmed about it on Facebook and that many people were interested in it.
Any conscious person would say that it is exaggerated.
Mr. McQueen, editor of the online magazine Love Mini, said that he felt that he could not even come after the children on the last day of the semester because of the ban.
However, this was the reason for the call from school and social services.
On the T-shirt there was the image of Kreiga Charles Lister from the BBC cult comedy "Red Curry" with one of his iconic expressions "Lying and Dr.."
He commented: "I told them I wasn't there because I'm not allowed to go to school.
Then I was called from the social services and asked why I wasn't after my daughter.
The school also called the police because I haven't come after my daughter for about 40 minutes."
Mr Mcbeta claims that he was told that he could no longer come to school premises and that the ban would apply until further statements.
He also said that he had been warned that he could be fined a pound of GBP 500 if we were caught in violation of this rule.
Sarah Miguel, director of Park’s primary school, said that this case was now over.
Sarah Miguel, Director of Parka Primary School, said: "I can confirm that Mr. McBet has resigned and is no longer the head of our school."
This is now over and I hope to return to the usual school life in September."
Jo Kooney, a consultant to the town of Burnley, said that the school had clear policies and guidelines.
"We must keep in mind that when we take on such positions as counselor or leader, you are subject to higher standards, and unfortunately this time he did not meet these standards," he said.
Advisor Jonathan Nixon added that he did not think he should have been banned by the school and that the elephant was being blown out of the fly.
Mr Nixon added: "This wearing T-shirt was stupid, and he apologized for it."
The Opashir police confirmed that they were called from school, but they did not.
In recent years, the premises of the former VEF factory, located on the Freedom Street, have been renovated - several IT companies are located there, the industry has already started to call this site the local valley of Silija.
The rest of the VEF will also develop, including Berzaunes.
The development and construction of the 2nd stage of the project will cost EUR 21 million at the Academic Centre of Torņakalns.
The procurement published by the University of Latvia on the development, construction and author supervision of the 2nd round technical project of the Academic Centre in Torņakalns, Riga, is concluded as evidenced by a notice on the website of the Procurement Monitoring Bureau.
Procurement is organised in the form of a negotiated procedure without prior publication of a contract notice.
The agreement will be concluded with the full LNK Industries Group, which is committed to carrying out these works by EUR 21 186 560.
As explained by LU, the University, with the launch of the European Union Foundation for the Planning and Implementation of Projects of the 2014-2021 programming period, continues the design, author supervision and construction of the next round of the Academic Complex - the building of the Center of Sciences, according to the Skiču project and the updated building time.
The building of the science centre, according to its main activity, is similar to the building of the science centre of nature science designed and constructed in round 1, and to the work carried out there, which is similar in terms of the most important technical and technological parameters, as well as the scientific and academic staff and students in the building.
The property of the competition was accompanied by a design project developed by SIA 6th style, whereby all possible suppliers were already provided during the competition with information about the vision of development of the Academic Centre of the University of Latvia in Torņkalns, including a list of the objects planned by the Academic Centre of the University of Latvia, which indicates the name of each particular object, the estimated area of the object, the planned year of putting the object into operation and other information.
At the end of 2015, SIA 6th style performed corrections in the previously developed territory of the Academic Center of Latvia Torņakalns building complex, which clarified the location of the buildings of the Academic Centre and their interconnection, as well as the transport organization cast into the territory and its surroundings.
A tendering procedure for the cutting-off of medicinal products in the lanes is hereby opened.
The Latvian road maintainer of SJSC has announced the purchase of mechanised grass-breaking in lanes in Latvian regions and Pierga, informs LAU.
The object of the purchase is divided into 9 windows: Alūksnes, Daugavpils, Jēkabpils, Jelgava, Rēzekne, Valmiera, Talsi and Riga Road Areas.
Applicants may submit a tender for one or more windows.
The cutting of medicinal products into road lanes is necessary to improve the transparency of the roads and their surrounding areas, to facilitate the passage of water from the road, and to limit the displacement and formation of the grass.
The most prominent cutting works are intended for farmers in the Talsi road area for a total of 28 roads of 637 kilometres, in Valmiera road area of 20 roads of 432 kilometres, and in Alūksne 17 roads of 384 kilometres.
It has already been announced that in June the company completed the cutting works of the hall on the main and most important regional asphalted roads of the country, but on smaller regional roads and on local roads SJSC Latvian Road maintainer planned to entrust part of the cutting work to farmers.
"It is an opportunity for us to use the funds allocated to road maintenance works more efficiently, while allowing farmers to fully load machinery and earn", says Vladimir Kononov, Chairman of the Board of the SJSC Latvian Road maintainer.
The closing date for the submission of tenders shall be 22 August.
Ombudsman: The Demagia of a compulsory health insurance model with an additional financial burden does not hold citizens with any criticism.
Any demagogy about compulsory health insurance, which would impose a direct and high payment burden on citizens, does not hold any criticism, is considered by law guard Juris Jansons.
Jansons met with health ministers Anda Chucka today to discuss the health sector.
After a meeting, Jansons told journalists that the sector financing model proposed by the Minister of Health was sustainable and developed and made it more accessible to patients.
He noted, however, that there had to be additional healthcare funding in this case, as this is not enough at the moment.
Jansons also stressed that any demagogy of compulsory health insurance, which would impose a direct and high burden of payment on citizens, does not hold any criticism, especially if the Dutch model is called upon.
Janson said that the Netherlands spends 11% of its gross domestic product on health, while Latvia is only 3%.
Thus, the government and the parliament must be sufficiently responsible to realise that this point of freezing must be raised, expressed by the Ombudsman and added that otherwise the model offered by the Ministry of Health (VM) will not work.
Chucka thanked the Ombudsman for his support and pointed out that the main concern was that the patient should be with the doctor, which in turn means that the health care system needs additional funding.
The Minister noted, however, that the additional EUR 35 million planned next year would only be possible to do the most acute things for oncological patients and for maternity professionals.
Consequently, the SRM has developed a plan and submitted a request for an additional EUR 41 million to be allocated to healthcare in order to reduce the line between professionals and investigations.
"A question of priorities, whether or not there will be funds," said Chuckha.
However, this sum does not include the increase in remuneration for doctors.
Commenting on the fact that doctors are not excited that all three options for financing health care are being pursued by VM in the government, including an additional payment to patients, Chucka said that, when moving all three models, the government was given the opportunity to choose.
Jansons also noted that it was possible to demonstrate clearly that Latvia was not prepared to impose an additional burden on the population by driving all three models.
It has already been reported that VM will defend the option of financing health care, which does not imply an overall increase in the tax burden, however, requires that part of the social tax be shifted to health, according to the conceptual summary "On changing Latvian healthcare system financing model".
At the same time, the Ministry pointed out that the best option of financing health care will be chosen as a result of discussions by the end of September.
Local Arbby is ready.
Arbūzis has given up this year, admits Rolands Dambis, owner of Arājas, Grobiņa Municipality of Mezes.
Watermelons are already sold on Liepaja market.
Several early varieties have started, but the later tubers have fallen well, and the regional newspaper of Course Times reports.
"This year watermelons grow better than last year", says a large berry grower in Rucava district Artis Kusis.
In weather terms, this is also a much more favourable summer than the previous one, when it was cold and windy.
A guest show of Liepaja Theatre started in Riga.
On August 12th and 13th, a Liepaja Theatre will visit the Daile Theatre in Riga, offering audiences both the "Playman's Night" award or the nominated performances, as well as a bright intrigue - the Liepaja Theatre director Herbert Linge's monography, the portal "Delfi" informs the theatre representatives.
On the evening of August 12, the viewers will be shown the human drama "Zilon Man" inspired by the director Laura Groza-Ķibere.
It is a story of a real historical person - John Merik - who lived in Victorian London and was called Blue Man because of his inherited disease in his cell.
In the exhibition, actor Egons Dombrovskis represents the title, who received the nomination "The Night Game Actor" as the representation of Merika's role.
As critic Normunds Akot, as his performance described, Merick is the role "through the heart spent" in which the born image is not repeatable".
On 13 August, the Portreti edition will be offered to the audience.
The performance was received by six "Playman Night" nominations, including "The Year's Large Form Show".
The director created the institution as a kind of portrait gallery, giving equal importance to every image of the plays, so each one of them is the center and the background.
The performance consists of a number of mini shows, which finally binds together into a single whole.
It is a observation of human nature, where the main conflict lies between true emotions and cold estimates, revealing the fact that a person is changing in different situations - each of the heroes is a wolf, who, for the sake of his own well-being, is tearing down the surrounding, sometimes a sheep that is broken by someone else.
On both of these dates, Herbert Linge, Director of Liepaja Theatre, will play the mono-exhibition "A man from the elevator" in Gaļinas Poliščuks.
This is not a sad story, but a full story of humor about how the elevator becomes the only friend of a person.
Despite the stylistics of the cemetery, which dominate the performances in the visual image, the dominant intonation of the institution is, however, light and even optimistic.
"A man who drives away from the elevator" is not about loneliness and age determination, but about love of life.
Even if it feels like there's nothing to do with it, critic Līga Ulberte wrote about the show.
Tickets are available in the box offices and on the Internet.
Detective Olga: My job is not a serial but a real life.
Olga Zelika - owner and investigator of the Riga Detective Agency is waiting for me on halfway.
She laughs loudly and leaves a very positive impression of a person.
A very elegant woman in a white panties and in a white jacket, who takes all my views of what a woman-detects should be.
She looks forward to me with a champagne, from which I will kindly refuse.
I told her that I used to talk to her, because it seemed interesting to me that a woman was dealing with such an unusual thing.
This has always been the work of men.
Olga has a higher legal education - a master's degree.
He used to work in criminal police.
Having understood that they want something to do and have established their own company.
The knowledge of it is limited to it.
"In Poland I really didn't want to go back," Olga says.
It's a routine.
There, in the criminal police, we investigated things, collected information.
We're working with suspects.
"This year we celebrate the tenth anniversary of "Riga Detective Agency"".
She calls on the anniversary celebrations: "There will be no drinking."
Everyone is promised people.
Asked about her business, Olga says this: "Business is very specific."
For the first five years, I had a team.
After that, I realized that the team was sometimes dangerous.
This is a business where if someone is not professionally working, you may find yourself in a very bad situation.
If journalists have the fifth power, we are the second.
The sphere is certainly not simple.
Many try to deceive us because we are involved in the fraud of our mates.
That's what people think!
Many come and ask whether or not you can impose eavesdropping devices to attract dogs.
Many have seen films.
Detective business is serious.
"It's a collection of information," Olga says.
If there is a crime by law, I must be warned about it.
We take the green tea and laugh at it, at least, so that there's a cup of tea to stick to, and you'll have to talk to.
I've had a client whose husband is always hurt.
She looked for protection, of course.
We also have security.
Her husband was manic.
At first everything is beautiful and good, but then begins.
"It's the worst," Olga says.
Psyhe is broken, and it happens that you can be treated as a pilot.
This may end up being bad.
Not God, with suicide.
It's very dangerous.
People become victims at some point.
"Two women are trying to leave their families and then come back again", she says.
I refused my last order.
"It happened for the first time in my life," Olga reveals.
There was such a strange situation.
She was married, she had a son.
"His husband struck his son and made him disabled," Olga remembers.
I believe that a woman has a mother's instinct, and first of all, she must protect her children.
When it all happened, she came to me, asking me to get out of that man.
There are people who are possessed with reproviousness.
The most terrible thing is that Mother turned her eyes to it.
I can't understand that.
Her child is now disabled.
We once couldn't find a body, and the dog helped a lot.
The drug department cannot do without the dogs at all.
"I understand that there are adequate people and there are those who do not have a healthy psycho," she says.
Of course, the facts of fraud are relevant.
Or the family is divorced and information is to be collected.
Find out who the guilty party is.
The last thing to me has been the topic when friends have deceived other friends.
It's interesting, because sometime men are smiling, now women.
Even the best friends are fighting!
Women's friends "put an end" for 100 or more thousands of euros.
Women need to be careful when they go abroad, because they can be sold in slavery.
"Latvian women are intelligent and have a lot of trust," Olga thinks.
There have been cases where couples travel abroad for a second marriage.
It's not right.
Olga says that she had a man like Jesus Christ.
Long body, long hair.
When I was 22, there was a tragedy.
He had a severe head injury.
He returned like a completely different person.
"I drew him," Olga remembers.
It could be compared to hell, it was terrible.
Asked what is the most unusual thing to face, Olga says: "All are special, but it's the hardest thing to use trust."
When the nigga's "lost" the nigga.
You take it and don't give it back.
If you have legal education and experience in the police, you can work as detective.
"One thing is to feel like a detective, the other to be," Olga says.
Situations of infidelity are crazy, because women are often not prepared to solve the situation.
They are not ready to accept the result.
This is an unforeseen situation because a person is not prepared to lose his family.
Not every woman is ready to accept reality.
Often, young girls who feel the taste of money use rich married men.
One man who followed his wife said that she could not have her favorite, because all her wives have cheated on her.
"He was married three times," Olga remembers.
So, then, there's a man's problem if all the wives cheat on him.
Olga tells about a woman who left her husband with all her children, and she asked him if he had ever raised his hand against her.
In general I always put him in position, he responded.
In such cases, I refuse to work.
I find it interesting how things are solved - whether photos are taken and shown to the spouse if there is evidence of fraud.
How does this happen?
"In parallel to the detective work there exists protection of personal data", Olga says.
This is a provocative question.
One law allows you to do everything, the other does not allow anything.
We may take such photographs and videos for personal interest, but not for public inspection.
If material which does not comply with the law is submitted to the court, there may be major problems.
Education and experience are not enough to become detective, but also need to be physically healthy and meet the criteria.
We don't have fingerprints, the police are doing this.
I tell customers - disconnect from the series, here is a real life!
In fact, when I was working in the (police) system, I also had to use dogs, they helped them very much.
"Narcotics can't work without dogs at all," Olga says.
Some clients turn to me in connection with murder investigations, but I don't like to take such things.
These are very difficult things.
Now there are more and more clients of men, because women tend to laugh at over men.
There was some other time.
Now women are entertaining, but men are sitting at home with children.
"Olga, of course, suffers the most well-equipped people", so Olga.
I like Dale Carnegie.
He says, stop worrying and start living in reality.
We all know the paranoid that if you hit one face, you have to cut the other, but you can't!
I have to say you're having trouble with that.
This cannot be done.
Do not be afraid to lose what interferes with living!
You must not become a little ant, and in addition to us, what we do with ourselves is happening.
Yeah, my first thing was directly connected with the husband's infidelity when a woman was not ready to accept the fact that a man cheated on him.
She always called and asked what to do to her.
"I'm now asking all the customers if they're ready to accept the situation when they find out that their husband really cheats on them," Olga says.
It's not entertainment, it's life.
If you come and pay detective, you have to take responsibility.
It's not a theatre, a show, but a real life.
I'm also supposed to be a specialist.
It is a heart thing and associated with Japanese medicine – hand treatment.
That is a very interesting point.
Why have I started doing this?
This is due to a large amount of adrenaline, and you need something to calm down.
Reiki not only calms down, but restores energy, lights.
"People leave my office positively and satisfied", Olga says.
She needs signs at the wall office, and Olga says that they are written by fingers rather than by brush.
I didn't just get into it, the book about the need fell into my hands literally.
I felt it as a sign.
However, this is very personal.
Learn more about you here.
The egg's singing.
It's her open fun.
All of us fear creativity.
From 11 years on, I played guitar.
I've recorded songs and clips.
I'm positive and smile, but you have to rest to rebuild.
Others are saving alcohol, I need alcohol.
Alcohol's falling.
In the police, it is much used because the work is full of stress.
"This causes aggression, and the moves can be unpredictable", she says.
I'm interested in sports and needing.
For 15 years, I worked with tennis.
I also liked walking with horses.
I turned off in nature articles, I would like to write a book.
Detective work is a delicate boundary when work enters your life.
"It's a job that shouldn't be put into life," she says.
Asked how you can combine work with private life, Olga says: "My beloved man is located in Italy."
We have a very strong feeling.
It must be the most real love in my life.
I need to think about him, and I feel better.
Detectives usually don't trust, but he's accepted my job.
Actually, I separate my work from private life.
I haven't got into this business either.
Reiki has directed me.
Even when I was a child, I saw more than others.
Needs open the intuition.
There are many detectives, but those who actually work - few.
In any case, it is a work with the brain, and it is hard to turn off.
You also need rest.
"You can't restore the institution," Olga admits.
The worst case I've worked on is the story of Constanci.
I'm working on that thing for a year.
A man literally laughed at that woman.
I did so that a child with Mom left for England - away from danger.
There was no other option.
We must not regret ourselves.
We're looking for compassion.
This cannot be done.
We should be happy about every day that we have.
We should thank God.
Every day three good things have to be said to someone else.
Take a good job or a day for yourself.
We should not do that with men.
It's a big mistake.
It must be understood that we have a man, not a child, and we need him to care for us.
If it's not right, you have to turn around and leave.
You can go to church, and it has helped me very much.
Don't have to be a fanatic, but do what you like and help.
Nothing will change unless changed, move away, and change your life.
Under no circumstances should you be in danger of yourself and your children.
You don't have to sit down and wait for something.
People are created to do good and to support each other.
If God created us, we are already in need and not in vain in this world.
Never should you sit on site!
The best way to prepare for a family photo session.
The summer is still in full swing, as is the current year of study, which families can have in their photos.
In order for everyone to look happy and beautiful, it is worth considering how to prepare a photo session in advance.
"Ihappymama" gives advice to a multi-child mom Aleksandrs Nesterenko and professional photographer Marina Levickaja.
We have to take a picture of nature, because it is much more natural and harmonious.
In the study, children find it much harder to feel and relax.
It is recommended to choose a uniform dress style for the whole family, preferably in a single color gamma.
For example, Alexander says that she chooses clothing for all six family members in such a way that the clothes do not contain more than three colors in tones and as little as possible inscriptions on the clothing.
Don't forget to have a good mood.
Have fun, joking, playing, but never denying and unpsiho if children are not immediately obedient as they would like.
And here's the next tips from the show of a professional photographer!
You have to understand exactly what you want to capture during a photo session and tell the photographer about it.
For some, they will be beautiful, akuroted children and perfectly formed family picture, for others - "life is what it is" - i.e. you will want to see true, true emotions, or, as the photographer himself loves, "refugeing back", "catching eyes", "catched by fuel".
Of course, it happens that someone wants "two in one," too, but it happens rarely.
In any case, when going to a photo session, it must be understood that it's just a couple of hours from your life, and the less you'll be penned, the better.
You are yourself - there is no strict mom who works, prepares to eat, educates and so on, and no living dad who constantly speaks on the phone.
And not the man who lives in you behind any unknown shell.
Be a family, remember how great it is for one another to be humiliating, smiling, and laughing.
And then the role of the photographer will only be to capture the true moments of emotions that prevail between you.
If you have chosen a photographer, trust him.
Stopping 250 times ask for a show of what has come, listen to his counseling choice of clothing, place for better frames.
Tie and make up all the clothes you need in advance so that you don’t need to do it on the day of your photosession.
Plan the route and think about how long you will need to get to the location of the photosession, especially when taking a photo in a study and the time is limited.
If you have little children, choose a photo series of days that correspond to the derived daily routine so that it does not happen at a time when the baby normally sleeps.
And, of course, do not forget to take with your children food, biscuits, water and favorite toys (mantas and sweets to use only in extreme situations).
Dads prepare that he may need to remove socks, but they do not usually write such advice, and only photographers know what the problem is, Marina admits.
Do not drink much water before the photosession and it will lie down well.
It would also be advisable to share some entertainment with all after the photosession.
Go to the theme park, eat some ice cream, get in touch with barbecue - which the family likes more.
So at the same time, you will have gained great pictures and pleasant memories of a total day spent.
Krasnoopjorovs and Fadeyeva: Raising the minimum wage - a miracle or a brake for the economy?
The issue of raising the minimum wage in public discussions has almost either the status of a saint cow: either the need to support an increase or the mention of any unscrupulous, general phrases.
In view of the significant increase in the risk of economic stagnation (the only thing we avoided from the technical recession), it is important to stress that the raising of the minimum wage is not a miracle that will reduce income inequality by one means, will bring Latvia's wages to Western European level and will fulfil the state budget.
On the contrary, if the minimum wage is raised too much, it is more damaging than the benefits, as it reduces the competitiveness and employment of companies, especially in sectors and regions with low incomes.
At first glance, despite several increases in minimum wages during the post-crisis period, the minimum wage in Latvia does not seem to be so high that raising up to the usual few decades of euro per year would significantly weaken the competitiveness of businesses - just EUR 370, while in some countries of the European Union (EU) the minimum wage is about one and a half thousand.
However, a different picture emerges if you compare it with the average wage in the country (%): the minimum wage in Latvia (44%) exceeds the EU average.
As the percentage of the minimum wage recipients in Latvia is significantly higher than in neighbouring countries (in Latvia 17%, in Lithuania 11%, in Estonia 6%[1]), a comparable increase in the minimum wage is binding on most companies.
According to the results of the survey of Latvian Bank companies, each fifth Latvian company replied that, with the increase in the minimum wage in early 2014, it was important or very important to increase the prices of products.
This means that, firstly, the increase in the minimum wage was partly financed by consumers (i.e. Latvians); secondly, the increase in prices for several companies meant a loss of competitiveness both on the domestic market and abroad (i.e. an increase in imports and a limited export).
Due to lower competitiveness and more smoking production, it was important for almost every 15 Latvian companies to lay off their employees (which means greater unemployment and emigration).
In addition, almost every eleventh company replied that it was important for him to limit the recruitment of new workers as a result of raising the minimum wage.
It is worth remembering that in 2011-2013 the minimum wage in Latvia remained unchanged.
Therefore, even if, in assessing the raising of the minimum wage in 2014, each fifth company noted as important the improvement of productivity, this does not mean that similar results could be expected in 2017 (the fourth increase in the minimum wage could lead to productivity gains in turn).
Another important result is that due to the rise in the minimum wage, it was important for several companies to increase the remuneration of employees who earn more than the minimum wage.
The impact of the minimum wage was therefore significant even for companies where none of the employees received the minimum wage.
In recent years, the rise in the minimum wage in all three Baltic States exceeded the increase in nominal labour productivity (real labour productivity + inflation).
The further increase in the minimum wage (even though overall rather low in terms of euro) is not justified by the rise in labour productivity will negatively affect the competitiveness and employment of enterprises.
When assessing the relevance of raising minimum wages, it is not enough to analyse economic averages alone.
It should also be assessed whether raising the minimum wage is "permissible" in sectors and regions where the minimum wage is most frequently used.
The results of the survey of the Bank of Latvia show that the number of employees with minimum wages is highest in small enterprises (the number of employees is between 10 and 19; 25%).
At the end of 2013, the share of employees in industry and services with minimum wages was higher (16% and 19% respectively) than in trade (15%), construction (11%) and the financial and insurance sectors (2%).
On the other hand, Latgale, where the minimum wage is 64% of the average wage (and more than two thirds of the average wage in the private sector), its further rise may be damaging by reducing labour demand (i.e. maintaining already high unemployment) and promoting the shadow economy's resilience.
Some of the signs show that in 2014-2015 the rise in the level of the minimum wage has been slowed down (total by 27%) in Latgale.
For example, Latgale is the only region of Latvia where unemployment was higher in 2015 than in 2013.
It should be noted that Estonia and Lithuania do not have any region that would significantly lag behind average wages from the rest of the country.
In Estonia, for example, the average wage in all regions is at least twice the national minimum wage.
In Lithuania, the lowest wage is in the Taurage region, but also there was a minimum wage of 54% of the average wage in 2015 (after two rapid increases in the minimum wage could reach 58 % in 2016).
In the public debate, the call from time to time to raise the minimum wage up to 68% of the average wage in the country (see for example here) lacks economic justification and cannot be implemented either in the short term or in the long term.
Firstly, such a high figure of average wages, or even so close to it, does not exist in any EU country.
Secondly, this would mean raising the minimum wage above average wage in a number of economic sectors (which would mean bankruptcy and mass redundancies for businesses in these sectors), such as clothing, leather production, fish processing, catering and veterinary services; and this is more than the current average wage in the private sector in Latgale.
Raising the minimum wage from January 2017 to EUR 400-410 per month, as currently offered by the Ministry of Welfare, would make the minimum wage in Latvia (% of the average wage) one of the highest in the EU.
If nominal productivity increases by 4% and the minimum wage is at least twice as rapid, this has a clear negative impact on business competitiveness and employment.
Such negative effects will be most widespread in sectors and regions where the current minimum wage is often used, for example, in Latgale.
The fact that we cannot afford a substantial increase in the minimum wage at the moment means that other mechanisms should be used to support the beneficiaries of low wages.
The immediate effect can be achieved by moving the tax on personal income to an exempt minimum (within the limits of the budget).
Insufficient education, inadequate education and poor quality of acquired education, as well as unsatisfactory health condition (often due to the expensive and long lines of medical services) are mentioned among the real causes of income inequality.
During the survey, 521 Latvian companies responded to the increase in the minimum wage in January 2014.
The survey took place within the framework of the Wage Dynamics Network (WDN) project.
These figures represent companies with a workforce of not less than 10.
This also explains the low share of employees with minimum wages in construction.
During the last night, 11 fires were recorded in Latvia, as demonstrated by operational information of the State Fire and Rescue Service (VUGD).
In terms of identity, the biggest fires were detected in Ogres region of Ogresgals parish, where a single-storey apartment was burned in an area of 80 square metres and on Dzelzkelmalas Street in Jēkabpils, where with an open flame there was burned with a broken cut of 30 square meters.
On Thursday firefighters also went to calls that burned waste, tires, two cars, building wall and ceiling, barbecue, dwelling roof, and unattended food.
During the day, the service has also participated in 21 rescue work.
No fatalities, victims or rescued people are reported.
In total, during the last day, VUGD responded to 38 calls, six of which were misleading.

The Russian Vice Prime Minister meets the ministers of the STECF secretly in Riga.
The Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev Arkadijs Dvorkovics met with three ZS politicians at the fish processing plant "Kija" last week - Minister of Finance Dans Reiznieks-Ozols, Minister of Transport Uldi Augulis and Minister of Agriculture Jānis Dūklavs, on Friday's "sights.lv".

In contrast to diplomatic practice, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not been involved in the conversation.
He has justified this because he has not seen such a need, 'that's where the Minister of Foreign Affairs is on vacation', writes the portal.

The legendary editor, Hafingtone, leaves "The Huffington Post".
Arianna Hafington, co-founder and editor of U.S. media holding "The Huffington Post", has announced 11 years of work leaving the company.
The "The Huffington Post" award, created in 2005, and awarded by the Pupler Prize, which offers serious political and economic journalism every day, as well as ensuring that Internet sensations are reflected in entertainment information, is considered a factor in the development of the media at a time when digital technology solutions developed rapidly.
The media offered innovative and interactive content solutions for his time, already starting in 2005, in a situation where Twitter was not yet available, but the feisbuks was popular only among students at national colleges.
Shortly after George Bush, a representative of the Republican Party, re-election as President of the United States, Hafington did not hide that media journalists represented liberal values, and such a world view would also produce news material.
Now Hafingtone's Twitter shows that after leaving, she is going to start a new business - she is planning to create a startup "Throw Global" to solve workers' health and overloading issues.
For the time being, it is not known who could take her place under the direction of The Huffington Post.
During her life, the portal withdrew from the anonymous comments, stressing to Hafington that freedom of expression is granted to people who claim what they say and who do not hide behind anonymity.
She also decided to publish news on the entertainment section of the US presidential candidate Donald Trump in summer 2015.
It is true, in late 2015, that Trampa's rhetoric is dangerous for American society, and information about the odiozo candidate was again published in the policy section.
It was reported that in 2011 US Internet Media Group AOL decided to purchase a fast-growing news website "The Huffington Post", visited by almost 25 million readers each month at the time of the transaction.
The transaction amounted to $315 million.
In 2015, the telecommunications giant Verizon bought AOL of USD 4.4 billion.
In 2016, Verizon also bought parts of Yahoo's internet business.
With these transactions The Huffington Post, an influential and independent tree, became a small fraction of a giant corporation.
Currently, the contents of the famous media are available in nine international versions, with a total monthly unique number of visits of 81 million.
Four people were killed in attacks in Thailand.
Nine explosions of at least four people were killed and several dozen injured, announced by the authorities, on Friday, in the resort cities of Thailand and in southern provinces of the country, over the last 24 hours.
Two explosions occurred in the province of Sucrathan in the south of Thailand on Friday about eight o’clock after the local time.
One bomb exploded in a flower in front of the sea police building, killing a municipal worker and hurting a man, announced Vongsiri Promčana, the Provincial Governor in Sucrathani.
"I think it's about explosions in Huahin," said the Governor.
The second explosion took place in front of the province police station.
In the south of Thailand, two explosions took place on Friday morning on the island of Phupet.
On Friday morning, two bombs exploded in Huahin at the call tower, killing one and hurt three people.
As reported earlier, on Thursday night, in the resort town of Huahin, two explosions took place, killing one woman and hurting 19 more people, including foreigners.
The woman killed in Huahin on Thursday was Thai.
Of the 19 injured, three were in a serious position, and seven of the injured were foreigners - four women and three men.
The bombs in Huahin were hidden in two flower fairs 50 feet [50 m] each other.
The sparks were detonated with mobile phones with half an hour difference.
Before that Thursday, one man died at an explosion in the province of Trana in the south of Thailand.
Policists rescue babies from car overhanging; parents are threatened with courtwork as a suffocation of glass.
In Riga yesterday, the municipal police saved the silky from a hot car, while the children’s parents threatened with judicial work about the broken glass of the car, the agency LETA informed the Riga Municipal Police (RTP).
A busy man ran to the patrol yesterday, saying that a car was spotted at the Spice shopping centre where a baby was staying for half an hour without an adult.
On arrival, an eyewitnessed car was found, which was parked in the sun.
The front passenger seating position was equipped with a baby seat.
The child was tortured directly on the sun rays.
The infant was loud and intensively breathed, and his face was red and watered.
Given that the owner did not appear on the ground, a decision was taken immediately to remove the rear glass from the vehicle in order not to endanger the health and life of the infant.
The child with the whole seat shall be highlighted from the hot vehicle and shall be summoned by a medical officer.
The child breathed a shallow, the skin was red and hot, so the guards applied a cool compression on their forehead until medical arrival.
Medical and child - parents arrived almost simultaneously at the event site.
The baby’s father, seeing the broken window in his vehicle, remained aggressive and the doctors did not allow the child to be present.
Parents discussed and explained that one child under seven is prohibited from being left without supervision.
In addition, the child was left in health and life - threatening conditions.
After the medical discussions, the victim was examined and hospitalization was found not to be necessary.
The parents of the child, however, strongly refused to give any explanations of what had happened and threatened with judicial action regarding the glass of a failed car.
During conversations with parents, there were no indications that they were under alcohol influence or that they would otherwise harm the child, so a infant who was aged less than four months was placed in both care.
File materials are sent to the Child Offence Prevention Division, whose employees will assess parental responsibility.
RPP reminds us that even if the outside is not very hot, a car left in the sun heats very quickly.
If a child or a domestic animal is left in such a car, their lives may be put at risk.
LPF members could request that Poni be suspended.
Members of the Latvian Floating Federation (LPF) could in the near future request the removal from office of the President of the Federation of Latvia of the head Caspary Poni, as well as the former Vice President of the Federation told LETA.
He said that, in the light of the criticisms of Poni and his activities in the Federation over recent days, several members of the LPF had signed a letter asking the LPF Assembly, which is the highest federal institution, to decide on any question raised by the LPF general meeting.
The members of the Federation are not satisfied with the master's style; moreover, he's going to Rio de Janeiro Olympics, which in turn did not have the opportunity to go to the record of Latvia to Alona Ribakova's coach, German Jakukovski, who was right on the Olympics stage, is regarded as an unethical and unworthy act by the President.
He pointed out that members of the LPF, as well as the Secretary General of the Federation Aivars Platonov, had done great work for the development of the federation and sport, but the contribution of Mr.
A gentleman who has worked for a long time in the Federation explained that the Federation was an attempt to concentrate power in the hands of one person.
Consequently, the members of the federation could also request amendments to the statutes governing the operation of the LPF, which would exclude such possibility in the future.
He explained that the dissatisfiedness with Mr.'s work in the Federation had been in place for a long time, however, the events of the last days had served as the members of the "last castle" Federation to decide that action should be taken.
The former vice-president of the Federation said that during the period of operation of Mr. Sir, the activities of the coach and the Council of judges were greatly reduced.
He explained that in order to ensure faster process and decision-making in the Federation, the members of the LPF decided at a general meeting to grant permission to the Executive Board, consisting of Mr.
However, as Dzeni acknowledged, Mr. Sir was deceived by fellow members of the Federation.
The members of the Federation trusted the Lord, believing that this would allow the Federation to make decisions more quickly.
"He discredited the trust of his fellows because he almost took authority in his hands by taking an unethical step," said Zeny.
"This attitude cannot be from the person who should serve as an example to other sports representatives," Benis admitted.
In his view, Mr. President-in-Office has tried to satisfy his ambitions, which in turn does not honor him as the President of the LPF.
Long-term Secretary-General of LPF Vladimir Maslovskis told LETA that a letter to the federation could be submitted next week, so that the LPF general meeting should be held within a month.
In his opinion, the general meeting is 'to talk about all the painful issues' and to decide on the way forward.
On Friday, it was not yet known that LPF members plan to convene a general meeting in which they could decide on his removal from office.
I don't know anything about calling such a meeting for the moment, so I have no comments.
As regards the dissatisfiedness of my work, so far there has been only one case, with the coach Jakubovskis, mentioned above, when some disappointment has been expressed.
Before the London Olympics, when Ribakova was not approved among the participants, he complained to the International Water Sport Federation (FINA) and invited Latvia not to send a sportsman.
"After this case Jacubovskis lost the position of the senior trainer of the sample, because his actions did not meet LPF's interests either," said Mr.
He also stressed that no complaints had been received so far at the meetings of members of the LPF at which they had accounted for their progress.
"On the contrary, we have received recognition that the quality of the work of the federation has improved," said the President of LPF.
He also explained that he had not been able to entertain, but to work, at Rio de Janeiro Olympics.
More people in Latvia are not clear and they do not understand what the functions of the presidents of the federations are.
People do not understand that we are voluntiers in these positions and, for example, unlike the leaders of the Latvian Olympic Committee (LOC), we do not receive salaries.
At the same time, we need to make sure that the sports federation has sufficient funding, as LPF only receives 10% of the amount needed from the country.
During the Olympic Games, I have had formal and informal meetings with representatives of the International Federation and various international programs, including international sponsors.
"I have also entered into negotiations and work on one of the stages of the World Cup in Riga in 2018", said Sir.
According to data from "Firmas.lv" portal, the revenues of LPF totalled 249 444 euros in 2015, which is less than 36 000 euros more than in 2014.
About 40% of this amount last year was the target grant received, an increase of around EUR 10 000 compared to 2014.
Also, in the form of membership, accession and other annual contributions, the LPF received some 43% more revenue, or 109 442.
Last year the Federation received a further EUR 35,532 in terms of donations and gifts.
Last year's spending in the Federation increased by about 70 000 euros compared to 2014, spending totalled 263 876 euros in 2015.
Most of the expenditure was not related to payments of money to individuals, to expenditure on materials or to salaries - 215 733 EUR is shown as "other expenditure" in the report.
People's money payments cost EUR 20 549, while salaries paid EUR 14 684.
If the 2014 Federation had concluded with a positive balance, then the 2015 LPF concluded with a negative balance.
According to the report, the Ministry of Education and Science (IZM) requested clarification to the Latvian Olympic Committee (LOK) on the participation of the President of the LPF in Rio de Janeiro Olympics, to which the Latvian swimmer Ribakova coach Jakukovskis has not left.
Latvian nationals have not suffered during the explosions in Thailand, as evidenced by the entry of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (HIS) on the social website on Twitter.
The Ministry indicated that according to the information held by the Honorary Consul of Latvia in Thailand, Latvian nationals have not suffered during explosions.
LETA has already stated that it calls on travelers to keep track of the development of the political and security situation in the country on a regular basis, as well as to be aware of the security of the place of stay, pointing out that there is a high threat of terrorism in the country.
Latvian CACs are invited to avoid gathering places, to be particularly careful and attentive when they are staying in public places, and to follow the instructions of local authorities.
The Ministry invites travellers who are in the resorts of Thailand or plan to go there to contact tour operators or airlines, specifying whether the journey will be carried out according to the plan.
The Ministry also invites travellers to follow regularly information about the development of the political and security situation in the country, as well as to ensure the security of the place of stay.
There is a high threat of terrorism in the country.
In view of the precarious security situation in the country, they are not recommended to travel to the border between Thailand and Cambodia, as well as to the provinces of Thailand and Malaysia at the border of Patan, Jal, Narathivat and Sonkhla.
In an emergency, the Ministry invites you to contact a daily Deputy Officer of the Consular Department by phone: +371 26 33 77 11 or e-mail: palidziba@mfa.gov.lv.
SOME also strongly advises anyone travelling abroad before travelling to obtain life and health insurance policies, which also provide for repatriation in the event of sickness or death, as well as registration in the Consular Register.
The Messiah, however, will not leave Argentina’s football selection.
The football superstar Lionel Mei, however, after a brief reflection, decided to return to Argentina's state unit, announced on Friday the player himself.
In July, the selection of Argentina for the second year in a row suffered a failure in the Copa America tournament final, reaccepting Chile’s superiority in the decisive match.
Immediately after he lost, Messie announced that he had finished his career in the State, but then he was reported to be able to return to the sample.
"I think seriously about the possibility of leaving the sample, but my love for Argentina and the selection of the sample are too great," said the 29-year-old Messiah.
The Spanish grand Barcelona attacker at the Messie State Unions in total, in 112 games, received 55 gates, which is the best indicator of all time.
Together with the adult sample, the Mesi has not made great progress, although Argentina became a vice-champion of the world in 2014.
They're five times called the world's best footballer.
For Chinese Ghus and Iron, double victory over Rio 20 km of elevating distance.
On Friday, the Chinese Soulers Vans Dzels and Cai Dzelins won a double victory for Rio de Janeiro in the Olympic Games of 20 kilometres.
The Olympic Champion was crowned by Dean, who did his distance at an hour in 19 minutes and four seconds, at the finish of 12 seconds ahead of Iron.
In turn, the Australian Souler Dean Burd-Smit, who lost the Gang to 23 seconds, won a bronze fight.
Kai Bonfim, a favorite householder, corrected Brazil’s record, but he missed five seconds to climb to the honorary hall.
Four years ago, he won a bronze award in London.
He also has two silver medals in World Championships on the same distance.
Judo coach Baskin: Niikiforenko is not the real heavyweight.
The Latvian juddy coach Oleg Baskin admitted in good faith that Arthur Nikiforenko had almost no chance of overcoming Ušangi Kukauri, the most difficult Azerbaijani athletes.
In practice, there was no minimal chance of being caught by a technique or a parter.
We had planned to do so.
When he was ready, he was right, but the enemy was stronger.
The opponent was well - known, because Nikiforenko had already fought against him twice and both Arthur lost.
He's tougher, though.
Arthur is artificially thrown into the heaviest category of weight to enter the Olympic team.
As weight category up to 100 kilograms was already busy, Arthur used the European quota in heavy weight category.
With a weight of 100 pounds, Arthur fought against a judist, which has a couple of pounds [140 kg] and has already won a serious tournament.
In the heavy weight category, at all times, there is very little random.
If the light weight categories are going through all kinds of turnarounds, then in the heavy - very rare.
The question whether Niikiforenko would be better fighting one step in the easiest weight category in the future was answered by Baskin.
I think yes - Arthur would have better fight in the category up to 100 kilograms.
It is his real weight category.
He's not the real heavyweight.
65% of Venezuelans want to leave Maduro, the question is whether they are ready to fight for it.
Two of the three Venezuelans want to leave President Nicholas Maduro, but the question is whether they are ready to fight for it.
The day after the National Election Board announced that "no time" for the withdrawal of the vote that took place this year, which will bring Chavismo to power until 2019 - people on the streets of Karakas continued their usual course of the day as if nothing had happened.
"I didn't hear the news because I watched the Olympics and how Michael Felips got two more medals," said Rafael Deian, a 36-year-old office worker who rested on Wednesday in Altamira Square.
In early 2014, the Altamira Square, located in the east of Karaka, was an epic centre of sharp unrest in which he protested against the Maduro regime.
However, now that the opposition has to exert more pressure than ever to achieve a referendum this year, people are no longer showing such energy throughout the country.
"I want a referendum, but for security reasons I will not take part in the protests," Deian said.
Others, more informed, want to mobilise in the future, but admit that Venezuelans are not so motivated.
The Chairman of the Election Board Tibiseus Lusen comments that the government is hindering the withdrawal process.
I will protest when the opposition will appeal to the protest, but I know that some of my friends are afraid," Roberto Reijess, (60), said Fox News Latino.
So, in addition to all the barriers that the government has imposed to delay the referendum, the opposition is now facing a new challenge: to motivate people to go out and protest.
Until recently, the referendum initiative had broad support - people arrived in unprecedented numbers during the collection phase of signatures.
However, when it comes to protesting against government moves to block efforts, the number of arrivals on myths is significantly smaller.
"Some people focus on food rowing, while others are afraid of arrests and deaths after 2014," said Cipriano Eredia, the legislator representing the opposition.
After Lucen announced that until the next step of the referendum process - an even greater number of signatures for collection across the country - it would have to wait until October, those against a socialist government say that President Maduro and his followers are simply trying to take away Venezuelan courage, making them believe that the vote this year is practically impossible.
According to the Constitution, if the referendum were to take place in 2017, Maduro could be suspended, but he would be allowed to name the next President.
If he is suspended today, he has the duty to declare general elections.
The U.S. Department of State addressed this issue in a Thursday afternoon notice inviting the Venezuelan authorities to guarantee respect for the constitutional rights of Venezuelans.
"The remaining steps to implement the President's abolition referendum must be taken in a clear, concrete and immediate manner, thereby contributing to a swift and effective resolution of the current political, economic and social difficulties of the country," it wrote.
Luis Salamanka, a political analyst who was a member of the electoral board between 2006 and 2009 that no change would be expected so soon.
"I think this year there will be no referendum unless social unrest and protests become even stronger," he said to the FNL.
He said that Lusen and the government violated the law, but as a result, they will achieve their goal if people do not speak out loudly.
In September, the opposition called for a wide-ranging manifesto. First, in Karakasa, to request an accelerated process to allow withdrawals to take place this year.
We want people from all over the country to be mobilised in the capital this day.
The government will feel pressure," said Eredia.
Salamanka, on the other hand, considers that this situation cannot be expected for so long.
"They should respond to the Lucen statement faster and stronger because it almost kills the referendum," said expert FNL.
Eredia, the Congress, admitted that some opposition parties would like to make the manifestation faster, while others would like more time to organise the group.
The opposition must now be cautious.
If people feel insecure in this situation, there is a risk that the activity of the second signature collection campaign will be low," said Salamanka.
In order to be activated, the reference process must be supported by twenty per cent of the national voters, which are almost 4 million people.
Salamanka and other analysts believe that even if the withdrawal took place in 2017, Chavismo will be saddened.
However, some people are not so optimistic.
Our party wants political changes today.
"If the government ends the way to the elections, we will have to explore other legislative options," Eredia said to the FNL.
The Director of the LNSC shall be suspended temporarily.
During the extraordinary sitting of the Lielais Vievare Municipality Council on 12 August, a majority of members supported the removal of Ainara Puķis, Director of Lielais Municipality Sport Centre (LNSD) from their duties for the duration of the inspection.
In the near future, it is planned to find out the conditions that a sports hall visitor wrote to the municipality in his application.
In particular, during the visit to the gym, the LNSC client had a head injury.
The blame is the Sports Centre of the Great Name District.
Due to the severity of the situation and the possible turn of the client to court, the commission created by the order of Vice-President Vitas Volontes of Lielvarde Municipality Council.
Its task is to perform a service inspection at the Sports Centre and to give an opinion by 16 August of this year.
The next Tuesday is scheduled to convene a special meeting of the Council to decide on further action.
It should be noted that during the accident in question A.Puķis was on vacation.
The Deputy Director of the Sports Centre from Friday to Friday is Oksana Grimaļuka-Nazarova.
Ogres seniors sport is a celebration.
Today, the Ogre district Sports Centre Stadium took place at the Ogre Pensioners' Society Sport Festival.
Sanita Tauriņa, the organizer of the Sport Development Work of the Ogres Regional Sport Centre, was welcomed at the Seniorus Stadium, which had prepared a special programme for the participants of the Sport Festival.
This time individual results will not be evaluated, but sports festival participants will be divided into four teams.
"Each member will lose investment as a result of the team", explains S.Tauriņa.
Participants will have to perform four tasks - basketball speed throws, construction of the Eiffel Tower together with memory game, florblow court, summer skiing.
In order to successfully activate all four programs in the disciplines, participants had to perform heating tasks - Unity circle, Rinķis dancis, "Expant", as well as three booths - riding with a horse, to perform the frissy and badminton elements.
All the tasks were prepared in an attractive form and were carried out by the participants of the sports festival with joy, smile and fun comments, supporting each other.
The summer skiing, which took place in the clothes prepared by the organizers, was a source of special joy.
The competition was followed closely by volunteers from the Ogre region Sport Centre who led tasks, recorded results and did not deny advice.
There was also the Ogres symbol of Chiekur, which inspired the participants of the Sport Festival.
Ogres seniors proved that they were active, attractive, and sport-friendly.
In one minute, the Green Team representative Pēteris Zeps put the ball in the right basket of basketball, but his team member Jānis Staujas left behind for only one effective litter.
Ogre pensioners are active.
Buses are always full of buses, about 300 people arrive at the parties.
"We meet once a week at the Family Support Centre, where we can play novus, table tennis, use training equipment," says Janis Staujas, Chairman of the Ogres Pensioners' Society.
At the end of the sports festival all participants received the Thanksgivings for participation of the Ogres region Sport Centre, but the biggest benefit is getting up in the fresh air, a good mood and time spent together.
2016/2017 Prime Minister No.19 West Bromwich Albion
Guardian journalists predict position 14: It is not just Alan Smith's forecast, but our journalist's advice as a whole)
Older season heading 14
Prospect to win the League with Oddschecker 1000-1
Until last week, it looked after a new season, such as the old Bromwich Albion: 2016/2017 season will again be fighting for satisfaction or stagnation, depending on how "blank is a glass" under the even more pragmatic leadership of Tonia Puliss.
But then Jeremy Piss sold 88% of his club's shares in Guočuan Nou and Pulis, in archaeologically safe hands, which Bukmeikers immediately made a favorite of the first unsatisfied manager.
The situation has undoubtedly changed in Balack Country - and not only in Hawthhorns, but also in a few miles north-west of the Volverhampton, where the new Chinese owners, while not spending time, refused Kenya Jaceta's services.
To confirm that his work is not immediately under threat, however, the entrepreneur has also expressed his desire to change the culture of the club.
"I don't want to change the club's habits or start unsustainable fun," he said, taking over duties.
I want to be a good owner and invest in this club in the long term.
First of all, our aim is to ensure that we stay in the Prime Minister and then get further, I would like to see the club firmly established at the top of the division.
I think it is the best league in the world, and I want to take this club as far as possible.
These are the achievements of Pulis, and the first aspect should not be a problem.
The next goal is to break to the top of the table, but it will be important for the new owner and the increasingly divided fan base to hope for a quick breakthrough in the table up to realise that this is an extremely complex task, given the thorough work done in recent times among the other teams in the adjacent table.
In order to go beyond the 14th place of the last season to get up, more work will certainly be needed.
Only Aston Villa, located in the lower end of the table, hits less gate, and it is worth recalling that at Christmas Albion, on average, did less than one beat in the gate in 90 minutes, almost the worst of the division.
They could not get a gate for 13 of 38 games, and they only run more than one gate in nine games.
Of their 10 wins, no game could get more than one gate, and seven games ended with 1-0.
As already expected, a dozen of 34 gates in total were taken from standard positions.
It is no wonder that the Hatthhorns team was in dissatisfied, perhaps most noticeable after the shocking 0-0 with Villa at the end of January, when the guest lady looked better.
On the other hand, only the six best teams had better indicators of protection - although no club has managed to list four of the centre's half-guards.
These guards are often undervalued, especially by Johnny Evans, whom Arsenal wants to get to, in the light of the recent crisis in terms of the injured players.
The international team in Northern Ireland experienced a great start at the European Championship, and Albion will have to be thoroughly wasted to sell.
Ben Fosters is reliable in the gates, and they are well-completed in the middle line.
Daren Fletcher, much like Evans, demonstrated to a large extent that he was still able to play on a high level at the age of 32, and Claudio Jacobs is undervalued.
To all sides, the future story of Sayo Berahino is still unclear.
Pisa’s owner’s stakes from Stoke and Crystal Palace were refused, but they still remain calm and Mark Hugh is ready to wait.
After the last season, close to liquidation is worth taking action by all the parties concerned.
The attacker is, of course, talented, but, as Puliss has already said several times, when he is called on the other side here, it has been seen for a long time that this relationship does not work.
Albion insists on the need to sign the transfer documents before allowing the former British sampleer U-21 to go, but his 15 million pound-value move with Diaffre Saho broke out a few days before taking over, claiming that he had passed the medical test and that everything was agreed, but he had a back injury, which would mean he would have to miss the beginning of the season.
This puts a great pressure on the Venezuelan Salomonon, who looked very hopeful for a moment last season, but he has to improve his nine gate performance, especially when Rikis Lamberts continues to be so inefficient.
The decision to release Victor Aničebi and Stefan Sesegnonu also looks strange.
Puliss throughout his entire career is sadly famous for his slow young player's push up and three titans - Jonathan Leko, Sam Fīld and Tyler Roberts' appearance in the last game of the previous season with an outstanding 1-1 with Liverpool, hardly becoming the norm.
He will return to the already tried and tested, but it is worth Leko to keep in sight.
The 17-year-old attacker, in general, participated in five matches in the previous season, becoming the first player to be born in 1999 in Prime Ministeralga, which is also highly appreciated in the British youth football system.
Matt Philips, with a contract of 5.5 million with Queens Park Rangers, will be fast, but he is the only young player who participated in the first race at the weekend.
This would not be encouraging to say if the end could be rather urgent.
"All," Puliss last month said Express and Star about what should be improved.
Every position you see.
We need to strengthen rear players, middle players and front players.
The objectives are, we know what we want.
They are more difficult to obtain than is intended, mainly because of uncertainty about the takeover processes.
The season could determine how they started with seven big winning games before the challenging race with Tottenham, Liverpool, Manchester City and Leicester from mid-October.
In the meantime, pressure on Pulis will have become smaller or unstoppable.
And who knows, maybe even Berahino will have found a new club.
Tata Steel UK closer to the rescue operation after the authorised change of support will
Post-Tata Steel UK pension trustees said that the scheme can be restructured without entering into the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), increasing the company's chances of closing a rescue transaction.
The British Steel Pension Scheme has a liability of GBP 15 billion and an estimated GBP 700 million deficit of at least, creating serious obstacles to the conclusion of a rescue transaction between Tata Steel UK and Port Talbot Steelworks in Wales.
Tata Steel is increasingly convinced of the future of British businesses employing 11 000 people after negotiations with the Minister of Economy and the pension regulator.
The company intends to combine its European activities, including British business with ThyssenKrupp, a German conglomerate.
However, the conclusion of the transaction depends on whether the British steel pension scheme will be restructured and the government will provide financial support.
Alan Johnson, the trustee of the pensions, said that this scheme would avoid the PPF if the benefits received by the employees were modified.
Although this is well-funded compared to other schemes, with a deficit limited to GBP 300 million for individual measures, Tata Steel and ThyssenKrupp wants to control their commitments.
Johnson said that the trustees admitted that it "is not real" to the joint venture or to any buyer of Tata Steel Uk to assume responsibility for financing the current and future deficit.
The modification of the benefits deriving from the scheme was a far more binding option than the accession to the PPF, and he added where employees would have to accept less favourable conditions.
Sources of Tata Steel warn that it could still be sold in Port Talbot.
The company has consistently refused to guarantee the future of steel industry since the start of the negotiations on its British business future in March, and it has been used as a short-term in negotiations with the British government.
Kushik, CEO of Tata Steel Europe, said that the Indian conglomerate wants to make its steel business more "sustainable".
Speaking to the cults at the Annual Meeting of Tata Steel in India, Charlie said that negotiations on the restructuring of pension schemes were progressing, but he insisted that the scheme was well-funded.
"We are talking to various stakeholders, including the British Government and other stakeholders, such as the Welles Government, etc.," said Chaterje, the Times of India.
It is believed that pensions have a certain impact on the business of goods such as steel, so we need to find a structural solution that does not hinder the business's progress.
The desire of the pension officer to cooperate in the negotiations on the restructuring of the scheme, Tata Steel, will be supported.
The potential changes in the scheme include redirecting the measurement of annual inflation-based increase in benefits from the retail price index to the lowest consumer price index as well as limiting future pension payments to the minimum prescribed by law.
Johnson added: "The full manager and its advisors have provided Tata Steel, the government and the pension regulator with evidence of the scheme's ability to pay modified benefits for an indefinite period and with a low risk level outside the Pension Protection Fund.
Our investment strategy has meant that the funding position of the scheme has not been affected by the recent drop in the securities market in the same way as in other British pension schemes.
CBS commentator mix Michael Feppsu and Ryan Lohti for the entire game
On Thursday evening, the commentator of the Canadian broadcast CBC Olympics made anger by mixing Michael Felips with his competitor Ryan Lohti.
Elliott Friedman both mixed the whole 200 m of individual swimming, which won Felips by fighting his 22. Olympic gold medal.
When Fulps crossed the line, Frīdman held him at the top of the world’s old swimmers’ top as Lohti, Felp’s national.
Fredman said, "He's going to do this."
Ryan Lohte will beat Michael Fepps in this race!
Felts might not even become on the honors of the podium.
However, Felips won, but Lohte was the fourth to finish.
Immediately after Fepps was at the gold, there was silence in the CBS broadcast.
Now, miraculously, a freeman acknowledged his mistake.
I'm sorry, I mixed my knees.
Fallow with gold," he said.
A Canadian commentator, whose professionalism on a wide scale was welcomed by mistake, once again recognised his mistake within the next hours after the event and apologised to the viewers on Twitter.
I'm sorry to everyone.
I was surprised.
"No excuse," he wrote.
In the meantime, Falps gained a record of 2 168 years old as the winner of the ever greater Olympic victory.
The earlier record belonged to Leonidas, from Rhodes Island, who had won more Olympic titles than anyone else in the Olympic Games.
Russian hackers have attacked the computer of the former NATO Force Commander.
Hakers published lists and data on one of the Soros Foundations by General Filip Bridlow.
The same hackers who could have been attacking the U.S. Democrat Party's e-mails and publicising its lists some time ago may also be responsible for a new series of attacks, reports the Bloomberg agent.
According to its information, these cyber-attacks attacked the correspondence of former NATO European Force Commander General Filip Braidlov and the services of the "Open Society" Institute, which form part of the projects supported by the millionaire George Soros.
The attackers have published the information gathered at DCLeas.com.
There is a bardlow's correspondence and data on the functioning of the Open Society Institute.
Hakers are reported to have been accessing fund computers for about a year.
The news agency claims that it is about the same hackers who attacked American Democratic Party computers and led by Russian speculators.
A year ago, a US intelligence service warned Congress's high officials of a possible hacker's attack on the Democratic Party.
Reuters news agency tells us that it has information to speculate at that time when a number of politicians told that cyber attacks are coordinated by two Russian intelligence agencies or their controlled organisations.
But the congressmen could not pass on this information to the victims of the cyber-attacks because it was secret.
The scandal of attacks on Democrat computers began after about 20,000 e-mails were published on the Internet, written by party representatives during the U.S. presidential election campaign.
Hilarija Klinton, the candidate party, announced that the release of these letters was organized by Russian specialties.
The Russian President's press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, has announced that Russia has nothing to do with cyber fighters.

Parking in the happiest place on Earth will be even easier in the future.
The Disneyland has presented information about its long planned parking structure, consisting of a transport hub and a new pedestrian bridge in the east side of the park.
The project, located in the east of the theme park near the 5 Freeway, includes 6 800 places of parking structure and transport hubs where buses, buses, taxis and other vehicles can skip visitors to the park.
The pedestrian bridge over port boulevards connects the recreation park with the parking structure and transport hub.
The structure together with the planned expansion project of the 14 acres of Star War Land, is part of the 1 billion US dollars for Anaheim city in exchange for 30 years of exemption from entertainment tax.
The construction of the project, which syncs with the Eastern Gates, will start next year.
The parking structure will be created over the Publa parking area of Disney’s hero, which is about 1 300 seats.
The transport hub will replace the commercial property acquired by the theme park in 2014.
The project is expected to be launched in 2018.
"The East Gate is part of our substantial investment in Anaheim, which will provide additional parking space for visitors and help to reduce congestion in the vicinity of the rest park by continuing to expand the Disney Island Recreation Park," said Disney representative Suzija Brauna.

In July, the heating of a house will have to meet two thirds of its population.
If the owners of the apartments are very harsh and specifically talking about the technical condition of the building, if it is possible to receive the aid and arrange the building in all possible ways, it is quite easy not to use it.
One of the most important changes is that any apartment house will be eligible for EU co-financing from this year, only the condition that the facade of the building must be heated.
Only serial apartment houses could use it in the past.
The most worried house managers are both supplied with the organization of apartment owners' meetings.
A major problem, where this process is currently taking time, is that 67% of apartment owners need consent.
"Previous program needed 51%", says Toms Cīrulis, Project Manager, SIA "Liepājas nadājas vārnieks" (LNA).
"Surely it is very difficult to ensure this because in most general meetings this amount of apartment owners does not appear", Gints Lochmels, project manager of "Namum Service APSE".
The largest house managers in Liepaja - "Namum Service APSE" and LNA, which serve about 900 buildings, plan to renovate at least 50 apartment buildings in the new planning period up to 2020.
They do not exclude the fact that at the beginning of the work it will be difficult to convince people to vote for renovation works, but the attitude of citizens should be improved with each project implemented.
I also needed a bank credit, 76% of the house population.
"Speaking on what will be - I still get them for signatures," says Senior Vita Isalniece of the most energy-efficient buildings in Latvia.
Janis agrees with her, who also lives in a warm building.
Well, you can't make half think, and the other half plus one person then disagrees.
"No, of course, it is important that everyone agrees with the event," noted Jānis.
This change was proposed by representatives of ALTUM of the financial institution.
They explain that with 51% of votes in banks, it is not possible to attract the necessary funding, which has been experienced in the last programming period as well.
In most commercial banks, two thirds of the owners of the apartments need certification.
As one of the recommendations to house managers, Anda Lagzdiņa, Head of the European Union Funds Unit of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, mentions the opportunity to present citizens with the existing examples and various benefits of renovation of buildings, such as energy saving.
In his youth Aaron had a long - term anger on the world for the death of his mother.
A potential suicide bomber detention operation in Canada was worthy of pressure films.
Everything started when the Canadian police received a video intercepted by the U.S. Federal Investigation Bureau.
Very early in the morning of the Royal of Canada, the police have received credible information from the Federal Investigation Bureau.
It contained, among other things, the so-called "engine" video recorded by an unknown person clearly at the stage of the last attack.
"And he was going to do it with a self-equipped bomb," said Mike Caban, Deputy Chief of Canadian Police.
In a video recording in a black mask, a man in English and Arabic expressed threats to the Canadians and promised to take away all that they had done to Muslims.
Within about three hours, using face and voice - recognition computer programs, the Canadian police have managed to recognize this man.
It was Aaron Dravers, the 24-year-old.
He was already under the supervision of the probationary service for the praise of terrorism and radical Islamic ideas on the Internet.
The judgment prevented Draiver from doing so in the future and also from engaging in any radical organization.
However, the authorities did not believe until then that Dravers could pose any physical danger to the surrounding population.
When the police arrived at his home in the city of Stratroi in the province of Ontario, the young man was out and sat in a taxi.
At that time, order guards tried to arrest him, but Dravers had started the trigger while sitting on the rear seat.
To prevent the detonation of the other explosive, policemen shot on the young man.
He's dead from the injuries he's got.
The taxiway driver is not hurt.
In an interview with Canadian television, Wayne Draiver, father of a neutralized terrorist, said that his son had turned to Islam during adolescence.
This had initially helped him to cope with drugs and alcohol.
However, Aaron was a problematic teen, who had long been furious to the world for the death of his mother, added his father.
Only when I saw that video in messages today, I realized how far he had gone.
I had no idea he was so radical.
"And I didn't know he was so good at speaking Arabic," says Aaron's father.
The Canadian police admit that if they had arrived a few hours later, the development of events could have been much different.
Radēvičs will go to Rio as a tourist and will support Latvian lighthouses.
Ineta Radēvičs, former Olympics and lighthouse Ineta Radēvičs, said that the performance of the seven-fly sportsman Laura Ikauniece-Admidiņa on Friday was not bad in the first two disciplines, given that she had injury.
On the other hand, Laura made a mark with the right foot, not as usual with the left.
Radēvičs pointed out that it is comparable - just as someone who has become used to write with the right hand, would suddenly be forced to write with the left.
Therefore, the result of Ikauniece-Admidiņa is not bad in view of the injury.
Radēviča discovered that she had not yet been contacted by Ikauniece-Admīdiņš, but she is actively following her startups and feels the same way.
Ineta learned about Laura's trauma recently and expressed her support for the athletes, stating that the playman did not start to create the cushions for herself, but showed the character and spirit of the fighter.
In relation to other sports, Radēvičs believes that the Olympic norms are very high, therefore it is wrong to blame one of Latvian athletes that he went to Rio as a tourist.
She remembered that she too was called a tourist when she went to the first Olympics, where she won the 13th place, and it creates negative emotions.
Ineta sometimes remembers her starters, not just Olympics.
"I like to remember my emotions, not the results", while remembering my experience in sport, revealed Radēviča.
She told me that it was always important to have a person in the truces who would add energy.
This year, however, Radēvičs herself will be a tourist - she will be going to Rio de Janeiro next week to support Latvian athletes.
She points out that she will definitely go to the matches.
Ineta Radēviča won the European Championship title in 2010.
In the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, she took 13 places for distant and 20 positions for the trio, but in 2008 the athletes did not start because they were waiting for their son.
In London, as has been said, Radēviča had a 4th place in a distant direction.
Muryans will show the movie "Quantum Code" by a physicist in Kashcheev's main role.
According to the annotation, while the electron was split up in the laboratory, Kashčejev is a dreamer, teacher, socially active and civic-thinking man and father who is looking for a link with Visvareno.
The hero of the film himself indicated in the Latvian Television Programme "Rita Panoramas" that he had an interesting experience taking the film.
I learned about how to make cinema, how to film it, how to record sound.
"And actually fantastic work," said the physicist.
He admitted that the film was made in two years.
The major disagreement with the director was the name of the film.
I am against this name.
No quantum code exists.
"There is no secret which, when looking at the film, could be known and it is all clear," said the associate professor of LU.
Kashčejevs admitted that he likes the fact that the film's premieres will take place in Muryan's open-air evening.
They are organized by friends from the "Viegli" Foundation, and these movies will take place every night until September 9.
Four people died during bomb explosions in Thailand.
After the Thai people voted for the adoption of the Constitution, on Thursday and Friday in five southern provinces of Thailand - the popular destinations of tourism - there were a series of bombs that killed four and injured many people.
The first two explosions took place in the seaside resort in Huahin on Thursday evening, the next Friday morning.
The city lies about 200 miles [200 km] south of Bangkok.
The police announced that one Thai woman had died at the first explosion and 20 people were injured, 10 of them being foreigners.
The authorities confirmed that other explosions took place in the southern cities of Phuket, Trana, and Sucrathan.
Two bombs exploded in the suburbs of Phūke in Patonga and two more Phann province - in the region of tourism north of Phūketa.
During the last 24 hours, 11 bomb explosions have been found in Thailand.
On Friday, Colonel Krisana Patanacharoen of the Royal Police in Thailand declared that the explosion was not related to Islamic extremists and was regarded as acts of local sabotage.
"It is too early to draw conclusions," he said.
"But we certainly know that these incidents are not directly related to any kind of terrorism, in fact it is local sabotage, and we are trying to find the perpetrators."
On 12 August 2016, following a small capacity bomb in Huahin, investigators gathered evidence from the crime scene.
On 12 August, the officials announced that four people had been killed in the bomb explosion string in the important areas of tourism in Thailand.
There are no conflicts in the country that could have led to the presence of terrorists.
"So we can say that these incidents are not terrorist attacks," he continued.
No group has yet taken responsibility for the attack, and the competent authorities have accused no particular group, but the explosion took place the same week as the new Constitution was approved by Thai voters.
All three southern provinces - Huahina, Phūket and Phann - rejected the military-supported referendum, and in south-eastern Thai provinces, where the majority of the population are Muslims, more than 6500 people have died in trouble since 2004.
The explosions took place on the day of birth of the queen Sirikithite of Thailand, which is a public holiday in Thailand.
The royal palace Klai Kangwon is located in Huahin, or "a city far from the anxietys", where the Thai royal family often resides.
King Bumbibol Aduljadiah was the longest reigning monarch in the world.

Porgia and Bess - something we deserved for a long time!
There are an infinite number of operas that have never been heard in Latvia.
There is something that sounds very rarely.
However, it seems strange that since the 1970s, George Gēršvina opus Porgia and Besa have neither been elected nor played unless they count the number of hrestomatmatic solos such as the periodic interviews of Summer Festivals of Summer Festival in Inese Galante (including as a titleplay at the Inese Galantes).
It has its causes - since Latvia has been a civilised country of the Western world, it is bound by the rules of Gēršvina's family heirs and copyright licenses that apply to Porgia and Bez until 2030.
Harmonisation procedures are not simple.
In addition, the author wanted all fourteen soloists to be black.
In Latvia, of course, the discussions around this opera in the US and the racial contexts are little known and the composer's wish to execute it would be difficult.
The concert with the help of four artistic black American soloists and their Latvian brothers and sisters was performed on August 6 at the 10th anniversary of the Cēsis Art Festival, recalling the charming sound record of Gēršvina, which features European classical music traditions with American jazz rhythms, gospels, fashion dances and hits that remain in memory in the early 20th century.
First, because of the LNSO and the conductor Andra Pog.
Despite the complex spatial arrangement of the concert tour in open-air conditions in Cēsis Palace Park, the orchestra was on the next stage next to the stage, which was played by soloists and singers (and great dance!) choir While, the total sound was stylisticly nuanced, rich and accurate for contrasts in both strings and metal blowers, as well as in the piano party (Mārtiņš Zilberts).
Secondly, because of the great soloist team.
The harmonious bariton bariton Lester Linč (Porgijs) is a favourite singer in Europe and in America, who is repertuated in both bariton and basbariton parties, especially in the Verdi operas.
Porgia sang the role many times, several times also in Kraunu - he felt like a fish in water in this opera and inspired the stage partners even to build the emotional atmosphere of solidarity between the poor people of the fishing village during the concert tour.
In his second Porgia and Bessa concert (the first took place in 2012, no more than with the Berlin Philharmonics and Sir Saimon Retlu) appeared as a vitally plastic combination of different vocal styles with dramatic toned timbre and fantastic piano in the upper register.
It is not for nothing that she is one of the most bright ways of modern times.
The image of the narcodler Sportinlaife plays a role in four continents.
He demonstrates his simultaneous dance and singing skills as a well trained music actor.
Smits is one of the rare moors that seems to be hiding yet undiscovered vocal possibilities as early as 15 years ago, when opera voice was accidentally found by hunging to smash peers.
Unbelievably, even from the 24th line and relative darkness, Jermeina Smith’s expressive gesture language allows him to see a happy bag of dust in his hands even if it is not there.
How can poor Bess not follow such a maphistophilis tempter, who in an empty place believe the illusion of a wonderful life in New York?
Rodney Clark, a generously-embraced theme, represented the role of the rock.
The biggest vocal surprise of the Latvian soloists in the Cesis institution was Sirina, represented by Sonoras Vaices, the most famous register, the skillful balancing between the spoken and the singing text, the appropriate change of voice position, the full performance of vocal acrobatics and dramaticism in both the Syrian graceful My Man is Gone Now, and in the stylized pre-donal chamber in prayer Oh, Docor Jesus.
In the role of Clara, Margarita Wilson's voice sounded well, but at the very beginning, the iconic Summertime sounded a little for a loud and nervous while getting his true character rehearsal.
Colorites and magnificently tasted the parties entrusted to Mihail Chuļpayev, Rihards Mačanovskis, Andrim Lapiņš (especially the Krabju seller, who is placed in the walls of castle ruins, answered Irma Pārze's taster in the Soprana Thesture).
Ilon Bagele, Rihard Miller, Emily Kivlenieks's sculptures, as well as the roles spoken, where the investigator, represented by Ivo Martinson, and the director and actor of the Cesis Festival unexpectedly presented in the White Advocate Aracdeil's image to the audience.
In the spatial concept of the concert tour created by Viesturs Kaiišas, choirs worked on steps, soloists - mainly in a proscedium, rarely on or off the stairs.
In a sufficiently dynamic activity, a little bit of a comical situation was done in the hands of Latvian soloists.
Their presence, however, has a very provocative explanation.
First of all, some soloists sang several intermittent boxes (which sometimes caused difficulties tracking their stage identity).
Secondly, there are many dialogues in Porgia and Bessa, and there is a phrase, a repetition, which is easier to track with its intentions in front of it.
The audience was very helpful in studying the details of the operations in Cēsis.
The weather did not explain, and the first part of the concert process went on for quite a long time.
However, it did not stop most of the listeners from remaining until the end of their lives to appeal to artists.
Nine evening, though, is a quite late time for full-length opera, especially if a longer houseway from Cesis is expected, however, opera Porgijus and Besa are worthy to return to Latvian musical circulation and will probably become one of the most bright musical adventures of this summer.
In Liepaja, too, where it was heard yesterday evening and in very other acoustic conditions.
In the play area in Riga, the man feared children with a curl.
On August 11, about 8 p.m., the State Police received a message from a frightened grandmother who was worried that a man was on the verge of fearing children on the Lomonosova street, in a children's field.
The lawkeepers immediately responded to the call and arrived at the spot, where he also met this man with a curl, which at the time of the event was under the influence of very high alcohol - 3.07 prolile.
It was found that in 1962, a man born had previously frightened children to avoid strangulation.
But this time, to scare the children, the aggressive man used a curl that was tied up with equipment on the baby’s court.
The man was arrested.
Criminal proceedings have been initiated in connection with serious public order disruptions that are evident in the lack of respect for society or shame, ignoring generally accepted standards of conduct and undermining people's peace.
For such a crime, a sentence with deprivation of liberty for a period of up to two years or with temporary deprivation of liberty, or with forced labour, or with a fine and supervision of probation for a period of up to three years.
The Presidents of the Federation usually use guest accreditation in the Olympic Games.
Presidents of sports type federations usually arrive for a few days in the Olympic Games and use guests' accreditation to change their names, so they have several owners during the competition, and the Latvian Olympic Unit (LOV) representative Marita Vilciņa told LETA.
On Wednesday, the big austories were caused by statements by German Jakukovsky, the coach of Alonas Ribokova, who, at the last minute, decided to go to Rio de Janeiro, to the head of the Latvian Swimming Federation (LPF), Kaspars, while the coach should remain at home.
Later it became known that Mr. Brazil had arrived with a coach's accreditation, for which the President was very surprised, because 'now there is no place in'.
As told by Vilciņa, only the presidents of two federations lived in the London Olympics village - Sir, as well as Guntis Zalītis, the head of the Latvian Union of Athletics (LVS).
There are athletes living in the Olympic village, as well as official persons, including, for example, coaches, doctors, delegation administration.
So, perhaps, Mr. London also had a coach's accreditation.
"The other presidents of the federations arrive as guests, and their accreditation is variable - they arrive for a few days and then are already used by someone else," said Vilciņa, explaining that therefore the presidents of these federations do not live in the Olympic village either.
Mr. Rio de Janeiro arrived at the end of July and Brazil will leave on August 13, which is likely to be the longest from the presidents of all national federations.
Significantly, only one day – on August 10, Latvian rejected swimming.
Latvia will be represented in 11 sports at Rio de Janeiro Olympics, and the estimates of the agency LETA show that the presidents of six or seven federations will drive to the most important competitions of four years.
Zalitis will arrive in Brazil on Saturday, Igo Japiņš, President of the Latvian Cycling Federation (LRF) will be on the next week's BMX competition, Ansis Dāle, President of the Latvian Windsurfing Federation, planned to fly on the 16th August, when Katie Birzule's start will have been completed, and Dzintars Urbančiks, President of the Latvian Federation, will be the day earlier.
The next week also President of the Latvian Shooting Federation Kārlis Krēsliņš planned to come, when we also shot Dainim Upelnieks.
Raimonds Rublovskis, the President of the Latvian Federation of Judas, at least during the competitions of Latvian athletes, did not appear in Rio de Janeiro even though he was scheduled to arrive, the Latvian Canoe Federation is currently not a president, but the Latvian Olympic Committee is presenting the conflict and its athletes to international competitions.
In the meantime, the President of the Latvian Volejbol Federation Atis Šalnitis and the Head of the Latvian Tennis Union Juris Savickis decided not to follow Riodejanairos.
Vasiliev appreciates the natural breast of Latvian women.
The world famous Russian fashion historian, interior decoration, stage designer, book author, lecturer and collector Alexander Vassiliev is very often visiting Latvia during the last few years.
More recently he "Mis un Misters Latvija 2016" evaluated the contestants in the final, and admitted that Latvian paintings, unlike Russian beautiful gender representatives, can be proud of natural breasts and lips that have not been improved with silicone and botulinum injections.
During the conversation with "Vakara Ziņas" Alexander Vasilyev told that for many years there has been a jury president in the popular "Mis Russia" competition.
That's why he also participated with great interest in the evaluation of the participants of "Mis un Misters Latvija 2016".
When asking, which is different to Latvian beauty competition standards from similar competitions in Russia, Vasiliev stressed that Latvians and Russians have quite different figures: "Russia's beauty contest participants have a blight of breasts, unlike Latvian competitors."
However, Latvian youth are beautifully dressed and encrypted, as well as can be proud of natural beauty, not the wonderful works performed by plastic surgery.
Therefore, I would especially like to congratulate Latvians on their natural beauty.
Vassiliev has big plans in relation to his professional activities in Latvia.
At the moment, the exhibition of fashion historian's collection "The Applied Nature" is on view at the Museum of Decorative Arts and Design.
On the other hand, in Ventspils, the Livonian Order Palace, there is an exhibition of Vasiliev "Cazsuits 1860-2010".
Vasiliev loved Ventspils so much that for a few days he also enjoyed the city’s hospitality and went on a walk along the sea.
I love it in Latvia.
Especially now, when there is a threat of terrorism across Europe, there is a real paradise corner.
"It is pure pleasure to spend time and relax in Latvia", admitted fashion guru.
In addition, on November 23 Alexander Vasiliev will open a private fashion museum in Old Riga.
Ask for help!
Please donate for the treatment of our son, brother, child.
We in the Rinald family are grateful to fantastic people around and to God for the opportunity to save Rinald, but unfortunately we do not currently have the opportunity to fully meet medical costs on our own.
Rinald Grinberg is a 11 - year - old tukumist who was diagnosed with brain tumours at the end of July.
This year he finished class 4 at the primary school of Millskalne with greatness, a strong sportsman and a very talented artist.
I think he's got everything.
Healthy, happy, persistent, hard and active boy.
Always smiling and kind.
July 26 will be remembered for life in our family.
The last few weeks were suffering from nausea, headaches, but doctors put it on the stomach virus.
And initially it seemed to be true.
For who could imagine that such "injured" symptoms at fault is much more serious, which is inconceivable to the mind.
On July 26, we got a diagnosis - Rinald has a brain tumor.
The rapid deposits of fluid in the brain, but everything that doctors can help in Latvia is to perform bypass surgery to remove excess fluid, as the tumor is practically not available for direct surgery.
It can also not be determined whether the tumor is benign or malignant.
The next state-paid plan: to start radiation and watch what is happening.
It was like such a evil nightmare, we'll go through here, we'll study the results.
Fortunately, it was possible to show Dr. Rinalda's results in Spain.
He is the vice-president of the World Neurosurgical Association, one of the world's leading neurosurgeons.
He accepted the operation, and it turned out that he had to operate immediately.
The tumor causes enormous pressure on the brain, and the risk of complications is too high.
And it is urgent to understand whether the tumor is benign or malignant to develop a plan for further treatment.
Without thinking for a moment, their parents chose to go to Spain to save their son.
At fantastic rate, Rinald and Mom, Evia, were operated in Spain on August 8 and August 9.
A very complicated, more than 6 hours long surgery was performed.
The operation took place at Santa Elena's clinic.
Most tumors were removed, pressure was reduced, analytical samples were obtained.
Rinald now rises from bed and as a good teenager, asks you to dinner frieze potatoes.
Now we have to wait for the results of oncological analyses.
Thanks to Dr Araez and the clinic’s management, who understood the situation and operated without full payment for the treatment before surgery.
They trust that the remaining amount will be paid, only a first contribution of EUR 10 000 was required to operate and save the lives of Rinald.
The EUR 6 000 for parents was able to provide by selling machinery, while the other amount necessary for travel expenses, living, and the hospital’s first contribution was made by relatives and friends.
But at least €24 000 more is needed to pay for the first phase of treatment in Spain and give back the money that we have borrowed for the first instalment.
Please help us to repay this, Rinalda's health so important, surgery.
Each euro is important to help to cover the costs of the operation that has already been carried out and to allow for the successful continuation of the treatment of Rinalda.
The signs of anxiety in Ukraine raise the question: What do Vladimir Putin think?
It has been shown that these claims are true.
Ukraine denies these, while the USA and the European Union claim that Russia has not provided any evidence.
The Open Analysis Group, Digital Forensic Research Lab, has identified some signs of Saturday fire, but little to prevent Moscow's big plans.
Russia is known for distorting events or misinterpretation for political purposes, particularly in the context of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.
This does not mean, however, that all Russian claims are unfounded.
Last year, Ukraine's resistance forces broke out on electric castles that supplied power to Crimea, and some of them are also involved in criminal activities and human rights abuses.
The attempted attack on Crimea is still a topical issue, although there are little grounds for suspecting that the Ukrainian Government would sponsor such an event scenario.
Whatever happened, the images of the open source analysts show that Russia is increasingly increasing its military presence since at least last Saturday - before the anticipated attack took place.
It shows the movement of semi-fare heavy weapons convoys, including off-shore missile systems.
Russian Escalation Industrially Known
Some reports show that Russian forces in Crimea were already planning a rotation around this time, which could help explain the activity, although it would be very consistent that it simply happened in one of the most stressful times since its annexation in 2014.
Whatever happened at the end of the week, Mr Putin has undoubtedly focused even more on Ukraine in his statements, choosing to use this episode, no matter how realistic it is, for what greater purpose.
The analysts point to the worrying parallels between Russia's behaviour just before previous military actions against Ukraine.
In February 2014, under the control of Ukraine, similar talks and military manoeuvrings were provided under the cover of Crimean volunteers to engage in a Peninsula, which was then controlled by Ukraine, only to reveal that they were, in fact, Russian special entities that initiated the military occupation.
In August, when the separatists supported by Russia did not work in Eastern Ukraine, Putin deployed forces along the border, warning that they might be needed for the "defence" of ethnic Russian civilians in Ukraine, who, according to him, is attacked.
He arranged a assistance convoy to the region, which according to NATO information was only a cover for the Russian invasion forces.
What does Mr Putin intend to do in Crimea?
Some mentioned whether Moscow alone was planning another military intervention.
The fight in Eastern Ukraine has escalated, just as it was before the invasion of August 2014.
But this supposed parallel could be the point when it is intended to introduce fear of military action, not of actual action - it will give Putin a brief brief message in its relations with Ukraine and with Western countries.
Mark Galeoti, professor at the University of New York, who is studying Russia, pointed out that Crimea would be of little importance as a point of starting military action against the Eastern Bank bordering Russia's land rather than Crimea, and that the rest of the country is better protected.
"There is a very small chance that Russians are actually planning some large-scale forums," Mr Galeoti said.
Rather, "we can see the classic Russian strategies in creating pressure."
The international peace talks on Ukraine, which once called the mechanism by which Putin forced contacts with Western leaders who ignored him because of the annexation of Crimea, are regarded by a growing number of people as ineffective and irrelevant.
Supposing that there is a danger that the conflict can be exploded again, Putin gives negotiations a new meaning: to get him out of the edge of the pit.
"It's the standard Putin's tactic – he wants to try to start from the position of force," Galeoti said about the next peace negotiations scheduled for early September.
"And the only strong side is to say, "If I want to, I could make everything even more, much worse."
Achieve an agreement with the West
Putin also said this week that during the crackdowns in Crimea it was not very important to continue the negotiations, forcing the other parties to convince him to return to the negotiating table and reach the centre of the process.
What does it actually give him?
Firstly, it allows Russia to continue to stand as a world power, although its economies are smaller than Australia.
Secondly, it positions Moscow as having veto rights in relation to Ukraine's sovereignty, retaining to some extent the country under Russian control.
It can also benefit Putin's long-loved expectations of a large-scale agreement with the United States, which would resolve their disputes on Ukraine and Syria, under favourable conditions for Moscow, naturally, also ending the Western sanctions against Russia.
It has been a good idea of this target since the deterioration of the country's economy in 2014, several times due mainly to the decline in the country's export value of oil and gas.
Since the invasion of Syria last autumn, he has repeatedly called upon Western powers to join him in his great coalition fight against extremists.
However, the Russian leaders may believe that they should be able to secure such an agreement before the end of President Obama's term of office in January.
The Russian official is mainly of the opinion that the next President will be Hilaria Klinton, which is more hostile to Moscow.
Donald Trump, although apparently friendly against Russia, is still considered unpredictable.
Obama, on the other hand, is seen as "seeking solutions instead of conflict," said Galeoti.
So it makes sense to close the window to ensure that something is done quickly.
Meanwhile, if we fail to reach an agreement on a large scale, Putin seems satisfied with the maintenance of Russia's weak neighbour, which, however, will be the next one.
In the earlier version of this article, the year Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine.
This was the case in 2014 and not in 2013.
When the convention strikes, the White House directs the means to fight the Zico virus
On Thursday, the Obama administration said that it would shift USD 81 million from biomedical research and anti-Hungarian and health care programmes to pay for the development of a vaccine against Zicos virus against emergency measures, because Congress did not approve new funding for fighting the virus.
Silvia Metjus Barvels, Secretary for Health and Humanitarian Services, pointed out in a letter to the Congress participants that, apart from the earmarked funds, the National Institute of Health and the In-depth Research and Development of Biomedicine will remain free from money to fight the vaginal diseases until the end of the month.
Therefore, the development of the vaccine at an important time would have to be stopped, with the increase in the number of cases of Zach’s disease obtained in the country in May.
In the United States, 7 350 cases of Zica virus were reported last week, mostly in Puertorico (according to the results of disease control and prevention centres).
Mrs. Barvel said that 15 infants were born with birth defects related to the Zico virus.
The virus can cause brain development abnormalities and other serious birth defects in mothers.
The spread of disease in the continental United States, when the first cases were recorded at the end of last month, has increased the political rates for the reaction of the federal government.
Hilarija Klinton stopped in Winwood, in Mayi area, where an outbreak of Zicos virus transmissions at local level was observed, and put pressure on Congress to return from its five - week break to confirm the emergency funding for the fight against the virus.
President Obama and the Republicans of Congress have been controversial for most of the year on the issues of the Zika virus.
In February, Obama's emergency funding was worth $1.9 billion.
The Republican stopped it by requesting a more detailed report on who the money would be spent.
For months, legislators have been arguing about how much money should be allocated and how to spend.
Last month, democracy blocked the examination of the measure proposed by the Republicans, which would allocate USD 1.1 billion to the fight against the Zico virus, but would include conditions that would prohibit family planning for the provision of contraception in relation to the virus that could be so transmitted by gender.
The White House in April was forced to channel USD 589 million to fight against the Ebola virus against the Zico virus. About two thirds of the funding is intended to be used internally.
On Thursday, Mrs Barwell said that her department had spent most of her money and that it would be spent in full by the end of August.
"The failure to decide on emergency funding for the fight against the Zicos virus has left the administration to choose between the delay of the important vaccine development work and the resorting to other valuable national programmes in order to avoid this delay temporarily," wrote Barvela.
Democrats objected to this statement to blame the Republicans for not adding additional money to the fight against the Zico virus.
At the conference representatives Nancy Pelosi from California, the leader of the minority, invited Paul D.Raan, the speaker of the House of Representatives, to remind Congress of the relocation of the event.
"All opportunities have been exhausted, and now we turn to the National Institute of Health," said Mrs Pelosi.
Mr Raien's advisers say that earmarking is a long-standing step that the Obama administration has been delaying in extorting maximum political benefits from the problem of the Zica virus.
Last week, the National Institute of Health declared that it had launched clinical trials against the Zico virus in 80 people, and hopes to launch the second phase of 'Zico virus epidemics in countries' in early 2017.
However, as the officials claimed on Thursday, without immediate additional financing, the study will stop.
Barvela said that she would target $34 million in the fight against the Zico virus from the National Health Service’s tools to find cures for other diseases, including cancer and diabetes.
A further 47 million will be transferred to the Biomedical Agency for in-depth research and development to support the development of medicines and vaccines in response to public health emergencies.
This money will come from a number of accounts, including 19 million US dollars, from a programme that provides heating oil subsidies to low-income families, and 4 million US dollars from substance dependence programmes such as opioid dependence.
Even as Barwell said, the extra money will only be sufficient for the next month, when the agencies will have to "reasonably narrow down their activities" in the fight against the Zicos virus if Congress does not act.
Over the past four months, the Disease Control and Prevention Centre has spent 60 million US dollars to help States protect pregnant women, 25 million US dollars to strengthen their preparedness for and fight against Zicos virus, and 16 million US dollars to help it to set up data collection systems to quickly detect microcephaly and other Zicos virus-related symptoms.
Thailand’s leader links attacks to tourist popular places with constitutional changes
The Thai junta leader, on Friday, invited the people of the country to be patient until the investigators find out what stands behind this week's deadly bombing series.
General Prajut Chan-och, head of the junta and Prime Minister, said that criminals were 'bad people' who protest the new Constitution, which were endorsed by the voters in a referendum on Sunday.
"For the sake of this, there are still bad people, and they were already working before the referendum," he said to the people.
At the bombs, four and dozens of people were killed and injured in five provinces on Thursday and Friday, including Phuket and Huahin, among tourists.
According to the authorities, the attacks by arson arsoners are linked.
The analysts claim that bomb explosions were not intended to kill many people, but to harm the tourism industry, one of the bright spots of the Thai economy.
At least nine foreign tourists were injured in Huanhin.
"Everything motifs, explosions and attacks by arsons undermine the junta's claim that the post-referendum situation will be stable," said Sunay Fasuk, senior researcher of Human Rights Watch.
These attacks have a discrediting effect on the authorities, are terrorising society and harming the economy based on tourism.
The workers of Thai rescue services take care of the injured at the Huahin bombs on Friday.
The police claim that, in their view, these explosions are not related to international terrorism or the protracted Islam unrest in southern Thailand.
They regard attacks as 'local sabotage' rather than terrorism.
The selected times of attacks and their location have strong political symbolism.
The explosions took place on Friday, when people were ready to celebrate the birthday of Queen Sirikiitas, who is considered as Mother’s Day in Thailand.
The four explosions struck the royal residence in Huahin, about 125 miles [125 miles] from Bangkok, where most of the wounded were also.
The constitution prepared by the military will reduce the influence of political parties and give more military powers to the military, even if the government is back under civilian control.
Hunta helped ensure its victory by preventing opponents from organising campaigns against it.
Murray Hibert, a South-East Asian expert at the Strategic and International Studies Centre in Washington, has made a military suspicion about the fact that attacks were carried out by people dissatisfied with the vote.
The explosions were "exactly coordinated, but obviously aimed at creating fear and excitement, not mass damage and damage and injury," he said.
Last year, 20 people, mostly tourists from China, were killed at the popular shrine of erène in Bangkok.
The Thai authorities were associated with Uighur fighters who were dissatisfied with the return of more than 100 Uighur to China.
General Prejuts, who has led the junta since 2014, when the civil government was dissented, said that this week's explosion "crushs the hearts of the Thais."
Why now that the state is doing better when the economy is going better, and the tourism industry is doing better?" he said.
We need to ask why and who did it.
Gold’s Reaction: How Simone Manuela’s historical moment looked
When I started this evening, I was like trying to remove from my shoulders the severity of the black-dominated community, which is something that I am not with myself simply in a position that I have.
I hope, however, that all this will be gone.
I am more than happy about the fact that I can serve others as inspiration and, hopefully, diversify this type of sport.
At the same time, however, I would like to have a day when we are more, and it is not Simone, a black swimmer, because the term 'black swimmer' makes it look like I should not be able to fight a golden medal or that I should not be able to beat the record.
That's not because I work as hard as everyone else, and I love sports and I want to win like everyone else.
Fight for the defence of students - lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (L.G.B.T.) - in Colombia
Two years ago Sergeo Urrego, aged 16, will be left out of shopping center in Bogota before leaving a message about suicide in a Facebook record, citing the Pink Floyd song "Goodbye Cruel World".
His death was the beginning of the contradictions that broke out this week in Colombia, where efforts to extend L.G.B.T. rights were seen in the wider political struggles that have divided the country into two camps.
After his death, Urrego’s mother, Alba Reijesa, brought a complaint to court against school officials to blame them for her only son’s exclusion, when he and his classmate were found to have had intimate relationships.
A year later, the Supreme Court of Colombia issued a favourable sentence to her, calling on schools throughout the country to develop a clearer policy to prevent discrimination.
The decision was part of a series of legal victories of Colombia's gay movement. Some time this year this movement celebrated the adoption of the decision on legalization of same-born marriages.
This week, however, they faced an obstacle to their fight for equality, because Jean Perody, a minister of education who has been openly gay, became a scandal about the application of this rule in the scandal.
The scandal began when social media began to circulate sexually exposed content from the pornography magazine, spreading people’s speeches that it is part of a manual published by the Ministry of Education.
Perodia was the active attacker.
Although the Ministry offered schools assistance on issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity with the idea of helping them pay attention to the rule, it did not attempt to impose standardised rules.
"What we want for schools is the tools to deal with conflicts," Mrs. Perdudia said on Thursday's interview.
The discussions started before the national debate on the future of the country where the peaceful talks between the government and the revolutionary Colombian armed forces, or the FARC, will take place.
The coalition of politicians in the government opposition and the leaders of the Catholic Church have mobilized extremely quickly, indicting the government of Presidency Huana Manuel Santos about the same-sex union and the promotion of gender change.
In order to make everyone even more complex, a government delegation negotiating with the FARC in Havana recently reached an agreement on gender and L.G.B.T. equality, calling on the government to adopt more inclusive policies.
Government criticism and peace talks on the populous star of Colombia's policy for the 42-year-old Perodia.
They have demonstrated rotten posters and some have also threatened violence against her and her partners, Cecilia Alvares-Korrea Glena, former Minister for Trade.
The whole week of concern, Perodia maintained an amazing peace in an effort to correct the error and resume the debate under constructive conditions.
"Part of what causes me to stand up and keep my clear head is the consciousness that there are children who are still only revealed," she said.
This is a very tight working field and very lonely time.
She also referred to the link between the peace process and the debate on students from L.G.B.T.
While the columbians continue to assess the benefits of a transaction with the FARC, a country comparable to an earthquake, they have to think about the origin of the conflict, she said.
"Is there a peaceful state that promotes inclusion or exclusion; is it one in which all have the same opportunities?" she asked.
Although this week she has not had the pleasure of being the target of accusations and accusations, she is pleased that today's Colombian gay students can take an example from her and think that they can try to become ministers one day.
"It is very important for me that they are calm and are aware that they can realise their full potential," said Mrs. Perodia.
We cannot expect a new suicide to start changing something.
Keep the vote cyber-friendly - The New York Times
"The U.S. looks for ways to hold hackers in pieces from electoral urns" (mailing, August 4)
The Minister for Internal Security, Jeff Johnson, says that the Obama administration is thinking about the additional security protection of the national electoral system.
These changes may be necessary and should be considered immediately.
The cyber threat in its various manifestations and the recent discovery that the external forces, perhaps national states, are increasingly interested in our elections, demands that the federal government pay more attention to the provision of our electoral system and perhaps consider it part of the infrastructure essential for our country.
Johnson should immediately contact thousands of national jurisdictions that assist elections and offer the help, advice and guidance of the Homeland Security Department.
While the diverse and diverse nature of our voting infrastructure hampers efforts to ensure it, it tells us that the process should be initiated as soon as possible.
A writer, a democrat from Mississippi, is a member of a high ranking national security committee.
In Pensilvāni a boy injured in carousels, this week already the third case of attractions in the parks
On Thursday, when the carer fell, a boy was injured and taken to the Pittsburgh Hospital. Quick help service and park officials say that this week, this is the third accident in the United States attractions in which children were affected.
A child whose name is not open was just taken to a hospital in Pittsburgh about 50 miles [80 km] west of the Adilvald and Soukzona theme park in Lyjoonjer, Pennsylvania, said a representative of the Rapid Assistance Services of the Westmurland Region.
The three-year-old boy, who visited his brother while he was being assisted in the field, was conscious and informed the park’s representative Jeff Krusher at the e-mail.
The Shusher said that the Rollo Coaster attraction would be closed for the duration of the investigation.
Children should have at least 3 feet (91 cm) in a caussile to visit, and those less than 4 feet (122 cm) should be accompanied by adults.
According to the information published on its website, the attraction was built in 1938 and the state Department of Agriculture indicated that it had been inspected in August.
The hospital representative refused to comment on the boy’s health.
On Sunday, a 10 - year - old boy died from the world’s largest water slide in Kansas, Kansas.
On Monday, three girls 6, 10, and 16 years of age, falling from a height of more than 30 feet (9 metres), were brought to hospital by the entrance of the panorama wheel changes during the annual market in Greenville, Tennesia, reported by local media.
The Prime Minister of Japan, Abe, will not visit a temple during World War II, where the memory of the fallen people of the war is honored: Jiji
The news agency Jiji reports that the Prime Minister of Japan, Sindzo Abe, will not attend the Second World War of Japan's defeat of the Second Year of the World War of Tokyo, which honors the memory of the fallen prisoners of the war.
On Thursday, Jiji reported that Abe’s plan to send him a ritual present for the temple for the anniversary.
In the temple, there are 14 Japanese military commemorations who have only been sentenced to war criminals, and China and South Korea consider this to be a symbol of Japan’s military wartime militaryism.
Abe has not visited the temple since December 2013, when he announced that he had visited to show respect for those who died for their homeland.
Tomomi Inada, the new Minister of Defence of Japan, has not answered whether she will attend the temple explaining that this is a matter of conscience.
Inada - a close associate of Abe and an advocate of an amendment to the Japanese pacifist constitution - has regularly visited Jasukuni in the past.
The news agency Kyodo reports that on Thursday, Masahir Imura, the Minister of Reconstruction of the areas affected by the Japanese disaster, visited the temple and said that you asked for Japan's peace and prosperity.
Relations between China and Japan, Asia's two major economies, have become more tighter following the increasing presence of China's coast guard and other state ships near the contested islands in the South China Sea, which are called the Saintscain in Japan, and in China as the Diouge.
Two suspects were arrested in the planning of Rio Olympics terrorist acts: police
On Thursday, the police detained two people who are suspected of supporting the Islamic group in planning possible attacks during the Olympic Games in Rio.
On Thursday, the operation police had already been detained by 12 persons, all suspected of cooperating with Islamic State fighters.
The Brazilian federal police report that three additional persons were questioned and subsequently released.
Both arrested Brazilians on Thursday, but the police do not disclose their names and other information.
Although there has been no conflict in Brazil's history with the known militia groups, the government reports that the Olympic Games have made the country a more pressing target, especially since the countries fighting against the Islamic State participate in the games.
It controls certain territories of Iraq and Syria and the US-led coalition has carried out air attacks against them.
The group has supporters around the world who have carried out civilians' shooting and bombing.
The murder of a young suspected French priest is officially charged with charges
During the murder investigation of the French priest last month, official accusations were brought against the man arrested on Monday, while Reuter reported on Friday the source of information in the police.
21 years ago, suspects were investigated about their cooperation with terrorists, and he planned human attacks and mentioned the source of information.
A man was telephonely contacted with Adel Kermič and Abde Malik Petitjan, who interrupted the church services in St.
Both police shot.
The suspected man had come from his home near Toulouse, to Saint-Jenu du Ruve and spent the night in the days before the attack, mentioned the source.
The young man, who had not been criminally punished before, admitted that he spent the night there, but told the investigators that he was leaving the next day because he had no good relations with Kermich and Petitjan, the source of information.
The investigators are trying to ascertain whether Kermitch and Petitjan were present in France and related to the Islamic State, which has assumed responsibility for the attack.
Pettyjan's cousin was arrested at the end of last month.
Doruss de Vriess before passing to Celtic to undergo medical examinations
The gatekeeper of the Nottingham Forest club Dorus de Vries arrived in Glasgow because he hopes to conclude an agreement on the transition to Celtic.
De Vriess was photographed, entering the Roshol Hospital before medical examination after Hoops agreed on the conditions with Sky But Champions Club.
The head of Parkhead Club Brendan Rogers is looking for an experienced center guard to compete with Kreig Gordon for the current first number.
However, Roger trusts the 35-year-old de Vries, because he and the Dutch have worked together in the Swansea club.
He played a 51 game in Swansea, which they won in 2011 to the Prime Minister under Rogers.
He changed the bicycle form to join "Vilkis" that summer, and since 2013 there has been a City Ground.
He also played in Scotland during his career after the Diungermline season, after he returned to Scotland in 2006.
His stay in the Real Court ended with an insurgency, however, Pars is experiencing a double agony, being "sent out in exile" from the highest level before losing in the Celtic Scottish Cup.
The guard was still in Forest under the contract and it was reported that Celtic would only have to pay a nominal fee to obtain his signature.
Macy's will close 100 shops.
The supermarket giant Macy's announced on Thursday its plans to close 100 stores, which is a dramatic step to help the chain to get forward from potentially sandy problems: in America, it claims to be online shopping for too many stores.
Macy's regularly reduces its store portfolio, often closing several dozens of insufficiently profitable shops immediately after the annual holiday fever.
However, by presenting its summer announcement that it will close up 15 percent of its 728 outlets, the chains seem to have taken a much more aggressive approach than many similar representatives of the retail sector in terms of reducing their stores by adapting to the very changing shopping environment.
The pedestrians and buyers pass the Macy's store in New York.
The retail giant states that it intends to close 100 shops.
Macy's has many reasons to try what to change: many of its stores are located, in small regional shopping centres, as the number of buyers has been particularly affected by the upswing of e-commerce.
In general, it has been more difficult times for the supermarket category, as customers increasingly choose retailers at a lower price, such as T.J.Maxx and fast fashion works such as H&M.
These factors, together with the short-term difficulties such as the ever smaller international tourist spending and seasonal weather that Macy's has put down in a situation of instability that has lasted for more than a year.
On Thursday, the company stated that its comparable sales in the last quarter had fallen by 2.6 per cent, a rather weak indicator which was nevertheless an improvement in view of the very poor 6,1 per cent drop in the annual percentage point observed in the previous quarter.
The retailer's revenue was USD 5.87 billion (7.64 billion for Canada), by 3.9 percent less than in the same period last year.
Macy's said that it would cost around USD 1 billion per year in turnover.
And the simultaneous closure of such a large number of shops could be seen as a defeat for the retailer.
However, the value of the company's shares decreased by 17 per cent on Thursday, indicating that investors perceive this move as a proactive measure that tells of the stronger future of Macy's.
In a sense, Macy's having reduced the number of stores should not be a surprise.
The retailer's CEO, Terry Lundgren, has said in the past that there are quite simply too many shops in the chain.
The top level leaders have been saying for some time that they have adopted a new strategy, where the emphasis is placed on 150 of its most profitable stores, seeking to achieve higher sales volumes in the already advantageous outlets.
Jeff Jenette, Macy's director, who has been appointed to Lundgren since 2017, said in his statement almost all shops that the company plans to close are those where sales and profitability are falling down.
"We are aware that we do not yet get adequate return on investments in these trading venues and often do not have a degree of customer experience that reflects our efforts in relation to the Macy's brand," Jenette said.
The company announced that it would come up with a list of shops that would be closed later.
Macy's said that it is still being decided on shops to close and that it is therefore not yet clear exactly how many workers will be made redundant.
The retailer will not go completely away from the main markets where it currently has shops, but it will think about closing down the less active stores.
This move will most likely not like shop managers, who count on large tenants like Macy's to attract and keep other smaller shops in their shopping centers.
Does your bottle of water contain dangerous bacteria?
According to a new study, drink from refilled bottles may be "to a much worse extent than let down your dog's toy", taking into account how many bacteria will have to come into contact with.
Website Treadmill Reviews asked Emlab P&K to check 12 different types of water bottles - with screw cap, with flip-off stopper, with screw cap, and with straw.
Each bottle was taken by the sportsman for a week without washing.
Your refilled water bottle can be as dirty as a dog’s toy.
"With the basis of 12 bottles of water that we tested, we found that the re-use of drinking containers could contain an alarming number of viable bacterial cells: more than 300 000 colony-forming units per square centimetre (KVV/kv.cm.)," says Treadmill Reviews.
Bottles with flip-off caps showed the highest microbes, with more than 900 000 colony-forming units per square centimetre (CV/m2.)
The bottles contain microbes that may cause skin infections, pneumonia or blood poisoning.
Bottles with imprintable stoppers were next worse with 162 000 CFU/cm, while containers with screw stoppers contained only slightly less than 160 000 CFU/cm.
"Drain water from such bottles may be worse than eating from your household's dish", is indicated on the website.
A well better picture can be seen for straw bottles, where only a part of the bacteria in other bottles was found – only 25 CFU/cm.
This might be because water is poured down to the lower part of the straw, rather than sticking to its edges, thereby attracting moisture-loving microbes.
In bottles with straw, the microbes are described as "maximum harmless".
"By looking at the results of our test, we recommend to choose a bottle with straw, due to the number of small bacteria and the absence of harmful microbes," said the website.
We also know that when it comes to bottles and bacteria, stainless steel is a better choice than plastic.
In addition, there will be fewer microbes in water bottles without cracks and difficult to clean.
It is recommended that readers wash bottles after each application, ideally with a weak whitening solution.
Religion must become modern or forgetting
In the United States, the Democratic Party has recently nominated Hilaria Klinton as its presidential candidates.
If the results of the last polls prove to be true in the elections themselves, in January America will inaugurate its first President - a woman.
Last week, across the ocean, British Prime Minister Terez Meja discussed Britain's withdrawal from Europe's rules with Angela Merkel, German Chancellor.
Women raised in Western society are educated to be aware that thanks to education, ambition and hard work, they can be competent and successful in any field of professional activity.
And today, young girls can target several existing role models, working in the highest leadership area.
So, is the real long and difficult struggle for equality between women over?
Hilaria Klinton is ready to become the president of the United States at any time, but in the area of religion, women's leadership remains contentious.
All right, not completely.
In the religious field, women's leadership remains contentious.
Last week, Pope Francisco announced the creation of a new commission to assess whether women should be consecrated in the diacon round of the Catholic Church.
The Anglican Church consecrated Libya Lein as the first woman to the bishop in January 2015, but it was only after a failed attempt in 2012.
While reform of the Judaism movement has been administered by women's rabbi since the beginning of the 1970s and by conservative movement since the beginning of the 1980s, the concept of women's rabbi still has a very strong resistance in orthodox Judaism.
In November 2015, in its third attempt to stop a growing wave of support for Orthodox women in the rabbi, the American Council published a very harsh message that women-rabine is contrary to the law.
Not without irony, when Hilaria Klinton was nominated as presidential candidates, the group of the leading American Orthodox Rabbi, who opposed women's coordination, launched a series of "discussions" on this controversial issue.
Why is this difference between secular and sacral?
The orthodox Judaism, like most other religions, seeks stability in what it considers to be long - lasting traditional values.
This is reflected in the ability to keep pace with pressure to adapt to changing societies.
Those who are against the coordination of women do so on the grounds that it is not 'traditional'.
However, taking over by preserving traditions is at its own cost.
And the price of such one-sided thinking may paradox damage the tradition in itself, excluding to the traditional community the oxygen it needs to maintain life.
In the book "Agrusta firearms", the First World War military history, Barbara Tachman emphasizes the danger of giving priority to the tradition of what has become known as "a red biting tragedy."
Until the beginning of World War I, when war passed from war to wartime on short distances to a heavier artillery that is broadcast from a further distance, it became profitable to hide soldiers as long as possible.
British and German armies responded to these changes by replacing their bright uniforms with bored grey and brown.
However, French soldiers were still wearing the same red hats and trousers that made them easy to do.
The French Minister for War Affairs, Ādolfs Mesimis, suggested that the armies under his authority could act in a similar way was perceived with oblivion and opposition.
The red trousers reflected the pride and prestige of the army, and the military were not prepared to give up.
The former Minister for War Affairs, Mr Etjen, spoke on behalf of France, when he spoke in parliament.
"Stop the red panties?" he cried out.
Never!
"That unspeakable and idiotic appendix to the most visible of all colors," later wrote Messimie, "was to have the evil consequences."
Faith leaders who are fighting for women's inclusion in leading religious roles could fall into the same trap.
By focusing only on "traditional" religion and not asking the important question: "What change is needed to make religion flourish?" they risk losing around 50 percent of their followers.
They also deprive the entire community of the talent, skills and enthusiasm that would otherwise be provided by women.
To insist that men continue to wear pants when it comes to religion, it may not be worth it, as the red beekeeper’s collapse shows.
Dina Breivere is a founder of JOFA in the UK and a student of orthodox rabbinism in Jeshivath Maharat in New York.
The children of the Roja county learned new skills in the camp.
From 1 August to 6 August, a camp "Varaviksne bridges" took place at the Rojupe Children and Youth Initiative Centre, during which participants creatively expressed themselves, sports, as well as learned new skills.
We arrived in the camp on the closing day when children with great interest painted glass jars.
Māra Folkmane, specialist at the Rojupe Children and Youth Initiative Centre for Youth, told that she was one of the activities most enjoyed by participants.
A visit to the Einārs Kalniņš Tableauskaite "Mazbebriņi" was also a source of great joy.
Most children liked the laser because it was possible to see how a drawing on the computer was gradually applied to the face.
E. Kalniņš told us what things she needs to learn at school if she wants to work in a carpenter, namely maths, especially geometry, computer science, as well as technical drawing and race.
He also stressed that this profession should work more with the brain than with the muscles.
There are individual orders in the small hall, and it is important to plan everything first.
In order to get to know each other, the camp started, the participants participated in different games, as well as jointly formed the camp "gebonnes".
On Wednesday there was a walk along the sea from Roja to Jocene. Natural materials were collected on the way, which were later used for card making.
Sports games also wanted to play a special role for the participants.
We went to apartment houses, where we had a sports and recreation area, played a football ball and a network ball.
Children like sport activities, we have a lot of boys playing football, basketball, and every time they ask for something sporty.
Girls like more peaceable activities.
On the other day, with the help of a self-hardening mass, we decorated jars, which can later be used as pencil holders.
There was also a talent evening, children chose to participate with, and one evening was devoted to performances.
Table games were played, each one could show his/her knowledge during the period of photo orientation, where after the pictures he had to find objects and take pictures.
The task was to come together in different ways in each picture.
We also paint mandals - some like it more, some less.
There will never be one lesson that pleases everyone: sport is closer to one another, creative activity for another.
"Now it seems that everyone is acting thrillingly with the painting of glass," explained Folkmane.
At the end of the camp, diplomas were awarded for creativity, sport, as well as assistance - several children helped in economic works.
The name of the camp "Varaviksne Bridges" is due to the participation of children from three associations - Rojupe and Melnsila Children and Youth Initiative Centre, as well as the multi-functional centre "Strops" of the Roja district.
These are joint bridges.
If the Romanians think something faster, we borrow ideas; if not, they borrow from us.
We share our experiences.
This year 30 participants participated in the camp - children who were active during the year.
"We had predicted 30, and it also happened," says M. Folkmane.
The camp was held for the fifth year.
It started in 2010 when the social services of the Roja district decided that families of children of many children and children of poor families had to organize camps in summer.
In the meantime, however, the situation in Paradise has improved, and the camp is now intended for the region's residents, who come and work in youth centres.
The goal is to spend free time in a meaningful and comprehensive manner.
In the past, there were two camps, each involving 20 children, and currently only one camp is held due to a reduction in the total number of children in the country.
Similar activities are taking place during the rest of the year.
The children drew a glass of paint, and the villages were visited by Einārs Kalniņš, who taught me how to burn wood, how to make machines from wood, and by means of a figureze we saw different forms.
There is also a new technique - enkutics, it is coloring with hot wax cream.
The teacher, Ilze Šelkova, was led by his teacher to form lessons from polymeric material, to form heels and various jars.
We make paintings of natural materials, interesting mandals of beans, peas, linseeds, leaves collected in autumn.
We're trying to use what's around us.
The youth center is working in winter from 15.00 to 20.00, while in summer - from 14.00 to 20.00.
"On average, 15 children visit the youth centre in Riga," says Folkmane.
She stressed that the Roja district council provides great support, which realises that it is necessary to allocate funds to children, because they form our future.
Charleston Athletic fan "can get a seasonal ticket only if he signs a behavioural agreement" and agrees not to criticise the club in social media.
While we recognize that everyone has the right to a personal opinion, publication of embarrassing comments on such websites does not benefit.
A fan working in the field of administration was then told that he would have to get a ticket personally from Klif Igor, former police chief inspector, who joined the club last month after 35 years of career in the police force.
In the following letter: "I must inform you that the granting of the seasonal ticket to you will be renewed on the condition that you sign the "Sustainable Contract of Conduct" (ABC) which will stipulate that you will refrain from publishing defaming or embarrassing comments on the website of the club or club representatives on all social media websites, or any other kind of behaviour that may be considered anti-social."
Talking to Daily Telegraph, he described how he called the club after paying the seasonal ticket, which was not received, and two days later he received a letter by post.
Yesterday he went to a meeting in the club and said, "They told me that I was too much "ticked", making others who were funny."
Driving holidays at the Dalmatation coasts
What do you mean by the word "deafness"?
I was driving here from all my power," said Colina, the former US Navy Commander, who has just driven a 25-mile cycling ride along a central part of a rough Croatian island without leaving anything there, except for the bright expression of sweats and salvish sailors in the arrogant mountains.
Some cyclists sing hymn or kindergarten poetry to make it easier on the mountain.
Colin's friend Petty suggests "The Little Engine That Could".
Other signs of numbers are quiet, or they simply keep quiet, thinking about what it requires in a trancelike state spoken of by hardened bicyclists.
Collina’s lonesomes are poisonous rather than varied.
Swim a few yards forward for her is like having hugs back at the beginning of the movie "Centre's wedding and a funeral."
Her mission and my mission are a week-long "luxus" yacht and cycling along the coast of the Northern Division of Croatia and islands organised by Freedom Treks.
While riding in the summer heat around a steep hilly spot like Croatia may not correspond to every sense of luxury, it is said that Northern Dalmation is easier to go out than South Dalmatation, our blanket is soft, and when we filled the forms of booking, freely and convincingly before all those months, there was a window that we did not mark, which could have provided us with a battery-charged e-ray.
The part of the transaction luxury is our swimming house for a week, the very new "Melody".
At the end of the trip, we can throw our bicycles around our guides Ivan and Ivan, and at the back of the ship, to jump in blue water, without contacting seaweeds, sharp stones, and other people on the narrow rock lanes that the Croatians call the beach.
In June, the water temperature at sea is perfect, everyone agrees: it is cool enough to cool down, but not cold.
On "Melody" there are masks and breathing rubs and some kayaks if someone feels energetic after a heavy morning on the blankets.
Instead, most of us return to our cabs with air conditioners, where Helen, the ship's massager - I don't know - will have already laid our beds, supplemented our minibar supplies, and left a new box with chocolates on the table.
Ivan says that after cycling, we are very important, and we learn to have rest chairs on our beds or with cushions on the upper deck together with a bartender Antonio, who is always ready to prepare one of his cocktails.
"Melody", 42 m long with 15 cabins and half a dozen crews, not quantified superjahta, but rather a stylish small cruise ship.
It turns towards a small island port between fishing boats and fleet holiday yachts, and we are proud to belong to it.
Collina and Petty belong to a group of menetup.com friends from Washington (Colombia): at sports and public activists after 45, as they call themselves themselves.
Last year's holidays in the Netherlands were so successful that they decided to try something even more richer, and that's what they are in Croatia.
The competing tomb from their church is on boating and cycling holidays in Provence, and every afternoon the air of competing Facebook publications is concentrated by the pingpong rally.
The element of holiday adventures can be exaggerated, because our schedule is nothing if there is no specific regime.
"Brokastis and dinner are in eight," Ivan announced the new participants at the opening meeting when we started the road from the beautiful old port of Trogira, near Split.
One sign of the ship’s call indicates that the cupfate is open, while the other at the end of the meal invites you to keep quiet and listen carefully to further information.
"Good morning!" is the cultural context, which is probably lost everywhere, but not in British contingent.
Any difference - fun has already taken on speed, jokes get out of the horn of abundance, while Ivan gives out the daily tours, but we all pretend that we are afraid of swinging, contour drain and profiles with climbs and falls, although anything else would be a surprise on the Croatian bike that starts and ends at sea level.
"It's like a heart monitor," says Ivan.
Full equal is not recommended.
Ivan leads an information meeting in parallel, free of charge, from English to German.
There are weeks when he has to deal with dozens of different nationalities, but we are a simple group - the Swiss, the Germans, the Americans and the British, who sit at the tables with two English and one - German.
We're all friends on our way.
Riding facilitates membership, and the only competition is inside, i.e. itself.
I do not remember when the dynamics of the group would have been more harmonious and relaxing.
Soon we're going to Ivan's wave.
A small rise is a slope that should not be confused with the roughness, which is a good thing.
Matadatas are serpentins and straight ahead mean straight: simple, but not always easy.
The driving instructions are always the same: "Blood alone, keep the distance, and they are not competitions.
See you on the coastside in nine.
Okay, five pairs, I forgot you were on holiday.
Take a lot of water with you.
We will go north through the Cornati Archipelago from Trogira for two days, where we will go to Dugi Otok - Croatian language "go-island" - and, after a little slew, we will go on a walk through the Telašcica Nature Park to admire its steep rocks and salt lakes, where seawater flows through the underground canal.
It is said that those flying into it become younger because of their strength.
If we do, will our legs be younger and stronger?
On the small island of Molata, we turn south again, moving from the continent to the nearby islands seems to be accidental.
Most of our trips are on empty small roads on the borders of the country with wide views of the sea and a diverse country of plants: olives, vineyards, sharp plant brooks, Mediterranean smells in the air and countless butterflies in flight.
As we move forward, there is always a break, but when Ivan stops, there is always a big shadow, and small mice are like a prize for those who have arrived faster.
Sports and public activists go a lot on cycling weekends, and they know the standards of behaviour by sending warnings in a row and leaving free places, so that Moto-crews can take whirlwinding manoeuvres much safer.
"Two or get hit," one cycler says to the other after the heavy car driver decided to take a roll-over manoeuvre in an opaque curve and quickly detonated.
Thankfully, the brakes worked.
Ivan divides us into three groups, every piece of short section, for driving on major roads, with Ivan on the rear, to encourage and "end the pace", as Ivan says.
If we need to cross the main road, we all come together, step off the bicycles and the security after the transition with our bicycles on the other side as we have been instructed and not before.
"Do you think Ivan is aware that he doesn't speak to a group of children?" he asks a Swiss biker when we are on the road and are waiting for a signal when we can cross it.
Not all afternoons can be devoted to leisure time.
The city tour in Zadara reveals a Roman forum and marine eagles playing music that sounds like a horrific face of a prisoner's sea monster, with stone - mounted pipes in promenade and open water.
Zadar's famous sunset perfectly falls within the time between the main course and the bottle, and after the dark onset we return to the marine organ and watch the wave operated lamp games in the glass trotula, which is actually a dance floor.
When "Melody" early in the morning begins the way to the rosary biograd resort, the song of organ is nothing more than just a chump.
On the fifth day, we are completely free from cycling.
A trip up along the estuary of the Krka River to see its waterfalls; then, the afternoon tour in Sibeniki, where we are looking at the Cathedral of the Thought, the master of Dalmatia renaissance, as well as a walk of chair time along the calm Zlarina Island, looking for its local treasure coral, makes these days interesting.
The Lourda is about to accept pilgrims in the shadow of attacks
During the annual Catholic pilgrimage, people gather at the temple of Lurda Our Lady.
The French security forces are in high alert, as thousands of Catholics gather at the annual pilgrimage of the Lurda temple in the shadow of several terrorist acts.
Every year, on August 15, tens of thousands of people gather at the temple in the foot of the Pyrénian Mountains to celebrate Mary’s admission to heaven.
This year's pilgrimage takes place at a time when the Catholics were shocked by the killing of an older French priest on July 26 by two Islamic extremists who attacked the church in the north of France during the Mass and then turned his rod.
Jacques Amel's murder took place two weeks after a Tunisian, the investigators claim that he had been radicalized by the jihadist online video material,-- tipped into the cargo car Bastilla's day celebration in Riviera's city in Nice, killing 85 people.
After three large-scale attacks in 18 months, many French citizens are cautious about attending public events.
The number of tourists fell sharply, and the authorities were concerned that the number of pilgrims this year would fall sharply.
However, fear of mass withdrawals did not materialize -- and some organisers say that even the influx of visitors' applications was observed at the last moment.
Some 25 000 believers are expected to arrive, including large groups from Italy and Belgium, and about 200 of the Eastern Christian branch - the delegation of Orthodox representatives.
Many pilgrims have declared that they will not be allowed to be frightened.
"We don't intend to stop living," 66-year-old Christians said to the AFP agency, describing prayer as the only weapon in the fight against violence.
"It is important to show that life continues," said Matier Guinean, one of the coordinators.
We will not give up our faith, our beliefs, or our own way of life simply because some fanatics are trying to sow fear.
Due to concerns about safety in France since the attack in Nice, a number of large-scale events have been lifted, including a huge stock market in the northern city of Lille and the European Road Cycling Championship, which was due to take place in Nice in September.
"Last week I lived in fear that my phone would call in one call to withdraw applications," said Faben Ležesne, a priest in charge of the official pilgrimage.
"On the contrary - it seems that attacks mobilised believers," he said and announced the influx of last-minute applications.
Kristiāns Žels, the manager of the trade union of local hotel employees, confirmed the "increased interest" of pilgrimages after attacks.
About the temple where Mary, a virgin in 1858, had appeared to a poor shepherd, Bernadette, Subyru, and certainly had extremely strict security measures.
Some 250 policemen and two dozen soldiers have been designated for site protection, including bomb neutralisation experts and experts with explosives detection dogs.
Swamping through the safety barriers led to bags being tested at the entrance, while the number of access points was reduced from twelve to three.
Katrina Simcox, who travelled on a pilgrimage from northeastern England to Lourdes at the beginning of this month, described the enhanced security measures.
"By Thursday morning, there were armed guards in the temples, and then only one entrance could pass through the gates (with metal barriers), and bags were searched," she said.
"This all frightened my three children who are used to Lourdes, and it was hard not to scare them when they asked why it was happening," she said.
It did not damage my impressions, but I became sad about it being necessary, and I realized that many people were calmed down by these measures.
The opening route of Friday has also been shortened – instead of starting in Lurda and moving further to the temple, it will begin and end in the temple.
Other measures include the closure of airspace for flights above Lurda, the closure of streets close to the transport temple and the replacement of waste containers against transparent plastic bags.
The French Minister for the Interior, Bernis Kazenevs, will examine security measures on Saturday.
About six million people go to Lourdes a year, making it one of the largest attractions of Catholic pilgrimage in the world.
Many visitors lead relatives who are ill or disabled and who come to swim in a source cave in which Bernadete had seen Mary in the belief in the medical properties of the water.
Tīris Castio, one of the organizers, described this year's meeting as "a little unusual", given the "threat, as the roots seem to be sought in France."
However, he claimed that this would not affect the quality and depth of their experiences.
Francisco, 58-year-old volunteers, who helped sick pilgrims, admitted that in her opinion, the presence of soldiers dressed in civilian clothing was "a little depressing."
However, if all of this calms down, it's good.
The Zaragozo shopping centre shoots two injured
Two people were seriously injured after a man found fire in the center of his shopping in Zaragozo northeastern Spain.
The incident took place at 11 a.m. on Friday morning at the full trade centre of Aragonia in Zaragoza.
The initial reports show that the shooter could have shot a woman who could have been his ex-partner.
After shooting, the armed criminal escaped, and now he is being sought by the police.
Even yesterday, 12 drinkers and four aggressive drivers were caught.
Yesterday 12 drinkers and four aggressive drivers were caught on Latvian roads, informed the State Police.
Four of the stopped drinking slates were in Zemgale, three in the Riga region, two in Kurzeme and Latgale, and one in Vidzeme.
All four aggressive drivers are stopped in Riga region.
On the other hand, 218 protocols of administrative violation are drawn up for exceeding the permitted speed of driving.

Opening of the waterfowl hunting season.
Every second August, the waterfowl hunting season is opened.
This year it will start at 16:00 on 13th of August, therefore the State Police calls both hunters and residents to be particularly careful and to comply with the security rules.
Waterfowl hunts take place not only in hunting areas but also in public water bodies, and although weather weather conditions do not give rise to heat as for other years, it is possible that, in cooperation with hunters, these waters will also be used by holidaymakers.
Both hunters and holidaymen and those living at water bodies are encouraged to be particularly cautious in the vicinity of lakes and rivers and to comply with safety rules, thus not endangering themselves or others.
Since it has been observed in previous years that a large number of hunters are involved in the hunting of waterbirds during the first days of the opening season, this year the State Police, in cooperation with the State Forest Service, will carry out reinforced hunting control.
During control, the law enforcement will focus on compliance of arms and ammunition movements with the norms of the law, as well as monitoring that hunting takes place without the influence of alcoholic beverages and reciprocating substances.
The police recall that the use of semi-automatic firearms, which have a total capacity of more than three patrons for the use of waterfighters in hunting, is prohibited, inter alia, by amendments to the Law on the Movement of Arms and Special Resources, in particular Article 22 (91), which state that persons who have a long-range firearm or large-energy pneumatic weapons registered for hunting or sport and have a short stop of up to two hours when carrying these weapons to or from hunting have the right to keep weapons and ammunition in the vehicle during hunting, but have to be placed in the most secure place possible, so that a firefight or other packaging containing ammunition or weapons is not visible from the outside of the vehicle, are closed doors and are equipped with an alarm device, thereby ensuring that they do not accidentally enter into the hands of unauthorised persons.
The police are calling for their and the safety of co-people during the hunting season and if you consider offences or any security threats, we invite you to immediately report by telephone 110.
In the event of any threat, the legislators shall be prepared to respond to the information provided by the citizens.
The new coasts of Caledon have been shaken by the mound earthquake of 7.2
On Friday, the New Caledonian coast was shaken by the 7,2 magnithes earthquake, told seismologists, pointing out that there is no threat of tsunami.
The epicenter of the earthquake was located in a depth of nine kilometres (109 km) east of New Caledonia Ilanthera at 1.26.
The Pacific Cunami Alert Centre indicated that there are no warnings or recommendations at present in relation to the potential threat of tsunami to the region.
"The earthquakes in this region, as we know, are not unusual, nor are the activities recently unusual", said Phil Kamins, senior seismologist of the research centre Geoscience Australia.
It could potentially be felt in Vanuatu or New Caledonia, but I doubt that it is strong enough to cause damage.
New Caledonia is located in the "Ugins Ring" - Pacific tectonic activity area, where earthquakes and volcano eruptions occur frequently.
Colombia and Venezuela agree to open the border.
Colombia and Venezuela agreed to open checkpoints on the border of both countries, which were closed a year ago, following Venezuela's initiative, and on Thursday told Juan Manuel Santos and Nikolas Maduro, the President of Venezuela.
Initial border points will be open to pedestrians only.
From Saturday, five border points will be open every day from 8 to 20.
It will be possible to open the border to transport after the conclusion of separate international agreements on security, trade and energy.
In August last year, Maduro ordered the closure of a border in response to an attack by Colombian fighters on the Venezuelan border border.
Three Venezuelan soldiers were injured in this attack.
This July, Venezuela unilaterally opened the border due to the sharp economic crisis - the Venezuelans in poverty tried to break through the border to buy the first necessary goods in the border shops.
This opportunity was used by 200 000 Venezuelan citizens.
This time we are one of the prides of Latvia and the sympathetic Madara Palameika.
Madara Palameika was born on 18 June 1987 in Talsi.
She is an Latvian lighthouse, which is beginning to break in the fighting competition.
Her coach is Father Gint Palameik.
The Latvian recordist broke into a fair.
Participated in the 2012 Summer Olympic Games, several times participated in the World and European Championship (most place 4th place taken at the 2014 European Championship), and 3rd place won the 2015 Diamond League.
Facebook reports a fight for advertising brokers.
The most used social network in the world has sent a warning shot on Facebook, making it clear that blocking ad banners using special tools is not acceptable and that users will have to watch ads.
The popularity of special advertisingblockers is increasing, but this means that companies whose main source of income is advertising are decreasing.
Facebook has now made it clear that it is well understood the irritable nature of advertising banners, but users will also have to live with them.
However, they will be provided with tools to choose what type of material they are shown, reports BBC.
"As we provide more and more control opportunities for people, we will also start showing ads to those who use advertising blocking software", said Facebook ad business vice president Andrew Bosvort.
In other words, users will be able to choose what type of advertising they see when selecting brands and industries that they find interesting.
"People don't like to see ads that don't apply to them or interfere with content pleasures," said Bosvort.
Advertising blocking tools do not usually work on mobile devices, where Facebook receives the largest number of visits, but the reduction in banner exposures they create is also in billions of money.
According to BBC, some 200 million people use advertising blockers.
In the previous quarter of the business year, Facebook revenues from advertising were reported to be USD 6.2 billion, or EUR 5.55 billion.
It must be said that this is not the first time Facebook is actively involved in determining what network users see in their youth flows.
As one of the last steps Facebook has just begun to take action to remove or at least limit from the youth flows the headings behind which the "empty" messages are actually concealed.
At night, asphalting will take place on Freedom Street; traffic restrictions must be taken into account.
This night in Bērzaunes Street from Bērzaunes Street to Gustavs Zemgala Street will be used in asphalt laying works, therefore drivers have to take into account limited traffic in this street section.
As the agency LETA learned in the Riga City Council, traffic restrictions at this stage will start as early as this evening from 21 a.m. and the asphalt works will last until 12 a.m.7.
Traffic towards Juglu will be directed through tram tracks.
Drivers must take into account the limited traffic at this stage and the extra travel time.
The municipality invites with understanding to treat the restrictions introduced and to comply with traffic organisation procedures.
The reconstruction started on the main streets of the capital – Brīvības iela from Rāņa bulvāra to Lāčplēša Street, and from the Air Bridge to Jugla Street, Lāčplēša Street from the Island Bridge to Avot Street, Jugla Street from Kdeide to Malena Street and Lielvares Street from Dzelzava Street to 84vidusskola.
The construction works will last until the start of the new school year and are organised continuously, including during night hours when asphalt is mostly applied.
The Deputy Medvedev in Riga will meet secretly with several ZS Ministers.
The Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, Arkadijs Dvorkovics, visited Riga last week, met secretly with three ministers of the Union of Greens and Farmers (ZZS) at a fish processing plant.
Informal meeting took place at the fish processing plant "Kija", and the Minister of Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola, Minister of Transport Uldis Augulis and Minister of Agriculture Jānis Dūklavs participated in the meeting, and the internet portal "views.lv".
The fact that such a meeting has taken place has been approved by Reizniece-Ozola.
She explained that during the meeting she was talking about abolishing sanctions for fish processors and also about the Inčukalns gas storage.
A meeting was held without the involvement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, contrary to diplomatic practice.
The organizer of the meeting was Ambassador of Russia Aleksandrs Vesņakovs.
The suspicion of more than €130 000 misappropriation is being detained by the accounting officer.
The National Police (VP) Administration of Economic Crime (ENAP) this month for 130,000 misappropriation of Riga commercial companies by the accounting officer who has worked for 20 years in the company, the agency BNS informed VP representative Gita Gžibovska.
Current information indicates that the suspected woman has committed illegal activities for several years and has caused the company more than €130,000 in losses together.
Given that the company’s officials had not followed the cash flow carefully and trusted their employee, they only learned a few years later about the machinations that took place.
This month, VP ENAP police detained a suspected woman born in 1963 and searched in the company.
Criminal proceedings for misappropriation have been initiated in the event of a large scale.
For such crimes, the law provides for deprivation of liberty for a period of up to ten years by confiscation of property or without confiscation of property.
Currently, a person detained has a security measure that is not related to the deprivation of liberty.
In Estonia, antibodies against the Zico virus have been detected in nine people.
In Estonia, nine people were tested for Zicos virus antibodies, which means that they might have been in contact with this infection, as pointed out by the Estonian public broadcaster ERR.
The information provided by the laboratory shows that this year, 121 samples were tested for Zico virus and nine of them were positive.
In Finland and Sweden, the first cases of Žikas have been reported in countries close to Estonia.
Data from the Estonian Health Administration indicate that no acute Zico virus infection has been recorded in the country and that people do not need to undergo a Zico virus test for flu-like symptoms, but they must contact their family doctor.
We have detected IgG (imunglobulin Class G) antibodies that show that the tested person is at some point infected with Zico or similar virus.
"This does not mean that the patient has a Zicos virus," explained Paul Nabers, head of the hospital "Synlab" for infectious diseases.
The zico virus carries 'Aedes' skin.
There is a problem in Latvia with the development of quality car purchase, Vice President Ingus Rutiņš said in an interview with BNS.
Whether there are problems with the prices of dumping in the automotive sector, Rutiņš replied in a positive way.
Of course.
Car purchases are, however, different from those of service services, which make it easier to manipulate prices.
As a result of the end of the car, a certain amount must in any case be paid as it must be purchased from the manufacturer.
However, the problem is and can be classified in two groups.
Either the advertiser of the procurement is incompetent and does not tend to create high-quality procurement, which, as a result, often without knowing it, is "iepourcs".
"Will very conscious purchases be built so as to get something concrete, and then there are all the wonders," said the vice president of the Auto Association.
He pointed out that it is now popular to talk about moving away from the lowest price offer to the most economically advantageous offer as the criterion for determining the successful purchasing, but in part the public still has a misconception about these things.
Now it is very popular - let's go from the lowest price to the economically most advantageous offer!
However, the criteria must be set in both cases and, when they are taken into account and evaluated, the decision is made on the basis of the lowest price principle.
In quality procurement, the technical criteria should be very accurate and relevant to the market.
On the other hand, the points do not need to be seen in terms of anything that can be expressed in terms of money.
Points do not need to measure fuel consumption, emissions, service services and similar things.
You need to know the life cycle of the car, the ride, etc., then you can count the whole together.
"The question then is only where the customer himself is interested in from the scenarios?" explained Rutiņš.
The project manager, Pēteris Rubulis, noted that problems are related to the fact that often the same person creates purchases for cars, work gloves, food, and these purchases are derived from the same sample.
We have also brought spare parts of procurement models to our consultations, which was not so difficult to describe as a detailed absurd.
"The problem is that the designer of the procurement very often lacks any understanding of the subject of the procurement and requirements is simply taken from somewhere", admits Rubulis.
In turn, Rūtiņš added: the smaller the structure that advertises procurement, because more problems may be.
"Of course this is precisely because of a lack of human resources and expertise," said the Vice President of the Association.
Latvian volleyballs are not up to fight for medals.
On Thursday, Alexander Samoilov and Jānis Šmēdiņš left the Rio Olympics tournament and agreed to join Evand Gonsalvēvs Oliveira and Pedro Solbergs Salgada in the decisive match.

Quite a bit of indignation and sorrow caused on social networks, so we can see the most bright recordings from Twitter.
Riga Festival celebrations started with the market.
Look at the photo of the festival market in Esplanade.
"Die Antword" is telling the Death Unit about theft of style.
On Thursday, the South African group Die Antword accused the director of the film Suicide Sqaud (Employees' Unit) of using the group's uniquely examining use without permission, calling the honorable director of the film "Sicide Sqaud" (Sicide Sqaud).
The leader of the group singer Jolandi has addressed the director of the film studio Warner Bros in his mobile app "Instagram", saying: "It is so, David Ajer, that you steal our style."
According to her, the film stars War Delavinja and Jared Leto have said that Ajer was just about "Die Antword" in the film field.
"But you didn't ask for permission to cheat us," said the singer.
The 31-year-old musician says that her bandmate Ninja had a brief turn to Ajera, but he "no answer, no, just like a tiny dread."
Jolandi insists that Ajer has captured the scenes from the introduction of 2011 short films "Umshini Wam" showing the duet of the South African Hiphopa.
She has also published a video showing that Ajer Walker and Harley Quinn have taken the images from both singers’ appearance.
Leto himself insists that the image of the inspiration of Joker is based on the image of the rockist David Bowy.
In conclusion, Joland’s claim is based on the harsh critics’ assessment that the film has earned after its directorship.
Jolandi and Nindža, in the right words Anri du Tuata and Vatkin Tudor Jones, received a fame with three repa studies, promoting African "Zef" counterculture.
The first time in Latvia "The Rosenberg Trio" will be an opportunity to hear this evening, on August 12, at the Summertime Festival - invites Inese Galante.

Turkey is looking for missing diplomats after the coup attempt
Turkey is looking for at least 32 diplomats who did not return with the cancelled staff after the coup on 15 July.
Foreign Minister Mevits Čavošogs said on Friday that 208 Turkish Ministry staff were withdrawn from jobs around the world for the trial period of the coup, and 32 have disappeared "without authorisation".
Approximately 18 000 civilians, military leaders and academics have been arrested or withdrawn from their positions in Turkey, considering them as a loyal US official, Fetul Gulen, who is accused of drafting a government recovery plan.
Gulens, who lives in Pennsylvania, is Turkey's most sought-after list of people.
Kavosoglu said that the team of the US Department of Justice later this month will come to a visit to Turkey to discuss his possible extradition.
This issue has become a problem in US relations with Turkey, a member of NATO.
The US opposed the strong armament tactic after the coup by Turkish President R.R.J. Tajjipa Erdogan, and Turkey replied to this by trying to establish closer ties with Russia.
Kavosoglu said that Turkish military attachés in Greece had fled to Italy, the Attaché in Kuwait tried to flee to Saudi Arabia, but was sent back, and two of the generals were caught in Dubai and sent to Turkey.
He also said that two officials fled to New York in Bangladesh and one of Russia went to Japan.
The Daily Hurryet of Ankara, citing military sources, reported that Turkish military attaché in Jordan was also missing.

The organizers of the Olympic Games are trying to clear the green coloured diving pool
The Olympic divers, for whom the exercise was scheduled on Friday, arrived at a closed pool, because the organizers needed more time to clear the green water before the first individual race in Rio Olympics.
The water suddenly changed the color on Tuesday, synchronised diving among the competitions.
The organizers claimed that even after the larger nearby pool of water polars and synchronised swimming, the water race was safe, and the greens also painted.
It was not yet possible when athletes came to warm up in the morning, although finally the pool was opened 1 p.m. after local time – only 2 1/2 hours before women competed 3 meters.
The color of the water looked closer to its normal color, but still with its green color.
The American nigger Ebia Johnson, who competes for trampling, told us that she came to warm up just to find out that the pool was closed without warning.
His Twitter wrote that "#FixTheSwamp (correct the bog) should be fashioned.
Tom Deilijs, a British divinator, who won the bronze synthesizing platform, also commented on the pool status in the pond.
Hopefully, this means we haven't been naughty in the last few days like a very bad one!
Mario Andrada, the chief speaker of the Committee of local organizers, stressed that the pool is safe to give the green light to 3 metres of foreheads.
He agreed that some athletes had been affected by water, but said that it was the result of the cleaning efforts of the pool.
"We repeat many times what we have said all the time - water does not endanger the health of athletes in any way," he said.
On the first day of such a water situation, one or two athletes complained that they had no eyes.
It was the result that the first reaction, when we saw how the water was getting green, was to use one of the chemicals - chlorine - it is used very often in swimming pools.
We immediately reduced the quantities.
We again tested water, and it fully complied with the parameters.
Simon Langford, the chief speaker at the centre of Mary-Lenk water sports, said that the pool was closed for further cleaning work.
He said that the decision was supported by the World Organization FINA (International Swimming Federation).
"The reason is that the water must be calm so that the pool can return to its blue color as soon as possible," Langford said in his statement.
Andrad said that the deterioration of the pool was a surprise to organizers who were not prepared.
"China is not a precise science," he said.
Some things, as you can see, are long.
In the last few days, rain water was even more difficult to obtain in normal conditions.
"The rains don't work," Andrad said.
He added that dry exercises were available to athletes in the morning, but admitted that "it was not perfect."
He explained that the change in colour of the pool was due to increased alkalin levels, as aquarium water could become green if not properly monitored.
When we started to do something about green, there was discussion about the best chemicals.
We cannot use too many chemicals in water, because athletes practice it," Andrad said.
We could certainly have done better at the beginning to prevent water becoming green.
When it became green, we made a mistake again.
AP athletes Jay Koen and Steve Wadeanire participated in the creation of this action.
Shanghai, Taipei, will nevertheless hold a forum despite the suspension of cross-border communications
However, Shanghai and Taipei will organise the annual City Forum in Taipei from 22 to 23 August, announced by the municipality of Shanghai on Friday, despite the suspension of cross-border communication mechanisms.
A high-level municipal official, Sha Hailin Shanghai may lead a delegation represented in the forum, announced by the Government of Shanghai on its official microblog account, Sina Weibo.
The Forum has been held by both cities in rotation order since 2010.
The 2016 Forum will focus on exchange of experience in areas such as health, electronic administrative services, culture and transport, seeking to "deep exchange of experience and cooperation" between the two cities, as reported by the Government of Shanghai.
Taiwan has not recognised the agreement reached in 1992 strengthening the one-China principle since the new leader Tsai Ing-vens took up his position in May, which has led to the suspension of communication and consultation mechanisms.
Ma ksiaoguang , a speech from the State Council of the Taiwanese Office of Affairs in such a land, on Friday said that peaceful cross-border relations could exist while the Taiwanese side stops on the political foundations of the 1992 agreement.
"We have an active and open attitude to the exchange of experiences between cities of both sides," said MA stressing that the substance of cross-border relations and exchanges of experiences between cities should be interpreted correctly.
Ugandan President meets with Chinese Foreign Minister, looks forward to closer cooperation
On Thursday, during a meeting with the Chinese Foreign Minister, Vanga Ji, the President of Uganda, Joveri Museveni thanked China for its long-standing support for Uganda's development and expressed the hope for enhanced cooperation.
Museveni said that China is an ancient friend of Uganda and Africa, who supported the African continent's release from colonialism and subsequently supported Africa's economic and social development.
The President mentioned the construction of Tanzania-Zambia railway in the 1970s as evidence of China's generous support, even when China itself was not particularly prosperous.
Museveni said that China has engaged in multilateral cooperation with Uganda, investing in infrastructure and business, as well as in cultural exchanges, and added that this type of cooperation contributes to the long-term development of Uganda more than simply provided financial assistance.
He hopes that China will be able to engage in various ways in developing Uganda's infrastructure and building industrial parks.
He also calls on the Chinese to invest more in Uganda and to travel it.
Wang It commended Uganda's work in the fields of industrialisation and modernisation of agriculture and added that China would continue to be the most reliable and ideal partner for Uganda.
Vang declared that China was ready to do its utmost to help the economic and social development of Uganda and added that cooperation between China and Uganda was genuine and without any political considerations, because it is based on a high level of political credibility and a reliable friendship over time.
He said that China could strengthen cooperation with Uganda's infrastructure and industrial park, as well as support the development of the energy and agricultural sectors of this East African nation.
