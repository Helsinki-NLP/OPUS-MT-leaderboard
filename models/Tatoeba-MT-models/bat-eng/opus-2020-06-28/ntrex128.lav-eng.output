Assembly Members (AMs) are worried about the possibility of "acquiring as amenities"
Some of the members of the Assembly are concerned about the proposal to change their position to the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament – Member of the Wales Parliament).
This is due to plans to change the name of the Assembly to the "Welsh Parliament".
In the whole political spectrum, AM is worried that it can make them a laughing object.
One of the Labour Party's AM has explained that their group is concerned about 'replaying with the words Twp and Pwp'.
For readers outside Wales: in Wales, "twp" means "only" but "pwp" means "some".
The parties Pleid AM pointed out that none of the group was "not satisfied" and recommended alternatives.
The representative of Wales's Conservative Party admitted that their group was ready to look at the change of name, but added that MWP is very similar to Muppet, which means "the sea".
In this context, it should be taken into account that the Velscan letter "w" is spoken in a similar manner to that of the English Yorkšīr's widget "u".
The Assembly Commission, which is currently working on changing the title of draft laws, said: "The final decision on what terms will be used to designate the members of the Assembly must, of course, be taken by the members themselves."
The 2017 Act of the Government of Wales conferred on the Wales Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published a proposal for the results of a public consultation, providing broad support for the change of the name of the Assembly to the Wales Parliament.
As regards the name of AM, the Commission preferred 'Welsh Parliament Member' (WMP), but MWP received the highest support for the public consultation.
The AM explicitly recommends alternative options, but the fight for an agreement can cause a headache to the speaker Elīna Jones, of the Assembly, who is expected to submit a draft law on changes in the coming weeks.
The draft law on changes will also include other changes in the work of the Assembly, including the laws on the discretion of AM and the structure of the committee system.
The final vote on how they will be called will be taken after they have discussed the laws and regulations.
Macedonians going to vote in referendum on changing the name of the country
The voters will vote on Sunday whether their country's name will be changed to "the Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The national referendum was organised to resolve decades of disagreement with Greece, a neighbouring province of Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the northern neighbour gives the impression of claims on its territory, and has repeatedly objected to Macedonia's request to be admitted to the EU and NATO.
President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, one of the plebiscite in favour of a change of name for opponents, declared that he ignored the vote.
However, the referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name is simply a matter for EU and NATO to join.
St. Mārtiņš Church calls to silence, fighting for existence at Harlem churches.
"As the old people I've talked to, they used to be in a bar and a church," says Mr. Adams.
"Now there is no more of either one."
He admits that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People are socializing in other ways today," he said.
"The bar is no longer in the neighbourhood living rooms, which people visit regularly."
Speaking to the churches, he is worried that the money that he receives when he sells property will end faster than he expects the leader, "and sooner or later they will return to the starting point".
The church, he added, might be replaced with apartment buildings with apartment properties that will host people who will not help in the surrounding temples.
"The largest number of people who will buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he explained, "and thus the day will come when these churches will close forever, because it is unlikely that most of the people who will enter these apartments will be members of this church."
The two churches were built by a white congregation, before Harlem became a black metropolis, the Community of Metropole in 1870, and St. Martina 10 years later.
In the 1930 ’ s, the original congregation of white Methodists abandoned the building.
The building was taken over by a black congregation that had worshiped God right next to it.
The black congregation of St. Mārtiņš Church took over his blessings during John Howard Johnson. On the 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, he led a working boycott who refused to accept or give promotion in the blacks.
The fire in 1939 seriously destroyed the building, but since Father Johnson’s members planned to rebuild the building, they ordered a call game.
His blessing in the congregation of St. Martins, David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor, proudly called the call game "for the calls of the poor".
The expert who played this call game in July used other words: "cultural treasure" and "an indispensable historical instrument".
Expert Tiffany Ng from Michigan University added that it was the first call game in the world played by the black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who, 18 years ago, moved to the church of Riverside.
Mr Merriweather said that the congregation of St Mārtiņš did not replace him.
In the last few months, relations between architects and contractors were reflected around the church of St. Mārtiņš, some of which were attracted by secular power, and others by the episcopical ecclesiastical church.
In July, the board, which is formed by secular leaders, addressed in writing the diocese with concern that the diocese "will attempt to pass costs" to the board, although the board was not involved in contracting the architects and contractors who sent the diocese.
Some in the congregation complained about the lack of transparency in the conduct of the diocese.
Shark wound 13-year-old teen at theOmar fishing ground
Shark attacked a 13-year-old boy in California on Saturday and wounded her. It was the first day of the lobster season, telling the services.
The attack took place shortly before 7 morning, near Beacon's Beach in the city of Ensinita.
Chad Hammel informed KSWB-TV in Sanjego that he and his friends had niris about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy was calling for help, and then the band came to him to help the boy get out of the water.
Hammel explained that at first he thought that it was just a sense of being caught by the lobster, but then he said he understood that the boy was screaming "My shit!
I'm saying!"
The whole bone of his key was opened," said Hammel, who immediately noticed it when he came to the boy.
"I shouted for everyone to leave the water: "The water is shark!" added Hammel.
The boy was transported by air to the Rady hospital in Sandygo, where his condition was recognised to be critical.
The species affected shark is unknown.
The barbers ’ captain, Larry Gilles, informed the media that shark had been observed in this area for a few weeks before, but it was acknowledged that it was not a dangerous species for humans.
Jail added that the victim was injured by the upper part of the torso.
Officials closed access to beaches from Ponto Beach in Casablad, Casablad, to the city of Swami's Ensinita for 48 hours for the purposes of safety and security.
Jails pointed out that there are more than 135 shark species in this area, but most are not considered to be dangerous to humans.
Sainsbury's plans to penetrate the UK beauty industry market
"Sainsbury's" goes to the attack "Boots", "Superdurg" and "Debenhams" with the shelves of beauty products of a universal shop and trained sellers.
As part of a significant investment in the UK's 2.8 billion pound of beauty market, which continues to grow, although the sales of fashion goods and home items will decrease, in 11 shops in the country will try bigger rows of beauty shelves, and if everything goes successfully, the next year there will be more such shops.
In the beauty sector, funds are invested when supermarkets seek to use shelves previously dedicated to TV, microwave ovens and household goods.
"Sainsbury's" informed that we would double our offer in beauty care up to 3000 products, including brands such as "Revlon", "Essie", "Tweezerman" and, for the first time, "Dr. PawPaw".
Existing lines from "L'Oreal", "Maybelline" and "Burt's Bees" will also receive more seats with brand areas similar to those in "Boots" stores for example.
The supermarket is also once again placing on the market its Boutique decorative cosmetic line, in which most products will be veganly friendly — increasingly demanded by younger buyers.
In addition, a wholesale perfume dealer "Fragrance Shop" will try a concession in two "Sainsbury's" shops, the first of which was opened last week in Croydon in the south of London, and the second will be opened in Sely Oak in Birmingham, later this year.
Buying online and switching to small purchases of food every day in local shops means that supermarkets need to invest more to convince people to visit them.
The Executive Director of Sainsbury's, Mike Coupe, has said that commodity outlets will become increasingly similar to universal shops, because the chain of shops is trying to fight with discount shops Aldi and Lidl, offering a larger range of services, but without food.
Sainsbury's has located Argos in several hundred stores and has opened several Habitats since bought both chains two years ago, which is claimed to have improved the sales of goods and made the purchased more profitable.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to improve its beauty and pharmaceutical departments ended with defeat.
"Sainsbury's" joint venture with "Boots" was tried at the beginning of 2000, but the union broke out after a dispute on how to distribute income from pharmacy shops in supermarkets.
The new strategy develops after Sainsbury's sold its 281 store business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain for 125 million pounds 3 years ago.
According to this plan, "Lloyds" will have the task of complementing a range with a wide range of exclusive skin care products, including "Roche-Posay" and "Vichy", in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury's, said: "In order to improve the environment for buyers, we changed the appearance of the shelves of our beauty products and their impressions.
We have also invested in highly trained colleagues, who will always be ready to make a recommendation.
Our brand range is designed to meet all needs, but attractive environment with a convenient location means that we are now an enthralling goal on the path to beauty, a goal that challenges past shopping habits."
Peter Jones "fearing full" after Holly Viloubia refuses a 11 million deal
The "Dragon Den" star, Peter Jones, "accepted fury" after the TV show manager Holly Willoughby, refused 11 million pounds of the deal with his lifestyle brand to pay all attention to his new contracts with "Marks and Spencer" and "ITV"
Viloubia has no time to devote to their home clothes and accessories brand "Truly".
A couple of business were compared with Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
"This Morning" 37-year-old show driver used Instagram to announce she's leaving.
Holly Viloubia has abandoned the Dragon Den star Peter Jones, because at the last moment he left their profitable lifestyle brand business — to focus on his new huge contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources of information claim that Jones was "fear full", when a TV golden girl at a tight meeting on Tuesday at the residence of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, announced that her new contracts worth up to GBP 1.5 million meant that she no longer had time to devote to her home dress and accessories brand "Truly".
The company was compared with the Goop (Gwinet Plarova brand) by Gwinet and, at the same time, it would double the wealth of Vilobian, which is estimated to amount to 11 million pounds.
When Viloubia (37) used Instagram to announce that he left "Truly", Jones moved away from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
As the source of information says, "Truly" was the most important of Hollie's priorities.
It should have become her long-term future, dedicated to the next decade.
Her decision to stand up was surprised by all the involved unprepared.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday: everything was so close to the start.
The centre of Mārlova shall consist of goods ready for sale in full storage."
Experts believe that the head of this Morning, one of the most financially profitable stars, can pay millions away because a lot of money has been invested in various products — from cushions and candles, to clothes and goods for the house, and it will be even more late to place them on the market.
And that may mean the end of a long friendship.
For 10 years, my mother of three children, Viloubia, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have maintained close relations with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Viloubia "Truly" together with Keppa was established in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined in March as president.
Both couples spend their holidays together, and Jones owns 40 % of the shares in the Bolvina TV producer company.
Viloubia must become the ambassador of the M&S brand and she will replace Ent McPartlin as the head of I'm A Ceebrity.
Jones's close source yesterday declared, "We don't want to comment on his business."
Serious conversation "and then we fell in love"
He was laughing at the criticism that will be received from news companies about a comment that some may consider 'not appropriate to the President' and that he is so positively referring to the North Korean leader.
Why has the President come from as much as he refused?
The tramp said in his picture of the "Know Dick" voice.
"I didn't say anything."
He pointed out that Kim had shown interest in meeting once again after Tramps acknowledged their initial meeting in June in Singapore as a major step towards the denuclearisation of North Korea.
Negotiations on denuclearisation have stopped, however.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, one of the major North Korean diplomats Ri Yong Ho informed world leaders in the UN General Assembly that North Korea does not see the United States' "response" to the initial steps of North Korea towards disarmament.
Instead, he pointed out that the US continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining tension.
Tramps was much more optimistic in his tongue.
"We have a great relationship with North Korea," he said.
"We were about to fight North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said that his work to improve relations with Kim had produced positive results — stopping the missile test, helping the release of prisoners, and returning the rest of American soldiers home.
And he defended his unusual approach when it comes to relations with Kim.
"It's just to give the impression of the President, but instead of having 10,000 people outside there trying to enter this closely populated area, we have 200, here," said Trumps, pointing out the crowd right in front of him.
The tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia are destroying the island, killing hundreds of people
Following the Lombard earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organisations were told that their assistance was not necessary.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombarda were displaced, the state of national disaster was not declared, but it is necessary to propose foreign aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they made it very clear that they did not ask for international assistance, so it is a certain problem" admitted Miss Sumbung.
Although Save the Children collects the group for driving to the Pala, it is still unclear whether foreign workers will be allowed to work there.
Mr Sutopo, a representative of the National Disaster Agency, explained that the Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Pala in order to see if the international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the assistance.
Given that earthquakes are regularly occurring in Indonesia, the country is still extremely unsuspectable in nature’s anger.
Although there are cases of shelters in Aceh, such are rare along other shores.
It was also likely that Palau’s failure to respond to a warning about the tsunami, despite the warning, was also affected by human death.
Even in the most favorable times, the movement between the many islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The ship-situation, which had strayed in Lombarda to treat the victims of the earthquake, now goes to Pala, but will need at least three days to reach the victims of the new destruction.
President Joko Widododo has made the improvement of the infrastructure destroyed by Indonesia the central point of his election campaign and has allocated large sums to roads and railways.
However, the lack of resources has plagued the administration of Mr Joko and is waiting for reelection next year.
Moreover, Mr Joko has to fight with the long-standing problem of tensions between the sect in Indonesia, where most Muslims have accepted one of the conservative forms of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were expelled from their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets using machetes, bows, arrows, and other primitive weapons.
Look at: Liverpool player Daniel Starij with ambition restores balance in match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturiridge rescued Liverpool from being lost against Chelsea at the premiere, getting the gates at the 89th minute on Saturday play at the Stanford Bridge stadium in London.
Starijs received a penny from Jerdan Shaqiri (Xherdan Shaqiri) at about 25 meters (30 yards) from the Chelsea gate, when his team lost with 1:0.
He moved the ball slightly to the left of himself and then took the ball in the direction of the next gate-room.
In this attempt, the ball flew high across the area, reaching the top right corner of the net.
The bomb finally ended up flying over the head of the jumping kepa Arrizabalag and falling into the net.
"I just tried to get that position to get to the ball, and players like Sach (Shaq) always play as far ahead as possible, so I just tried to get as much time as possible," Starijs explained LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Cante (Kante) coming, the kissing ball, and, don't think much, the ghost."
The half-time "Chelsea" was led by 1:0 after the star of the Belgians (Eden Hazard) caught the words in 25 minutes.
The "Blues" attacker played the ball back to Mateo Kovačic (Mateo Kovacic), before turning to the middle of the square and at the maximum speed to jump to the "Liverpool" square.
Kovachich quickly played and received the ball back in the middle of the square.
Then he made a nice shot between the players, allowing Azard to get into the area.
Azard exceeded the protection speed and finished the combination by taking a blow to the left foot on the net, passing to Liverpool Elison Becker.
On Wednesday, at 15.00, "Stadio San Paolo" in Naples (Italy) will fight with "Napoli".
"Chelsea" with "Environment" UEFA The European League will meet on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
Indonesian tsunami victims reach 832 people
The number of victims of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia has reached 832, announced early Sunday by the State Disaster Agency.
Many people were reported to be trapped in the ruins of buildings after a major earthquake of 7.5 milieu, which struck the country on Friday and caused up to 20 ft (~6,0 m) high waves, and the news conference was informed by the agency’s representative Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The city of Palais, with more than 380 000 people, was covered by the ruins of the collapsed buildings.
Police suspects of murdering a woman to arrest a 32-year-old man
The murder investigation was initiated after a woman’s body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44 - year - old wound victim was found at 7.55, Grayson Mews Street, and a 32 - year - old man was suspected of murder.
The police have called on people to apply for something in the area that has seen or heard.
Detective inspector Brian O'Hagan said: 'The investigation has just begun, but I would like to invite you to contact us every one of us who was in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhed and saw or heard something suspicious.
I also call on everyone, especially the drivers of taxis, who could have recorded something in their car video recorders, to contact us, because they probably have information important for our investigation."
The police representative confirmed that the woman whose body was found is a local resident of Birkenhead, and she was found in her possession.
At this afternoon, friends who think they know a woman have come to a crime scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and, as the police have reported, they are working to inform the nearest relatives of the victim.
The Taxometer Manager, who lives in Greisonum, tried to return to his apartment, but the police told him that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He could not express a word when he learned what had happened.
Citizens are informed that they will spend hours before they will be allowed to return.
It was heard that a police officer tells a man that the entire area is perceived as a crime scene.
A woman in tears appeared at the scene of the crime.
She keeps saying, "It's so terrible!"
Two afternoon inside the cordon had two police vans, and another was placed right next outside.
Several policemen were deployed inside the cordon and controlled apartment buildings.
Anyone with information is asked to use DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact "Crimestoppers anonymously" by call 0800 555 111 by calling 247.
Kromvel's statue becomes the latest scandal for the rewriting of history
The rejection would be ethically justified in the light of the activities similar to the Taliban, which led to the destruction of so many cultural and religious monuments of England by his fanatic Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described the proposal made by Mr Crick as "false" and "a try to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: 'In view of the ongoing debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the figure outside the Palace of Westminster would also become an objective.
Kromvel himself commanded neither the execution nor the destruction of sanctifications during the English civil wars.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed by his predecessor, Thomas, who lived for centuries.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s magnificent portrayal of Kromvel reveals his view in the 19th century and is part of historiography of a person whom many believe it is still worth honoring.
Mr Goldsmith announced the Sunday Telegraph: 'Cromwell was probably more than today at the end of the 19th century than was, of course, a parliamentary defender against external pressure, which was, of course, a monarchy in his case.
A historical discussion is continuing as to whether it really is a completely akurated picture of the topic.
Clearly, the conflict in the middle of the 17th century determined the future development of our nation, and Kramvel, as such, is a well - known personality representing one of the sides of the breed of that time.
He's achieved by being a lord's tread, it's worth praising and mentioning."
Pig-slaughter blows the farmer in China to death
According to information, in the local media market, a farmer was attacked and killed in south-west China.
A man — mentioned only by his name Juan — was found dead in an overcrowded artery, all in one blood on the pig cake market in the province of Lupanshui in Guizhou, reported "South China Morning Post" on Sunday.
The pigs are about to inject the vaccine into the pig cell in the Chiining (Xinning) Province of China (Qinghai) on 30 May 2005.
He and his cousin are reported to have arrived on Wednesday from a neighbouring province of Juani to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The following morning, his cousin found a man dead and found that a pig cell next to him stood open.
He told them that there was a large male pig with blood in the mouth in the pig cell.
According to the information, the judicial investigation confirmed that 550 pounds (~249 kg) of heavy wand had collapsed the farmer.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and sacrificial," said cousin. "It is only his name Wu (Wu), who says "Guiyang Evening News".
The material of the security chamber showed how Juan enters the market on Thursday about 4.40 p.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Juan was not his own brother or his cousin.
The Market Manager informed Evancing News that the later vest was turned on to prevent its attacks on others while the police collected evidence at the scene.
According to the information, the Juan family and market management discusses compensation for his death.
Although this is rare, other attacks of pigs have been reported in humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and a man at his farm in Massachusetts, resulting in a man's critical injury.
Even 10 years ago, 650 pounds (~295 kg) was held by a heavy pig in Wales by farmers forced onto the tractor until the animal was frightened by his wife.
After farmers in Oregon in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba explained that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "pulse shot".
"It's just playful.
They like to suck, they're very curious... they don't want to harm you.
You just have to show them enough respect," he said.
The end of Orkanas Rose brings a wide and strong rain in the southwest of the United States
It is estimated that Orctan Rose will weaken as the coldest waters go to the north coast of Mexico.
However, the coming days of Rose will bring floodwaters in the north and southwest of Mexico.
Five afternoons (after North American Eastern Time) the Rose Winds reached 143 km/h (85 miles per hour) corresponding to a Category 1 orcade, and the point was 620 km (385 miles) south-west of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rose is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure zone is formed above the Pacific, moving east toward the east coast of the United States. With tropical storm forces approaching the peninsula of Lower California, on Monday it will start a deep humidity mass from the tropical strip to the south-west of the United States.
On Monday, Mexico will bring up to 10 inches (~25.4 cm) of rain.
Then tropical humidity, interacting with the short-range low pressure horizon, will create a wide area of strong rains in the South West in the coming days.
1-4 inches (~2,6 to 10,2 cm) will cause dangerous sudden floods, mud currents and possibly landslides in the desert.
Wet deep from the tropical strip will cause rain, which in certain places will reach 2-3 inches (~5.1 to 7.6 cm) per hour, especially in the southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
Most south-west, especially most of Arizona, are expected to rain up to 24 inches (~5,2 to 10,1 cm).
There is potential for sudden flooding with rapid deterioration due to the dispersion of tropical rains.
It is very undesirable to go into the desert because of the dangers of tropical rains.
Strong rain can transform canyons into rapid rivers, but storms will bring local storms and sandstorms.
Under low pressure, the local part of the coastline of Southern California will be brought nearer.
Rains may occur, which together will exceed half an inch (~1.3 cm) and may cause slight mud streams and slippery roads.
It will be the region's first rainhouse in the wet season.
Distributed tropical rains Arizonas will begin to approach late Sunday and early Monday, before rains take over wider areas late and early on Tuesday.
The strong rain will spread on Tuesday to the Four Space Region (DR Colorado, DA Juta, NA Arizona and DR New Mexico) and will last all Wednesday.
In October, intense temperature fluctuations are possible throughout the United States, as the Arctic temperature is falling, but tropicals are still quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature at a short distance.
This is a dramatic example of temperature differences on Sunday in the central part of the United States.
The difference between temperatures in Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and Senluis and Demoin (Des Moines), varies by almost 20 degrees.
The following days will try to develop and expand long lasting summer heat.
In most of the US central and eastern parts of October, it is expected that the beginning of October will be warm, reaching 80 degrees or more (Farenheit; ~27 degrees Celsius) in vast areas from southern plains to part northeast.
Temperature in New York City on Tuesday could reach 80 degrees (Farenheit; ~27 degrees Celsius), which would exceed the average by about 10 degrees.
Our long-term climate forecasts show that there is a strong likelihood that the average temperature in the eastern US will exceed in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people were listening to the Bretha Kaveno case
On Thursday, more than 20 million people watched on six television channels with enthusiasm, as evidenced by Brett Kavanaugh and Cristine Blasey Ford, the candidate for the Supreme Court, who accused Kaveno of sexual harassment, which the woman claims happened in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political undivided switch-off of the regular transmission by broadcasters to report the latest developments in Friday's events was continued: the agreement organised by Arizona senator Jeff Flake to investigate the FBI's charges for weeks.
Forda informed the Committee on Justice of the Senate that she was absolutely convinced that Kaveno had dealt with and tried to wear her clothes during the secondary school party.
Kaweno unmistakably showed that he was absolutely sure he did not.
The Nielsen reported this on Friday was 25.4 million people.
The companies CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC registered the average interest of the viewers.
Data on other broadcasters, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, which demonstrated this, were not immediately available.
And "Nielsen" usually faces problems in listing people who are looking at what is happening in offices.
In order to get a better idea, this number of viewers corresponds to the number of turn-off games or Oscar ceremony observers.
Fox News Channel, whose commentators have strongly supported the appointment of Kaveno, was the largest audience, on average 5,69 million during the whole day hearing, informed Nielsen.
ABC was the second with 3,26 million spectators.
CBS attracted 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, informed Nielsen.
The interest remained high even after hearing.
Fleuk was the central figure of Friday’s drama.
After the moderate Republican team had published a statement that he would vote on the appointment of Kaveno, the senator noticed the CNN and the CNS cameras on Friday morning, when he, accompanied by the call of protesters, tried to lift to get to the hearing of the Committee on Justice.
On the CNN, he stood for several minutes for a bent eye, as a paralyzed.
"I stand here, right in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the state?
He was told that "the company owns power while so many women are powerless."
Fleuk explained that his team had made a statement, and before the elevator was closed, he was told that he still had something to say during the committee hearing.
Cable networks and broadcasters were broadcast live several hours later when the Committee on Justice intended to vote on the nomination of Kaveno for voting in the Senate.
Fleek, however, claimed that he would only do so if he knew that the FBI would deal with the accusations against the candidate that the minority had demanded.
Fleuk was partially convinced by conversations with Chris Coons, a fellow democrat.
After negotiations with Koons and several more senators, Fleuk made its decision.
The choice of Fleuk was important because it was clear that the Republican would not vote in favour of Kaveno without the investigation.
President Trump has instructed the FBI to investigate Kavanaugh's accusations.
British Prime Minister Maya accuses critics of political games on Breksita’s behalf
In an interview with Prime Minister Terez Mey, the "Sunday Times" newspaper, which criticises her plan to withdraw from the European Union, accused people of having a 'political play' with the future of Great Britain and the destruction of national interests.
British Prime Minister Terez Maya arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Great Britain, 29 September 2018.
In another interview, right next to an interview with him on the first page of the newspaper, Mary's former Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson, continues to attack her Brexita's plan on the future relationship between Britain and the European Union, the so-called Chequers Plan, stressing that the proposal for the UK and the EU to use each other's tariffs is "fully absurd".
Wade Sims Shooting: Police arrested Diteon Simpson, suspected of the murder of a LSU player
The police have arrested the shooting of suspects of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketballist.
Diteon Simpson, a 20-year-old, was arrested and arrested as accused of a second-degree murder, informed the police station of Baton Rouge.
The officials released a video showing the deal of Sims with Simpson, and the police reported that Sims lost their glasses during the fight.
CBS's daughter company WAFB reports that police glasses were found at the scene of the crime and that Simpson's blood was found on them.
After questioning Simpson, the police informed him that he had confessed to the shooting of Wade.
According to the lawyer, he was given $350,000 in security.
On Friday, a team of a judicial expert at the Eastern Baton Rouge Parish gave a preliminary conclusion stating that death caused a shot in the head that hit the neck.
The department thanks the operational group on the search for police refugees in Louisiana, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the police and the local community at Southern University for helping with the investigation leading to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, director of sports at LSU, thanked the law enforcement in the territory for their "devoy and work in the name of justice".
Samss was 20 years old.
6 feet 6 inches (~1,98 m) the long attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball LSU.
In the last season, on average, he won 5.6 points in one game and 2.6 bombs.
On Friday morning, the LSU basketball coach Will Wade announced that the team was "slopped" and "shocked" about Wade's death.
"This is what a person is worried about always," said Wade.
Volcane blows ash across Mehiko
The ashes from Pokatepetla volcano have reached the southern neighbourhoods of the capital of Mexico.
After the activity was observed in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours, the National Disaster Prevention Centre warned the Mexicans on Saturday that they should not approach the volcano.
The Centre was able to observe multiple squeezing and shaking.
The images in the social networks showed that car windmills in the vicinity of Mehiko, such as Hochimilko (Xochimilco), are covered with a thin ash layer.
The geophysicists have noticed 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital volcano, since the strong earthquake of 7.1 matronides shocked the central part of Mexico in 2017.
The volcano, also known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police conflict with Catholic separatists before the anniversary of the vote on independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday following the clash of protestors with the public order police and, when thousands joined the opposition demonstrations, to mark the first anniversary of the polarising vote on the separation of Catalonia.
The group’s masked separation of supporters by public order policemen was accusing them of eggs and girded in powder colour, creating dark cloud dust on the streets, which would normally be full of tourists.
And then the police were using bats to prevent the fights.
Several hours of independent supporters, saying: "Don't forget or forgive!" were involved in confrontation with unitary protesters who said: "Long life for Spain!"
According to the local newspapers, fourteen people were given medical treatment during protests due to minor injuries.
One year after the referendum on 1 October, which Madrid recognised as illegal, but which the Catalonians praised, the idea of independence in the affected region remains under great stress.
The voters expressed their conviction of independence, although the turnout activity was low and those against separation were largely boycotted.
According to Catalonia's officials, almost 1000 people were injured last year when the police tried to stop the vote at the election points throughout the region and violently clashed.
The independent groups were on Friday night in order to prevent demonstrations in support of the state police.
The demonstration took place, but the demonstrators were forced to choose a different path.
Narkis Teremes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, admitted that she no longer hopes Catalonia would gain independence.
"Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents' eyes filled with joy for having been allowed to vote, but now everything is stopped," he said.
Although the parties supporting Catalonia won with a small but important victory in regional elections last year, these parties have fought to keep moving this year because several of the most famous leaders have either emigrated or arrested and are waiting for the court to play a role in organising the referendum and in declaring its subsequent independence.
The 42-year-old mechanic Joan Puig, who filmed a phone protest in support of the police, said that the conflict was built by politicians from both sides.
"The tension is increasing," he said.
On Saturday, one of the nine Catalonia leaders, Uriol Junquerez, who have been in custody until the trial since last year, announced that he would stand for the elections to the European Parliament next year.
"Canding in the European elections is the best way to expose the regression and repression of democratic values that the Spanish Government has drawn against us," he said.
Londonderija: men arrested after engorgement in a car building
Three men (33, 34, and 39) were arrested after the car had been hit several times in London.
The incident took place at Balinagard krešcent (Ballynagard Crescent) on Thursday about 7.30 p.m. in BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Bleming (Bob Bleming) informed that the gates and the building itself were damaged.
Perhaps the crown was shot at the same time on the car.
Men's blow let "Livingston" with 1-0 win "Rangers"
Dolly Menga first gate provided the Livingston victory
The supported Livingston stunned Rangers by bringing Steven Gerrard to his second loss in 18 games that took place in the role of the manager of Ibrox Club.
The Dolly Meng blow proved to be crucial, because the Gary Holt team adjusted the situation with Hibernian.
The Jeard team has not won guests in this season, and next Sunday they have to meet with the leader of Hearts, from which they are falling by eight points.
Prior to that, on Thursday in the European League, Rangers took up Vienna's Rapid.
Meanwhile, Livingston extended its series to six games without loss in division, and the chief coach Holt has still not felt the taste of defeating, since Kenny Miller changed last month.
Livingston does not use the opportunity against dull guests
Holth team with its direct game, which made it all the more difficult for "Rangers", had to be led long before they got the names.
Scott Robinson broke out, but made his attempt in front of the gate, then Alan Litgow's attempt after slipping into his legs to delay the Kreiga Halkett's blow with his head over the gate line was unsuccessful.
The owners allowed Rangers to play in front of them, knowing that they would be able to stop guests in the planned places.
And that's how the decisive gates came.
Rangers allowed a free beat, and Livingston used a corridor, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined together to provide Mengam, who hit and got the gates from the middle of the zone.
At this stage "Rangers" managed the ball, but the protection of the guests proved to be unspoilable and the gateguard Liam Kelly did not significantly disturb.
This continued during the second half of the year, although Alfredo Morelos, ordered Kelly to save the gates.
Scott Pitman's attempt was interrupted by Rangers' goalkeeper Alan McGregor's business, and Litgov's missed the gate in the Livingston's combination.
In the "Livingston" zone, central balls continued to appear, while two calls imposed punishment — after Hallett fought for the ball with substitute Glenn Middleton and for playing with his hand — was rejected.
The performance of "Livingston" - analysis
Scottish BBC Alsdair Lamont in "Tony Maði" arena
Phenomenal "Livingston" performance and result.
Each of them was great, continuing to overstate expectations, improving performance.
Their game style and personalities have practically not changed since return to the highest eselon, but a great praise is deserved by Holt for how he has united the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great, maintaining a first-class organized protection, and Menga made sure that Connor Goldson and Joe Warall always kept alert.
But Ranger lacked inspiration.
No matter how good they were at times under the rule of Gerard, they were far from the standards.
Their last ball was boring — only once they broke into the part of the host square — and this is essentially a call to Awake "Rangers who are in the middle of the table.
The Erdogan in Cologne looks forward to shared feelings
Saturday (September 29), when Turkish and German leaders met at a breakfast in Berlin, there were many smiles and blue skys.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aimed to restore relations between NATO allies.
They have a disagreement on various issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new giant mosque.
The largest Turkish community in town outside Turkey.
The police, as a safety reason, blocked a crowd of 25,000 people, preventing them from gathering in front of the mosque, but many of the supporters came near to see their President.
The hundreds of protesters against Erdogan — many of whom were deaf — also made known their attitude by condemning both Erdogan’s politics and the German Government’s decision to take him to their own side.
The protests between the two parties reflect the contradictions made by a guest, some of whom consider the German Turkish hero, while others despise the autocrats.
Road traffic accident in Deptford: a bike dies in a car collision
A bicycleman died in a car accident in London.
The crash took place at the Bestwood Street intersection with Evelyn Street, on the road with an intense traffic in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, at about 10.15 BST.
The driver stopped and helped him, but the man died at the site of the event.
The crash took place several months after another bicycleist died on Chillders Street, about a mile from the site of the Sunday crash.
The capital police service announced that police officers were involved in identifying a man and informing their loved ones.
Roads and buses are closed instead of the event, but car drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin prison: six employees injured during the disorder
According to the Pison Office, six prison workers were injured in an irregular situation in a mansil prison.
The events at the HMP Long Lartin prison in Vorčesinēr approximately on Sunday at 9.30 a.m. and are still ongoing.
In order to prevent situations in which eight prisoners are present and which are enclosed in a single wing, the employees of the special service "Tornado" were involved
Employees were treated for mild facial injuries at the site of the event.
A representative of the Prison Service said: "In order to solve an incident in the "HMP Long Lartin" prison, specially trained prison staff were involved.
Six staff were given medical treatment because of injuries.
We will not engage with violence in our prisons and clearly say that those responsible will be transferred to the police and perhaps spend more time behind bars."
"HMP Long Lartin" has more than 500 prisoners in prison, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison chief was hospitalized after the prisoner’s attack.
And last October, the employees in charge of mud control were sent to prison to solve the serious situations in which the personnel had attacked with billiard bombs.
Orccan Rose Feniks, Las Vegas and Soltleixitii are threatened by sudden flooding (a possible benefit from the situation to the areas affected by drought)
Arizona suffers rarely from tropical depression, but that is exactly what will most likely happen early in the next week, when the orcan Rose with its remaining force will advance across the deserted south-west, creating a risk of sudden floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning on sudden floods on Monday and Tuesday in the western part of Arizona, the southern and eastern parts of Nevada, the south-eastern part of California and Juta, including the Fenix, Flagsof, Las Vegas and Soltleixitii.
It is expected that on Tuesday, Rose will move directly over Fenixa on Monday.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix on Twitter pointed out that since 1950, only "ten tropical cyclones kept the status of tropical storms or depressions in a radius of 200 miles (320 km) from Phoenix!
Katrina (67) was 40 miles (65 km) from the borders of AZ."
The latest national Orccan Centre models predict 2-4 inch (~5,08 to 10,2 cm) of rain, reaching 6 inch (15,24 cm) in some places.
Other desert south-west areas, including the central part of the Klinsi Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to receive 1-2 inches (~2.54-5.08 cm) reaching 4 inches (~10.2 cm).
For those who are not at risk of sudden floods, Rose rain can be a blessing, as the region is experiencing drought.
Although the likelihood of flooding is very serious, some of the rains may be beneficial as south-west is currently suffering from drought.
A little over 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, which is the second highest category, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.
First, the Orkana Rose route leads to the coast of Lower California, Mexico, where it will reach the shore.
Rose is still with oran force on Sunday with a maximum wind speed of 85 miles (137 km) per hour, located approximately 385 miles (~620 km) south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moving north at a speed of 12 miles (19 km) per hour.
The storm is faced with cooler waters in the Pacific and is therefore getting worse.
Therefore, an orcana with tropical storm force is expected to reach the coast of Mexico Monday afternoon or morning.
Mexico may be strong in its rains, posing a significant risk of flooding.
"The rains are expected to reach 3-6 inch (7,62-15,24 cm) from Lower California in the south-west part of Sonora, precipitation probably reaching 10 inch (25,4 cm)," reported Weather.com.
Rose will move northward, across Mexico as a tropical storm, and then reach the Arizona border early in the morning as a tropical depression, which will then move across Arizona and arrive in the south of Yuta on Tuesday late evening.
"The main threat expected from Rose or its remains is a very strong rain in Lower California, north-west Sonora and south-west US desert," said the National Centre of Orcans.
This rain is expected to cause life - threatening sudden floods and mudflow in the deserts, and landslides in mountainous areas.
Attack Midsommer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested for attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found in Soomerset with wound wounds.
The injured teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday at about 4.00 BST.
He was brought to the hospital where his condition remained "stability".
The police informed that 17- and two 18-year-old teenagers, as well as a 20-year-old man, were arrested overnight in the area of Redstock, Eivonne and Soomerset.
The police have asked to refer to anyone who could have a mobile phone material about what happened.
Tramps says Kaveno has suffered from the 'malities and anger' of the Democratic Party.
"The vote on Judge Kaveno has voted to reject the brutal and violent tactics of the Democrat Party," Trump announced at a meeting in Vienna (Wheeling), West Virginia.
Trump stressed that Kaveno had suffered from the 'mality and anger' of the Democrat Party throughout his nomination process.
Kaveno was shown before Congress, where energetically and emotionally denied any accusations of sexual harassment against Christine Blasey Ford decades ago, both of them teenagers.
Ford also showed his accusations during the hearing.
On Saturday, the President announced that "The American people saw" Kaveno's "excellence, ability and courage".
"The vote on the approval of Judge Kaveno is a vote in order to confirm one of the most educated lawyers of our time in the history of ghosts in the service of the people," he announced the crowd of supporters in Western Virginia.
President Kaven's nomination was mentioned around the importance of Republican activity in interim elections.
"Fifty weeks to one of the most important elections in our time.
I didn't bite, but actually I was a candidate," he said.
"It's why I'm going everywhere to fight for great candidates."
The tramp argued that the democrats had assumed the mission of 'prospecting and resist'.
The first of the important votes in the Senate on the nomination of Kaveno is expected to take place no later than Friday, CNN informed the Senior Assistant in the Republican Party Management.
Hundreds of people have been killed in the earthquake in Indonesia, and the number of victims is growing
Officials informed that at least 384 people were killed on Saturday, many simply washed up when giant waves hit the shores after a strong earthquake and tsunami struck the island of Sulawesi.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered to the festival in Pala, when high waves of up to six feet [18 ft] hit the shores, excavating many in death and destroying everything on their way.
The tsunami occurred after an earthquake of 7.5 balls.
"When yesterday there was a tsunami threat, people were still operating on the beach and did not flee immediately, and they became victims," the representative of the Indian Disaster Reduction Agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, informed Brijfga Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it brought cars, logs and buildings, it shook everything that was on the ground," Nogoro said, adding that the tsunami, before wrestling against the shore, had crossed the sea at 800 km/h (497 mph).
"Many people hit the trees to escape, and survived," he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Pala.
The photographs taken on flight by disaster agencies reveal many destroyed houses and shops, deformed and collapsed bridges, and the water - covered mosque.
The aftergrows of the coastal city continued to sink on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Use Agency, BPPT, emphasised in its statement that the emission of energy from Friday's massive earthquakes was approximately 200 times higher than during World War 2 by the bomb of the bomb on Hirosim.
The city’s location at the end of the long, narrow bay may have strengthened the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "wide", and informed that thousands of homes, hospitals, shops and hotels have collapsed.
He said that the bodies of some victims were trapped under the ruined buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 had disappeared.
Nugroho acknowledged that the number of victims and the damage could be larger along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Pala, in an area called Donggala (Donggala), which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
"The communication "was completely destroyed, no information was received from Dongala," informed Nugroho.
There are more than 300 000 people living there," the Red Cross announced in the notification, adding that the affected regions are headed by its staff and volunteers.
"Yet it's a tragedy, but it could be even worse," the organization informed.
The Agency was widely criticised on Saturday for not informing that the tsunami had sought Pala, although officials claimed that waves arrived during the warning.
The video distributed on the social networks is heard that the man calls desperately on the upper floor of the building people to the bottom of the street that tsunamis are approaching.
In a few minutes, the water wall is trekking against the shore by washing buildings and machines.
Reuters, a news agency, was unable to confirm immediately whether the material was real.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a serious loss of power supply, which shut down the communication Palu, making it difficult for officials to coordinate rescue.
The officials announced that the army had started sending cargo planes with assistance from Jakarta and other cities.
The city airport is open for aid measures only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo plans to visit the evacuation centres in Pala on Sunday.
The number of victims of Indonesian tsunamis exceeds 800.
This is very bad.
Mr Doseba told that the employees of the "World Vision" who successfully reached the city of Pala, Doggala, and now home to the tarpaulin in the office yard passed by the way to the ruins.
"They told us that they saw a lot of buildings that had been destroyed," he explained.
This is very bad.
Even when relief teams were determined to organise disaster victims, some complained that foreign aid workers were not allowed to go to Pala.
According to Indonesian legislation, funding, resources and personnel of overseas organisations will only be allowed if the disaster area is declared as a national disaster area.
This has not happened yet.
"It is still a provincial disaster," said Aulia Arriani, representative of the Red Cross of Indonesia.
"When the government declares, "OK, it is a national disaster," we will be able to accept international aid, but such a status has not yet been established."
When Palu arrived on the second night after the Friday earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of the still unraveled people continued to hope that their loved ones would become wonders that make life brighter during natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the runoff.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who was pressed under the rubble for two days next to the body of his mother.
The coach of Gendon Succinon, an Indonesian national paragliders team, was prepared by two paragliders in Asia who were absent this month in advance of Indonesia.
Other of those trapped in the "Roa Roa" hotel, including Mr. Pedagoi, were their students.
"As an experienced paragliders," he said, "you're teaching an emotional burden."
Mr. Gendonas remembered that after the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel spread in the paragliders' team, he desperately sent the WhatsApp reports for hours to Palu's participants who participated in the beach festival.
However, the result of his reports was only one grey mark, not two blue marks.
"I did, that means that the reports did not reach the addressee," he said.
The Greeks took USD 26 750 during the ATM filling "Newport on the Levie" complex
According to a statement by the Police Department of Newport, the thieves stole USD 26 750 in the morning for Brink's employee, who filled the ATM Newport on the Levie complex.
"The motor driver emptyed the entertainment complex ATM and was prepared to fill it with more money," detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While the manager was busy, another person called "from the back" to Brink's employee and stole a bag with ATM money.
According to the press release, the Witnesses noticed a number of suspicious individuals who left the crime scene, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identities should contact the New York Police 859-292-3680.
Canje West: The rapper changes his name to Je
Repery Canje Vests changes his name to Ye (Je).
When announcing a replacement on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The being known as Canji Vesta in the past."
The 41-year-old West has been called the Je for some time, and he used the name of his eighth album, published in June (Ye).
This change takes place before he comes to the show "Saturday Night Live", in which he is expected to present his new album "Yandhi".
Showmakers say he's replacing the singer Arian Grandi, who has stopped his work as "emotional cause".
Vest has said that this is not only his current shortening of professional name, but also of religious significance.
"I believe "Ye" is the most commonly used name in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "Tu," Vest explained earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with the radio broadcast leader Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, that's us.
At first there was Kanje, which means "only one, then followed by "Ye", which is the reflection of the good and bad in us, about our confusion, about everything.
Album has more reflections about who we are."
He is one of several famous repertoires who have changed their names.
Sons Kombs, who until now was known both as Puff Dady and P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the words Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who had previously cooperated with Vesta, is also, and has not used, a sign of thought and large letters.
The elected Mexican President promises not to use the army against the civilian population
The elected Mexican President, Andrez Manuel Lopez Obrador, promised never to use military force against civilians at a time when the 50th anniversary of bloody return to students is approaching.
Lopez Obrador promised "Tlatellolco Plaza" on Saturday " never to use the army to suppress the people of Mexico."
On October 2, 1968, the peaceful demonstration of the army unit was shot, killing 300 people at a time when the left - minded student movements spread throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has sworn to support young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to students and opening up more public universities.
He said that unemployment and a lack of education attracts young people into criminal gangs.
US funding for artificial intelligence should be doubled
Since China is becoming increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount spent on research in this area, explains the investor and artificial intelligence practitioner Kai Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments were made following statements by various US government bodies on artificial intelligence, although the US as a whole lacks a strategy on artificial intelligence.
In the meantime, China launched its plan last year: it aims to become the main country in the area of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"A huge budget for research into artificial intelligence will be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind the US, and a further cardinal turn in the field of artificial intelligence is expected," said Li.
At the CNBC interview this week, Li said that doubling funding could double the chance that the next artificial intelligence achievement would take place in the US.
Lei, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by "Houghton Mifflin Harcourt", the Executive Director of the Innovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most significant artificial intelligence companies in China, "Face+".
In the 1980s, at the Carnegie Mellon University, he worked to create an artificial intelligence system that would expose the best Othello (Reversi) player in America, but later he was the leading officer of Microsoft Research and the president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lī admitted the previous technology competition organised by the U.S. government, such as the "Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge" and asked when the next one would be prepared to identify people with ideas for the future".
"Scientians in the United States often have to work very hard to get government grants", observed Li.
"Not China attracts leading scientists, but large companies," he explained.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university glossers to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lei added that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to improve its achievements in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that green cards should automatically be awarded to people with a doctoral degree in philosophy in the field of artificial intelligence," he said.
In July 2017, the Council of State of China published its plan for the development of future generation of artificial intelligence.
Lī explained that the Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences provides funding for academic institutions for people, similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations providing money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
This year, the US Ministry of Defence (U.S. Defense Department) established a joint artificial intelligence centre to bring together partners from industrial and academic circles, and the White House announced the creation of a special committee on artificial intelligence issues.
And this month DARPA (Central Organisation for Research and Development of the Ministry of Defence of the United States) announced an investment in the initiative called "AI Next".
The National Science Foundation for Artificial Intelligence research currently invests more than $100 million a year.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation aimed at setting up a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence (National Security Commission on Articial Intelligence) has not been in place for several months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on change of name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country to the 'North Macedonia Republic' by taking a step that will prevent decades of disagreement with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's requests to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a Macedonian province, underlines that its northern neighbour’s name indicates claims on its territory and has imposed vetoto Macedonia on admission to NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June, which was based on the proposed new name, but nationalists in the opposition insist that changes would undermine the ethnic identity of the famous majority in Macedonia.
President Guorge Ivanov has said that I am not voting in the referendum, and a campaign with a request for boycott has raised concerns as to whether voters' activity will reach at least 50%, which is necessary to make the referendum fit.
The rapporteur's newsletter asks: 'Are you in NATO and the EU for membership by entering into an agreement with Greece'.
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is a price worth paying on the road to Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the break-up of Yugoslavia, becoming an organisation such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the young Macedonian people, so that they can live freely, under the aegis of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all of us," said the 79-year-old Oliver Georgijevska Skopje.
Although this is not legally binding, enough Members have announced that they will take into account the outcome of the vote, which will become decisive.
To change the name, the parliament will need 2/3 of the majority.
The National Electoral Commission informed that no violations were reported by 1 p.m. in one afternoon.
However, activity was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in previous parliamentary elections, which voted in 66 percent of registered voters.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjos Tanevski, 62-year-old.
Prime Minister Zoran Zayev of Macedonia, his wife Zorika (Zorica) and their son, Dushko, gave their voices to the referendum in Macedonia on the change of name that will open the way to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of Parliament, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov, prepared a small show and arranged chairs at the tents that had been set by those who had referendums in boycotts.
"We are in NATO and the EU, but we want to join with a raised head, not through the slave door," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a small country, but we have self-esteem.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China or Russia, and become part of European-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zayev states that NATO membership will launch the necessary investments in Macedonia, where unemployment exceeds 20 percent.
"I believe that most of the votes will be cast in favour, the more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," said Zayev after voting.
He said that the result "yes" would "confirm our future".
The survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research shows that 30-43 per cent of voters will participate in the referendum – less than the required activity.
Another survey carried out by the Macedonian Telem TV showed that 57 percent of the votes are planned to take part in the vote on Sunday.
70 percent of them said they would vote in favour.
For a referendum to be successful, the turnout must be 50 percent and another vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first serious blow to the Western Government, which came to power last May.
Look at: The Manchester City Sergio Aguero is a noun for all righton protection to gain a gate
Serhio Agvero and Rahimim Sterling won the "Brighton" protection by enabling Manchester City on Saturday at "Etihad" stadium in Manchester, England to win at 2:0.
Agvero had the impression that his gate gain in 65 minutes was ridiculously easy.
The Argentinian attacker received a supplement in the middle of the square at the beginning of the combination.
He jumped between three righton guards, and jumped inside the free area.
Then Agvero had four green shirts.
He took the ball to one guard, then in the race he exceeded several more "Brighton" on the edge of the field.
Then he took the penny to the left, reaching Sterling.
The English center attacker used his first touch to play back to Agvero, who used the right football boot to beat the Brigton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan to beat the ball on the right side of the network.
"Agvero is fighting with foot problems," Peps Gardiola, a manager of City, told reporters.
"We discussed with him the play of 55, 60 minutes.
That is what happened.
We were lucky he got the gate at that time.
But it was Sterlings, which provided Sky Blues with the original advantage of a premiered pen.
Gates were held in 29 minutes.
Agvero got the ball in deep righton.
He sent a ball with a beautiful shot along the left leg of Leroy Sane.
In Sande, he performed several shots until he entrusted Sterling with bringing the ball to the next gate door.
The attacker of the Sky Blues Center easily launched the ball in the network just before crossing the border.
In "City" fights with "Hoffenheim" the Champions League group will play on Tuesday at 12.55 Tuesday at "Rhein-Neckar-Arena" stadium in Zinshama, Germany.
Shercer wants to have a problem with Rockies
Since Nationals is not taking part in the switch-off games, there was no reason to resume.
But Sherzer (Scherzer), who is always ready to compete, hopes to use the opportunity against Colorado "Rockeys", on Sunday, but only if "Rockeys" have actual exclusion games. And "Rockeys" in the Western group of the National League is led by one game against Los Angeles "Dodgers".
"Rockies" has printed at least a white card with 5:2 on Friday evening, winning the Nationals, but has still not gained its first title in the division.
"Even though we play in the same way, we will at least be able to entertain, knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver, with the crowd and with the other team, will probably be the most harmful with which I will be confronted this year.
And why would I not then like to compete?"
"Nationals" has not yet announced who will start the game on Sunday, but, as he says, is ready to let Shercer take a shot.
Shercer, to whom it will be the 34th beginning, on Thursday performed a litter session in the outside part of the "bullpen" area, and on Sunday will throw the ball during normal rest.
The Washington labroc is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 rakes 220 2/3 innings in this season.
Tramps hosts myths in Western Virginia
The President mentioned the situation in which his chosen candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kaveno has entered, while speaking about the importance of the activity of the Republican voters in interim elections.
"In November everything we have done is in danger.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections in our time.
It's really very, very serious — I didn't ask, but actually I did, and that's why I'm everywhere and fight for great candidates," he said.
The tramp continued: "You see this terrible group of disgusting democrat radicals, who is acting right now.
And they are determined to regain power by using all possible means to achieve the goal. You see evil, opposite action.
They don't care what they're hurt, who they have to cross to get power and control, that's why they want power and control, and we won't give them that."
Democrats, he said, have taken up the mission of 'prospecting and resist'.
"And you've seen it yourself in the last four days," he stressed, calling the Democrats "nice, evil, uncomfortable and false."
He named Senators Dianne Feinstein, Senators of the Democrat Party of the Senate's Committee on Justice, whom viewers responded with loud calls.

Have you published the document?
Hmm, what's this about?
No, hmm, wait -- it was really bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer ready for diversity.
It is unbearable to the public
It was not surprising that the Momentum activists in my local party wanted to subject me to censorship.
After all, I am the last of the Labour MEPs in the Labour Party to date, who have been informed that he is not desirable, all because we do not hide our point of view.
My fellow Member, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she took a decisive stand against anti-Semitism.
In my case, movement for censorship criticised me for not accepting Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of economic policy, of national security, of Europe is ironic, but it was issues where Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
In the Communication on the Nottingham meeting, in the eastern part of Nottingham, it is said that 'we want meetings to be inclusive and productive'.
The majority of the meetings that took place during the career of my eight fellow Labour MEPs were of the same nature.
Unfortunately, in many meetings today, the atmosphere is different and promises of a 'happy, more happy' policy have long been forgotten if they have ever been.
It has become increasingly clear that the Labour Party does not want to tolerate different views, and any view is assessed according to whether it is acceptable for party management.
It started shortly after Jeremy became the leader: colleagues whom I think are similar in our policies, began to expect me to turn 180 degrees and accept views that I would never agree to in other cases, whether it is about national security or a single EU market.
When I speak publicly - and it is not important, what I say - is followed by a tyranny about the use of social networks, calling for a ban on next elections, revealing the center's policy, claiming that I have no place in the Labour Party.
And that's not just my experience.
Indeed, I know that I am more successful than part of my fellow Members, because the comments against me are usually political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who are faced with the straits of sexist and racist insults every day, but never try to keep quiet.
One of the most unsatisfactory aspects of this political era is how normal use has become.
Jeremy Korbin announced last week that the Labour Party should cultivate tolerance culture.
In reality, we are no longer an organisation that is ready for diversity of views and with every distrust or changing the terms of selection, the party will narrow.
Over the last two years, I have often been advised not to jump, think what I'm talking about, and then "all will be in order" with me.
But not because of this, I decided to engage in politics.
Since I joined the Labour Lawyers for 32 years ago as a schoolteacher in response to the negligence of the Tehran Government, which has literally led my integrated school class to collapse, I set the task of fighting for better public services for those most in need, both as a member of the local council and as a minister of the government.
I have never concealed my political views, including those from the previous elections.
No one in the East of Nottingham had any reason to doubt my political position, and in areas where I did not agree with the existing government.
For those who pushed the proposal on Friday, I can only say that at a time when the country is moving decisively towards Brexit, which is harmful to households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the Leiborist party leader.
But basically, the only thing I want to announce is not the Nottingham "Momentum", but to my constituents, regardless of whether they are Labourmates: I am proud to be able to serve you, and I promise that there is no threat of denying candidates or reminders that in politics nobody is indispensable, will not stop me from doing what I think best for all of you.

"Ayr" 38 - 17 "Melrose": The uncomplicated "Ayr" reaches the highest row in the table
The last two attempts may break the final result to some extent, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves to triumph in this amazingly exciting match of the Scottish Championship today.
Now they're on the top of the table, the only team out of ten.
After all, it was both their excellent protection and the much better opportunity that led the owners, and the coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
"We've been tested in all our games and we've still not been defeated, so I have to enjoy it," he said.
"Melrose" Robin Christie: "All respect "Ayr", they used their opportunities better than we."
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, implemented by Frazier Climo, was raised by Ayr, but the yellow card Scouted to Captain Rory Hughes, where Warriors had put the figures of Melrose to the game, and Jason Baggot caught an unrealized ball.
Klimo increased the control of Ayr with a penalty, right at the end of the mid-term, he got points, then realized the solo attempt, so Ayr stopped with 17-5.
But in the middle of the "Melrose" began with a good game, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, being realized by Begots, reduced the gap to 5 points.
Then there was a lasting break, because Rūaridh Knott had a severe injury and was brought to the unrelateds from the field, but when the game resumed Ayr quickly moved forward when Stafford McDowall made a attempt to realise Klimo.
The captain of Ayr, Blair Macpherson, then received a yellow card, and again, under intense pressure, Melrose used an redundant player — a attempt by Bruce Colwine, who had not been realized.
But the hosts got ready, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for crossing Klimo without a bomb, from a garden corridor, McPherson performed the Tachdaun Ayr Mola at the back.
Klimo realized the ball, as before, almost from the resuming of the same time after Kyle Rowe took over David Armstrong's flop in the fifth attempt of the manager Gregor Henry.
Still Game star seems to plan a new career in restaurant business
The star of the series Stilli Game for Ford Kierran seems to be planning to engage in hospitality business, because it turned out that he was named as the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays at the popular BBC show Jack Jarvis, which he is making and in which he shares with his ancient partner Greg Hemphill.
The duet has announced that the next ninth season will be the last of the show, and Curenz apparently plans his life after Craiglang (Craiglang).
According to official information, he is Director of Adirftmore Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although the Scottish Sun source pointed out that Kyrnāns planned to engage in the "during restaurant business" of Glasgow.
"The Sea belongs to us!": Bolivia, trapped in such a land, hopes that the court will open its way to the Pacific Ocean.
The sailors patrol around the field of the Fleet Hall in Lapas.
Public buildings have raised blue flags in the ocean.
The Fleet-based vessel from Lake Titica, until Amazonaine is devout: "We have the right to the sea.
Its recovery is our responsibility."
In Bolivia, which was trapped in the land, Chile still remembers the bloody coastline lost in the 19th century conflict, just as it is long to sail again in the Pacific.
This hope has probably been the highest since decades, as Bolivia has been waiting for the International Court of Justice judgment on 1 October after five years of examination.
"Bolivia develops, in its spirit is united and peaceful and, of course, looks forward to the outcome," declared Roberto Calzadilla, a diplomat of Bolivia.
Many Catholics will watch the judgement of the International Court on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Tribunal in The Hague will decide in favour of Bolivia's demand that, after decades of interruptions in negotiations, Chile is obliged to discuss the granting of sovereign seatimes to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of local origin of Bolivia, awaits the controversial fight for re-election next year, is also very interested in the judgement of the Monday.
"We are close to recovering the Pacific Ocean," he was thrilled at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that a court judgment in favour of Bolivia is unlikely and, if it is accepted, no major change is expected.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands does not have the power to allocate the territory of Chile and its representatives have stated that they will not determine the possible outcome of the negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice was given no more than six months after the final review showed that the case "was not complex" was explained by international regulatory expert Paz Zárate from Chile.
And the last four years have not pushed the Bolivian case forward, but rather delayed.
"The question of access to the sea has been misappropriation by the existing Bolivian administration," Zarate announced.
Morales’s valiant rhetoric is in the Czechs abhored by the rest of the goodwill, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the negotiations once, but after this it will be very difficult to maintain the discussion.
Both countries have not exchanged envoys since 1962.
Mr Edvardo Rodríguez Veltzé, former President of Bolivia, did not agree that the court acted at an unusual speed.
Monday for Bolivia will bring "an exceptional opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile" and the opportunity to "put an end to the 139-year conflicts that both sides will benefit from," he said.
Calsadilla also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, was using sea problems as a political cop.
"Bolivia will never waive her right to access the Pacific," he added.
"This decision is an opportunity to cut down what needs to be done to overcome the past."
North Korea will refuse nuclear weapons only when it can trust in the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho, said that his people would never lose their nuclear weapons first if they could not trust Washington.
Mr Ri spoke on Saturday to the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to meet the promises made during the meetings of the leaders of both countries in Singapore.
His comments were made at a time when it seems that US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, is ready to resume diplomatic efforts to prevent nuclear war, more than three months after Singapore's meeting with North Korea's leader Kim Channon.
Ri claims that it is a " Fantasia" to hope that the US is still not reinstated by sanctions and unwillingness to declare the end of the Korean war, will ever make North Korea fall on its knees.
Washington is cautious regarding acceptance of the declaration before Phenyan takes significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
However, many are sceptical about whether Phenyan really wants to give up an armament that the country probably considers to be the only way to guarantee its own security.
Pompeo plans to visit Phenjana next month to prepare for the next Kim's meeting with Trump.
Paris Fashion Show presents the newest massive head-up line on the way to the nearest High Street
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely block the sun, then you are in the right place.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown presented the viewers with a row absurd, hugely on the head wearable object in the spring/summer 2019 collection, which sparkled on the background of the Paris Fashion Week.
Unpractical hats have been flooded by Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their stunning achievements for fashion demonstration.
The Valentine’s greatest product was a glamour - colored hat decorated with a colour - like edge that glows its heads.
There were gems of gems, magic hats, and even pineapples — but they were not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also showed a strange selection of masks — just before Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had lips, which were more likely to be used by Hanibal Lekter than by the high fashion.
One of the designs reminded me of breathing senses, with pipes and glasses, while another resembled a melted ice cream cone.
And if you want to continue with a massive fashion, then it's the right time.
Style's observers believe that a huge amount of ambush is possible on the way to the nearest High Street.
Large-scale hats became popular immediately after the "La Bomba" appeared — straw hats with two feet (~60 cm) wide edges seem to have worn all of them from Rianna to Emilia Ratajowski.
Very unpractical hats as a cult object in all social networks led to another large piece of food on the tongue — a straw beach bag, almost as large as a bathing suit model that brought it.
Redish-yellow rafia bag, decorated with rafia barbers and equipped with a white leather handle, took a special place in "Jacquemus' La Riviera" collection of spring/summer 2019 Paris Fashion Week.
The celebrities stylist Luke Armitage explained FEMAIL: "I expect large hats and beach bags to appear in central street shops next summer, because the designer has left so much impression that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for huge-sized accessories."
John Edwards: Language knowledge is vital for the people of the world
Scotland's independent schools have an excellent reputation for educational institutions, and it has been preserved in 2018, when excellent exam results were once again obtained, further reinforced by individual and collective achievements in sport, art and other societal events.
The aim of this school, which includes a total of 30 000 students in Scotland and which represents the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), is to ensure the best level for their pupils and their parents.
Independent schools have set goals for preparing their pupils for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their lives as world citizens.
As an educational sector that can develop and implement special school programmes, we see that modern languages are still a popular and desirable subject in our schools.
Nelson Mandel said: "If you speak to people in a language he understands, it remains in his consciousness.
If you speak his native language, it remains in his heart."
It is a convincing reminder that we cannot simply rely on English when we want to build relationships and gain trust from other countries.
In view of the recent results of this year’s exam, we can see that the languages are at the top of the league’s table with the largest number of exams held in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who taught foreign languages reached the highest mark.
Scottish Council of Independent Schools for 74 schools shows that 72 percent of students received the highest sign in Chinese A, and 72 percent also gained the same mark in German, 69 percent who mastered French and 63 percent who mastered Spanish.
This shows that the independent school in Scotland supports foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Now languages as an object of choice are rated as high in independent school programs as in science-technology-engineering and mathematics (science, technology,engineering and mathematics) group subjects.
The 2014 survey of the Commission for Employment and Skills revealed that 17 percent of employers were unable to fill vacancies because of lack of language skills.
As a result, language skills are becoming increasingly compulsory in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
With increased job opportunities requiring language knowledge, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of their chosen career, learning a foreign language will in future benefit from such long - term skills.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically improve the competitiveness of a multi-language expert.
According to a 2013 survey by YouGov, involving over 4,000 adults in Britain, 75 percent do not require a foreign language that is good enough to support a conversation, but French was the only one that spoke a 2-digit number of people, 15 percent.
That is why investing in language teaching is important for today's children.
Several languages, especially those of developing countries, will provide children with better opportunities for meaningful work.
Schools in Scotland differ from one language to another.
Some schools will focus more on the most common modern languages, while others will teach languages such as the Chinese and Japanese, which are considered the most important for the future of Britain by 2020, according to plans.
Whatever your child may be interested in, independent schools will always be able to choose from a number of languages, and teachers will be experts in the field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a language environment for children and provide them with the skills necessary to achieve success wherever the future is.
At the moment, in a global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still vital for the future of the country, so this fact must be reflected in education.
Indeed, today's languages would be regarded as "the skills of international communication".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scottish youths.
Il faut bien le faire (This must be done).
John Edwards is the director of the Scottish Independent School Council
Lebron in the debut "Lakers" contains Sandygo on Sunday
Fanny has finally arrived at the moment of Lebron's first game in Los Angeles, Lackers.
"Lakers" coach Luke Walton has announced that James will be playing on Sunday in the pre-season game against Denver's "Nuggets" in Sanjego.
But we still have to decide exactly how many minutes he's playing.
"It will be more than one, but less than 48," Volton informed the "Lakers" official website.
The Lakers reporter Mike Trudels recorded on Twitter that James would probably play a limited number of minutes.
He continued his practice this week, asking James about his plans for the "Lakers" series of six preseasons games.
"At this stage of my career I don't need preseason games to prepare," he said.
Trump's myth in West Virginia, YouTube
President Donald Tramps today in Vienna, West Virginia, begins a series of myths.
This is the first of the five kittens planned by Trampla next week, including stopping in friendly places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Since the vote on his choice to fill a vacancy in the Supreme Court has been suspended, Trump aims to obtain support in the forthcoming interim elections, because there is a risk that the Republicans will lose control in Congress after voting in November.
How many times will Trump's home in West Virginia be held today and how can we watch it online?
Trampa accommodation in Vienna, West Virginia is scheduled for seven nights, after ET today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trampa accommodation in West Virginia You can watch online on channel YouTube.
It is thought that Trump will speak about listening this week to the case of the candidate for the Supreme Court, Breta Kaveno, who has been accused of gender crime as tense, and the vote of the Senate is expected to take place to perform approval for a week while the FBI is conducting investigations.
However, the main purpose of this visit is to help improve the situation of the Republicans, which is expected in November.
Consequently, President Trump's campaign shows that this next week's five-day mission is to "act volunteers and supporters, while the Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority they own in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Congression control for his agenda is so important that the President will visit the state as much as possible, because we are launching a successful campaign season," Reuters told Trampa's representative, who did not want to disclose his name.
This evening's visit to Wesbanco Arena is likely to attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and this will be reflected in Pittsburgh media," says West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month when Trump will visit Western Virginia, the state where he won in 2016 with more than 40 percent.
Trump is trying to help the West Virgian senator candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind according to polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morris that the President should come to help improve his results in polls," said Simon Haeder, professor of politicalology of Western Virgian University.
Ridera Cup 2018: The U.S. has shown determination to fight to keep high expectations of Sunday singles
After three sessions "one in words" Wednesday afternoon of the game "Foursome" format was probably exactly what is necessary for this Raider cup.
Sporters love to talk about the fluctuations of success, and it really believes, especially in competitions like these.
So, what side do they think is success now?
"They were in charge of six points, but now with four, since I think that in a way this means that success has focused on us," said Jordan Spyth when he goes on his own.
Europe has, of course, a priority, because it has a 4 point lead, but another 12 will be played.
Scott explained that the Americans believe that the wind is blowing their sails and that they have cause for optimism, of course, also in the person of Scott Thomas, who played together all day, and each of them can be proud of three points of four.
The pit has been destroyed from the first blow place, until the lawn, and is an example of a winner.
These gstulusive cry of victory became more and more loud when his round continued, a decisive blow was made in a beaver to reach the same number four times when he and Thomas were relieved of two beats by two.
His blow in a beaver, which reached their victory of 15, was perceived with a similar call, of them, for his conviction that the American team has not yet been expelled.
"You really have to rock deep, and worry about your match," Scott said.
That's all that's left to these players.
18 holes to succeed.
The only players who have gained more points in the last two days than Scott and Thomas are Frankesco Molinari and Tommy Fletwood, who will undoubtedly enter the history of this Raidera cup.
Europe's strange but attractive couple are falling behind four points and will not be able to harm.
The Mollywood was the only couple who had been free of bogia on Saturday afternoon, but they avoided the bogians on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and nine on the last pits on Friday morning.
This process and the way in which their energy flows into this crazy crowd and reassuring that they are players to win on Sunday, and Flyingwood with Molinari will be the most popular players who can provide a potential European victory when the sun goes across Le Golf National.
It's desirable for both of them at the same time in different pits.
However, it was premature to talk about the European triumph.
Babba Watson and Webbb Simpson were quickly dealt with by this morning's hero Sergio Garcia (Sergio Garcia), who played with Alex Noren.
Bogius and two double fronts took them into a spade and a Swedish bunch, and they were not even near to get out of it.
On Sunday, however, there is no one to help us cope.
In "Fubball" and "Foursome" formats, the game is so exciting to watch close by the interaction of couples, to see what advice they give and what they don't, and how the strategy can change the situation in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far, and before the last day we have long led, but this competition in the "Foursome" format showed that the US team is determined to fight for which many, especially "Stateside", have doubted.
On the last day, the European selection of the Raider Cup is under the leadership of 10-6
The European selection of the Raider Cup will start the last day under the pleasant leadership after the Saturday "Fubball" and "Foursome" competition ended under the leadership of 10-6 against the United States.
The inspired couple Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari were led by two victories over the hard-working Tyger Woods, which increased the score of Le Golf National to four.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, in order to preserve the trophy lost by Hazeltine two years ago, dominated over the impeccable American teams in the morning competition in the "Forballs" format, and the result became 3-1.
In the United States, it was more vigorously opposed to the "foursome" format, winning two match-ups, but unable to eliminate the deficit.
Jim Faryk's team needs 8 points on Sunday 12 singles to save a trophy.
Flywood is the first European first year to score four points in a row with Molinar, called Molliwood (Molliwood) by the end of a sensational week is only the second couple in the history of the Raider Cup, which scored four points in the first four match.
I'll catch the Patrick Reed in a fulballs format they'd then, without difficulty, defeated the tired Woody and American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with a even more empathetic result of 5&4.
Woods, which won two matches on Saturday, showed a great game, but he has lost 19 of the 29-year-olds in "fubballs" and "foursomes" formats, and in addition seven consecutive times.
Justin Rose rested before the morning games "Fubballs", returned to the partner Henrik Stenson's "Foursomes" to say Dastin Johnson and Brook Koepka, who are taking the first and second place in the world ranking.
Europe failed completely to achieve its own, although the day in south-west Paris was a pleasant and fluent wind.
The three most prestigious golf competition winner, Jordan Scott and Justin Thomas, set a benchmark for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They pressed 2&1 against Spanish John Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fouballs format and returned later to defeat the Polter and Rory McIlroy with 4–3 "Foursomes" after losing the first two cries.
Only twice in the history of the Racedra Cup, the team has played 4 points of deficit alone, but as owners, the Faryk team only has an unsorted result to preserve the trophy.
After the second location two days, as it looks, the anti-attack Sunday will be problematic.
North Korea announced that "nothing" will not armed unilaterally, without trust
The Foreign Minister of North Korea informed the United Nations on Saturday that the continuation of the sanctions increased its distrust in the United States, and North Korea will in no case unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho informed the World Organization of the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant steps in good will" last year, such as the decommissioning of nuclear weapons and missile trials, dismantling of the nuclear testing landfill and promise never to distribute nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we don't see a proper US response," he said.
"In the absence of confidence in the United States, there will be no faith in the security of our country, and under such circumstances we will never unilaterally armed the first."
Although Ri repeated well-known North Korea's rejection of Washington's "gradual" approach to denuclearisation, according to which Korea would be rewarded for step-by-step steps, his statement left the impression that it did not automatically reject unilateral denuclearisation, as Phenyan did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Chanun and Donald Trump, the first-in-office US President and North Korea leader meeting in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work towards "denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has tried to formally end the Korean war of 1950-53, but the United States has announced that Phenjana must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also not accepted the call to alleviate serious international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US insists that "denuclearisation must be first" and increases the level of pressure created by sanctions in order to achieve the objective of power, even against the declaration of the end of the war," said R.
"The idea that sanctions could put us on our knees is empty fantasies that bear people who know nothing about us.
The problem, however, is that the continuation of sanctions only deepens our infidelity."
Ri did not mention the intentions of the other Kim meeting once with Trampa, whose U.S. leader had specifically mentioned when speaking to the United Nations this week.
In his speech, the Minister specifically highlighted three times a meeting with the South Korean leader, Mun Jae-in, over the last five months, and added: "If the other half on this denuclearisation were South Korea instead of the US, denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula would not have reached this deadlock."
However, the tone of Ri was dramatically different from what he said last year when he announced in the United Nations General Assembly that the diversion of North Korean missiles to the US continental part was inevitable after the "Very President" Trump had named Kim as a "missile" in a suicide mission.
This year, in the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to 'fully destroy' North Korea last year, commended Kim for his courage to take steps towards disarmament, but stressed that there is still much to be done and sanctions should be maintained until North Korea denuclearized.
Wednesday Trump announced that he had not planned a certain time, stressing that "it is not important whether it will take two years, three years or five months".
China and Russia stress that the UN Security Council should reward Phenjana for what has been done.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The implementation of security Council sanctions should be carried out vigorously, avoiding errors, until a definitive and convincing denuclearisation is achieved."
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions since 2006 in order to achieve the destruction of funding for Phenjana's nuclear and ballistic weapons programs.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly meetings and then informed that he would again visit Phenjana next month to prepare a second meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip was not successful.
He went away from Phenjana in July, saying that progress had been made, but in a few hours, North Korea accused him of "deserving demands".
The North Korea meeting with Munas this month undertook to dismantle the weapon landfill and also the nuclear complex if the US takes "appropriate measures".
According to him, Kim had informed him that the "appropriate measures" that North Korea would like to see are the security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and the steps to normalise his relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard University will learn the subject of enough rest
A new subject at Harvard University this year has reached that students sleep more, and it is an attempt to turn against the increasingly popular brutalist culture, which includes a caffeine-filled study through nights.
One teacher found that in the world, students at the best university often do not even have basic knowledge of how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, as well as a specialist at Briggham and Women's Hospital (Women's Hospital) developed the subject of training, which he considers to be the first subject of that type of study in the United States.
An inspiration for creating a new subject for him arose after speaking about the impact of sleep shortages on learning.
"A girl ended up coming to me and asked, "Why do I only say it now when I'm in the final course?"
She found that no one had ever explained to her the importance of sleeping — who surprised me, he told Telegraph.
This year, for the first time, the subject of teaching, provides students with basic information on how good sleep habits contribute to learning and sport, as well as to overall well-being.
Paul Barriera, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the Executive Director of the University Health Services, informed that the University decided to introduce a course after learning that students suffer from a serious lack of sleep during a school week.
The hour-long training process includes a series of interactive tasks.
One part contains an image of the offices doors, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes and books to learn about caffeine and light exposure and how performance in sport is influenced by lack of sleep and the importance of sleeping routine.
In another part, students are informed how prolonged sleeplessness may increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
Then student town map with interactive icons invites participants to reflect on their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change student behaviour at once.
But we believe that they have the right to know. Just as you have the right to know how health will be affected by cigarette smoking," said Professor Čeisler.
He said that the culture where the ability to learn all night is proud still existed and added that modern technologies and increasing pressure on students meant that sleep shortages became an increasingly serious problem.
He explained that ensuring enough quality sleep should be the student's "hidden weapon" to combat stress, excessive sleep and anxiety, and even to prevent weight gain, because the lack of sleep turns the brain into a hunger regime, making them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Kaliforneitis studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Čeisler to develop the subject of training, after he had attended one of the professor’s lectures last year in the first course of Harvard.
He said that the subject of the study had opened his eyes and inspired him to have a course available for the entire student town.
He hopes that the next step would be a request for students who get post-graduate education to learn a similar program before going to enjoy competition.
Professor Čeislers suggests that students set up a modifier not only for the time they are going to rise, but also when you go to bed, and keep in mind how people are being harmed by "blue lights" emitted by electronic devices screens and LED lamps, because they can break the rhythms of the day, making them sleepy.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga Gates Overcame Jerard's men
Rangers found another nice game in the guests when Dolly Menga hit Steven Gerrard's confused team decided to lose 1 to 0 against Livingston.
The Ibrox team hoped to win the first trip since February 4:1 in the triumph "St Johnstone", but the Gary Holt team provided Gerard with his second loss in 18 games, since he became the club manager, and his team is 8 points away from the Scottish Championship leader "Hearts".
Menga beat the ball in gates seven minutes before the end of the half-life, and the lack of the "Rangers" inspiration in no way looked after trying to smooth the result.
Rangers falls to sixth place, and Livingston moves to third, and in terms of gate differences it is only "Hibernian".
And "Rangers" can be another problem, because assistant judge Kalum Spence needed medical attention because of head injury, apparently caused by the object of the next-hand shot.
Jerard made eight changes in his team, which quickly left behind the back of Ayr, reaching the "Betfred" cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same "Livingston" 11 players who took "Hearts" one point last week, and he would be happy how his well-designed team repressed opponents in each episode.
It is possible that Rangers managed the ball more often, but Livingston used better what was their action.
They had to get the gate for two minutes after the first play of Menga sent Scott Pitman in the direction of Alan McGregor, but the player of the center missed his big chance.
Then the long free-drip of Keaghan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his partner in the protection of Alan Lithgow was able to transmit the ball only far ahead of the rear door.
Rangers took control, but there was an impression that playing in the last third was hoped, not believed to happen.
Alfredo Morelos (Alfredo Morelos) certainly believed that he had to hit a penalty in 15 minutes, after he had been hit by Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson rejected the call by the columbie.
Rangers performed only two shots at the target in the first half, but the ending of the attack by former Ibrox gatekeeper Liam Kelly did not significantly interfere with either Lassana Coulibaly or Ovie Ejaria.
Although the Livingston of 34 minutes could have changed the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for their efforts.
"Ranger" was once again unable to deal with Jacobs' planned long combination.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept balance and chose Mengu for a simple conclusion.
Jerard’s break with Kulibali changed with Raein Kent, and it almost immediately affected the game, because a half - guard sent the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly of his line immediately dropped to block.
But Livingston continued to make guests play as they like, making one long blow after another to Litgow and Halket.
The Holt team would have been able to continue leading the final stage, but McGregor played well by stopping Jacobs before Litgov made a blow with his head from the corner.
The Rangers alternate, Glenn Middleton, asked for another blow in the late game, after he was hit by Jacobs, but Tomson's demand was ignored again.
Almanah: Inventor of the Geier counterer
And now a page from our Sunday Morning almanaha: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago... one day in Germany was born Johannes Wilhelm of Hans Gaeger, who grew up as a physicist.
The Geyer developed a method of determining and measuring radioactivity, as a result of which was ultimately a device known as the Geyer meter.
In science, the Geeger counter, who took his place and preserved his place, has also taken his place in pop culture, as for example in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado (Coronado Call), in which the main roles were played by the researchers of the extraordinarily unconvincing cowboy type Rogers and Dales Evans:
A man: "Who, by the joke, is that?"
Roger: "This is the Geier counter used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put on these headsets, you will hear how the atoms that release these minerals are exposed to radioactivity."
Evans: "Really, it really turns!"
"Hans" Geyer died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention named by his name continues to live.
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to "see" the evil cells
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to "see" the evil cells and kill them
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognise the bad cells
When using this method, cells of the immune system are derived from the patient and are transformed into cells in the laboratory
Then they can "see" proteins that are characterized by many malignancies, and will be injected back into the body
The mock-up vaccine has shown promising results in patients with various types of malignancies.
A woman who was treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognise the bad cells showed that her ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method consists of obtaining cells from the patient’s immune system, converting them into a laboratory to be able to "seen" several tumours of the typical HER2, and then inject these cells back into the body.
The U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Professor Jay Berzofsky in Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promotes the growth of several types of malignancies," including breast, ovarian, lung and colon and rectum cancer, explained Professor Berzovskis.
A similar approach to the generation of immune cells from a patient whose immune system has been "acquired" as an attack on cancer cells has been shown to be effective in one type of leukaemia.
Canje Vests, after visiting SNL, dressed in MAGA hat, attacked Trump critics.
It didn't stop well
Kandje Vests was ejected at the "Saturday Night Live" studio after an incoherent performance, in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and announced that he would stand for Presidential elections in 2020.
Having finished that evening the third song, whose name was Ghost Town, during which he wore the "Make America Great" hat, he began to purify the loud phrases of the democrats and repeatedly stressed his support for Trump.
"Only many times when I speak to white people, they ask, "How can you like Trump? He's a racist!"
Well, if I were to worry about racism, then I would have left America for a long time," he said.
"Saturday Night Live" started with an exhibition with Matt Damon's main role in which Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in the Senate's Committee on Justice of the Senate on the accusation of Cristine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not transmitted, the material was loaded with Vest's graceful social networks by the komitist Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock tried to throw West like this.
And yet West was sorry to the viewers for having mistreated him in the backstage because of his head.
"They mocked me in the backstage!
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat in your head!"
They laughed at me!
And yet they said I've lost my connection with reality," said West, according to Washington Examiner.
Vest added: "Gribat see what happens when the connection with reality is lost?", and promised to put on "your Superman's settlement", because it means that you can't tell me what to do.
Try love!"
"Varity" reported that his comments caused the audience to whistles at least twice, but the team members of the show looked confused, and at least one person told the press release: "There was complete silence on the stage."
West was invited at the last minute to replace the singer Ariana Grande, who had died a few days ago by a friend rapper Max Miller.
The West confused many with the song (I Love it), which he performed in a champagne bottle costume.
The visit was supported by the Conservative TPUSA leader, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "One of the strongest people in the spirit: PATEICALS, WHY DO NOT BEAR!"
However, on Twitter, the conversation show director Karen Hunter recorded that West simply "was who he is, and it is wonderful."
"But I choose not to hire a person (by buying his music or his clothes, or by supporting his "art"), who, as I believe, supports and bars with ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And we too," she added.
Before this show, the rapper on Twitter announced that he changed his name, saying that he has now become "a matter previously known as Canji Vestu".
He is not the first artist to change his name, and acts like Diddy, which is also known as Puff Dady, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper Snoop Dogg had previously been to Snow Lion and, of course, to Prince of the Lenny Music legend, changed his name by a symbol, but then to the "screw artist who was previously known as Prince".
Imprisonment of murder in the attempt to clash in Belfast restaurant
A 45 - year - old man is accused of a murder attempt after a man was hit in the East of Belfast in Friday's restaurant.
The police informed that the incident took place in Ballihackaor.
The accused will be expected to appear on Monday in front of the Belfast Master's Court.
Complaints will be examined by the Public Prosecution Service.
The star of "Tremaid Games" Kitts Herington turns against toxic masculinity
Other Herington is known as the sword-wrecking John Snow HBO in the brutal medieval fantasy series "Tremaid Games".
But the 31 - year - old actor has turned against the brutal stereotype of a hero, saying that such characters often lead young boys to think they should be strong to be respected.
In a conversation with "The Sunday Times Culture", Kitt explained that in his opinion there was "a problem" and asked us how to deal with the toxic masculinity #MeToo era.
Another, who recently married his Three Games partner Rose Leslie, as well as 31 years of age, admitted that he cares about the problem.
"I can't tell myself at the moment what mistakes we made with masculinity," he said.
"What do we teach young men about this problem when they grow up taking into account the existing problem?"
Others believe that television with its very masculine characters may be partly responsible for the toxic increase in masculinity.
He said, "What is inherited, but what is taught?
Who are taught on TV and on the streets that make young boys feel they have to be seen as men?
In my opinion, this is one of the most important questions of our time: how can we change it?
Because there are clear problems with young men."
During the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in any of the "Fruit Games" continued or in a spade, after the series ended next summer, stressing that "the battlefields and horses have vanished".
Starting from November, Kits will play a key role in the renewed Sam Shepard "True West", which is the story of the film producer and his brother's robber.
The actor recently admitted that he considered his meeting with his wife, Rose, as the best thing that happened to him as a result of the "Tremes of Games".
"I met my wife in this show, because it provided my current family and my life from then on," he said.
The other person, John Snow, played on the solo series of the Rosa Emmy Prize.
A couple of islands were owned by Leslie family in Scotland in June 2018.
HIV/Aids: China reports an increase of 14% in new cases
China announced that the number of people living with HIV and AIDS increased by 14%.
Healthcare officials report that over 820 000 people have been affected in the country.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases were the result of sexual relations indicating changes.
Traditionally, HIV was rapidly spread through some parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected by HIV with this type of infection fell to almost zero, the Chinese health care officials informed at a conference in the province of Junnańa.
However, the number of people living in China with HIV and AIDS has increased to 100,000.
The transmission of HIV to sexual relations is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality in China was decriminalised in 1997, but it is said that discrimination against LGBT people is common.
Based on national conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have had sex with men will eventually get married in women.
Many of the cases of transmission of sexually transmitted diseases are the result of under-protected sex in this relationship.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised universal availability of HIV medicines as part of its response to the problem.
Maxina Voters denied that the employee had washed the data of Republican senators, sharply turned to "dangerous lies" and "developing theories"
On Saturday, Maxine Waters, the US Chamber of Representatives, denied the allegations that her staff had published personal information of the three U.S. Republican senators on its sites.
The Democrat of Los Angeles insisted that the claims are disseminated by the "right-wing" wings and websites.
"Mell, lie and even more despised lies," Voters spoke on his Twitter site.
The transmitted information is reported to include the address and telephone numbers of the US Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch from Yuta.
Information online appeared on Thursday, it was published by an unknown person from Congress, at a time when the Senate group held hearing about the accusations of Breta Kaven, nominated to the Supreme Court in sexually unscrupulous behaviour.
The leak occurred some time after the three senators had interviewed Kaveno.
Conservative, web sites, such as the Gateway Pundit and RedState announced that the origin of the records' IP address is related to the Waters' office, and revealed information about the staff of Waters, informed Hills.
"This unwarranted statement is absolutely false and totally false!" insisted Waters.
"My staff whose identity, personal information and security due to this fraudulent and false claim has been compromised in no way is responsible for the leaking of information.
This unwarranted statement is absolutely false and absolutely false!"
The Voters statement soon caused criticism online, including the criticism of former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This is an angry denial," wrote Fleisers.
"It makes it possible to conclude that her temperament does not correspond to a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of what he has not done, he must not be angry.
He must not be barren.
He shall not speak about the motives of the accused.
He must be calm and calm."
The task of the Fleiser was to compare the Voters' reaction with the democratic fall in the judge Kaveno, who was accused of an overly angry reaction during a Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a republican candidate for Voters to lose his chair in interim elections, also gave his opinion on Twitter.
"It's great if it's true," he wrote.
In his statement Voters informed her that her office had been warned by responsible officials and law enforcement bodies about these fraudulent allegations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators will be revealed," she continued, "and that they will be declared legally responsible for all their works, which are destructive and dangerous to any of my staff."
John English 3 – Rovan Atkinson's half-carried exhibition of spy films
It has become common to look for a association with Brexit in every new film with a British flavour, and this seems to refer to this one, which has revived, the fantasy of the future compositions of Johnny Angly English, which began in 2003 with the "Jongy English" and was reborn in 2011 with "Jonny English" (wentling).
Is the toothless prick about itself, about how apparently hopeless we are, a new export opportunity for our nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny Anglis has the right to create a yoke after the second revitalization — more than anything else signifies that he has a wide range of comical characters developed in areas where consumers do not speak English.
He is, of course, the rebellious secret agent who, despite his strange claims for adorable sophistication, is a little Kluzo, a little Mr. Bine, and the little guy who plays one of the notes "Chariots of Fire" in the 2012 Olympic opening ceremony of London.
He is also based on the traveler's and international, incomprehensible character, once represented by Atkinson in the already forgotten Barclaycard TV ads in which he left the chaos on his way.
The latest Johnny Angley adventure has at least one or two nice moments.
I liked the location where Johnny English was going to a helicopter in a medieval suit of armor, and the Ripeller's blades are about to break off his helmet.
Atkinson's ability to visually create a comical impression is visible, but humor is quite weak and strangely superficial, especially because "serious" cinema brands, like "007" and "Unable mission", use comedy as one of the ingredients with confidence.
Humor creates the impression that it is devoted to children rather than adults, and I think Johnny Angley's absurd attitude is not as creative and ambitious as Atkinson's moss tricks in the skin of binos.
As usual, everything is based on the fact that Britain has come into a serious bunch.
Cyberhaker has entered the secret Internet network of Great Britain’s spy, revealing the identity of all Britain’s agents in this field, the pity of an active agent, a pityless small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last straw for the Prime Minister, the populist and the person who has lost full political popularity: Emma Tomsone is doing his job, with Terez Mea partly like, but there is not much to work with in the scenario.
Her advisors in the field of intelligence inform that as all active spy has become public, she will have to call someone who has already retired.
And this man is the unscrupulous Johnny Anglis, who now works as a teacher at a fine educational institution, and obediently teaches how to work as a secret agent (a couple of fun jokes), because England offers to learn a spy profession from the very foundations.
The coal is being brought back to the Inteol extraordinary meeting and combined with its former many victim assistant Bo, which is also played this time by Ben Miller.
Bo is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, with a fun personality that becomes important only at the end of the film — a role that Vicki Pepperdine has not been fully used.
And so Batman with Robin to make a huge mistake in serving in His Highness Secret Service has returned and finds the beautiful fateful woman of Olga Kurylenko (Ophelea Billetova).
In the meantime, the prime ministers have been dangerously trained by the harizmatic technology billionaire, the evil Jason Wallt, who is pictured by Jack Lacy, and he says he can solve the British computer here.
Coal and Bo start their wild fun odysey: masked for the Odsians, they light up a fine French restaurant; they create confusion in secret by being part of the Volta luxury yacht; and Coal causes absolute chaos, trying to use virtual realities on the head display to get acquainted with the interior of the Volta building.
All that is possible is done for the end, but no matter how attractive and crazy the film is, there are many elements of children's television.
A lot of moderate elements.
As with other Johnny Angle films, I can't wonder if the British film industry could give Rovan Atkinson a role that would make full use of his talent?
The Labour Party denies plans that the British will work for four days a week, and the salary will be paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn is going to discuss a radical plan, according to which the British will work four days a week and get five wages.
It is reported that the party wants company leaders, through the artificial intelligence revolution, to save their employees by giving them another holiday.
In this case, the employees will be able to enjoy the three-day long weekend, at the same time receiving the same salary as before.
Sources tell us that the idea of "response" to party agendas in the economy, and plans to change the economy in favour of those working.
A transition to a four-day week week has been supported by the Trade Union Congress, which considers it to be an opportunity for workers to benefit from economic change.
One of the leading representatives of the Labour Times was informed: 'The Sunday Times': 'The policy changes are expected to be announced by the end of this year.
"It will not happen on the same day, but the four-day working week is an idea that meets the party's objective of balancing the economy for the benefit of the workers, as well as the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised to introduce the four-day week of implementation of the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party as such is not in favour at this time.
The Labour Week of the Labour Week of the Labour Party was announced by the Labour Party representative: "The two-day working week is not part of the Party's policy, and it is not weighing it."
The Chief Executive Officer, John McDonnell, used a leiborist conference last week to give shape to his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnel explained that he was determined to take away the power of 'the mass of directors' and 'the speculators' of the public service company.
The Minister also plans to hold posts in the sense that the existing average shareholders in the water companies may not be able to recover their entire package, because the Labour Government could implement the "deductibility" due to injustice.
He also approved plans to include employees in the boards of companies and set up exclusive Ownership Funds to allocate 10% of the private sector capital to employees who receive up to GBP 500 per year in dividends.
Lindsey Grem and John Kennedy answer "60 Minutes", or the FBI's investigation into Kaveno's case could change their views
The investigation by Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question whether the findings of the office could force a Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview on Sunday, Scott Pelley, correspondent of the 60 Minute program, interviewed Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham on whether the FBI could reveal something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy left a more open impression of a person than his South Carolina colleague.
"Yes, of course," Kennedy replied.
"I said, referring to the hearing procedure, I said I had spoken with Judge Kaveno.
I called him after it happened, when the accusation became known, and asked, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, direct and unambiguous."
The Grem's vote, on the other hand, seems to be stoned.
"I'm making a decision on Brett Kawen, and there's going to be a terrible accusation," he said.
"Dr. Forda, I don't know what happened, but I know, that's what Brett strongly denied it," said Grem, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of her named was able to confirm it.
The event's 36-year-old.
I don't think any changes are expected."
What is the World Citizens' Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday will host the World Citizens' Festival, an annual music event in New York, taking part in an impressive amount of stars and having the same mission: reducing poverty in the world.
This is the seventh year of the festival, tens of thousands of people will attend the World Citizens' Festival, which will gather in the Great Moore of Central Park not only to enjoy performances such as Janet Jacksones, repertoire Kardi B (Cardi B) and Shawn Mendes (Shawn Mendes), but also to raise awareness of the real goal of the event, which is to put an end to extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an event created by the International Defence Group Global Poverty Project, which hopes to put an end to poverty by attracting more and more people who actively fight poverty.
To receive a free ticket to this event (unless there was any wish to pay for VIP ticket), the concert visitors had to perform a series of tasks or activities, such as voluntary work, email an e-mail to a world leader, make a phone call or any other important activity to raise awareness of the end of poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen movement been, for which there are 12 years left?
Is the idea of awarding with a free concert a good way to convince people to act, or is it just another case of so-called "legalism" when people think they can really do anything to influence when they sign an online petition or send a Twitter message?
Global Kitizen's movement has claimed that since 2011 it has registered more than 19 million activities from its supporters in order to achieve various objectives.
It reports that these actions have helped world leaders declare commitments and policies equivalent to over USD 37 billion, which will have an impact on the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group referred to 390 commitments and notifications arising from its activities for which at least USD 10 billion had already been paid or financed.
The group estimates that up to now nearly 649 million people worldwide have been directly affected.
Some of the key commitments include "The Power of Nutrition" – a partnership of UK-based investors and performers, committed to "helping children grow to the full", promising Rwanda to provide USD 35 million to help end the country's lack of nutrition after receiving more than 4700 Twitter reports from the world's citizens.
"With the support of the United Kingdom Government, donors, governments of other countries and citizens of the world like you, we can leave a poor diet in the history of social injustices," Triacey Ullman, the representative of The Power of Nutrition, announced to the audience in London in April 2018.
The Group also mentioned that, following the launch of more than 5000 measures, calling on the UK Government to provide mothers and children with better nutrition, the government announced the allocation of funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will provide nutrition for 5 million women and children.
Answering one of the most frequently asked questions on your website – "What makes you think we can put an end to extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen commented: "It will be a long and long road, in which sometimes we will climb and fail.
But, as did the great civil rights and anti-aparteide movements before us, we will also succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Jeanelle Monáe are some of the artists who will take part in this year's event in New York, led by Deborr-Lee Furnes, Deborror-Lee Furnes, and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use the navy of war to block Russian energy exports - says Minister of the Interior
"If necessary," Washington can use its navy of war to prevent Russia's energy from entering the market, including the Middle East, as quoted by the US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s activities in Syria, especially in the places where it operates under a call from a legitimate government, are a source of research into new energy markets.
"In my opinion, the reason why it is located in the Middle East is that it wants to deliver energy in the same way as it does in Eastern Europe — in the southern part of Europe," he said.
And, in the opinion of the official, there are ways and means of dealing with it.
"The United States can, through its navy, make sure that the sea routes are open and, if necessary, block them so that Russia cannot bring its energy into the market," he said.
Zinke approached the public who had come to attend an event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organisation known as "the voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to resolving the situation of Russia and Iran, pointing out that they are actually the same.
"Iran and Russia have more or less economic opportunity to use and replace fuel," he said, at the same time referring to Russia as a country whose economy depends mainly on fossil fuels alone.
It is said that the Trampa administration promotes exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, thus replacing Russia with much cheaper options for consumers in Europe.
For this reason, the officials of Trump Administration and also the US President, Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "unsuitable" Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, after Trampa's words, would make Berlin "dependent" from Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly emphasised that the 11 billion US dollars Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which doubles the current gas pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
According to the Kremlin, Washington's dreadful resistance to the project is simply based on economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"In my opinion, we agree that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose a supplier," says Aleksandrs Novaks, Minister of Energy of Russia after a meeting in Moscow with the US Minister of Energy, Minister of Energy, Rico Perija.
The United States has expressed its negative position against Germany, which has reaffirmed its involvement in the project.
The leading organisation of industrial sectors in Germany, the German Federation of Industry (BDI), has called on the US to refrain from engaging in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I feel a big problem if a third country intervenes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, Head of the German Federation of Industry (BDI), following a recent meeting between the German Chancellor Angel Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Ms Elizabeth Vorena, Senator of Massachusetts, will give serious consideration to her nomination for the 2020 Presidential elections
Ms Elizabeth Vorena, Senator of Massachusetts, announced on Saturday that he was seriously considering standing for the post of President after the mid-term elections.
During the meeting in Holoika, Massachusetts, Vorena confirmed its consideration of standing for presidential elections.
"It is time that there are women in Washington who will "correct" the imperfect government, which also means women-presids," and that her words are reflected in The Hill newspaper.
"After 6 November, I will think carefully about my candidacy in the U.S. presidential election."
During the meeting, Vorena referred to President Trampe, claiming that he 'leader the country in the wrong direction'.
"My heart is concerned about what Donald Tramps does with our democracy," she said.
Vorena has openly criticised Trampa and his choice of candidate for the Supreme Court Bret Kaveno.
On Friday on Twitter, Vorena said: 'Of course, before the elections, the FBI needs investigations'.
However, a Thursday survey revealed that most of the supporters of Warren do not believe that she should stand as candidates for elections in 2020.
According to the results of the Political Research Centre/periodary survey "Boston Globe" of Sufolka University, fifty-eight percent of the "potential" voters of Massachusetts claimed that the senator should not stand for election.
Thirty-two per cent supported this decision.
The results of the survey showed that former Governor Devals Patrick, who received 38 percent for election membership and 48 percent against, had gained greater support.
Moreover, in the context of the possible candidates for the elections in 2020, the names of the high profile democratic party's works, such as the former Vice President Joe Baiden and the Senator of Vermont, Little Sanders, appear.
News agency "Associated Press" informed that Baiden was committed to providing a formal decision by January.
Sara Pailina quotes Treka Pailina PTSS at Donald Trampa
Treks Pailin (26) spent a year in Iraq after being called in a military service in September.
On Monday evening, he was arrested and accused of domestic violence.
"The one to whom my own son goes through, to whom he goes through after his return, can be attributed to other families facing the consequences of the PTS and certain dose vulnerability that our soldiers return to," she said to the audience in Donald Trump's town in Tulas, Oklahoma.
Peline referred to his arrest as "an obvious problem that everyone pretends not to see" and said of his son and other war veterans that "they return a little different, they come back to their fortifications, they come back to think about the respect of what their fellow soldiers and pilots have given to the country, as well as all the other members of the military field."
He was arrested Monday in Vasil, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against women and of keeping the gun in a state of danger, according to a statement from the Commissioner for Police at Vasil, Den Beneta.
18 States, Colombia Region sets challenges for a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the Colombian district are supporting a legal challenge for a new US policy that prevents victims of refuge who are fleeing a gang or domestic violence.
The 18 states and the Colombian district representatives submitted a brief presentation to the court counsellor on Friday in Washington to support the asylum seeker faced with the policy obstacles, reports "NBC News".
The applicant's full name in the Grace v. Session case, which was initiated by the American Union of Civil Liberties in August against federal policy, has not been revealed.
She claimed that her partner "and the sons of his violent gang member" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her request for asylum on 20 July.
She was detained in Texas.
The Stat lawyers who supported Grace described Salvado, Honduras, and Guatemala, from which a large number of U.S. asylum seekers come, as countries where the problem is gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy changed the 2014 decision of the Immigrant Appeal Council, which allowed documentless immigrants fleeing from domestic violence to seek asylum.
Prosecutor General of the region of Colombia Karl Racin announced on Friday that the new policy 'has ignored the state, federal and international laws introduced to deceds'.
"The Federal Law provides that all requests for asylum are examined in accordance with the facts and circumstances of the claim in question and that such an obstacle infringes this principle," stated the brief presentation of the court counsel.
In addition, the lawyer stated in his statement that a policy that prevents immigrants from entering the country is damaging the US economy, as these immigrants are likely to become entrepreneurs and " secure the necessary workforce".
In June, the Prosecutor General Jeff Sessons addressed immigration cases to judges requesting that no more asylum be granted to victims of domestic and gang violence.
"The observation is available to persons who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion," he said in his statement on 11 June on politics.
The asylum has never been intended to solve all the problems, even all the serious problems, which people face every day throughout the world.
Disgusting rescue efforts in Pala by doubling the number of victims in the search process
The situation has become more and more difficult for the survivors.
"Situation is very tense," said the 35-year-old Rieza Kusuma, comforting his feverish baby in the centre of the evacuation of the town of Pala.
"Each minute, medical emergency services bring new victims.
Clean water is a deficit."
The people were visible when they returned to their destroyed homes and overwintered their water, trying to save everything that was found.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals that were affected by the earthquakes of 7.5 Magnitudes were overflowed.
Some of those injured, including Dwi Harris, who had a broken spine and shoulder, lay outside of the Pale Army hospital, where patients were looked out because of the persistent strong aftershocks.
He had tears in his eyes, remembering how the powerful earthquake began to shake the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save.
I think I was trapped in ruins," said Harry, to news agency "Associated Press," saying that his family had arrived in the city for wedding purposes.
"I called my wife for help, but there was silence.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they are safe."
U.S. ambassador accused China of intimidation through propaganda ads
A week after the official Chinese newspaper launched a four - page ad every day highlighting the mutual benefits of U.S. and Chinese trade, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump referred to the supplement "China Daily" in the latest Delines Register, which was sold by Iowa State, indicting China's attempt to intervene in the U.S. Congress elections on 6 November, but China denies it.
Trampa's accusation that Beijing was trying to intervene in the US elections marked what U.S. officials said to the news agency Reuters, namely that it was a new step in the increasing Washington campaign to put pressure on China.
While there is a completely normal situation that foreign governments place advertising in order to facilitate trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a growing trade war, resulting in a series of tariffs on each other's imports.
At the beginning of the trade war, Chinese repressive tariffs were directed against exporters in States such as Aiova, which supported the Republic of the Republic of Trampa, said Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador to China and former long-term governor of Aiova, who is a large exporter of agricultural goods to China, said that Beijing has pained American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote his opinion to the Sunday publication "Des Moines Register", claiming that China "now doubles this intimidation by placing propaganda ads in our own free press."
"By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese Government uses for its benefit the tradition of freedom of speech and free press of such importance to America, placing paid-for ad "Des Moines Register," wrote Branstad.
"In contrast to Beijing's usual news guide here, you will find a limited number of different views and you will not see the true reflection of such different views that the Chinese people may have in connection with the Chinese worrying economic trajectories, given that the media are here under the strict supervision of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He said, "One of the most influential Chinese newspapers was to avoid publishing," he wrote, but he did not mention which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn about Republicans who alienate women from the mid-term elections involving the Kaveno scandal
Since many leading Republicans support and defend the candidate of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh against whom several allegations of sexual violence have been made, analysts have warned that they will experience a negative reaction, in particular from women, in the forthcoming mid-term elections.
The emotions associated with this have been extremely high, and most Republicans have already been prepared to give their voice.
Such things cannot be withdrawn, 'the Saturday article in The Hill was told by Grant Reeher, a professor of politics at the University of Syracuse, Maxwell's University.
Rüher doubted that the recent exhortation by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) of the FBI investigation would be enough to calm down the angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday. They will not forget it tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, Senior Adviser and State Representative of MoveOn of the progressive movement, "Washington, D.C." on Friday.
On Friday morning protesters in the courthouse of the Senate sang "November coming!" when the Republicans under the authority of the Committee of Justice chose to continue with the nomination of Kaven, despite the testimony by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported "Mic".
"Democrat enthusiasm and motivation will be at a very high level," the independent political analyst Stu Rotenberg told the news portal.
"People say that it is already at a high level, it is true.
However, it could be even higher, especially among those living in the suburbs who are fluctuating and younger voters (aged 18 to 29 years), who often fail to go to elections even if the President does not like it."
Even before the public testimony to Ford, in which she presented allegations of sexual violence from a candidate for the position of the Supreme Court, analysts mention a possible failure if the Republicans continued to nominate this candidacy.
"The Republican Party has become a judicious chaos," said Michael Steele, former Chairman of the Republican National Committee, "NBC News" at the beginning of last week.
"This is not just about the committee's vote or final vote, or whether Kaveno will be sentenced, but also about how the Republicans have dealt with this situation and how they have treated it," Guy Cecil pointed out to the news channel, the "Priorities USA" director who is leading this group that helps to elect democrats.
However, it seems that the Americans are somewhat divided in relation to who to believe in the Ford and Kaveno evidence, a little more inclined to believe in the latter.
The new "YouGov" survey shows that 41 percent of respondents are definitely or mostly inclined to believe in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent claim that definitely or mostly they are inclined to believe in Kaven's evidence.
In addition, 38 percent said that Kaveno might have lied to his testimony, as long as only 30 percent of them say the same about Ford.
The Guardian reported that the FBI is currently investigating for Forda's allegations and for at least another defendant, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week Forda showed the Senate in the Committee on Justice that when Kaveno was 17 years old he had been drinking against their sexual assault.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the position of a judge of the Supreme Court during studies in Yasla in the 1980s has demonstrated her genetics in a party.
The global web inventor plans to start a new Internet to take over Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, a global web inventor, is launching a project that could compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest Inrupt project of technology legend is a company based on the "Solid" source platform opened by Berners-Li.
"Solid" allows users to choose where to store their data and which people have access to some information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Burners-Le joking, the hidden intention of Inrupt was to "domin over the world".
"We must do this now," he said about the start-up company.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology to enable people to build their own "personal online storage" or PTD.
It may include contact lists, work lists, calendar, music library, as well as other personal and professional tools.
This is like if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all simultaneously available in one browser.
The personal online storage is unique in that only the user determines who and what information can be accessed.
The company calls it 'personal powers through data'.
According to the company's CEO John Bruce, the idea of "Inrupt" is to provide company with resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
Bērners-Le, Bruce, the security platform acquired by IBM, some external developers contracted to work on the project, and a voluntary coding community.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world could develop their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Burners-Lie said that he and his team do not talk to Facebook and Google about whether to implement a complete change by fully covering all their business models within one night.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a Saturday article published by the Medium Platform, Bērners-Le said that "Inrupt is a mission to secure commercial energy and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web based on "Solid".
In 1994, Burners-Li transformed the Internet by creating a Global Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Burner-Le has had an influential opinion in discussions on net neutrality.
Even after Inrupt was launched, Bērners-Li will remain the founder and director of the Global Web Consortium, Global Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I'm really optimistic about this new web era," said Burners-Le.
Bernard Vann: Marking Victorian cross assigned to the clergy during World War I
For 100 years now, the only clergyman of the Church of England received the Victorian Cross as a fighter during World War I.
Lt-Col Bernard Venz received this award on 29 September 1918 in connection with the attack on Bellenglisei and Lehaukorta.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later, so he did not know about the highest British military award he received.
His two grandsons appeared on Saturday’s exhibition in Meadden, Northamptonshire, to reveal a memorial to him.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was "excellently symbolic", that such a stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather had received an important award.
According to the newspaper "London Gazette" on 29 September 1918, Lt Col Venz led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through very thick mist and cannons and machine guns."
Later, he rushed to the shooting line and, with the greatest courage, led it forward before the gun zone was taken, where the three groups were won.
Lt Col Venus was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 — just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Ven (72) said that his grandfather's actions were "something I could never do, and that at the same time is a very humble act".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also put the crown orchestra on the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Venz claimed that he felt "proved by participating in this debt", and claimed that "the value of a true hero is reflected in the support provided by many".
MMA fans waited all night at Bellator 206, but instead of that, they were welcomed at the Cūķi Pepus
Imagine being put up all night to see "Bellator 206", but in the end you are prevented from seeing this major event.
In San José, the Aphisha included 13 battles, including six primary maps that were broadcast live all night long on the UK’s 5th channel.
In the morning of 6 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were about to join each other, viewers in the United Kingdom were unpleasantly surprised by the change of transmission to the Pig of the fighting.
Some were in a real misunderstanding when they remained awake all night until the early morning while waiting for the fight.
A fan on Twitter described the transfer to children's cartoon as a "false joke".
"The government has determined that this content is unacceptable after 6.00, so the switchover to the children's programme has taken place," explained Dave Schwartz, the senior vice-president of Bellator on marketing and communication.
"Peppo pig," "yes."
Scott Coker, President of Bellator, said that he would work on schedule planning so that future viewers in the United Kingdom could see these broadcasts.
"In my opinion, when I make a comment on the repetition of the transmission, let us resolve it in some way," said Cocker.
"But the clock there is six in the morning on Sunday, and we will not be able to solve this problem by Sunday after our time and Monday after their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, after switching a lot of text appeared, and they were not positive.
We tried to prevent it because we thought it was a technical failure.
But that was not the case, and it was controlled by the government.
I can promise you that there will be no such problems next time.
We will stick to five battles instead of six, as has been the case up to now.
This is a failure."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley didn't feel good enough because of his sexuality
Tom Daley, an Olympic divisor, claims that he grew up less valuable than others because of his sexuality, but that motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old man didn't realize that "not everyone is like me" until he started attending high school.
When visiting the first Radio 4 "Desert Island Discs" led by Lauren Laverne, he said that he started talking about homosexual rights to give others "hopes".
He also said that becoming a parent caused him less to worry about winning in the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the permanent director of the long-term program, has taken several months to rest for illness.
As it turned out from the Laverne community in the first programme, Daley said that as she grew up, she felt 'lesser' than others, because 'the society is not assumed to like girls and boys'.
He said, "Until today, feeling that I'm not as good as others, or that I'm different, has been the main driving force that gave me the strength and strength to succeed."
He said he wanted to prove that there was "something" so that people would not be disappointed when they finally learned about his sexuality.
The double winner of the Olympics bronze medal has become the high-level leader of the LGBT campaign and has used its presence in this year's Friendship Games in Australia, calling for even more countries to decriminate homosexuality.
He said he decided to speak to the public because he felt happy to be able to live openly and without difficulty, and wanted to give "hopeness" to others.
The three-time world champion said that in love with a man, the U.S. filmmaker, Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, was "unprepared".
Daley married the 20 - year - old Oscar Prize laureate last year, claiming that the age difference had never been an obstacle.
"When you've gone through so much for so low age" (the first Olympics were at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later), it's difficult to find someone at your age who would have experienced similar peaks and falls.
The couple became an older son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Dale said that his "all prospects" had changed.
"In the first year, everything that was important to me was getting a gold medal," he said.
"Do you know what? In life, more important things about the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son Robert has the same name as his father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40, from brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not want to accept the death, and one of the last things he asked him about was whether they had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him that she won't be anymore to be in the first line," he said.
"I held his hand until he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing and had died, I finally confessed that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
"I just knew that it was what I had dreamed of all my life — to dive the housekeepers in the Olympics.
It also inspired his first song selection — Heather Small executed “Proud”, who resonated with him on his way to the achievements of the Olympic Games and increasingly casts off the goose tissue.
The Desert Island Discs program can be heard at BBC Radio 4 Sundays at 11.15 p.m. after British summer time.
The Mikelsons Reserver from the shape of a bench bench playout of the Raidera Cup
The American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday playing his 47th Raider Cup play match, but he will need to change his strategy to avoid a failed turn of events.
The captain Jim Furyk was sitting on a reserve bench for Saturday four balls and two pairs of games every two years.
Instead of being in the centre of action, as has often been the case with US teams, the fifth winner divided his day, acting both as a supporter and participating in his game with the hope to correct what suppresses him.
Since the 48-year-old golfer has never been the most accurate player even at the top of his career, he is not the most suitable candidate for the tense struggle in the rough square of Le Golf National, where inaccurate beats are regularly punished.
And if the game itself is not scary enough, Mikelson will fight with the exact British Open Championship winner Franzco Molinari, who has joined with young Tommy Fleetwood in order to win all four match this week.
If Americans who lag behind four points, starting up 12 monks, successfully take the lead, Mikelson's macho could prove crucial.
Furic expressed his confidence in his teammate without any false words.
"He was fully aware of his role today, tipped me through my back, covered me with his hand, and told me that tomorrow he would be ready," said Furick.
"He is very sure about himself.
He is an outstanding sportsman who has given so much to these teams earlier this week and this week as well.
I guess I didn't imagine playing him in two machos.
I imagined more, but everything moved in the way, and we'll count on that.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
Mikelsons will give Nick Faldo a record of the most played machi Raidera Cup on Sunday.
It could mark the end of the Raider Cup career, which has never really coincided with his individual record heights.
Mikelson has gained 18 victories, experienced 20 losses and seven unsorted games, even though Furick claimed that his presence gave the team some intangible benefits.
"He is fun, sarcastic and clever, he likes to inquire about people, and he is a great teammate," he explained.
"In my opinion, the newest players liked to surgeon him too this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than just a game."
Thomas Bjorn, master of the European selection, knows that a significant rise in leadership can quickly be thawed
The master of the European selection Thomas Bjorn knows from his experience that leading the battle for the last day of the Raider Cup can easily turn into an unpleasant situation.
The Danes debuted in 1997 in Valderra, where the team of opponents, whose captain was Steve Ballesteros, won a five-point victory over the Americans, but only now reached the finish line with a very small score, namely by winning with 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we were significantly advanced under the leadership of Valderra; we were raised under the leadership of Brooklyn, where we lost, and Valderra, where we won, but only with a small victory," said Bjorrs (in the picture), looking at the victory of the 2018 release group with 5-3 both Friday and yesterday under the leadership of the 10-6 golf course "Le Golf National.
Thus, history will show me, as well as every member of its team, that nothing is over.
Tomorrow you give yourself everything.
Go to the field and show your best performance!
This will not end until the resulting points are visible on the screen.
Our aim is to get this trophy and to concentrate on it too.
I have always said that I concentrate on the 12 players who are on our side, but we are very well aware of what will come on the other side of us — the world's greatest players."
Relaxed by the performance of his players on golf course, Bjorn said: "I never enjoyed it too early.
New challenges await tomorrow.
Tomorrow individual games, and this is quite another thing.
It's great if you have a partner next to you when everything goes well, but your golfer's skills are fully tested in individual games.
This message you have to pass on to your players, that is, that they give themselves everything in the next day's game.
Now you leave your partner, and he must also show his best performance."
Unlike Bjorn's opponent team, Captain Jim Furick will see his players show their best performance in individual games rather than partners. The exception is the only Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who got three points out of four.
Furick himself has been on both sides of this important last day tournament, both as part of a winning team in Brooklyn and as a result of the defeat of European teams having a sensational success, which later in the golf world is also known as "Miracle at Medinah".
"I remember every damned word," he said in response to the fact that Ben Crenshaw, the captain of the 1999 team, brought his players together to fight the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you'd like to get to the quick spot you've been through in Brooklyn as you've been through in Medin.
When such impulses are broadcast in the same direction, it exerts great pressure on mid-term games.
We made our composition accordingly and cut the guys in the way that we thought was right, and let's try to do some kind of magic tomorrow."
Thomas had the task of trying to drive the counter-attack, and he placed Rory McIlroy on the main game and Europeans Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter in the first part of the list.
"I rank the guys in this order, because I think it fits best during the tournament," said Bjorn in relation to the chosen single players.
Re-entry into service of the new German navy
The latest German carflot had to be chartered in 2014, replacing the outdated Cold War navy, but it would not happen at least by the next year due to the erroneous system and increasing costs, it was reported by local media.
The entry into service of the main ship "Rheinland-Pfalz" class charter class in Baden-Wirttemberg was now postponed until the first half of 2019, it reported in the Die Zeit newspaper, citing a military representative.
The ship needed to join the warflot in 2014, but the unpleasant after-supply problems were influenced by the fate of the large project.
Four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class ordered by the Karflot in 2007 will replace the old Bremen class fregates.
They are expected to be equipped with a powerful gun, a range of air and anti-ship missiles, as well as some secret technologies such as reducing radar, infrared and acoustic reception.
Other essential features include longer maintenance periods – it must be possible to deploy new frigates for up to two years away from the ports in which they are registered.
However, the continued delay means that the latest technology warships, which would allow Germany to demonstrate its power in the overseas countries, will have become obsolete by the time they enter into force, note "Die Zeit".
Last year F125 was regarded as a failure in all the headings, when the German warflot formally refused to place the ship into service and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss yard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the warflot returned it to the yard after the ship’s delivery.
It was little known of the reasons for this step, but the German media mentioned a number of "software and equipment faults" that would render warships invalid if used in the battle mission.
Software deficiencies were particularly important since ships of the Baden-Württemberg class are operated by approximately 120 sailors, which is only half of the older crew of Bremen.
It also proved that the ship has too much weight, which reduces its performance and limits the military fleet’s ability to make improvements to it in the future.
It is believed that the 7,000 tonnes of heavy-duty vessel Rheinland-Pfalz is twice as heavy as the ships of similar class used by Germany during the Second World War.
In addition to the erroneous hardware, the costs of the entire project (including crew training) also became a major problem.
It is said that it has cost EUR 3.1 billion instead of EUR 2.2 billion initially foreseen.
The problems associated with the new fonts are becoming particularly important in the light of the recent warnings that the German Navy is decreasing.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the chairman of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament acknowledged that the warflot was indeed 'starting in a ship'.
The official claimed that this problem had stagnated over time, as old ships are taken out of service but are not delivered in a new place.
He regretted that none of the gonads of the Baden-Württemberg class had joined the carflot.
The National Trust will hear the life of the secret bats
A new study carried out in a Scottish highland is aimed at detecting the use of bats in the food search process.
The findings are expected to provide new clarity about the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help to protect them in the future.
The Scottish National Trust scientists will study pundurks, pigmejs, as well as brown longs and water nightsharks in the gardens of Invereves.
Special recorders will be deployed in the main places, tracking bat activities throughout the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand detectors.
Sound experts will analyse all records in order to determine the frequency of bat calls and the types of activities undertaken.
A habitat map and a report will then be developed to provide a detailed view of the landscape that reflects the behaviour of bats.
NTS Nature Conservation Adviser Rob Dewar hopes that in the results you will discover which habitat areas are the most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help to identify the benefits of habitat management activities such as the creation of meadows and how to best preserve the forests for bats and other related species.
The cod population in Scotland and the United Kingdom has fallen considerably over the last century.
These land are at risk of building and development works involving the loss of bat skis and residence.
Wind generators and lighting can also pose a risk, like pulp and some chemical treatments for building materials, as well as attacks by cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, because of their nightly hunting habits, their ears during hunting are more useful than their eyes.
They use a complex method of echo-location detection to find insects and obstructions on their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land maintenance throughout the country, takes the problem of bats very seriously.
The organisation has ten trained experts who regularly carry out surveys, checks on bat masks and sometimes even rescue work.
The organization has even created in Scotland the first and only dedicated "Threave" reserve for bats, which is owned by Dampris and Galove, where eight of the ten species of bats are found in Scotland.
The property manager David Thompson states that this area is ideal for bats.
"There's a great place for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and generally suitable habitat.
But there are still enough things we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us to understand better what they need for survival."
He stressed that it was important to check that the bats were not allowed to occur in the area concerned before the property maintenance work was carried out, as one female hiding place might result in the killing of up to 400 females and their babies, thus potentially destroying the entire local population.
The bats are protected animals and must not be killed, tortured, disrupted or destroyed by their skis.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a member of the Scottish Defence Fund, has called for help to be made available to the public.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about bats, and for a number of their species we simply do not know how they are going."
Ronaldo rejects accusations against extraditing lawyers to court against the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has condemned his accusation of rape as "false news", claiming that people "desired to pay attention to themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are assigned to court against the German news magazine "Der Spiegel", which published these claims.
The football star of Portuguese origin and the "Juventus" Turin is accused of American girls raped by Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is claimed that he paid a woman $37,000 to keep quiet about this incident, so he said "Deer Spiegel" on Friday.
A few hours after making this statement, Ronald 33, through Instagram's online video, asked its 142 million followers to call this information "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," said the fifth award winner of Billon d'Or in the cell.
"They want to become famous through my name.
It's normal.
They want to become famous at the expense of my name, it is part of my work.
I'm a happy person, and everything's okay," a smile added to the player.
According to Reuters, the attorneys of Ronald is going to appeal the magazine Deer Spiegel to court against the statements they have made about "inadmissible disclosures on suspicion of fundamental privacy".
Cristian Schertz said that the player would claim compensation for "moral damages in the amount corresponding to the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of the rights of the person in recent years".
This incident occurred in June 2009 in the "Palm Hotel and Casino" class room in Las Vegas.
According to documents submitted by Nevada State Court of Clark district, it is reported that after getting to know the nightclub Ronald and Majorga went back to the player’s hotel room, where he had an analized woman.
Majorika claims that after that incident, Ronaldo has fallen in his knees and said that it was 'to 99 percent 'very boy', but to the temptation of this one percent'.
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but this was done by mutual agreement.
Majorg also claims that she went to the police and had pictures of the injuries she had taken in hospital, but later she agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "fear of remorse" and worried about "public humiliation".
A 34-year-old woman claims that she does not want to accept the terms of this settlement anymore, because the incident has left a permanent injury.
At the same time, when the above statements were made, Ronaldo was about to move from Manchester United to Real Madrid, but this summer EUR 100 million went to the Italian Grandpa Juventus.
Breksit: UK losing 'for ever' car manufacturers
"The United Kingdom will "will regret it forever" if after Breksita it loses its position as world leader in car production," said the Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He is "disturbed" by the fact that Toyota UK has announced "BBC" that if Britain were to leave the EU without agreement, it will temporarily stop production at the Burnaston plant near Dērbia.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese author said that the delay at the borders in the case of Breksita would, without agreement, put on the game jobs.
The Burnaston factory, which produces Toyota models Auris and Avensis, produced almost 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"In my opinion, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production in our factory will be stopped," said the Managing Director of Toyota Marvin Cooke.
Other UK authors, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, are worried about leaving the EU without any contract and about how cross-border trade will operate.
For example, BMW claims that after Brexita will close its mini-plant in Oxford for a month.
According to the authors, the main concerns are the supply chain at stake if no agreement is reached after Breksita.
The Toyota production line operates according to the principle of "perceived time", where cars made on order have a share of both UK and EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom withdraws from the EU on 29 March without agreement, the border could be disturbed, which could lead to some delays and shortages.
According to the company, it would not be possible to detain more than one-day valuable inventory at its Dubishshire plant, so it would be necessary to stop production.
Mr Clark said that the withdrawal plan (Chequers) for the future relationship with the EU was 'estimated to avoid such border checks'.
"We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that would allow, as I would say, not only to benefit at the present moment, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he said in "Today" Radio 4 program.
"Confirmation to this not only from Toyota, but also from other producers is that we must be able to continue fully the very successful strategy of the supply chain."
"Toyota" was unable to tell how long production could be stopped, but warned that increasing costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory in the long term and ultimately endanger jobs.
Peter Tsuvalaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and works in the factory as the coordinator of union integration, said that his friends felt more and more alarm: "I can say from experience that as soon as someone's position disappears, it doesn't return."
The representative of the Government said: 'We have presented an accurate and credible plan for our future relations with the EU'.
Trumpa's meeting with Rosenstein can be held again, reports White House
The important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein can be "been postponed for another week", because the fight against the position of candidate for the position of judge of the Supreme Court Breta Kaveno continues and it reported the White House on Sunday.
Rozenstein oversees Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates interference in Russian elections, the link between the funds used by Trump and Russia, as well as the possible violation of the rule of law by the President.
For months now, Trump has been content in Washington with regard to whether he will dismiss Deputy Prosecutor General and, as such, threaten Miller's independence.
At the beginning of this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed entering the negotiations with Trump and the possibility of leaving the president with Amendment 25.
Rosenstein denied this information.
But on the last Monday, he went to the White House, where he talked about his resignation.
Instead, a Thursday meeting was announced with Trump at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Tramp said that the "popier" wouldn't let Rosenstein go, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid coming into conflict with the Senate's Judicial Committee, where both Kaveno and one of the women accused of committing sexual abuse — Dr. Kristīne Bleizija Forda.
On Friday, Tramps ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into Kaveno's accusations, continuing to delay the vote of the Senate.
The tramp press secretary, Sarah Sanders, visited Fox News Sunday.
A people about Rosenstein's meeting she said: "The date of faith is not yet fixed, it could be this week or delayed for a week, taking into account all the things that are happening around the Supreme Court.
But we will see this, and I always want to inform the press about the news."
Some reporters contest this claim: Sanders has not done a press break since 10 September.
The leader, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of barfinders is not related to the dislike of the TV reporter "a famous man," although she added, "I did not deny the fact that they are the haunts of fame."
She then proposed a direct contact between Trampa, which would increase the interest of the press.
"The President is involved in more question and answer sessions than any President before him," she said and, without giving more information, said: "I have been interested in the number of questions."
Sanders said that the brifing would continue to take place, but 'if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States direct questions, it is certainly better than to talk to me.
We are trying to do so much, and you see that we have done it in the last weeks, and it will take place instead of the press briss when you can talk to the President of the United States."
The trams regularly answer questions from the White House or participate in open sessions or press conferences attended by important individuals.
Individual press conferences are rare.
Perhaps the President demonstrated its reason this week in New York, making a reporter's crowd an uncontrollable and sometimes strange expression.
Minister of Health writes to EU staff in Scotland NHS on the fear of Brexit
The Minister of Health has written off EU staff working at the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland to express their gratitude and desire for endurance after Breksita.
The MSP sent a letter to Jean Freeman for less than six months until the United Kingdom left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the costs of applications for permanent status for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In his letter, Frymen wrote: 'The negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU continued during the summer on the withdrawal that led to the decisions to take place this autumn.
However, the UK Government is also preparing for a possible scenario without agreement.
I know this is a very troubled time for you.
That is why I would like to emphasise, once again, how much I appreciate the involvement of every worker, irrespective of their nationality.
Colleagues, both within and outside the EU, provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and benefit patients and communities we are caring for.
Scotland is certainly your home, and we very much want you to stay here."
After a head injury, Christian Abercrombie is undergoing an emergency operation
The "Tigers" guard Christian Abercrombie (Christion Abercrombie) in Tenes conducted an emergency after a head injury operation, which he won on Saturday, where with a result of 31-27, Vanderbilt Commodores, reported "Tennessean" sport reporter Mike Organ.
The chief coach of the state team in Tennessee, Rod Reed, told reporters that trauma occurred shortly before the middle of the day.
"He came to the side line and so say fell," said Rid.
While Abercrombius was on the side line, the trainer and medical staff gave him oxygen, they put him on the nebula and brought him back for further investigation.
An official of the state of Tennessee told Nashville, the reporter of WSMV in Tennessee Chris Harris, that Abercrombie had been operated at the medical center of the University of Vanderbilta.
Harry added that for the time being "there is no information about the type/severe of injury", and the state team in Tennessee is trying to understand at what moment this injury was gained.
Abercrombie, a representative of the red shirt, is in his first season after the change of Ilion to the command of the state of Tennessee.
Before leaving the Saturday game, he had generally carried out five blocks, which made up 18th in total this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher state fees when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher state fees when buying property in the UK, and the additional funds obtained will be used to help homeless people in accordance with the new Tory plan.
This step will neutralize the efforts of Corbin to attract new voters.
The increased State duty will apply to non-taxable persons in the United Kingdom.
The Treasury provides that up to GBP 120 million may be collected per year for the provision of assistance to homeless persons.
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher public fees when buying property in the United Kingdom and redirecting the acquired additional funds to provide assistance to homeless people, it will today announce Tereza Meja.
This step is considered to be an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract new voters with promises to secure housing at better prices and to address the wealthiest part of society.
The increased state levy will be applied to non-taxed persons and companies in the United Kingdom, adding the money gained to the government's efforts to combat the homelessness problem.
The premium included in the current national tax, including the application two years ago of the higher level of charges introduced for the purchase and hire of the second home, could amount to up to three per cent.
The Treasury envisages that such a step may add up to GBP 120 million per year to its budget.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of newly built London’s assets are purchased by non-residents, thus striking prices and making it difficult for first-time buyers to get to their own home.
Many wealthy national territories, especially in the capital, have become "spock cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy introduced just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the state fee so that more young people can afford their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high prices of real estate by tearing down land, but not using it, and urged her to renounce quotas for affordable housing in order to solve the problem of British housing.
Mr Korbin has proposed a series of attractive housing reforms, including a reform of rental control and removal from the house without reason.
He also wants to give boards greater powers to build new housing.
Mrs Maya said: 'I mentioned last year that I would use my prime minister's position to restore the dream of Britain; that is, every new generation should have a better quality of life.
And that means bringing the poor housing market together.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and arrange their lives here.
However, it is not right that housing can be purchased as easily as foreign companies and people who do not live in the UK and who work hard in the UK.
For many, the dream of their dwelling has become too long, and the harsh homeless problem is still a reality."
Jack Ross: "My biggest goal is to drive the Scottland"
"Sunderland" manager, Jack Ross, says that his biggest goal is to become a Scottish leader at some point.
Scott, 42, has accepted the challenge of restoring the North East Club, which is now occupying the third place in the first league with three points from above.
This summer he went to "Stadium of Light" after "St Mirren" aiming back in Scottish premiere last season.
"As a player I wanted to play in my country.
I got B cup, and that was all," Ross said for the Scottish BBC Sportsfound.
"But I grew up, along with my father, watching Scottland games in the Hampden Park, and it has always called me back.
However, this option would only appear if I were successful in running the club."
Its predecessors are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former president of Allosa Athletic states that he did not have to worry about following in the footsteps of such a large club's recognised managers, previously rejecting the offers made by Barnsley and Ipsvica.
"My success will now be measured by whether I can return to the premiere of this club.
Because of the structure and the possibilities of this club, it undoubtedly fits into the premiere," he said.
"Back to the club's premiere will not be an easy task, but I'll probably think I've only succeeded here when this task has been accomplished."
Ross is only the third year in the career of his manager, who has previously been a Deputy Director in Dumbarton for some time and spends a 15-month period in the composition of Hearts trainers.
He then helped the club "Alloa" recover from falling to the third level and helped "St Mirren" to win the title of the champion in the same season.
Ross claims that it is much more comfortable than that of his player during his career in clubs "Clyde", "Hartlepool", "Falkirk", "St Mirren" and "Hamilton Academy".
"They were probably true crucifixes," he remembers, taking responsibility for Allloa.
"I really believed that management was my real call – more suitable than playing.
Sounds strange because I was successful, I could live and enjoy certain heights.
However, playing may be difficult.
We have to go through a lot of things every week.
I still feel it because of work-related stress and pressure, but management is my lion.
I've always wanted to drive and I'm doing it now, so I don't think I'm in the right place, all of my life I'm not feeling so good."

The wave of summer heat has made the British less popular kangaroos sit down, but it has increased pressure on restaurant chains.
The data collected showed that, in July, sales of pubs and bars increased by 2.7 percent, but in restaurants they decreased by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, who represents the business consulting agency CGA, which collected the data, said: 'The continuous sunny weather and the extended participation of England in the World Cup have meant that in July there was a similar trend as in June, with an increase of 2.8 per cent in the margin of the gangs, while the restaurants experienced a fall.
Restaurants, whose sales in June decreased by 1.8 percent, experienced an even worse situation in July.
The situation in the coffee folds and bars was the most beneficial because they had a much larger upturn than restaurants had experienced a downfall.
Food - based pubs also suffered from the sun, but not as dramatically as restaurants’ employees did.
It seemed that people simply wanted to go out for a drink.
A month-on-month sales of beverages increased by 6.6 per cent, while food sales dropped by 3 per cent."
RSM leisure and hospitality analyst Paul Newman said: "These results are continuing the trend observed at the end of April.
The weather and the wide social or sporting impact are the biggest factors determining turnover outside the home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to fight, although the drop in sales by 4.8 percent compared to the period in question for the previous year will be particularly painful for additional constant cost pressures.
As for food providers, long and hot summer could not arrive at an even more appropriate moment, and time will show if the warmer temperature that we normally experience in August will provide the much-needed breathing."
The total increase in sales, including in the new companies, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a decrease in brand sales.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, a UK sales supervisor for the Krags, Bars and Restaurant sector, collects and analyses data from 47 operating groups with a total turnover of more than GBP 9 billion and has incorporated the sector criterion.
Every fifth child has a secret social media account that it hides from his parents
The survey reveals that every fifth child, some of whom are only 11 years old, has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed an increase in false Instagram pages.
This information has raised concerns about the publication of content of a sexual nature.
Twenty percent of students said they have a "main" account to show to their parents.
Every fifth child, some of whom are only 11 years old, makes up social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed that the number of false profiles on the Instagram photo sharing site is increasing rapidly.
This information has raised concerns about the publication of content of a sexual nature.
Twenty percent of students said they have a "clear main" account that should be shown to parents, and also private accounts.
A mother, who was at the back of her 13 - year - old daughter’s secret site, found a teenager who encouraged others to rape him.
A study conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent School Managers (HMC) revealed that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, and only half of them admitted that they maintain private accounts.
The HMC leader Mike Buchanan said: "It is frightening that so many teenagers are making online profiles where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Elilad Doila will be a "lighted voice" in the Scottish Rule of Freedom
Eilidh Doyle was elected Director without the right of executive power at the Annual Meeting of the Board of the Board of Ileid Doyle in Scotland.
Doila is the most prized room and outer space for Scotland, and President Ian Beatti described this step as an excellent opportunity for those who are driven by sport to benefit from her extensive experience at international level over the last ten years.
"Eilida is given great respect throughout the entire Scottish, UK and world-wide illiteracy community, and we are convinced that Scottish lighthouses will gain enormous amounts with their presence on their board," said Bety.
Doila said: "I would like to act as an "light voice" and I hope that I can really engage and help drive this type of sport in Scotland."
The American won a 200 m and 400 m race at the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games, thus obtaining four Olympic gold medals in general, and now has a regular BBC pandemic, was unable to go through a transient ischaemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "This day, a month ago, I experienced a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors claimed that only time would show whether and to what extent I would recover.
It was a terrible piece of work, but I fully recovered, repeatedly learned to walk, and today I can do the exercise!
Thank you for the inspiring words."
Opinions share an advertisement of breast milk pump compared to cows
The breast milk pumping company has taken care of shared views on-line with regard to the advertising of nursing mothers compared with the milking of cattle.
To mark the release of the so-called "first silent breast pump" in the world, the consumer technology company "Elvie" released the advertising of a sticky black to show the freedom that the new pump offers to nursing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a wall-filled cattle bag with a song that says about this: "Yes, I'm going to knock myself out, but you don't see any tail" and "if you haven't noticed, they're not the udders, they're my breasts."
He continues: "Fly, pump, I feed the little ones, snuck, sniff, I knock my ladies."
However, advertising published on the company's Facebook page has called a wide range of online resonances.
77,000 times the videos viewed and hundreds commentated have received shared reviews from the viewers, and many say that it highlights the 'fear' of the dairy industry.
"Evenly wrong decision to use cows for the promotion of the product.
Just as we, too, have to make milk for them to be hard and to give birth, but their babies are taken away from them a few days after their birth," someone wrote.
Elvie breast milk pump in non-contingently part of the chest for breast-feeding women (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment states: "I understand that it is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
Why, though, do not use them to promote breast milk pumps for mothers who can keep their babies?"
He also said: "Advertising makers did not know what they were doing."
Others defended the ad, and a woman admitted that she felt that the song was "sensitive".
"I think this is an excellent idea.
I would buy it if I was still breast-feeding.
It made me feel like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I understood the idea.
This is a genius product," he wrote.
Another comment states: 'It is fun advertising, for mothers who wash milk (drained in workplaces or toilets) and feel like 'grows'.
It is not an advertising that praises or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the advertising, a group of women found that they all danced with non-contrast pumps placed in their chests.
The concept of the campaign is based on the observation that many women who wash their milk claim to feel like cows.
But the Elvie Pump pump is completely quiet, it has no wires and tubes, and it is inconceivably part of the chest for breast-feeding women, allowing them to move freely, keep the baby and even participate in events outside the house.
Anna Balarin partner and creative director, commented: "Elvie Pump" pump is so revolutionary product that it deserves bold and provocative placing on the market.
In parallel with the women who wash milk and the dairy cows, we wanted to pay attention to milking, while demonstrating in an entertaining and understandable manner the shocking feeling of freedom that the new pump will bring."
It's not the first time that "Elvie pump" pump has come to the heart of attention.
At London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the tongue of Marta Jakubowski, viewing using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children are quietly moved to the tent town on the Texas border
The number of children of migrants who have been detained has increased sharply, although the border is passing on a relatively large number of people each month, as before, and this has partly been achieved by the harsh rhetoric and policies implemented by the Trampa administration, which have made it difficult to house children with sponsors.
Usually, the majority of sponsors themselves were immigrants without documents, fearing that if they openly applied for a child, this would threaten their ability to remain in the country.
The risk increased in June, when federal officials announced that potential sponsors and other members of their household will have to be allowed to remove fingerprints, and this data will also be passed on to other immigration-related institutions.
Last week, Matthew Albence, an senior official in the field of immigration and customs law, showed that the agency has arrested dozens of people who have applied to act as sponsors for unaccompanied minors.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not been penalised in advance.
"Almost 80 per cent of persons who are either sponsors or members of the sponsor's household, staying here illegally, and a large part of these persons are criminal aliens.
That is why we are continuing to persecute such people," Mr Albens announced.
According to the asylum staff, in their efforts to speed up children’s cases, officials have introduced new rules providing that some of them will have to appear before the court within a month of detention rather than 60 days after the previous standard.
Many will take advantage of the video conference call rather than come personally to defend their legal status before the judge of an immigration case.
Persons who will be considered unfit for obtaining a release will be promptly expelled.
The longer children are being held in custody, the greater the likelihood that they will become restless or depressed, which may lead to violent attacks or attempted escape, is reported according to information and evidence from asylum workers acquired from the system in recent months.
The lawyers claimed that these concerns would increase in larger objects, such as Tornillo, where the signs of child suffering are more frequent due to their widespread nature.
They added that moving children to the tent city, not taking enough time for their emotional training or allowing them to give up from friends, could create injuries that many have already struggled with.
Syria is forcing the U.S., French and Turkish "Occupant Army" to immediately export its troops
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country is going on for the eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, claimed that the foreign forces are illegal in Syria, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that 'it will be dealt with accordingly'.
"They have to depart immediately and without any conditions," he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011, and millions have been forced to leave their homes, 'the war against terrorism has almost ended'.
He announced that Damascus would continue "to fight in the holy war until all Syrian territories will be cleaned" from both terrorist groups and "any foreign military presence".
The United States has deployed some 2,000 soldiers in Syria who are mainly trained and advising both the Kurd forces and the Syrian Arabs, who are opponents of President Bashar Al Asad.
France has sent over 1,000 men to this war - torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Mualem stated that the circumstances were great for them to return, and blamed 'the Western countries', 'the spread of original fear', which is why refugees do not want to return.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to make this return easier," he said.
"These people are politicising what should only be a humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not receive assistance for the reconstruction of the country before the conclusion of an agreement on the end of the war between the Arabs and the opposition.
UN diplomats explain that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone under the last rebel base in Idlib has given an opportunity to speed up political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkey agreement prevented the Russian-supported Syrian forces from attacking a large-scale province of three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement 'has been set by deadlines' and expressed the hope that the military action would be directed against Jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Qaeda affiliated group 'Jabhat al Nusrah', which 'will be destroyed'.
The UN Envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to convene shortly the first meetings of the new committees, which will include government and opposition representatives, to draw up the post-war constitution of Syria and to pave the way for the elections.
Moualem set out the conditions for the participation of the Syrian State in the Committee, stressing that the work of the Group should be limited to a 'revised article of the existing Constitution', and alerted for intervention.
Why Trump will be elected for a second term
From this point of view, Mr Trump will be re-elected in the 2020 elections, unless, and perhaps hopefully, many liberal observers, the empire and the scandal do not put an end to his Presidency.
And then "it will be the most dramatic Presidency final all the time!"
There is no evidence at present of the relaxing attitude of the observers.
Since 2014, ratings have more than doubled during the most favourable CNN transmission time to reach 1,05 million viewers, while MSNBC has almost tripled them to 1,6 million viewers.
Fox News presents 2.4 million viewers, compared to 1.7 million years ago, informs Nielsen, and the MSNBC "The Rachel Maddow Show" (Reichela Medov's show) is at the top of the cable television rating with 3.5 million leading news viewers in the evening.
"It is a fire that attracts many people, because it is an incomprehensible thing for us," explained Neal Baer, the pillar of ABC Drama "Designated Survivor". This drama tells of the secretary of the Cabinet who becomes president after the attack is destroyed by the Capitol.
Nellai Skowella (Nell Scovell), a comedy writer-veteran and "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club" has his theory.
She remembers a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The leader told her that she would vote in favour of Mr Trump.
She wanted to know why.
"He said, "That's why he strays me," said Ms. Skowell.
Haos is somewhat entertaining.
Of course, unlike the rest of the TV shows, news from Washington could determine what will happen with the Rou v Wade judgment, whether immigrant families can be merged, and the state of the global economy.
Ignorance is a luxury that can only be tolerated by the most privileged observers.
And yet it is more than being informed when, at six o'clock, we look at the group of experts to discuss how Bob Woodward used unnamed sources of information for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort, 15 thousand dollars worth of bomber-type jackets from a stream of feathers and leather ("the garment from which the arrogance of it" announced "Washington Post") and the role that Stormy Daniels would play in the passionate description of the anatomical details of Trampa.
I, for example, will never again take Super Mario as before.
"Part of what he does, which creates the impression of a reality show, is that he spent every day on you with information," Brent Montgomery, CEO of the Weelhouse Entertainment and Pawn Stars creator explained the changing team and everyday turnarounds of Trump show (the Chinese with N.F.L., Kim Chenun).
You cannot afford to miss any one episode, as otherwise you will leave.
When I went to Mr Fleis for the week, it was a sunny 80-degree (~27 by Celcia) time for Kaiai on the north coast, but he sat in the premises where, without licking the eye, MSNBC was watching the show, simultaneously recording the CNN.
He was unable to rest, not when Brett Kavanaugh was to stand before the Senate's Committee on Justice, and his future in the Supreme Court is threatened to turn around.
"I remember the times when we made all those crazy shows and when people said that "this is the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleis told me.
"I think it's such a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Money from outside flows through the most in-depth parliamentary interim election campaigns
It is not surprising that the 17th Congress electoral district is seeking money thanks to the transformation of the Congress areas, which will lead two existing Members to fight for one place.
This recently changed Pittsburgh outskirts area is linked to a democrat representative, Conor Lamb, who got his place in the special election last spring in another area.
Lemb will fight with another existing Member, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former Pennsylvania area 12, which largely overlaps with the new area 17.
After the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January decided that the old areas were unconstitutionally divided for the benefit of Republicans, the maps were revised.
Competition in the new area 17 has led to a fight between the main financial groups of parties: the Democrat Campaigns Congress Committee (Democrat Campaign Congressal Committee) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lemb became known in Pennsylvania when he won with little victory in the widely observed elections of March in the 18th Congress district.
The Republicans had held this place for more than 10 years, and President Donald Trump won 20 points in the area.
The political experts foresee a small majority for democrats.
The United States considered the punishment of El Salvador for supporting China, but then considered
Diplomats acknowledged that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing without much pressure from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr Trump had a friendly meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, and he stayed at the hotel in Panama until the partners put out the door to the Trampa's management team.
The officials of the Department of State decided to withdraw heads of diplomatic missions of the United States from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, on the basis of a 'no decision to refuse recognition of Taiwan', Heather Nauert, a representative of the department of the United States, pointed out in a notice earlier this month.
However, the fines were limited to El Salvador, which received about 140 million sums from America in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which would include a reduction in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for a Central American country in which unemployment and the number of murders have reached the highest level.
In the course of the internal meetings, officials from North and Central America held a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity, which would have followed a similar meeting last year, which was recognised as a stepping stone to the efforts to prevent the migration of migrants to the US.
In mid-September, national senior officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, bringing their observations to an end in principle.
The diplomats informed that Vice President Mike Pence has now decided to participate in the conference planned in mid-October to show how serious the administration emphasises the meeting.
And three American ambassadors returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without new and serious statements or punishments from Washington.
The representative of the White House, who spoke on behalf of Mr Bolton, did not want to provide more information on the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to negotiate in the internal talks if their anonymity was to be preserved.
His story was confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on condition that his anonymity was preserved.
History Study
The second stone in the garden could be a report by the special prosecutor Robert Mueller on the fact that Mr Trump has probably been hindered by justice, which has a great deal of public evidence.
It is claimed that Mr Miller will also investigate whether the Trampa campaign has co-operated secretly with Russia in the attack on our elections.
If at the Congress there will be a second party, Trump will have to answer the structure, and perhaps also his fellow jury right when he is going to meet voters again.
There are many "but", and I do not say that the fall of Trump is inevitable or that it will happen to his fellow Europeans.
There are choices that we will have to make on both sides of the Atlantic, and these choices will show the duration of the fight.
In 1938 German officers were ready to coup against Hitler if the West had opposed him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the long - term bloody.
History is about such turning points, and the constant route of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans now have to face several such turning points.
What will we do if Mr Trampa forgives General Rod Rosenstein, a man who controls the fate of Mr Miller's investigations?
Rosenstein has been facing a difficult situation since it was reported that last year he had proposed to keep a secret record of his conversation with the President and thought of his inappropriate position.
Mr. Rosenstein says that the story of The Times is not accurate.
"How can we respond if the requested FBI investigation of Breth Kaveno is not complete or fair, or if it is confirmed to the position of a judge of the Supreme Court despite his unfair testimony and credible accusations of sexual assault?
And, what is the most important thing, will we vote in the interim elections of Congress, which will call Trampa accountable?
If we do not endure all these challenges, democracy will enter a spirit winter.
But I believe that we will succeed by referring to what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish Czech woman who was sent to Auschwitz the same Nazi regime once found in my home.
She survived, emigrated America, and 60 years later sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the table with a svastic.

Rangers Star Graham Dorrans feels optimistic about fighting with Vienna's Rapid
Rangers will take Rapid to themselves on Thursday, knowing that victory over the Austrians after the impressive unsorted game in Spain with Willarreal will allow them to take on a stable position this month to qualify from the European League G Group.
On the way the trauma did not allow the center attacker Grem Dorans to resume taking part in season games until the undivided result of 2:2 with "Villarreal", but he believes that "Rangers" can use this result as a trample to achieve even more.
"We can be happy about this, because Willarreal is a good team," said 31-year-old football player.
"We went in the game, believing that we were able to make good progress, and we got this point.
Perhaps we could have finally defeated them, but in general, unsorted results are a fair result.
They might have been better in the first half, but we were in the second half and we were in a better team.
And on Thursday there will be another important night for Europe.
Hopefully, we will get three points, but it will not be a nice game, because they have achieved a good result in the previous game, but I am sure that with the help of our supporters we will be able to continue to fight and achieve good results.
The last year with all my injuries and changes in the club itself was clearly heavy, but now there are new storms that I feel good.
The team is great, and the guys enjoy it; the exercise is good.
I hope we will be able to continue the fight, leave the last season behind and succeed."
Women cannot sleep because they worry about their pension savings
Although the respondents clearly knew what care they wanted to receive, there were few who had discussed the matter with their family.
About half of the individuals in a national study indicated that they were not talking to a spouse’s friend about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
"People want them to be looked after by family members, but they don't do anything to talk about it," opens Holly Snyder, Vice President of the State Life Insurance Agency.
This is where to start.
Talk to your mate and your children. You can’t prepare your family for taking care if you don’t do your desires well in advance.
Work with your counsellor and family to talk to where and how to get care, as these choices can be an important factor in determining costs.
Join your financial consultant. Your consultant can also help you figure out how to cover these costs.
Your ability to provide long-term care funding can include traditional long-term care insurance policies, hybrid insurance policies with a monetary amount to cover these costs, or ensuring that you use your property – most importantly, that you have money.
Make your legal documents. Prevent legal struggles before they begin.
Conversate the authorised person on health issues so that you can have a trusted person who will supervise your healthcare and provide specialist action in accordance with your wishes if you are not able to express it to yourself.
Consider also the possibility of granting financial powers.
Choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf that will ensure payment of your bills if you fail to do so.
And don't forget the seemingly small details! Imagine that one of your elderly parents is going to the hospital to get emergency help.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Specify these facts in a written plan, so that this situation does not surprise you.
"And it's not just about finances, but also about who the doctor is," said Martin.
"What are the medicines used?
Who will take care of the dog?
Make sure there is such a plan."
A man shot several times with an air gun in Ilfracombe
A man received several shots with an air gun while travelling at night at home.
The 40 - year - old victim was in Ilfracombe, Oxford Grove, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen, and palm.
The police described the shooting that took place around 2.30 BST as "immediate".
The Victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are calling for witnesses.
earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to government information, a strong earthquake and tsunami that visited the Indonesian city of Pala on Friday killed at least 384 people. It is expected that the number of victims will increase.
The rescuers have not been able to obtain any information from Dongala, Donggala, north of Pala, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-mile earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Pala after the devastating natural disaster.
Here's the basic information about Pala and Dongal, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi and is located on the west bank of the narrow bay on the island of Sulawesi. It is estimated that 379 800 people lived on it in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when an earthquake and tsunami broke out.
Dongala is an area lasting about 300 km (180 miles) along the northwest coast of the Sulawesi island.
It is estimated that there were 299 200 people in 2017 in the province-based administrative region.
Fishing and farming are the pillars of the economy of the province of Central Sulawesi, especially in the coastal area of Dongala.
The production of nickel also plays an important role in the province, but it is mainly concentrated on the shores of Morovali, Sulawesi opposite.
In the last 100 years, Palu and Dongala have been repeatedly affected by tsunamis, reports the Indonesian Catatrophy Prevention Agency.
In 1938 the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings in Dongal.
The tsunami also sank over the western part of Dongal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in a seismicly active Pacific fire ring in which earthquakes occur regularly.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of Aceh, located in the north of Sumatra, caused the tsunami on 26 December, affecting 14 countries, killing 226 000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, of which more than half were in Aceh.
2005: The series of strong earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nia, near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: 6.8 Magnitude Earthquake hit Java, Indonesia's most populated islands, south, leading to the tsunami, which hit the southern shore, killing almost 700 people.
2009: 7.6 mathematical earthquake occurred near the city of heaven, the capital of the province of Western Sumatras.
More than 1,100 people went to Bojana.
2010: The 7.5-magnanimous earthquake struck one of the Mentavai islands along the Sumatra coast, causing tsunami waves up to 10 metres high, destroying tens of villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: The earthquake close to the surface of the earth was found in Pidie Jaya in Aceh, creating destruction and panic, since it reminded us of the destruction caused by the devastating earthquakes and tsunamis of 2004.
This time, however, more than 100 people were killed by bumbling buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes struck the Indonesian tourist island of Lombardok, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and it temporarily prevented hundreds of tourists from returning home.
Sarah Peylin's oldest son arrested following an accusation of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of Sarah Peylin, former Governor of Alaska and Vice President, has been arrested because of a charge against him.
According to a report issued on Saturday by the State Police of Alaska (Alaska State Tropers), 29-year-old Pailin, who lives in Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested for domestic violence and opposition to the arrest.
According to a police report, when a acquaintance-women tried to call the police to report the crimes that she claimed he had committed, he took the phone away from her.
Pailin has been detained at the Mat- Su pre-trial detention facility, and he has a $500-dollar security, reports KTUU.
He entered the court on Saturday, where, asked whether he found himself guilty, announced that "by certain means not to blame".
Peylin has been accused of three A - class offences, for which he may be sentenced to years in prison and USD 250 000 in fines.
He has also been accused of a class B offence, for which he can receive a day sentence and a $2000 fine.
This is not the first time Peylin is being accused of criminal offences.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Thomas Peylin.
His mother, Sarah Pailina, called the police and reported an attack.
This case is currently pending at the Alaskan Court of Veterans.
He was accused of domestic violence in 2016, of delaying the report on domestic violence, and of wearing the gun in the grip of this incident.
His girlfriend says he hit it with his face.
In 2016, the Veterans groups criticised Sarah Peylin for linking her son’s violent behaviour with post-traumatic stress syndrome when returning from service in Iraq.

At least 384 people died after the earthquakes that occurred in the Indonesian islands of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7,5 - year - old earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks have been destroyed and the number of victims is expected to increase in the coming days.

Federal prosecutors want to demand that the rarely used death penalty be imposed on a person suspected of a terrorist act in New York City
The federal prosecutors want to demand the execution of Sayfulo Saipov, who has been suspected of a terrorist act in New York City when eight people were killed. It is a rare form of punishment that has not been committed in the state on federal crimes since 1953.
As stated, 30-year-old Saipov used a home Depot rental car to attack in October on a bicycle near West Side Highway, where he crashed pedestrians and biker on his way.
In order to justify the execution of the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov 'by intent' killed eight victims and 'by intent' caused a serious injury, as stated in the statement of intention to claim the death penalty in the New York South District Court.
According to the judicial document, both of these accusations may be sentenced to death.
Within weeks of the attack, the federal big jury held an accusation on the prosecution of Saipova in 22 accusations, which included eight accusations of murders for extortion, which are commonly used by federal prosecutors in organised crime, as well as charges of cruelty and the death of motor vehicles.
The attack needed "considerable planning and pre-conception", explained the prosecutors, saying that the attack by Saipova was "scrupulous, cruel and inhuman".
"Sayfullo Habibulajevich Saipov wounded, harmed and harmed the families and friends of these people: Djego Enrique Angelini, Nikolas Cleves, Anna-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Ernāns Djego Mendoza and Allehandro Damnocco," says a statement of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years later, the prosecutors of the New York South District Court have been charged with a case of execution.
Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug providers, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in 2009.
The death sentence was last executed in New York City in 1953 in the federal case of Julius and Etele Rozenberg, a couple sentenced to death after being accused of being spyed for the benefit of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
Rosenberg’s victory in the electric chair was executed on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, in the course of days and months, Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, did not express regret.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the article, Saipov told the officials that he was inspired to attack after watching the ISIS video on his phone.
The police informed that he also requested permission to place the ISIS flag in his Chamber.
He has rejected 22 accusations.
David Patton, one of the federal social defenders representing Saipov, said that he was "littlely naturally dissatisfied" for the accusation decision.
"We believe that the intention to demand the death penalty instead of accepting the guilt in exchange for life imprisonment without the right of release will only prolong the ongoing injury to all the parties involved," Patons explained.
A team of saipova defenders has previously called on prosecutors not to demand the granting of the death penalty.
The Conservative declares that the conduct of the negotiations at Breksita should be entrusted to NAIDZEN-FARZAM
Najiel Farajs promised to "mobilize the people's army" at today's conservative conference during the protest.
At the same time, the British Independent Party leader announced that politicians should feel the anger of Eurosceptics when one of the members of the Teresian House suggested that negotiations with the EU should be trusted by him.
Peter Bone, a member of the conservative line, announced to the March in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would have long had Mr Faraža been Minister of Brexita.
However, the challenge that Mrs Meijas will have to face when trying to reconcile her opposition to the party, was demonstrated by conservatives who supported the continuation of the EU and joined a separate city protest against Brexit.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his compromise plan on the future relationship between Britain and the European Union (Chérs compromise) and is experiencing attacks from those who want to leave the EU, from those who want to remain in the EU, and also from the EU itself.
The brothers insisted that she would make a determined effort to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite a negative reaction, and would make the Eurosceptics and leiborists choose between her offer and the "hoos".
Mr Bouna, "Leave Means Leave" (The withdrawal is a withdrawal) announced at the Solihul that he wants to throw out the Maya plan at the fertiliser.
He suggested making Mr Farage an ally and entrusting him with negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been to say, we would have already left," Bones announced.
A Member of Parliament from Wellingborough added: 'I will support Brexit, but we must throw the Messle Plan'.
In support of his opposition to the EU, he said: 'We did not fight to have a package!
We want to make our own laws in our country!"
Mr Bouna ignored the assumption that public opinion could have changed since the vote in 2016, 'Ideas that the British have changed their minds and wish to remain in the EU is absolutely false'.
Andrea Jenkins, a supporter of Brexita, also took part in the March, and the reporters said, "I just say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan is not popular, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular with our party and our supporters, who actually do all the work and want us.
Please give up Chequers and start listening."
In a message directed towards the Maya, she added: "The Prime Minister remains in place when they fulfill their promises."
Mr Farage said that politicians at home should feel pressure if they are to ignore the decision made in the referendum in 2016.
"Now it is a matter of trust between us — people — and our politicians," he said.
"They're trying to hand over Brexita and we're here today to tell them we won't let them do it."
In his message to an inquisitive crowd, he fills: 'I want you to let our politicians who are going to transfer Brexit feel under pressure.
"We will call on the people of this country who have allowed us to win the battle for Brexit, and we will never stop until we get ourselves independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the rest of the people marched through Birmingham before the city center held two hours long.
Ignoringly, activists welcomed conservatives with Breksita banners after the group meeting this weekend.
Lord Adonis, a representative of the Workers' Party, mocked Conservatives about the security issues they had experienced at the beginning of the party application conference.
"These are the people who claim to us that they are able to maintain the IT system order and all their technology for Canada and yet, yet, for an undivided border, for free trade with Ireland," he added.
"It's an absolute farce.
There's no such thing as a successful Brexit," he added.
Vorena plans to carefully think about candidates for US President
Senator Elizabeth Vorena says that she will "consider carefully" the accession of the US presidential election after the November elections.

Russian Grand Prix: Louis Hamilton comes to the world championship after the team allows him to beat Sebastian Fetel
From the moment Walter Botas qualified on Saturday before Louis Hamilton it became clear that Mercedes's team's work would play an important role in the competition.
From the beginning, Botas began well and almost left Hamilton dry, defending his place in the first two trips and inviting Fetel to attack his teammate.
Fetel was the first to go into the garage and left Hamilton’s movers to deal with others, which was probably crucial.
The Mercedes pilot filled the circle later and set aside from Fetel, but Hamilton continued to take the lead in post-warrantism, which saw the Ferrari driver persistently leaving the inside free, at the risk of being left behind by a doublemaneuver in order to defend himself in the third corner.
Max Verstapen began from the rear row and at the end of the first circle was the seventh of his 21st birthday.
Then he was in charge of a large part of the race, because he focused the tires to quickly reach the finish and envelop Kim Raikonen in the fourth.
After all, he arrived in a garage in circle 44, but he could not increase the speed of the remaining eight circles because Raikonen remained the fourth.
This is a difficult day, because Walter did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman.
The team did an extremely important job to get one and two," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad language of the body
President Donald Tramp at Saturday morning, senators Diane Feinstein did not persevere in her letter from Christine Bleisian Ford, in which she accused Brest Kaveno of sexual harassment of the Supreme Court candidate.
When speaking in Lithuania, the President did not speak directly about Ford's testimony to the Senate's legal commission, but made a comment that what happened in the Senate shows that people there are "unfair, unmistakable and unreliable."
"One thing that can happen and something beautiful, which is already happening in the last days in the Senate, when there is anger, when you see angry, evil, insurgent and untrusted people," he said.
"When you read the press releases and wasted information and then they say, "Oh, no, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you miss information?
Remember her answer to the question... have you broken the document?
Oh, no.
I didn't do it."
Okay, wait a minute.
Did we do this...No, we didn't do it," he added, in the intonation of the senator.
In July, Feinstein sent a letter explaining in detail what Forda accused Kaveno of, and in early September the content of the letter was disclosed, but Feinstein denied that it would have happened in her office.
"I didn't hide the charges of Dr. Ford, I didn't break up her story," Feinstein said to the commission, "The Hill."
"She asked me to keep it confidential and I did it."
But her denial did not like the President, who said this at Saturday night: "I'll tell you that it was a very bad language of the body.
Maybe she didn't do it, but it's the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
While continuing to defend the candidate of the Supreme Court, who is accused of sexual harassment by three women, the President suggested that democrats use accusations for their own benefit.
"They are purposefully disposed to regain power by any means."
Or you see evil, trouble, they don't care what they hurt, what they're having to destroy in order to gain power and control," says the President, "Mediaite".

The air traffic controller dies, allowing hundreds of people on board to escape during an earthquake
A air traffic controller in Indonesia is praised for the hero after he sacrificed himself for the safe takeoff of an aircraft with hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people have died and many have disappeared after a strong earthquake in Friday shaken Sulawesi island, causing tsunamis.
In the territory, strong post - grains continue, and many are trapped in mud in the city of Pala.
However, despite the fact that his colleagues saved their lives, the 21-year-old Antonio Ganavanas Agung refused to leave his job in Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport's Palu airport control station, which was very busy.
He remained at his station to make sure that on the plane Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the runway, he would take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the traffic control, thinking that it could collapse.
Later, he died in the hospital.
An Indonesian air navigation representative, Johannes Sirait, said that his decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reported Australia’s ABC news.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kaliman, to bring him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We're sorry for hearing it from the heart," he fills it.
Meanwhile, the public authorities are concerned that the number of deaths could reach thousands, the State Disaster Prevention Agency claims that access to Dongala, Sigi and Butangano (Boutong) is limited.
"It is believed that the beautiful growth will be, because still many people's bodies are under the ruins, and many cannot be accessed," said the agency representative Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The waves, reaching six feet [6 m] in height, destroyed Pala, where mass funerals would take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft continue to provide assistance and necessary goods.
Risa Kusuma, 35-year-old mother, Sky News said: "Each minute the emergency services bring new victims.
Clean water is a deficit.
Small stores are hidden everywhere."
Jan Gefand, Head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, CNN said: "The Red Cross of Indonesia hastens to help the survivors, but we do not know what we will find there.
"It's a tragedy, but it can all get worse."
On Sunday, the President of Indonesia, Joko Widododo, came to Pala and the State Military Envoy, saying: 'I ask you to work day and night to accomplish all tasks relating to evacuation.
Are you ready?" The CNN reported.
Indonesia has already been shocked this year by earthquakes in Lombarda, where more than 550 people died.
Aeroplane crash in Micronesia: Now Air Niugini says that one of the people has disappeared after the plane crash
The airline carried out a flight during which the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia fell and now claims that one of the people had disappeared, even though it had previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
The airline Air Niugini announced in a press release on Saturday afternoon when they could not answer for one of the passengers — the man.
The airline announced that it cooperates with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find a missing man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
The local people on board helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane fell into the water, trying to land at Chuk Island Airport.
The officials, Friday, said that seven people were hospitalized.
The airline announced that six people remained in hospital until Saturday, all of them in stable condition.
The causes of the accident and the sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. fleet report that the plane fell into the lagoon shortly after taking off the runway.
Some eyewitnesses felt that the runway length had changed on board.
American passenger Bill Janes said that the plane was very low.
"It was really good," said Janes.
Janes says that he and other passengers were able to get out of the sinking plane using an emergency exit, because water was only to the middle.
He said that the strikers fell panic and shouted, as well as that he had a light head injury.
The U.S. naval seamen who worked near to improve the quay also helped with rescue work by using an inflatable ship to bring people to the shore before the plane falling about 30 feet (100 feet) below the water.
Data from the Air Safety Network show that 111 people have died in the airlines registered with PNG in the last 20 years, and no one has been associated with Air Niugini.
The psychoanaly commentator explains the course of events at night in which a live woman was burned
On Saturday, the appeal provided evidence repeated in the case under appeal, where a man is accused of burning a live woman in 2014.
In the US Department of Judicial Expert Analysis, psychoanalyzor Paul Rovlet presented several hours as a witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used the information from his phone to put together the 29 - year new accused Quinton Tally and 19 - year - old prisoner Jessica Chambers acted at the night she died.
Rovlets said that he had received location data from a number of phones, which suggests that Telis was with Chambers in the evening at her death evening, challenging his previous testimony, reported "The Clarion Ledger."
When the data showed that his phone was at Chambers when he said that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to see Sanford.
Sanford showed him in the courtroom that he was not in town that day.
When the accusation asked if Telis was telling the truth, claiming that he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said he was "mo because my car was in Nashville."
Another coincidence was that Tally said he knew Chambers only about two weeks when she died.
Phone records show that they only know each other for a week.
Rovlet said that a little after Chambers died, Telis erased text, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He deleted him from his life," said Heil.
It is envisaged that the defences will present their concluding arguments on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected that the trial would be passed on to the jury later on the same day.
The High Breed Group: What is a conscious hip-hop?
Hip-hop trio wants to challenge negative opinions about this music genre by giving a positive message with his music.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip-hop has moved away from its beginnings on political messages and when facing social problems.
The group wants to return to the root of the genre and make the conscious hip-hop again popular.
Artists such as "The Fugees" and "Common" have experienced the recent rebirth of the UK with such artists as Akala and Lowkey.
The black one again?
In New York, the cord has been sued over him for dismissal after receiving the "racist" message
In New York, a cord has sued someone in court for discriminatory dismissal after she received a wrong message from a mother who complained that a cord "receiving is black."
The couple deny that it would be racist, like the "expressing" court case.
Lindsija Plasko-Flaksmana, the mother of two children, expressed her negative attitude to find out that the new baby-career, Jizele Maurys, was black when she came to work on the first day of 2016.
"NEVER, HISTORY,"Plasko-Plaksman wrote to his husband in a text message.
However, she sent a message not to her husband, but to Maurice, and twice thereafter.
In view of her inactivity, the "samulsī" Plasko-Flaksman discount in Maurisian, stating that their previous altar, an African American, did a bad job and that she had been waiting for the Filipino, referring to New York Post.
Maurice paid her for one business day and sent her home with Uber.
Now Maurisa has sued the court for her dismissal and wants to receive $ 350 a day for a six-month job for the first time she applied for and without a contract of employment.
"I would like to show them that they don't do such things," she said "Rost" on Friday, adding "I know it is discrimination."
The couple reject the accusation that they are racist, claiming that the suspension of Maurice's employment was a reasonable decision, because they were afraid that they would not be able to trust her after she was insulted.
"My wife sent her something that didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racers," Joe Plasko, man, said Post.
"But would you entrust your children to someone you treated rudely, even if it happened only because of error?
My newborn?
Think about it."
By comparing the court hearing with the "expression", Plasko said that his wife had given birth only two months ago and was very "a difficult situation".
"You're really against someone like this?
It is unacceptable action," added the investment banker.
While judicial proceedings are still under way, public opinion is fast to judge over social networks, blaspheming them about their behaviour and logical thinking.
A new letter reveals that the publishers of Paddington’s book were concerned that readers would not be able to associate with the speaking bear
Bond's daughter, Karen Jenquel, born shortly before the book was approved, said about the letter: "It's hard to "put in some shoes" who reads the book for the first time before it was published.
It is amazing to know now what we know about Paddington's great success."
When she said that her father, who worked as an operator in the BBC before feeling the inspiration to write a book to children about a small toy bear, was optimistic that his work would be rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book issue was "sweet bitter" after Father's passing away forever last year.
Speaking of Paddington, who she calls "a very important member of the family", her father quietly proud of her possible success.
"He was quiet, quiet man and wasn't great," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was just like if you have a child who reaches something: you're proud even if you haven't done it yourself.
I think he saw Paddington's success in a similar way.
Though he was created by him and the fruit of his imagination, he always gave every gain to Paddington himself."
I had to telephonely turn away from my dying daughter
After being humbled, her daughter with the quick ones took to Nice Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors constantly fought for her life.
"Nothing called regularly and said she was very bad and expected not to live," said Ednan-Laperuza.
"Then I got a call from Ned, saying that she will die in the next two minutes and I have to come back from her.
And I did.
I said, "Here, I love you so much, dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that doctors gave her to maintain her heart rate slowly stopped and left her body.
She would have died even faster, and it all came to an end now.
I had to sit down and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn’t catch or scream because I was in a situation where families and people around me were.
I needed a lot of effort to control it."
After all, then, the daughter was in mourning, Ednan-Laperuz boarded the plane with other passengers who had no idea of who she was passing through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I cut my head down and the tears ran all the time.
It is difficult to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt deep compassion for Ned.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved him."
Endurance women stick cards to bridges to prevent suicide
Two women whose loved ones have committed suicide take action to help others not take their lives off.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Hamfrey strengthen cards at the Welsh Bridge with inspiring message and phone numbers so that people can call and receive support.
His son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression, but he committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want an elder to experience what I have every day," she said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lydnia, said that her son was a promising cook with a addictional smile.
"Everyone recognised him for laughing.
Everyone always said that his smile "lighted" always and everywhere."
But he refused to work before he died because he was "very, in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, found him after Tyler had committed suicide.
Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that it's going to have consequences."
Davis made cards, "to make it clear that there are people you can turn to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
You don't have to sit silently, you have to talk."
Hamfrey, who has been a friend of Davis for years, lost Mark, his wife for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say that he felt sad or was depressed or anything else felt," she said.
"Some days before Christmas we noticed that his attitude had changed.
He reached his lowest point on Christmas morning, when the children opened gifts, he did not create eye contact with them or anything like that."
His death was a big injury to children, but they have to deal with it, "It's making the whole family a little nervous.
It's up to us.
But all of us must continue and fight."

The future of Breta Kaveno hangs in the air, because the FBI initiates investigations
"I think if we could really get what he is asking for – in time and volume limited investigation – we could achieve a little consensus," Fleuk announced on Saturday, adding that he was concerned that the commission was "shared" between the fortified partisans.
Why do Kaveno and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their detention is just a coincidence.
The interelection is five weeks later, on November 6, if the Republicans are expected to be badly affected, their attempts will be much weaker to elect a man from among them.
George W. Bush called the senators in lobbying them to support Kaveno, who worked at the White House during the Bush and met his wife Ashley, who was the personal secretary of President Bush.
What will happen after the FBI prepares its report?
A vote will take place in the Senate, where at present 51 places are held in the Republican, while 49 in the Democrat.
It remains unclear whether Kaveno can obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pens, Vice President, to decide the vote and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
Kim's leadership "reducing" the number of political asylum seekers in North Korea
The number of North Korea’s political asylum seekers in South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong came back to power for seven years, said South Korea’s legislator.
Park Byeong-Seug, citing data from the Ministry of Association of South Korea, said that last year there were 1127 political asylum seekers, compared to 2011 when the number was 2706.
Park said that the stricter border control at Star North Korea and China and the high rates of human traffickers are key factors.
Pyongyang did not make public comments.
The vast majority of political asylum seekers from North Korea are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that more than 30 000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most of them pass through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the hard-protected Demilitarisation Zone (DMZ) between both Korea.
China considers political asylum seekers to be illegal immigrants and denounces them in a forced manner.
Relations between North Korea and South Korea, which are still under technical war, have significantly improved in recent months.
At the beginning of this month the leaders of both countries met with Pyongyang to discuss delayed denuclearisation.
This happened after an historic meeting in June between U.S. President Donald Trampa and Kim Jongunas in Singapore, when they agreed to cooperate to release the Korean Peninsula from nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions since these negotiations did not make any progress.
"In the absence of confidence in the United States, there will be no faith in the security of our country, and under such circumstances we will never unilaterally armed the first ones," said Ri in his address at the UN General Assembly in New York."
Nancy Pelosi named Brett Kaveno as "history" and claims that he is unsuitable for work in the Supreme Court.
The Court’s minority leader Nancy Pelosi named the candidate of the Supreme Court Breta Kaveno as "histomatic" and claimed that he was not suitable for work in the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi commented on the interview "Texas Tribune Festival" in Austin, Texas.
"I can't stop thinking that if a woman had behaved like this, they would call him "histomatic," said Pelosi about his response to Kaveno's testimony to the Senate's Judicial Commission on Thursday.
Cavendo emotionally denied accusations of sexual harassment to Dr. Christine Bleius Ford when they were teenagers.
In its initial argument, Kaveno was very emotional, sometimes almost shouting and learning, when talking about his family and high school years.
He, in particular, condemned the democrats in the Commission, in the name of the accusations against him about the 'rotsk and coherent destruction' organised by the Liberals who are angry with the loss of Hilaria Klinton in the Presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said that she felt that Kaveno's testimony was based on the fact that he could not work in the Supreme Court because it showed that he had bilateral treatment with the Democrats.
"I think he himself disqualified with such assertions and the attitude he takes against Clinton and Democrats," she said.
Mr Pelosi objected when she was asked whether she would try to doubt Kaveno if she had been confirmed and if the Democrats had gained a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say that if he does not tell the truth to Congress or FBI, he is not suitable for office not only in the Supreme Court, but also to work in the existing workplace in the court," said Pelosi.
Kaveno, now, is a judge at the Washington district court of appeal.
Pelosi supplemented by saying that as a democrat, it is worried about the possibility of Kaveno taking decisions against Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, because he is regarded as a conservative judge.
In their approval negotiations, Kaveno asked questions as to whether he would reject decisions of the Supreme Court.
"There is no suitable moment to work in the court as a hysterical and double person, but to expect us to be happy to say, "Is it not wonderful?" said Peloshi.
But women must hold up their hands.
It's a denunciation, months and years, it's all accumulating "cross the edges", but she's not allowed to get it from her own crying out of her.
"We cry when we're angry," Mrs. Steinham told me in 45 years.
"I don't think that's something unusual for you?"
She continued, "Sometime she helped me very much, who herself was the leader of a company that said she also wept when she was angry but built a technique — when she became angry and began to weep, she said to the person she was talking to: "You can think I am sad because I weep.
I'm angry."
And then she went.
And I thought it was great."
Asa is only partially recognised as a type of anger discharge because it is misunderstood on its own foundations.
One of my greatest memories is that of the oldest man - made job I had when I wept once because of my inexpressive anger, when an older woman, a woman of restraint (a woman) was behind my chest, who was always a little scared of me on the stairs.
"Never let them see that weep!" she told me.
"They don't know you've moved.
They think you're confused and they're just going to be happy that you managed to "palace under your skin."
Patricia Schreder, the U.S. Democrat Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in charge of his pre-election campaign president.
In 1987, when Hart, who was caught in a connection with sexuality, abandoned the ship, also called "make fools" and left the elections, Shreder, deeply disappointed, thought that there was no reason why she could not stand as President.
"That wasn't a carefully thought-out decision," she said to me 30 years later.
"The election was already seven other candidates and the last one they wanted to find one more.
There were those who called it "Snippets and seven snippets."
She was late in campaigning, left behind funds, and promised that if 2 million US dollars were not collected, she would not participate in the election.
It was a lost fight.
She found that many of her supporters, who donated $1,000, donated only $250.
"Do they think I got discounts?" she wondered.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was very emotional — grateful to those who supported her, disappointed in a system that made it very difficult to collect money and speak to voters rather than delegates, and angry about sexism — in which she was "suffered".
"You would think I had a nerve collapse," Sherder recalled how the press reacted to him.
"You would think "Cleenex" was my corporate sponsor."
I remember thinking what they're going to write on my tomb.
"She wept."
Why the U.S.-China trade war can be favorable for Beijing
The main excuses about how the trade war between the US and China started is hidden and while the fight does not see the end, disputes between countries can be favourable to Beijing in the long term, says experts.
The US President Donald Trump issued the first warning at the beginning of this year by taxing the main Chinese export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important escalation started this week with new rates that affect the unit's $200 billion ($150 billion) value, charging immediately half of the goods exported from China in the USA.
Beijing also "climb" responds every time, the latest is the five to ten percentage points of American goods worth $60 billion.
China has stated that it is a commitment to answer the US against one another, and it is questionable that in the near future, the world's second largest economy could be mentioned.
In order for Washington to resign, certain requirements would have to be met, but the public failure of the US would be too embarrassing to the President of China, Xi Sji Jinin.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the pressure of the US trade war can have a positive impact on China in the long term, reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a political decision was made quickly either in Washington or in Beijing could create uncontrollable economic conditions in any of the countries, which are really more dangerous than observers previously recognised," said Abigeil Grace, a researcher at New American Security who focuses on Asia.
Syria is "prepared" for receiving refugees back, announced by the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
Syria argues that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and urges them to help restore a country that has been affected by war for more than seven years.
When speaking to the United Nations Assembly, Foreign Minister Valids Almualem said that conditions in the country were improving.
"Now the situation on land is much more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists to their normal state.
There are all the conditions for refugees to return voluntarily to a country which they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic events that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN assumes that the country has left 5.5 million Syrians since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six million more people are still living in the country and need humanitarian aid.
Almualam said that the Syrian regime would accept assistance in the reconstruction of the destroyed country.
But he stressed that the state would not accept conditions for assistance or assistance from countries that helped to sponsor insurmountables.
European golf team has sensually won the Raydra Cup battle in Paris
The European golf team won the 2018 Racer Cup, overcoming the US sample with a result of 16,5:10,5 "Le Golf National" outside Paris, France.
The United States has lost Europe six times in a row and has not received the Raidera Cup since 1993.
Europe regained the cup when the team led by the random Dane Thomas Bjorn got 14.5 points that was needed to overshadow the US sample.
The star of the U.S. Phil Michaelson, who was hard to go all round the tournament, was watered at the base of PAR 3 16. on a match in Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari played shinyly in all its stages, becoming one of the four players who have ever won the 5-0-0 result since 1979, when the tournament is played in the current format.
American Jordan Scott with 5 against 4 sensational loss of European teams, at the rating of the lowest player Torbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's best player, Justin Johnson, lost 2 against 1 Ian Polter from England, who could have had this last Raider cup.
The eight Raider Cup veteran, Spanish Serbian Garcia, became a tournament of the best players from Europe at 25,5 career points.
"I don't cry normally, but today I can't control tears."
This was a hard year.
I am sincerely grateful to Thomas for lifting me up and for believing me.
I'm very happy we've recovered the cup.
This is the merit of the team and I am glad I could help," Garcia commented emotionally after winning the European sample.
He next gives the name to John Rams, a national who won the U.S. golf legend Taiger Woods on Sunday with 2 against 1 single-games.
"The pride I feel when I win Tyger Woods, I grew up following the steps of this player," said 23 years old young Rams.
Woods lost all his four machos in France and now he has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Raidera cup.
Unusual statistics for one of the best players of all time, who won 14 top golf tournaments, being the other behind Jack Nicas.
The U.S. team fought all weekend to find their chance, except Patrick Rid, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played the high-level golf event all round.
The U.S. team captain Jim Furick, after the unsatisfied performance of his team, said: "I'm proud of the guys, they fought.
This morning, we were able to put a little pressure on the European team.
We fought.
All due respect to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players took a very good game.
We will restructure, I will work with the American PGA and the US Raydra Cup Committee and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You need to tap your hats.
We won."
