On the way with Alster's Lambretta club
Motormen "Lambretta" were not replaced by cultural satellites of fashion in the 7th century.
A group of the fans of the Italian Motorer is trying to preserve the spirit of those times.
70 years after the first establishment of the Alster “Lambretta” club, around 100 motorists from the United Kingdom and Ireland gathered in Ferman County this weekend.
One of the first two members of the club was Chris Wilson in 1966 acquired the first “Lambretta” for about $40.
“I only had a motor vehicle, but I learned that I could use it in other ways.
That was some kind of sport.
I didn't get involved in fashion culture, and now I'm probably too old for that," he said.
"It was quite cheap and quite reliable, and you could get it at an affordable price, and having bought it to do something more than just to go from A to B."
He participated in "Lambretta" separate start race in the Art Island TT ring.
The first Alster "Lambretta" club was founded in the beginning of the 1980s and was reorganized 12 years ago.
“About 1971, motorcyclists and other forms of transport were increasingly interested in people, and clubs were in general suffering from anxiety, so I thought: “All things, that’s the end,” said Chris.
"Then, in some time, there was again interest, and it seems to have grown ever more."
Philip Steele is the secretary of Alster "Lambretta" club, currently with 97 members, who is responsible for membership.
“All the motives are different.
Some members have been influenced by fashion culture, since it has almost started.
Others are racing enthusiasts or brokers – here you will find people of all kinds.
There are some who just have an interesting vintage.
Many motors are modified, so there are no two equal.
It is possible to keep driving at a speed of 35 or 40 miles per hour, adapted to the narrow streets of Italy, but some members have improved this.
Some highly modified motors could probably reach a speed of up to 100 miles per hour."
During the weekend, a breakdown occurred, and some motors had to start pushing.
And although the weather in Northern Ireland is not always as pleasant as the "Lambretta" homelands in Italy, this time the sun was engulfed by motorists in Fermana County.
Ruth Davidson asks for the actor's silence on the "Brexit" question
Ruth Davidson asked her fellow conservatives for a "sty-time" so that the Prime Minister could agree on "Brexito".
The head of the Scottish regions said that within two years of the EU referendum, the debate was sufficient.
She gave her opinion after Boris Johnson said about the Prime Minister's plan, which he called "a crazy and totally absurd".
She said that it is time to support the Prime Minister.
At a party conference held in Birmingam, Torri activists said: “In the past two years, we have had time to debate.
Former Foreign Secretary served in one of the best offices in the country’s history and during that period most of the current plan, which was already recognised last November.
The Conservatives must now support the Prime Minister, allow her to complete the deal and help implement plans in the country.
I think the silence period would be very useful."
Her comments followed a sharp criticism in the "Brexit" debate, which was not first expressed by former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.
During an interview with the BBC journalist Andrew Marro, Theresa May later assured her that she believes in Brexitu and that her office plan can ensure a favourable free trade deal with the European Union.
Davidson also said that participating in other elections would promise to prevent the second Scottish referendum on independence, because in 2014 "the victims were promised that such an event would be the only one in their generation".
When asked about a possible rerun of the 'Brexit' referendum, she replied: 'If we were talking about Scotland's history, I repeatedly said that you cannot repeat the referendum if you are a nationalist and you are not satisfied with the result.
I would change if I said I could hold another referendum on Brexit because I was hoping for a different result."
Path M8 after police incident reopened
Highway M8 is once again opened after a police incident at Glasgow.
According to the police, the road was closed a little earlier than 07.00 a.m. in both directions at the border of 15 Townhead when anxiety of the foot occurred.
Traffic on the closed road didn't last three hours and was disturbed in the city where the marathon "Great Scottish Run" takes place.
In 20 C.E., the man was later taken to the Royal Glasgian Hospital for research.
A friend of Christine'a Blasey Ford approved a statement on sexual abuse suspected of Bretta Kavanaugh.
Lelanda Keyser, who had friends with Dr. Christine'a Blasey Ford in high school, accused Bett Kavanagh's sexual abuse when they were both teenagers, wrote a letter to the Senate's Committee on the Judiciary, explaining that although he did not remember the party's home in which the attack might have taken place, he believed in Ford's story.
Keyser previously made a statement through her lawyer that she did not remember the party mentioned and did not even know whether he had met Kavanaugh.
On Thursday, while witnessing against the Courts Committee, Kavanaugh often referred to Keyser's statement as proof of his virginity, but did not mention Keyser's statement that it was believed in Ford's words.
On Friday, President Trump asked the FBI to carry out a study in a week when the Republican senator Jeff Flake and other moderate senators asked to give the time for the study and for the week to postpone the entire Senate vote on the Kavanaugh.
On Saturday, Keyser sent a letter to the Committee of her lawyer stating that he wanted to “as a contribution to the additional study by the FBI” on Kavanaugh.
“However, as my client has already explained, she does not know the judge Kavanaugh and does not remember the party or assembly in which he would have been with or without Dr Ford,” says Keyser in a letter from the lawyer Howard Walsho.
The letter goes on to explain that Keyser “does not reject Dr. Ford’s saying and has already said to the press that you believe Dr. Ford’s testimony.”
"However, the simplest and irreparable truth is that it cannot confirm it, because it does not remember the said occurrence," continues the letter.
Kavanaugh's friend Mark Judge, allegedly next to the attack, claimed that he would also contribute to the FBI's investigation.
Legitimate people in Chicago talk about life with a corrupt policeman and his gang
The High Prosecutor of Illinois is trying to change the history of the Chicago police after a dark period.
It is believed that an unfair policeman exploited innocent residents of social housing and unduly arrested a large number of people.
To date, 42 people convicted illegally have been legalized.
Instead of the social housing project, Ida B. Wells has now left only an empty site, and earlier their population has been exploited by corrupted Chicago police for more than a decade without fear.
They were led by Sergeant Ronald Watts.
The citizens accused him and his tactical team of extortion, counterfeiting and coercion of police reports and evidence.
Willie Martin and Cleon Glover are two of those convicted so far by the Prosecutor General of Cook County Kim Fox.
“If you didn’t work with him, you ended up being bad.
You were his enemy.
You prevented him from working and earning", - Cleans said about Watts Cleon Glover.
“I was very scared.
I wanted to escape the area,
but I didn't have anywhere to go," said Willie Martin.
The lawyers of the Fox ethical department review 30 to 40 more cases related to Wattsu.
Ida B. Wells, a resident of social housing, Landon Allen, said that many people decided not to sleep about Watts.
"Man did not love much," he said.
"But it wasn't important."
According to Clarissa Baker, another resident, there was no one who believed that the population was speaking of a sergeant in office.
“He has his gang.
Who will believe us?"
said Baker.
Joshua Tepfer, who works at the Chicago university validation project, says that so far no one really believed in them.
“It was all over, because they didn’t seem important to them, and they didn’t care because they were black people living in social housing, so they thought they had done something wrong,” Tepfer said.
“Seržant Watts sat in prison for an attempt to steal the FBI informant in 22 months.
Martez Wise is also placed in prison thanks to Watts.
I just had a son.
I couldn't be with him for four years.
He hardly knew me because he was just born, so I had to reconnect with him," said Wise.
"I've lost my business for four years."
72 years of existence “Fidelity” believes in the success of block circuits, virtual reality and artificial intelligence
The potential of “Fidelity” block circuits was noted until 2018, when all corporations started to talk about this technology.
Director General Abby Johnson led investments in cryptovalytes, the most risky and volatile asset class in recent years.
“About two years ago, I and other senior managers were just curious about what happened, especially in the bitkoins market,” - Johnson said.
We started thinking and realized that we had to find out.
Disquietingly led to the launch of bitkoins in New Hampshire, where the price of this crypto was about $ 180.
In December last year, the price reached nearly $20 000 and, says Johnson, "we've noticed: when the price rose, we started to earn, although we never expected it."
She did not indicate how many bitkoins the "fly" or how much "Fidelity" was made.
"Fidelity" employees have a clear interest in these technologies.
The unit-chain club for employees, called “Bitas and Blocks”, which organises seminars and meetings with specialists, now has about 2 600 members.
The company agreed with Coinbase, which gave its customers the opportunity to check the balance of cryptovulates using the Fieldity mobile app.
In 2015, there was a possibility of donations from bitcoins.
According to Johnson, the company rejected most of the other possible uses of bitcoins, or at least for a short time.
We're trying to watch the market.
So far Katie Chase, chief strategist of the Fidelity Application Technology Centre and leader of the Block Chain Incubator (part of FCAT), is looking for ways to use the public and business-based block chains.
Chase was unable to comment on specific projects, but it revealed that there was a great deal of interest among customers, partners and employees.
"It's all new.
If you get involved in the information, you will understand that evidence of the concept is still being found", said Chase.
We have tried to adapt the block circuits to different situations and we have learned a lot, but the technology is not so advanced as to be able to solve such problems."
In the meantime, she argues that the group focuses more on trying to understand the nature of those obstacles.
They are trying to understand how to calculate the value of physical objects such as works of art, tokens or to use block circuits in the supply chain.
"For as long as this is not the focus, but I think it will end up being interested," said Chase.
"Fidelity" will be ready for this."
As an example, she referred to the Pebble clock, which was completely unsuccessful in marketing standards, but finally paid back to Fidelity.
Its group has developed a programme for smart watch stop producing in three years, collecting millions through Kickstarter's crowdfunding project.
When Apple Watch appeared on the market, Fidelity was ready.
It quickly applied the Pebble app for the new Apple product.
“We were not blind to the fact that the watch “Pebble” would be popular, but we wanted to be prepared if people liked the smart watch,” she said.
"We've gained knowledge and were ready when smart clocks were released into the mass market."
The Sulawesi Island was destroyed by the earthquake and the tsunami
On September 29, on Friday, the islands of Indonesia were hit by a powerful 7.5-point earthquake that caused tsunamis and destroyed almost 400 people.
There are many injured ones who are expected to grow.
According to an Indonesian disaster management agency representative, electrical power and communication are not affected, so it is difficult to assess damage in the town of Pala and in the neighbouring community of fishermen of Dongala.
California students wear T-shirt with racist notes
According to CNN branch KGTV, the Escondino Schools Union confirmed this week that about 10 students had taken a misinformed decision to demonstrate racism at the event for the highest classes.
"We are proud that all the diversity is accepted at our school," said Adriana Lepe-Ramirez.
"We will not tolerate the promotion of racism and exclusion."
The report also states that the incident is being investigated by the Escondino Secondary School, the Union’s officials and the local police.
“The school’s administrators contacted the parents and guardians of the wrong students and will be subject to disciplinary penalties,” states the report.
According to a report from the police station, students from a school in San Diego north of San Diego had to wear a pixel with letters from which racist recordings were put, and they had been photographed.
Schools usually confirm notes in advance, but after taking a photo, some students choose their words.
The Union report states that this behaviour is "not compatible with the culture, values or history of the Escondid Secondary School".
"We must understand the impact of our words and actions and take responsibility for the decisions we make every day," Lepe-Ramirez said.
"Escondium Secondary School continues to foster family values and unity-based culture throughout the community."
A former student, Cade Pannel, told KGTV that an offensive picture of the social media was injuring him.
"It hurts me personally," he said.
“ Maybe it seemed funny to them, but it isn’t.
Only the inexperienced can laugh at such things."

According to "TMZ Sport", O'Neal will perform heart surgery to eliminate the disorder that UCLA doctors have observed during the routine examination.

We are happy about the composition of this year's team and Shareef will be a great complement to it.
He has a good foundation, and he will be able to improve at both ends of the field."
According to 247Sports, O'Neal, 18-year-old, is a 4-star candidate, with 8th prize held in 2018 in newcomers' ranking as a heavy national attacker and 41 as a player.
Before joining the UCLA, O'Neal helped Crossroads high school to achieve record results in the last season – 25:9.
The chief son of Sarah Palin is accused of violence against his father
Track Palin was arrested for three crimes, including attacks, in 28 years.
On Sunday, he was not first arrested for domestic violence.
According to the court’s records, the incident occurred in Palina’s home in Vasilla, Alaska, where Track Palin had to get to the blood injury to Todd’s father in dispute with the truck.
Year 28 after Saturday incident arrested for three crimes, including an attack.
The court documents show that the dispute started when the man called to take the truck, but his father refused to give it.
As explained in the court’s statement, Track Palina was arrested for charges of first - degree hacking and fourth - degree attack and fourth - degree crime, and his father was injured in his face and head.
According to the documents, Palina's linguists called the "creatives" and told him not to use the weapons.
The court statement also indicates that the man was arrested on the garage roof.
The court documents record the words of Sarah Palin that her son was "smoked" and "drinkled on some medicine."
It was also noted that Track Pulin police had previously claimed to drink several bottles of beer.
He was arrested at the beginning of 2016 and accused of domestic violence against a woman, of obstructing the notification of domestic violence and of the possession of arms in the womb.
“When I see my son feeling what he is experiencing when he comes back, I understand other families living with the consequences of a post-traumatic stress disorder, and I know how the soldiers are being injured,” said former Republican candidate for Vice Presidents and Governor of Alaska.
"Now I know better than ever that the American best people need the chief commander who will respect them and appreciate them."
Elizabeth Warren claims to think about the election to the Presidents after the mid-election
"It is time for women to march to Washington and correct the failed government that women should lead," said a democratic senator speaking to the crowds who met at the town of Massachusetts Holjok.
"So I promise this is: after 6 November, think carefully about the absence of a candidate for President."
Warren, trying to defend his position in the competition with the representative of the Republicans in the state of Geoff Diehlu, previously said that the presidents were uncandidate because he wanted to pay attention to his work in the Senate.
"It is very important to focus on the mid-term elections and to stop acting as if the only important thing was 2020", she said to the reporters in August when they gave a speech in the National Press Club.
"The nearest important fight is the mid-term elections, and not only in Massachusetts but also in the whole country."
Warren has long been seen as a potential candidate for democracy in 2020, capable of competing with President Donald Trump.
However, it would look forward to a difficult primary election battle, with the possible involvement of other well-known democrats – former Vice President Joe Biden, California Senator Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gilliband, New York Senator.
A third thoughtful death in less than a year is associated with a mental health clinic of celebrities
According to The Mail, a third person committed suicide in a luxury psychiatric clinic more than a year ago.
Shaquell Vidal, a TV coma daughter, died on 7 April, having spent almost a month voluntarily in West London, Marylebone, at the Nightingale Hospital.
Her boyfriend James Lyle (57 m.) – manager of the hedge fund, millionaire and former sponsor of the Conservative party – paid the costs of her care for five years.
The future chief chef died almost six months after the day when the high-level celebrity Daisy Boyd (28 years) became one of the founders of River Cafe Rose Gray.
After his separation, Dan Macmillan (43), an heir of the publishing company, Boyd died on 5 October in a drug accident brought by a visitor to the clinic.
Two months ago, Alan MacDonald (61 years) left his home when he left the hospital four days earlier.
In May, the Supervisory Quality Commission criticised the Nightingale clinic because it did not make sufficient efforts to prevent illicit substances being introduced.
On 11 March, BBC recorded the kamikas Avo Vidal’s daughter in Shaquell’s clinic.
Last week, at the preliminary hearing of the Coronary of Westminster, Royal Advocate Katie Gollop said that on 29 March Shaquell disappeared from AWOL and returned to his deteriorating mental condition a week later.
Ava Vidal, working on behalf of Mr. Gollop, said: “My client wants to find out what happened to Shaquell..., who she was in contact with and what she was doing.”
Mr. Lyle, she called Shaquell's "kidkin".
Informal Shaquell's father-director John Gordoll (52 C.E.) said: "I know that Shaquell continued to communicate with James Lyle and he was at that time in New York."
At Mr Gordoll's meeting, he revealed that on 4 April, Shaquelle called him and told him that he wanted to buy and drink cyanide, and he called the clinic "more than a dozen times" 20 minutes after this call, but no one responded.
“I think further events could have been avoided if someone had responded,” he added.
On 5 April, the clinic doctor found Shaquell’s mental status to be very poor."
After less than 48 hours, she had a notebook wire.
In Nightingale, the representative expressed his sympathy to family and friends and said: "Our clinic aims to provide high quality care in a safe, treatment-friendly environment."

Led Zeppelin was sued again due to the alleged stolen Stairway To Haven guitar reef
Led Zeppelin was again sued for the guitar reef used by Stairway To Haven in 1971, which was allegedly stolen by the group.
A positive sign is that part of the British group’s 1971 hit is washed.
The Court of Appeal rejected the 2016 ruling that the group had not copied the name of another group called Spirit.
In 2015, Michael Skidmore, the trustee of the Spirit guitar, brought an action.
It seems that the challenge about the Led Zeppellin song “Stairway To Haven” will last for a long time – just like the song itself.
The group will return to the court for accusations of the stealing guitar reef of the 1971 ballad.
The US Court of Appeal rejected the 2016 ruling that the group had not copied the hit beginning of the band's Spirit music.
It is argued that the court judge made mistakes, for example, by falsely informing the jury of copyright laws.
The case was brought back to court.
Michael Skidmore, the trustee of Spirit guitar Randy Wolfe, lodged his first claim in 2015.
Police trap ended in Michigan when the policeman passed the suspected murderer who shot them.
Michigan was suspected of murder by her girl, and was arrested after the police intercepts that ended after he passed the police car.
In 33 C.E. Adam Nolin is suspected to have shot her girl in Wajing, Michigan, 27 C.E. Tia Mae Randall.
He was sued on Friday at a hospital, where he was hit by an officer when he passed him by a SUV car, because Nolin was trying to escape by a motorway with intense traffic.
Nolin has been accused of five serious crimes, including an attack on the murder and escape from the police.
"Injuring the hospital is not the usual case, but it is not the first case," said James Magufee, captain of the Wajing Police.
"It is subject to appropriate treatment, but the justice process must also continue.
The judiciary are often adapted to implement it."
Nolin's girl's body was found on Thursday in a mobile home in the Creekside Estates district.
The mother of two children was shot with one shot and the police immediately identified Nolin as a suspect.
The police then issued a public warning on Nolin and gave a short description of the man and his black Dodge pickup in 1996.
A man observed in his pickup and went to the highway US 131, when the police tried to stop him.
Nolin and a pickup hit the concrete wall, then left the car and ran off the highway.
As he ran, he shot the volunteer cops.
One policeman sat in the police SUV car and passed Nolin from the back.
The observer filmed an event.
Nolin was taken to a hospital in a difficult but stable condition and will remain there until it is written down and moved to Kentan County prison.
"This event has shown that Western Michigan police risk their health in order to protect the community," said Magufee.
"They have taken husbands together quite quickly and with appropriate means, and we are proud of them."
In total, Nolin has been charged with two charges in an attack to kill, and he is also accused of escape from the police, of carrying a hidden weapon and of a serious crime committed in the use of a firearm.
He's not yet charged with his girl's murder because an investigation is still under way.
“We are, of course, still carrying out a murder investigation, which we will soon conclude in order to be able to submit it in time to the attorney of Kent,” said Magufee.
The judge praised a courageous man who beat his teeth into his house for an invading thief
The judge did not spare the greatest praise for the valiant man who stood up against two criminals, who tried to break into his house.
Although one hacker tried to trap him on a wooden board, David Oldham, in 63 C.E., was not afraid.
A man working for the university territory defended himself, struck both of the criminals, and beat one of their teeth.
The invaders fled, but after the battle on Mr. Oldham, the blood remained, according to which in four months the Craig Ford was detected and arrested.
When declaring the judgment to Ford, who lost his teeth in trying to get into the individual house of Mr. Oldham 400 000 pounds, Ormskerke, in Washington, the royal judge Clement Goldstone, said: “You probably didn’t expect the reactions of Mr. Oldham to see only the eyes and the nose, you hit him in the house, he hit you.
He also struck your fellow who tried to break into the second floor and jumped from the roof.
On Friday, when the judge sentenced Ford to three years and four months in prison, he said: “I believe you learned two lessons.
First, we do not need to mite David Oldham, and second, we do not need to start with the police.
Because of your crimes now you have one tooth less than before and you bitled the dog.
It's still a little punishment."
He added: "I would like to commend Mr Oldham for his reaction to your actions."
Prosecutor Derek Jones claimed that in 2016 Ford had already been convicted for another hacking and had to be held in prison for three years, but had been released in a comparable manner.
Mr Oldham told the royal court of Liverpool that he jumped when he heard a noise at his home on 5 April at about 19.00.
He said: “P. Oldham, who is a rich man, courageously left home and resisted the accused.
Fearing his own safety, he struck him in his face so that he could hit and beat his teeth.
Then another intruder jumped off the roof in front of Mr. Oldham, who instinctively hit his face."
According to Mr Jones, he took a wooden board and tried to steal Mr. Oldham, and Ford said: "Call him, and he beat my teeth."
The companion said to Mr Oldham: "If you let us go, we will leave" and together with Ford fled from the scene of crime.
On August 2, the police got Ford through the raid in the town of Wavertree.
Ford kicked a police dog, then he bit his shoulder.
It is believed that the second hacker is still in the wild.
25 years of non-residential residence. Ford confessed that he was guilty of hacking, maiming and dangerous driving, although this was forbidden to him and he did not hold a driving licence.
Tore activists met the criticisms expressed to Johnson with favours
Tori activists humiliated Boris Johnson today when he was rescued "a man of great and aggressive nature".
P Johnson, trying to please ordinary people in his uncompromising languages about Brexit, received a rigorous assessment by former Minister of Trade Digby Jones, who was also welcomed this afternoon by Birmingham's conference participants.
David Davis also attacked Mr Johnson because he cares about the headlines of newspapers and not about a strong policy.
Speaking to MailOnline, Mr May's ally ally, added that he simply "tribled" because he was unable to be a full leader.
There is an adverse reaction when the former Foreign Secretary has again attacked the plan of Prime Minister Chequers and has called it "insane" and "totally absurd".
Mr Johnson also added that he was sincerely in favour of the draft, and here she opposed the withdrawal in a referendum two years ago.
It also called on the government to support ambitious projects such as the construction of a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland.
However, Mr May said that they were critics playing political games, and he argued that they did not challenge and were prepared for difficult negotiations with the EU.
At an interview with Andrew Marro BBC, on which the conference was launched, May said: "I believe in Brexitu.
Lord Jones, the former Labour Minister of Labour, who is now independent, received the crowd's approval when he heard the prospects of Brexit.
People were growing up when he expressed his opinion on Mr Johnson, who allegedly answered "to the business" questions of the businessmen concerned.
Not specifically, to name Mr Johnson, Lord Jones made it clear that he was a "man of a kind and aggressive nature".
“Verslas is very important, so when he said “beginning the business”, the former Foreign Secretary has shown that there is indeed a small and aggressive man”, he said.
"I don't fully agree with him."
Lord Jones also praised his speech at the meeting of the Salzburg Leaders to see Mr May's response to the plan of the EU's leaders' trailers at its office.
Ruth Davidson, a Scottish leader, also previously criticised Mr Johnson, recalling that he was a high-level government official during the "Brexito" negotiations.
Mr May's ally, said to the newspaper MailOnline, that intervention is not very serious, and Mr Johnson has insufficient supporters among the actors in the parliament to be able to expel the Prime Minister.
They said: “Now this news is not very dangerous.
He does not sound, but he does not have enough supporters in the parliamentary party, and he knows it.
We see a clear contrast between David Davis, who respectfully expressed his opinion, and Boris, who satisfies his personal ambitions."
Secretary of Business Greg Clark criticised Mr. Johnson, who was acceptic of businessmen looking at Brexita.
When speaking at an internet conference on Birmingham, Mr Clark said that Mr Johnson was "fullly wrong".
He said: “I am surprised that someone can think like this at all.
There is no successful economy in the world, which should not have successful prosperous enterprises."
At an interview with Sky News, Ridge on Sunday, Davis acknowledged that the coming months would be difficult because the EU would try to make the United Kingdom a lot of concessions.
However, he believes that the government must not give up and seek an agreement similar to the Canadian treaty, not the one proposed by the Cabinet of Ministers.
When asked how Johnson had succeeded in taking the lead, he did not miss out on engulfing the former secretary of foreign affairs.
Describing Mr Johnson's suggestion to build a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland, he said: "One of the shortcomings of British policy is that of politicians with fantastic ideas."
He added: "Our communication is chaotic and many of his ideas are suitable for headlines, but not for strong politics."
Bulgaria spent €80 million on poor restoration of European taxpayers' money
Bulgaria has spent €80 million in European taxpayers' funds for the restoration of old castles, which now seem to be made from "sour and cardboard".
The Balkan country has spent £80 million from the European Regional Development Fund.
Instead of returning the former greatness, the restoration was a step by step.
The local government in the area around Krakrea's fortress has promised to overturn unbelieving works.
The Bulgarian Government has released tens of EU millions of insolvent medieval castles for restoration.
The Balkan country spent £80 million from the European Regional Development Fund for the restoration of ancient castles and fortifications, but instead of returning their former size, it received a pardon for construction work.
Sometime after expensive reconstruction, it seems like building from "sour and cardboard", so tourists are no longer attractive.
For example, monumentists were impressed that the fortress Krakra and the Roman Fort Trayanovi Vrata near Ihtiman were reconstructed using polymer concrete, commonly used for the building of the pavement, in the western Bulgarian city of Pernicus.
According to The Telegraph, the EU and the Bulgarian Government agreed in private that lessons should be learned from this failure.
“Constituent is in the condition of overturn,” architect and monumentian Stella Duleva said about Trayanovi Vrata.
She's been in the 16th century, and now she's ruined."
This reaction follows the restoration of Krakra fort in Pernice, so the local authorities promised to remove the part delivered in 2019.
Pernica's fortress for unbelievable modifications was released in "the town of the cardboard".
Byzantine Yailata fort was called “the strength of the cheese” because of the reconstruction of smooth white blocks, which are not compatible with a facade affected by weather conditions.
These unsuccessful efforts coincide with the newly emerging doubts as to how the European Union uses the development funds.

Using a security gap, criminals could have reached at least 50 million Facebook accounts.
However, a large-scale hacking was notified only after three days on Friday.
Now Facebook under new European data laws is faced with a huge fine
If at least 50 million accounts are terminated, Facebook may have to pay a fine of £1.25 billion.
The criminals could access accounts because of a security gap, so a large number of sensitive personal information could be disclosed.
However, Facebook reported the hacking only on Friday, three days later, and until evening, it was not possible to tell you how many British accounts were damaged.
While the search for applications continues, the Irish Data Protection Commissioner, who checks the web giant's compliance with the European data compliance requirements, who has its headquarters in Dublin, criticised the company by stating: "The notification is incomplete."
Facebook risks a huge fine under the new data law of the European Union, as companies may be required to pay up to four percent of global turnover.

In the MG Baltic case, the following entries are being heard: the accused discussed Gabriele Landsberg
The Court meeting was opened in November 2015 between former Vice President of MG Baltic and former "work" Vytautas Gapšias's record.
When listening to an entry, it is difficult to understand exactly what the accused are talking about.
It is true that Mr Kurlianski and Mr Gapšys speak about the Christmas feast, and the name of the current conservative leader Gabrielis Landsbergis is on several occasions sounding, but it is difficult to understand exactly what is being said.
The appeals have been brought against both natural and legal persons.
In the case of political corruption, charges were submitted to three legal and five natural persons: Labour and Liberals Movement parties, MG Baltic concern, former liberal and "work" leaders E. Masiulis, Vytautas Gapšias, former Parliamentary Liberals Š. Gustavis, Seimas Member G. Steponavičius and former Vice President of MG Baltic R. Kurlianski.
For the Labour Party, suspicions have been raised regarding the effects of bribery and trade, Liberals movement is suspected of bribery, trade and abuse, while MG Baltic is suspected of buying and selling the effects of these parties.
Officials suspect that politicians were taking or were discussing the bribes with the then Vice President of MG Baltic, R. Kurlianski, and later proposed or supported the Group's positive initiatives in Seimas and other institutions.
Mr Masiulis, former Chairman of the Liberal Movement, is suspected of the effects of trade, bribery and illegal enrichment, and has been suspected of abuse by former Vice President of this Party, Š. Gustainis, former member of the Vilnius City Council.
Mr Gapšys is suspected of the effects of bribery and trade, Mr Kurlianskis is about buying and selling.
Survey: Who has the greatest chance to win the second round of the presidential election?
The survey on the second election round included four candidates on the top of the ratings - economist Githan Nausda, Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis who did not announce the candidate, and two candidates who participated in the initial election of the Party of the Homeland Union - the Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) - Seimas Member Ingrida Šimonytė and diplomat Vygaudas Ušackas.
It was true that on Sunday, I. Šimonytė received support from the TS-LKD in the elections, and Mr. Usack left the election battle.
According to the figures, if the elections were to take place in the near future, in all cases the second round of the President would be won by G. Nausėda, but the head of "Vilmorus", sociologist Vladas Gaidys says that it is too early to draw conclusions.
"Differents (from others - DELFI) Nausage, but it is very important to see whether about parties talking or about people, what the dynamics are.
So the doubles of Shimonytė were from one study to another, and Naseda had stopped growing, Ushack even decreased.
This growth is very important for you," sociologist says.
Moreover, in the light of the results of the survey, it is clear that a large percentage of people have not yet decided, voted for or thought not to go to the elections in general.
If I. Šimonytė and S. Skvernelis were to compete in the second round of the presidential elections, the fight would be tense - for I. This would be 32.7%, for S. Skvernelis 30.9%.
Of course, 36.4% of people said they would not vote for any of these candidates, or did not know who to vote for or to vote for.
Sociologist V. Gaidys once again stressed that we are not seeing a full picture so far, because all candidates who were to apply to the less successful Lithuania's editor have not yet announced.
"If we look at last year's elections, there are many parties in Lithuania, where are their candidates?
For example, where is the social democrat candidate? 30 years old as a candidate, will she not be there now?
When he declares himself, he will see how his opportunity lies with other candidates.
So that side of Lithuania, which is less successful, has been less reflected so far," said Mr Gaidys.
In turn, political scientist Mažvydas Jastramskis, the Institute of International Relations and Political Science of Vilnius University, says that it is still very early to draw conclusions, while all three candidates who rejected V. Usackas, who had left the fight, seem to be in general.
"I can say from the experience of my research that these differences do not mean anything.
The difference of 5 percentage points does not necessarily reflect the advantage of any candidate.
The only thing I can see is that Nausda would look good against Usacka (...) again, bearing in mind that these people would come to a real vote.
The night before Skverniel also looks good, but we are comparing now apples and potatoes, because for example, Nausda has already announced that he will be present, Skvernelis has not announced.
In addition, the survey was conducted against the initial election of conservatives, as it would appear after them?" - said the political scientist.
According to him, Nausėda has a small plus, but when all the candidates have announced, he can shed light.
"The situation is quite equivalent.
Night, Skvernelis, Shimonytė - results roughly.
I would like to remind you that half a year before the 2003 presidential election, Rolandas Paksas had a 5% vote in favour and then won the election.
It's not possible to make any predictions," said Jastramskis.
DELFI recalls that the candidates for presidential elections have already been announced by economist G. Nausda, Seimas member I. Šimonytė, philosopher Arvydas Jozaitis, economist, Seimas member Aušra Maldeikienė, Member of Liberals Movement Petras Auštrevičius, Seimas member Naglis Pueikis and Member of the European Parliament Valentinas Mazuronis.
Iran accused Israel of trying to hold a cyber attack
"The idea that the history of using cyber weapons is clear from cases such as Stuxnet (exploitation) is currently trying to violate Iran's communication infrastructure," Minister of Information Mohammad Javadas Azirani wrote through Twitter.
He was referring to a 'Stuxnet' attack in 2010 that caused damage to Iranian nuclear facilities.
This malware program is believed to be developed by Israel and the United States.
"They were left empty on the watch of our technical teams.
We will continue to talk about this opposition in international fora," Mr Jachrome stressed.
Deputy Minister Hamamid Fattahi said that the technical teams have recorded many attempts to penetrate their systems on Monday weekends, but the attackers were "stablely separated".
The well-being in the Imuls club made the husband wrong, his recovery failed

The man was quickly withdrawn from the water, but he was already unconscious.
It was tried to revitalize him.
Soon they also tried to revitalize it, but they failed to save their lives.
On the way to the hospital, he died in an emergency car.
This disaster was reported by Antons Sakalauskas, the president of the Health Club Network "Impuls".

We express our sincere sympathy for the deceased man’s family for his loss.
According to preliminary data, the event could have been caused by a client’s health problem.
According to information provided by family doctors, it had diabetes mellitus.
We recall that it is always very important to take a responsible view of our opportunities in case of serious health problems and to consult with doctors and health club professionals.
In the premises of all wellness clubs there is a standby overseer, whose main task is to monitor the pool, its access and to ensure the safety of customers, and it is distinguished by the extensive clothing of other employees.
Such pool supervisors shall have radio stations at which to contact the administration and registry immediately, answer their requests or call for assistance.
Four times a year staff training in the context of the security programme is in place - much more often than required by law.
At the time, workers shall develop theoretical and practical knowledge, learn how to act in case of a disaster, monitor whether the personnel is properly guided by the rules of procedure and internal order.

No personal money will be returned to Eligijus Masiul during the search
On Tuesday, the Court of Appeal declared that it rejected the claim of the lawyer accused.
The order is final and uncontested.
In the case of political corruption, Mr Masiulis, former head of the Liberal Movement, appealed to the Appeal Court asking him to pay him any personal money - the money taken from him and the spouse's wallets in search.
In total, more than 242 thousand euros were taken from E. Massul.
These allowances shall be subject to a temporary restriction on the right of ownership and shall be renewable on an ongoing basis.
The last time it was extended by Vilnius Regional Court on 15 October.
Mr Masiulis asked the Court of Appeal for a refund of all the money - he wants to get the 800 euros taken from his spouse's purse and his wallet - 690 euros, 130 pounds, 1600 US dollars.
Former politicians say that the latter money was devoted to the US planned travel.
The lawyer of E. Masiulis Mindaugas Blivs asked for this money back at the Court of Appeal on Monday because the spouses worked well-paid jobs and had the opportunity to have such amounts.
Prosecutor Just Laucius requested that the complaint be rejected by the court.
"The legal and legitimate order of the Vilnius Regional Court does not restrict any more of the property claimed.
The Court has rightly held that it constitutes the foundation for the confiscation of property, as well as for the confiscation of the expanded property," said Mr Laucius.
On 15 October the Vilnius Regional Court decided not to return more than 242 thousand euros to the accused of political corruption case E. Masiulis.
This money is found too hard to blame for corruption in the home of a former politician and in the car.
The Chamber of three Judges stated that it was clear from the file that property rights were restricted only to funds which constitute the subject matter of criminal offences indicted Mr Masiulis.
"Taking into account the extent of the restriction, it must be concluded that the right of ownership of the accused is not subject to restrictions disproportionately or too long," states the resolution of the judges Nijolė Žimkikienė, Jurgita Kolyčienė and Fire Trumpulis.
The judges noted that in the case E. Masiulis was accused of committing serious crimes, the criminal proceedings are large and complex, and therefore, in order to ensure the possible confiscation of property and the extended confiscation of property, it is necessary to extend the provisional limitation period for the accused’s property.
Prosecutors say that former Vice President of MG Baltic Group Raimondas Kurlianskis gave a bribe of EUR 106 thousand to E. Masiulis for taking decisions beneficial to the Group in the Seimas.
Both defendants believe that the money to Mrs Masiulis was EUR 90 thousand - was a loan from Mr Kurlianski.
According to the case, the search was EUR 242.4 thousand, EUR 130 of UK pounds and USD 1.6 thousand.
Mr Masiulis and his lawyer have repeatedly tried to recover money, but the courts have rejected their requests.
Former politicians have said that some of these funds belong to other persons and were intended to invest in real estate or are family money.
It also claimed that there was no evidence that funds would be obtained in a criminal way.
In the past, the Court of Appeal has stated that the charges against Ms Masiul show that these funds could have been obtained by accepting a bribe of more than EUR 100 000.
According to law, the remaining cash taken through a search could be derived from unidentified sources of income, not declared, not certified documents, and perhaps no legal income.
In the case of political corruption, charges were submitted to three legal persons - Labour Party, Liberals Movement, MG Baltic Group.
In addition to E. Masiulis, in the case charges were lodged with former "worker" Vytautas Gapši, former Parliamentary Liberalas Šarūnas Gustavis, Seimas Member Gintaras Steponavičius and former MG Baltic Vice President R. Kurlianski.
Mr Kurlianskis is accused of giving bribes to former Parliamentaries E. Masiulis, Š. Gustainis and V. Gapšiai.
The Americans captured dangerous Russian fighter manoeuvres
During the 25 minutes of taking over, according to the U.S. Navy, the Russian SU-27 rushed straight through the plane.
The Russian plane slipped through him for a second time, using the acceleration of the traction, and made a turning point.
Passengers reported that they felt a feeling of being at the time of first and second arrivals.
The Russian army has the right to exercise in international airspace, but this interaction was irresponsible.
We look forward to international standards that ensure safety and prevent incidents that are in line with behaviour, including the 1972 Agreement on Incidents at and above the Sea Prevention (INCSEA) - said the US naval forces in their report.
"Insecure actions increase the risk of miscalculation and possible collisions", notes the report.
The Russian Ministry of Defence recognised the incident, but believed that the Russian SU-27 had maintained a "secure distance" from the American aircraft.
Parents' costs are not being reduced further: only up to €50 per month are being paid for class activities.
According to the survey of the market and the public opinion survey company Baltijos Research, a survey conducted at the end of August revealed that a third (32%) of parents spent less than EUR 100 before school this year on "buying" their single school-age child, a fifth (21%) spent between 101 and 150 euros, three of ten (29%) from 151 to 200 euros, and a little less than one fifth (18%) spent more than 200 euros on preparing one of their child for school at the end of summer.
Parents whose children began to go to the first class this year spent an average of EUR 220 on their child’s school bag, while other parents whose children have already completed the first class have set a lower amount of approximately EUR 160 on average for their child’s training.
However, costs are not being reduced, as the school year is on the rise, as parents often have to porpoise their child cages and corepetitors.
Depending on the nature of the activity, the price of one unit in the country may vary from 20 to 100 euros.
Parents who have school - age children were asked to tell them what average monthly they are planning to spend on their single child’s subscribing employment.
A quarter (23%) of the children surveyed planned to spend up to 20 euros per month for post-school activities, a further quarter (26%) said they paid up to 50 euros, three out of ten (31%) allocated between 50 and 100 euros per month for orphanage, and a sixth (17%).
It is true that in Lithuania, children of school age receive an informal children's educational cart, which amounts to 15 euros per month.
However, this money can only be used for one group, and if the cost of the activity is higher, the difference must be borne by the parents.
If a child is visiting several groups or is raised in a family by a few children of school age, the cost of post - school activities can double.
According to Justina Ambrasienė, marketing director of consumer loan company "Vivus.lt", savings for children's families with low or average income, especially when several children grow up in the family, can be a challenge.
At the beginning of the school year, parents turned their heads to obtain money for exercise, office supplies, or new sports clothing.
The main concern now is how to take children after school without spending a bunch of money.
We note that parental expenditure increases particularly in August when it is necessary to prepare properly for the new school year, but later on it remains higher than during the summer period, as parents tend to invest in their return employment.
Often, when they lack funds and take their possibilities seriously, they are determined to borrow," says J.Ambrasienė.

Kaunass are delighted by the fourth troelebus that has already been printed
Today, the fourth exhibition of the mobile street Atia oldos, good news has been exhibited in Kaunas streets, and the old troelebus has been printed in the inscription "The Inscriptions of the syenograph".
The city municipality of Kaunas has reported on a new fun troelebus.
"This old lady "Skoda" also changed her own watery green color into a much more colorful and brighter clothing.
It is also a participant of the exhibition "At the old age, good news!" and - representatives of the municipality write to the photographs introduced.
Mobile street art exhibition "At the old age, good news" is about to say goodbye to the old trolleybus, which will be replaced by new ones next year.
Already next year, the old "Skoda" trolleybuses will be used by 85 new-end and modern "Solaris" trolleybuses.
The portal reminds us that the trolebus to Kaunas streets was the first to be printed in street drawings a month ago.
Several well-known artists of Kaunas Street art are shown on the trolleybus – the Old Town’s pipe and the elephant.
Within a week after the first performance to Kaunas streets, the second creation of street artist Timomtyeus Norvila - Morfas was developed.
A fun yellow car is shown on the trolleybus, which is often called just "vabalu".
"You wanted to get a trolley bus in.
This picture looks very fun, especially because it also fits the trolleybus wheels.
When the wheels turn around, it seems to be part of that car.
When we painted the wheels white, we made them a retro style, so the combination was very frustrating.
Until the tires of the trolleybus had been painted, it really didn't look so charming", – earlier told the portal Kaunas.diena.lt an artist of the street.
On October 27, on the third trolleybus, a large drawing was laid down.
It is imprinted with white, yellow, orange, brown, but mostly blue.
This color is dominant.
On the left side of the trolleybus body one K.Donelaičio street house is represented, and the central mail is on the right side.
"Vabalas" was my favorite for me so far," he said, "for Morfas, he took up the third trolebus, who made it clear to Morphas.
Buy new
"Kauno diena" reminds that last week Kaunas Company controlled public transport Kaunas buses signed a 29,4 million agreement with Solis Bus & Coach S.A Polish company stating that Kaunas will buy 85 new trolleybuses.
" Kaunas invests the largest amount of public transport for the renewal of public transport throughout its history.
This agreement will allow all of us to replace old Skoda brands with trolleybuses for many years and offer the most comfortable service for passengers.
New low-based modern trolleybuses will have more seating, effective cabin conditioning and heating, high-quality information systems, video surveillance cameras and ergonomic driver's workplace.
New machines and parallel network renewal and street repair will allow trolleybuses to drive more reliably, much faster.
And, of course, the troelebus of modern design is a great gift to the city," said Mindaugas Grigel, CEO of Kauno minibusi.
The first trollibuses will reach Kaunas in August of next year, and all old trollibuses will be replaced by December.
Christmas Age: Queen Elizabeth II invited M. Markle's mother to celebrate together
Hercogiene Meghan hung the royal palace of the British.
This is demonstrated by the special gesture of Queen Elizabeth II: The British Monarch Christmas invited the mother of the Sasex Duke, Doria Ragland, and the British media to her Sandringam palace.
Even the parents of Duke Kate have not received such honor.
In the case of Carol and Michael Middleton, parents and other members of her family have until now only been invited to the traditional Christmas service with the royal family.
The unnamed source for the newspaper Sunday Express revealed that the invitation to Dory Raglabd is a sign of "caralien respect Meghan".
Dory was at the royal wedding in May to beat the queen with "his peace".
The invitation to together celebrate Christmas, and also raised talks that Ragland was planning a longer stay in Great Britain.
It is a question that she wants to help her daughter before and after childbirth.
Meghan and her husband, Prince Harry, should be the first to be born in spring 2019.
The exhibition Women's World will re-hearse in Žalgiris Arena
After the autumn routine and the more important weather, the exhibition "Womens World" is already held for the 16th time – women are declaring the long weekend, because even four days' hottest news of fashion, style and beauty is already available here – on 8-11 November, in Kaunas Žalgiris Arena.
Over the years, the exhibition shows how the face of the event changes, it means not just an ordinary shopping cart, but a tradition of giving time to yourself.
Often it becomes a place for friends to meet and a reason to spend a day with a sister or a mother.
Four days of the exhibition have a special power – each woman here can learn the secrets of charm, learn the tricks how to look bright every day, find indispensable products, hear or try various procedures that hinder the aging process.
All this and more, will promise as many as 415 exhibitors who will wait for visitors on all three floors of the Arena.
Three days will be held workshops on beauty and health topics, and on Sunday the songless sex representatives will be able to hear advice to create an exclusive image of the stylist and blogger Viktorija Šaulytė's lips.
A large proportion of women in business are confronted with marginal situations where stress causes them to interfere with a stable emotional and physical state.
For this reason, Kaunas Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Crafts and the Business Women's Network operating there were born the idea of holding a conference "Versli and Happy". Without stress, where discussions and practical examples will encourage you to help yourself in situations of stress and encourage you to look at your life more creatively.
Like every year, I see events dedicated to beauty masters.
The exhibition's long-term partners, the Association of Hairdressing and Beauty Professionals, will provide the opportunity to learn two days of the subtleties of hair painting and modelling from the charismatic duo of the International Academy "Vinokurov & friends" - S. Maslov and R. Sakalauskas.
For those seeking further improvement will wait for the bride creation competition and for the mastery battle of Art Battle, which will not leave indifferent.
As if the cherry on the tower will become a sacred festival of representatives of the beauty world "With birthday, Lithuania", where it will be possible to see a show never before - from body painting to dance.
Another tradition of "Womens World" will not be forgotten, as will the presentation of the latest collections of designers on Friday "Made and beauty show", where the most stylish will be selected.
The handicraftsmen will be welcome in "Dekostudios" creative workshop where they will be able to create original furniture for the interior or to create gifts more interestingly.
On the final day of the exhibition, all the longings are especially welcome, because traditionally visitors will be happy with the competition "LONG-HAIRED WORLD 2018", where new record of the longest cash register will be recorded each year.
Prime Minister: the teachers' salary has risen by 117 euros after the introduction of the basic payment
Since September, the average wage of full-time teachers of the country has increased by 117 euros, according to Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis.
"It's early to say how much it (new order - BNS) has advantages or disadvantages.
The fact is that those people who have a full workload - their wages increased by more than 117 euros on average", Skuvernelis said to journalists at the Government on Monday.
He called the Lithuanian Education Workers' Union (LPGS) plans to carry out the strike on the ethos payment "democratic law", but stressed that the strike should not interfere with the education process.
"In a democrat country, all forms of protest are permissible, possible.
If you think you need a strike, that's the right of their self-determination.
Once again, children, students, would not want to suffer in this area.
If there is a strike, it must be done in accordance with the laws in force," said Mr Skvernelis.
In June, the Seimas confirmed the model of teachers' pay and has been introduced in stages since September.
The hourly payout was replaced by 1512 hours a year.
The teacher’s working time is divided into three parts: contact hours, i.e. lessons, preparation and work for the community.
This reform, led by Andrius Navickas, calls the trade union absurd, angry that it adopts the 'buldozer' principle and announces the launch of an indefinite strike on 12 November.
The LRUPD requires immediate withdrawal of this "minimum" wage system and the introduction of an ethical model, which would have a minimum of 18 contact hours for one single application.
It is also about increasing the constant share rates of official salaries by 20% and reducing the number of children in the classes.
Among the innovations, the introduction of a new methodology for allocating training funds is criticised, as trade unions do not have enough funds to teach home, divide classes into groups, qualifications, education aid, and class in large cities, as they have been.
The Ministry of Education and Science has stated that the routine payment of teachers’ work will help to adjust the workload of teachers’ work and to compensate for all their work for the school community.
It is envisaged that the teaching institution will be able to cover up to half of the total number of hours a year for the community, and up to 40% of the total number of hours for the first two years of work.
The teacher working time is set at 36 hours per week, of which no more than 24 contacts per week for compulsory teaching.
About one hundred general education schools, kindergartens and non-formal education institutions contributed two hours of strike initiated by LSDPS in May.
A total of about 53 thousand educators are located in Lithuania.
Calling for preparation: The crisis can be expected within 2-3 years
The slowdown in economic growth and even the crisis can be expected in the next 2-3 years, but both the Bank of Lithuania and the government of the country are much more prepared for these processes than a decade ago, "The position of Verslo" interview, said Vitas Vasiliauskas, Chairman of the Board of the Bank of Lithuania.
"To say that the crisis - already behind the corner, I could certainly not, but the signs of the economic slowdown are certainly there.
This year our country's economy was growing by more than 3 percent, and next year we are planning to grow by 2.8 percent.
The key message I would like to send to society and business is to be prepared for everything," Mr Vasiliauskas said.
He believes that there is no uniform crisis, and therefore they need to be prepared differently.
The difference between the decade before the crisis is that, at that time, the government thought that the revenues generated by the growing economy would be forever, and that costs were projected.
As a result, when the crisis broke out in 2008, we had to cut our costs dramatically.
Now, according to Mr Vassiliou, the situation is different, and the crisis is better prepared.
"It is true that the situation of the Bank of Lithuania and the Ministry of Finance differ.
We believe that we are already beyond our potential and that the brakes are needed.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Finance does not think so," the Chairman of the Board of the Bank of Lithuania said.
The preparations of the institutions of the country for the coming crisis Mr Vasiliauskas appreciates 7 out of 10 points.
According to him, such a small and open economy as Lithuania has a significant impact on external factors.
The current push of the great elephants - the US, China, the European Union - will undoubtedly touch us.
We must therefore be very careful.
When the economy is small, we can, but I do not believe it, say Vasiliauskas.
What can we expect for those who have taken large loans in the future?
According to Mr Vasimauskas, the European Central Bank has clearly drawn up a short-term strategy, and decisions on interest developments can be expected not earlier than in the summer of next year: "At present, the main goal is to try to manage expectations".
The trend, which is most worrying to the head of the Bank of Lithuania, is the reduction of working hands in our country.
'The decline in working hands is also a significant factor in the decline in the competitiveness of the economy.
It is also a reduction in the number of breadmakers.
Migration this year allowed me to balance this process a little, but I do not know whether this is a long-term trend," Mr Vasiliauskas said.
ELTA recalls that the Bank of Lithuania and the Ministry of Finance predict that the country's economy will grow by 3.4% this year, next year by 2.8 percent.
The Swedish Conservative Leader will again try to shape the government
Sweden, which has been at the political stalemate for two months after the elections, will receive a second chance to form a government, announced on Monday by the President of the Parliament.
The balanced party is owned by the four right-party Alliances of the Centre, which received a slightly less vote than the previous left coalition of the Governing Centre during the 9th elections on September.
Both blocks have been hard to bring together most of them, refusing to agree with the anti-imigration Swedish Democratic Party, whose origins are the Neonazii movement.
The first attempt by Mr Kristersson to form the government on 14 October was unsuccessful.
On 29 October, Prime Minister Stefan Lofven announced his failure and concluded his term of office.
In an attempt to make parties agree, Parliament's President Andreas Norlen said that next week he would propose Mr Kristersson to the parliament as a candidate for Prime Minister, thereby pushing the first vote since the beginning of the government's efforts.
"It is not clear in advance whether the various parties will accept Ulf Kristersson as a Prime Minister," A. Norlen said to journalists.
However, he stressed that 'the process must move forward and the dynamics between parties must change'.
"The negotiations on this bourgeois have to end," he added.
The date of Parliament's vote is still unclear, but Mr Norlen said that 14 November was between possible dates.
In Sweden, the Chairman of Parliament may, four times, instruct a candidate to form a government with which the parliament will meet.
If all four attempts fail, the country must organise new elections.
The current appointment of Mr Kristersson is the third attempt made by Mr Norlen.
Some groups of Christians from the Balanced Party and the Alliance's partners are pushing Mr Kristersson to accept the support of the extreme right-wing Swedish Democratic Party, but he has so far rejected this possibility.
The Swedish Democratic Party, which received 17.6 % of the votes in the elections and is the third largest party, has long ignored all the main political parties.
The ultra-rightening party, which has successfully used the voter's anger about immigration after nearly 400 000 asylum seekers had arrived in the country since 2012, demands an impact on decision-making in exchange for support.
However, the liberals and centralists of the Alliance strongly contradict this idea.
Since 2014, the Swedish Social Democratic Labour Party (SAP) has managed with green and informal left-wing support, while it has enabled cooperation between the blocks, but only if it retains the Prime Minister's post.
The Alliance and the Swedish Democratic Party rejected this opportunity.
The Afghan Government delegation will participate in peace negotiations in Russia
The Office of the Kabul Government will take part in this month's international peace talks on a war of war in Afghanistan, announced by officials on Monday.
The Taliban, in turn, is still considering whether or not to participate.
Russia announced that such a conference would be held in Moscow on 9 November, although the United States is currently trying to establish bilateral negotiations with the Taliban on the end of a 17-year conflict.
The High Peace Council of the Government of Afghanistan, in charge of the reconciliation efforts with the fighters, will send four representatives to the meeting in Moscow, a representative of Sayed Ihsan Taheris, told the news agency AFP.
However, the Afghan Ministry of Foreign Affairs avoided answering whether it would send its delegation to this conference, which will focus on initiating peace negotiations between Kabul and the Taliban.
We are still in agreement with Russian officials, - said representative Sebaghtulah Ahmadi. - We welcome any peace efforts led by Afghans.
Taliban representative Zabiullah Mujahid (Zabiula Mujahid) said that movement is still under consideration.
Moscow also invited representatives from the USA, India, Iran, China, Pakistan and five former Soviet Central Asian Republics.
Pakistan, a long-standing accused of supporting the Taliban of Afghanistan, 'must participate', said the AFP representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Muhamada Faisal.
The U.S. Embassy in Kabul has not yet replied to the request for comment.
Initially, a meeting was planned in Moscow in September, but was postponed on the request of Kabul to lead the process by Afghans.
The negotiations will take place in a sensitive time.
The newly appointed U.S. peace messenger Zalmay Khalilzad (Zalmaj Chalilzad) is trying to convince the Taliban to agree to negotiate the conclusion of the war and is afraid that a multilateral meeting in Russia could undermine these efforts.
One U.S. government supervisory authority reported last week that the government of Kabul has weakened in recent months.
The President of Cuba met with the leader of North Korea in Pyongyang
North Korean leader Kim Chen Unas and Cuban President Miguel Diazas-Canelis, both of whom look forward to the abolition of US economic sanctions, agreed to expand and strengthen their country's strategic relations, announced on Monday by North Korea's state media.
Diaz-Canel, who arrived in Asia on his first international journey after arriving in April, went to Pyongyang on Sunday.
He was met at the airport by Kim Jong Unas; the leaders together entered the city through the crowds who welcomed them.
The North Korean state media reported that the leaders had negotiated in the state guest house Paekhwawon, accentuating the common socialist history of their countries and promising further solidarity.
The official media did not provide much detail but indicated that the negotiating atmosphere was friendly.
The meeting with Kim Jong Unu could be seen as an alert to Washington, whose efforts to make significant progress in the denuclearisation of North Korea are increasingly strong.
Pyongyang, who has recently also sought Moscow's favor with pebbles, has made a tougher rhetoric before this week's US Secretary of State Mike Pompey and North Korea's chief negotiator Kim Yong Cholo in New York.
On weekend, Pyongyang criticised the US through his official media for the irreversible sanctions - a political tool that Washington has also used widely against Cuba and Russia.
North Korea has alluded to further developing the nuclear weapons programme if Washington does not change the course.
Sanctions are an important item on the Diazo-Canel agenda.
Last week, during a visit to Moscow, Mr Diaz-Canelis discussed an arms contract with Russia worth nearly 50 million dollars (EUR 43.8 million) and received a similar promise by Vladimir Putin to expand political, economic and military ties.
The two Presidents then issued a joint statement condemning the US 'an embodiment to the internal affairs of sovereign states'.
The US economic embargo on Cuba, originally introduced in 1958 and subsequently extended, remains in force.
The painful US and European Union sanctions against Russia have been imposed as a result of the annexation of Crimea and support for separatists in Eastern Ukraine.
Diaz-Canel has to leave Pyongyan on Tuesday.
He will also visit China, Vietnam and Laos.
On safety grounds - cars insecure?
On Saturday, she asked the police officers to find out this case of fraud.
According to the Klaipėda, in 2006, the Hyundai Santa Fe car was left to store in the site at the end of September.
She noticed the web site on November 3rd.
It turns out that scams on her vehicle were trying to sell for EUR 3800.
According to the owner, the car could have been stolen.
The vehicle was sold by a man born in 1989.
According to police, a person is not the owner of the site.
A study shall be carried out to investigate the circumstances of the crime.
According to firemen, on Sunday evening, about 22:00, the fire occurred on Banduzus street, on the seventh floor.
Fired one room in the apartment is packed with garbage and a room is located in the sofa.
The owner was removed from the apartment and reviewed by the doctors, reported to the police.
Fired and sandy objects were thrown out of the apartment in the window.
During the fire, he was wearing the seventh high-level wall.
Record: Atonement during 157 days sailed Britain
Britt set out from the sea to the coast of England on Sunday, becoming the first man to sail the Great Britain along the coast.
For 33 years, Ross Edgley (Ross Egils) spent 157 days in water and was over 2,883 miles (2,83 km).
He sailed in six hours, and at night on a ship of his accompanying support team.
The last mile was overcame by a couple of hundreds of fellow swimmers.
He boarded a Margeite in south-east England, where he started his trip on 1 June.
The sportsman, who was going to keep up in 100 days, told his relatives who met him on the shore, "I'm sorry, late."
He said he first felt relieved when he went to the shore.
"I was very worried that my leg wouldn't withstand," said the Athlet.
The World's Open Waters Association indicated that Mr Edgley had repeatedly suffered from exceptionally unfavourable weather conditions during this endurance test, which was supported by the producer of Red Bull for energy drinks, and that the bottom was even 37 times prolonged by jellyfish.
The organizers announce that Edgley has twice improved the record of the longest sailing with breaks in the seas, which has so far been 73 days.
It also reached a new record, probably overcoming the distance between the southernmost and northern points of Britain - the Lands End bribe and John O'Grouts.
This distance was over 62 days.
Clebonish forest secrets: One suspect has already been detained
It was a scary finding of a passerby, because the killed was badly buried.
Only in such circumstances was this crime known because the victim of the murderers had no family members and his disappearance was not reported.
He was not the earliest of his early years.
Like suspects of his murder.
One of them was allowed to be arrested for three months by Kaunas District Court last week.
The second, who is suspected of fleeing abroad, where he is secreted from another crime, is still being sought.
Until he is found, lawmakers are more inclined to comment on the circumstances of this crime.
I. Valinskienė: I would agree with my children a lot of things
In the opera "Love and Death in Verona" the most prominent performers of the country appear to be expanding.
The team joins Inga Valinskienė, who is entrusted with one of the most important roles of the work: a woman will play Juliet's nurse.
Povilas Mešola also became an important part of the team, who will take care of the artist singing.
"I think that many and very beautiful stories have been created since Shakespeare's time, but "Romeo and Juliet", will probably always remain the symbol of these stories and will be built on various scenes for a long time.
It will be interesting to be part of one such presentation," said I. Valinskienė.
Although a woman of course is well known on stage, she has created several roles in various performances or musicals, and nurses have not yet experienced her.
"The time to play Juliet has already passed," said I. Valinskienė.
- I would probably like to accept such a proposal in my own time."
True, the training character in the drama of Shakespeare is no less important, some critics are even regarded as the most important.
The gold is not only an intermediary, a helper - its way and its tone of speaking, the female attitude towards feelings, and the resulting solidarity with the lovers give more colour to the plot.
She also had an important education because she was one of just two women in the drama "Rome and Jjulietta".
"The character of the neck is not very close to my way and style, but sometimes it's just more interesting.
To create a different character than you own - a heavy part of the creative process.
So far I do not know what the final result will be, because it will depend not only on me, but also on the interpretation of the director, - says Mr Valinskienė and reveals that being in the place of Juliet's discipline is likely to do the same.
- I think she listened to her heart.
Most women do so.
I'd probably do that."
The legendary opera "Love and Death in Verona" by Kęstutis Antonio rock is created by the famous drama "Rome and Julieta".
A work based on real facts tells the story of the tragic end of the love of two youths - Romeo and Juliet.
The sad end of history is due to the uncertainty of where the conflict exists between young people's families - Montecs and Capulians.
"All times all history is possible.
Parents who were against children's choice have always been and will be.
Only today's solutions to these problems are more varied - it is asked whether Romeo and Juliet's history could be repeated today, says future teacher I. Valinskienė.
In my own name, I would like to deal with many things in my children's lives, including with the brides."
The main role played by actor and director Ramūnas Cicėnas in the rock opera - Romeo and Juliet - Ieva Zasimakaitė and Justinas Jarutis will perform on the stage as well Vidas Bareitis, Kęstutis Cicėnas, Mindaugas Pālēlis, Marius Jampolskis, Paul Šinkūnas and Aidas Barkauskas.
The latest performance of the rock opera "Love and Death in Verona" will be presented to the audience by the end of December.
On December 28, the first new colour-catching legendary piece will be developed by the viewers of Vilnius Siemens Arena.
The day later, on December 29th, the rock opera will be shown in Klaipeda "Svyturo" arena.
E. Jankauskas announced with which football players to complete the League of Nations tournament
The Lithuanian football team coach Edgars Jankauskas announced the composition of the national team for the UEFA League matches with Romania and Serbia on November 17 and 20.

After three years, Grat Sirged returns to the team for 23 years.
In the national team, Mr Sirgėds debuted at age 18 after the successful 2013 European U-19 Championship.
At the European Youth Championship in Lithuania, G.Sirgėds won 3 goals and became the most effective champion and was elected to the symbolic team of the championship.
However, later on, the career of a prospective footballer was halted by the trauma.
After a two-year call, Mark Beneta, another representative of Kauno Žalgiris, received an invitation to the team.
The scary comes back due to injuries in the match of the League of the United Nations in October with Egidijus Vaitkūnas and Edvinas Gardvainis, who spent with Romania and Montenegro.
"We'll try to get the first points in the UN league, although we're waiting for a very tough biker in the squares.
At home, we lost a minimum difference both for the Serbs and the Romanians.
There was also a lack of success.
We hope we can get back to our guests.
While it is crucial for competitors to fight for the first place in the group and the opportunity to continue fighting for the road to the European Championship," said Lithuanian team coach E.Jankauskas.
Before the end of the two rounds of UN league groups, the group of Division C 4 is fighting very persistently.

"Skamp" presents a song which has already refused to show one video on TV
This year, the Skamp Group started to create music.
After announcing the only anniversary concert "Skamp20" which will take place on 26 December in Vilnius Siemens Arena, three of course presents new works one by one.
This time - it's Love Me Like There's No Tomorrow and a bold song video.
"This work is about love, so I thought that the clip should also capture all types of relationships, regardless of age or sexual orientation," - the idea of a new song and video reveals Erika Jennings, who is convinced that any expression of homophobia in 2018 is not normal.
The new song "Love Me Like There's No Tomorrow" has been filmed in a video in ten different orientations and age pairs: "We have always supported LGBTQIA communities and believe that one day we will no longer have to discuss it," says Viktor Diawara, who created the music of his work at the beginning of the year during his family holiday in Israel.
It is true that this video has already given rise to negative reactions - it is not willing to show one of the most popular shows in the country.
This tells us a lot about our society.
Television will not show the clip because it kisses people and it is not a good content for children.
And the fact that any day-on-day television can be applied to the battles shown on the screen and the other examples of violence are the right content?" - asks Mrs Jennings in rhetoric.
The Erics also point to Will Alessius: "You would like to see more hand-circumcised and kissing people around, regardless of their social status, gender or age.
We raise children and want them to grow in an environment where there is as much tolerance and as little swelling as possible.
We want to make the new song and video at least slightly transparent on the day of our listeners and give them a smile."
The group "Skamp" has since 1998 been known for bold texts of songs that have spoken on unpopular or sensitive topics.
All the group's best songs – old and new – will sound loudly and widely at the Skamp20 concert already on 26 December in Vilnius Siemens Arena.
All are welcomed with their families, and children under 10 are free of charge.

A few minutes later, in the version of the portal kauna.dien.lt, readers received information about police and ambulance crews traveling towards Kaunas clinics.
The reasons for this movement became apparent.

Presidency: LRT is not ownership of politicians
When the Seimas intends to return to discussion of the conclusions of the Commission that has examined the functioning of the LRT, the Presidency is afraid that the governing body simply seeks to gain more political control of the public broadcaster.
"The public broadcaster is not the property of politicians, and the fundamental principle is that independence from politicians is maintained," said President's Adviser, Mindaugas Linge.
However, he has emphasised that the counselor is now in a position to see the opposite process.
"It is possible to see that those (political. - ELTA) influences want to have more.
This is something we appreciate quite critically," said Mr Linge.
According to him, the proposals of the LRT Commission operating in the Seimas are a question of questioning and dubious legitimacy, because it is peace to the independence of the broadcaster.
Although, Mr Linge emphasised, there is a need to improve the governance of LRTs, this should be done on the basis of expert support and in search of specific aspects that hinder LRT’s smooth operation.
He stressed that international institutions already stressed that LRT should be supervised not by political authorities but by competent authorities.
On Tuesday, the Seimas intends to take a decision on the conclusions of the commission that has examined the functioning of the LRT.
This conclusion has been criticised.
Very sceptical proposals to change the governance of the LRT are to reduce the powers of the Council and the terms of reference of its members with the term of office of the designating authorities.
In this context, concerns were raised by the European Broadcasting Union.
In January, the opposition group of Seimas Members appealed to the Constitutional Court on whether the activities and finances of the LRT were not in conflict with the Constitution.
For those working abroad - good news from Mr Karbauskas
The Seimas started to discuss the amendment of the Law on Declaration of Residence of Ramūnas Karbauskas, the elder of the Group of Lithuanian Peasants and Green Union, whereby citizens working and paying taxes outside Lithuania would be exempt from the compulsory payment of health insurance contributions.
After submitting the draft on Tuesday was supported by 56 Seimas Members, before it was 9 and 25 Parliamentaries were detained.
After discussion in committees, the draft is planned to be discussed in the Seimas Plenary sitting on 6 December. The Seimas also decided to request the Government's conclusions.
According to the proposed project, persons who pay social insurance contributions in the Member States of the European Union, the States of the European Economic Area or the Swiss Confederation, by decision of an institution of the State Social Insurance Fund, shall be exempt from the payment of compulsory health insurance contributions in the Republic of Lithuania.
Residents and working outside Lithuania, according to the data submitted and validated by the Board of the State Social Insurance Fund ("Sodra") and the State Tax Inspectorate, would be considered to have left Lithuania.
It is about services that people do not use.
There is an additional possibility to fix the fact that a person has left the country," R.Krauskis explained from the Troika of the Seimas.
Such proposed legal regulation, in the opinion of the conservative Seimas Member, would be unfair to citizens living in Lithuania and paying taxes.
"Part of Lithuanians living abroad abuse it," A. Matulas noted.
Social Democrat Algirdas Syss believes that in this way we call on citizens to remain under the obligation.
In its view, it would create preconditions for smart people to use the health system free of charge.
Once the proposed amendments to the law have been adopted, the persons who move to other countries pay social security contributions, no accrued debts and the burden of managing the debts of Sodra will be alleviated.
Currently, Lithuanian citizens who have actually left Lithuania, but have not declared their residence in accordance with the procedure laid down by legal acts, are charged monthly with compulsory health insurance (PSD) contributions and, if they are not paid, accrued debt.
A. Dunonesta has been convicted of fraud, but has been convicted of counterfeiting
The Vilnius Regional Court has left the sentence for trying to fraud a former famous sportsman Alvydas Dunneda, but it has been judged for the counterfeiting of documents.
The Verdict, published on Monday, came into force immediately.
A. Doonëla has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment for a period of one and a half years and is sentenced to imprisonment for a term of up to four years.
This year, the Vilnius City District Court sentenced the multiple champion of Lithuanian scarfs' rowing.
He was sentenced to one and a half years' imprisonment.
The Vilnius Regional Court, which examined the case on the basis of the conviction, removed one accusation, but the sentence remained the same.
The former sportsman will also have to pay almost EUR 760 to the Fund for Victims.
The prosecutor's office, A.Dunēl, has accused him of falsifying a draft in 2013 by which he lent LTL 200 thousand (about 58 euros) to his wife, Dalecija, a dentist's office.
The spouse only learned about this in December 2016, when he received calls to pay the debt.
A former spouse said he had never borrowed money from a man for clinical purposes and had not signed a draft.
According to the conviction of the judges of Vilnius Regional Court there is no objective data in the case proving that it is A. Duonėla who has recorded data which do not correspond to reality that it is the loan of UAB "Dalecija" A. Doonėlai 200 thousand Litas.
It is acceptable to accept the arguments put forward by the sentenced person and his defender in the complaint, that there is no objective evidence in the case to support this.
Having thus found that A. Duonėla has only used a fake document for fraud and has recognised that this attribute - the use of a forged document - is part of a component of fraud (in the case in question - fraud), A. Duonėla has been verified in accordance with Article 300(1) of the Criminal Code without proof of his involvement in the commission of a criminal offence", says the ruling of Vilnius Regional Court.
Fireclays led earth-earned kittens - he heard a dim for three days.
As reported by the Fire Rescue Board of Kaunas County, it was reported that a cat buried after changing the thermal pipelines was killed for three days.
When firemen arrived, they also heard a cat's crippling.
It was found that a few days ago, thermal track repairs were carried out here.
It is possible that when the track was buried, the sky could have closed the earth to two Cats.
The firefighters buried the heat - track covering at a depth of about a year and a half, killing the cavity for cats to emerge.
The son of Antonino Scalia states that his father's unobservable liberal protests on the Kavanaugh
The son of the judge of the Verelio Supreme Court, Antonino Scalia, told the agency Fox News on Sunday that his father would not notice his extreme forces protest against the nominated judge Brett Kavanaugh because it felt that the Supreme Court was too involved in the affairs of the modern world.
“In general terms, his unobservable noise as a result of the nomination to the Supreme Court, because many are referring to the Roe v Wade case – at least the left-wing one,” said Christopher Scalia, reminding of the famous 1973 case, after which the constitutional right of women to abortion was established during certain trimesters.
In Roe, one way of abolishing the right of all states to regulate abortion themselves and some states, in response to this decision, immediately tried to restrict their right to abortion.
"My father often said that in Roe v Wade and other cases, the court actually tried to solve cultural problems, although they had to be dealt with during the elections and the legislative process," he added in the show "Fox & Friends".
"In the run-up to speed up the proceedings, the Supreme Court has further harmed, so nominations to the Supreme Court and disputes regarding approval give rise to a more severe reaction, because judges take up a role belonging to legislators."
The Nebraska senator republican Ben Sasse expressed a similar opinion at this month's meeting regarding the approval of the Kavanaugh, repeating that Congress often gives excessive power to executive authorities, which are largely not accountable to anyone, and that the resulting bureaucratic issues are left to the Supreme Court, and therefore judges must take up work which the senators refuse.
According to the Office of the SRSG on Children and Armed Conflict, he was responsible for recruitment and use of children and adolescents.
When asked whether Kavanaugh could avoid a negative reaction to the alleged sexual abuse he had committed decades ago, Scalia said that it would probably not be possible to avoid noise.
In response to statements that Kavanaugh should not hold office at the Supreme Court, because on Thursday, during the senators' poll, Scalia questioned the fact that all judges are peaceful character.
"Judges often get angry," said Scalia about the evil disagreements that sometimes arise in controversial cases.
“It is true that Judge Kavanaugh probably responded more aggressively, but that was different circumstances.
He tried to defend his good name from unprovoked accusations."
On Thursday, in the Senate's Committee on Judicial Affairs, a majority of votes (11 v 10) were allowed to take part in the entire Senate vote.
In a dramatic moment, Arizona Republican senator Jeff Flake announced that he would give his decisive vote to Kavanaugh only if the FBI was given a week to investigate the abuse of the current alleged accusations against Kavanaugh.
The investigation is still ongoing and President Trump said that the agency has a broad mandate and that it can question what it has just wanted.
“Schiaparelli” collection of ready-to-wear clothing – fantastic trim
Is it possible to embody surrealism?
Schiaparelli tried to answer this question.
The Paris Fashion House, which was founded almost a hundred years ago by Elsa Schiaparelli, presented its first collection of ready-made clothing and handbags.
This collection is almost as incredible as the famous boot-form hat of Elsa Schiaparelli turned around to wear a brand that is ready for clothes.
The eccentrical image of a fashion home that has long developed this time proved to be very modern.
In aesthetic solutions you will find your senses, lobsters, hearts, and eyes.
Schiaparelli created his first collective in 1930 and was the first designer whose models marched with music.
She and her friend El Salvador Dali were thinking about reconciling art and fashion, and now this idea was taken over by Calvin Clein and Rafa Simons, in collaboration with U.S. artist Sterling Ruby.
The Slando legend that Dali and Schiaparelli, together with the evening dress created by the lobster motifs, wanted to throw out a real mayonese, but they did not have the approval.

"We wanted to return to the idea of cooperation, which is inseparable from the history of Schiaparelli," said Bertrand Guyon, a creative director of the house of fashion in Vandom Square for the last three years.
When creating a collection of ready-made clothing, he used Schiaparelli's friendship with Manu Ray and, in cooperation with My Ray's Foundation, made clothes according to well-known works of art.
The picture of the famous artist's close-to-view "Stiklė tears" is shown on T-shirts exposed to "Perspex" tears and red lips from "Observatorium Time: Inspiratorys" on a true silhouette dress with collage.

One of the strangeities of Elsa was a suspicious desire to the letter S. Her branded color – "Shouldering Rosary" inspired her perfume "Shouring".
The first hand of Guyon's "Schiaparelli" with a keyhole is called "Passty" on the button.
Her retail price will also be fantastic – 5000 pounds.
A temporary store was opened yesterday in the left-hand store, showing the surrealist half of the Paris Fashion Week and buying Virgil Abloho's carpets from the soon-to-veal Ikea collection.
Half an hour before opening, more than 500 young Abloho fans were in a row on the beach, eager to buy one of his works at more favourable prices than his male clothing for Louis Vuitton.
This project helps Ablohui reach a wider audience than the one with luxury fashion and designer furniture.
“No one has any ownership anymore, but knowledge of a particular chair can help you to have a conversation at the dinner table.
This is what he thought for a thousand years," he recently said.
The audience gathered in the Maris district realized that the event in the garage would not be normal when models began to ride through onboards.
The collection of free colorful men and women’s cloaks by the Westwood man designer Andreas Kronthaler was based on portraits of Jessica Fulford-Dobson Kabul skaters.
Some women (and some men) who have swelled the sandals with upper heels went on skateboards, but they walked on their own bypassing heights.
Westwood, having watched the performance in the first row and wearing a collection dress with a horse's motifs and an orange bellowed he last bowed to his husband, who gave her a bouquet of flowers.
Strong twin connection in photos
Peter Zelewski, born in Detroit in London, was already established as a street photographer when four years ago he started taking a picture of twins.
“I, as a portrait photographer and a person, always admired twins and their extraordinary connection, which everyone speaks of,” he says.
The photographer did not plan to create the whole project, but, according to him, “after photographing the portrait of the first twins, I gained my dependence and left the way back.”
The soon coming book of Zelewskis "Duveni" will print 44 identical twin pairs of photos and stories.
The project is more visual, he says: “It is not a documentary or a scientific project – I wanted to take pictures of the affected and emotional portraits of people.”
The nurses expressed their confidence in the trade union negotiating wages
Members of the Royal College of Care, dissatisfied with the trade union agreement with the National Health Service for salaries, declared after the vote the distrust of the Union and accused it of the demands of an increase in remuneration which had been expected.
This unprecedented decision was taken after a lengthy discussion at the Royal College of Care, when his former Secretary-General, Janeta Davies, acknowledged that his salaries would immediately increase by 3% this year, with the abolition of the 1% limit.
In the absence of the expected salary rise, members were angry and forced Davies to leave office, then petitioned and, on Friday, held an urgent meeting in Birmingham, after which they expressed their confidence in the college council.
“The honest and open debate in Birmingham helped to clarify the relationship, so the college will only strengthen”, said Maria Trewern, director of Royal Care College.
“The vote is clear and the council of the Royal Care College and the authorities understood the message they sent to her.
In recent weeks, the Council has already sought changes in the organisation and has tried to listen to and include Members; we will continue our efforts to do so."
The meeting will be held next week and members of the college of Royal Care are expected to withdraw.
"Services are based on trust," said the nurse of the National Health Service, "Guardian.
“The actions of the Royal College of Care have destroyed confidence in it, and the Board must therefore withdraw.
I hope that she will be honest and listen to the request.
I wonder if the members of other trade unions will also seek restructuring."
State Officer of the General Trade Union at the National Health Service Rachel Harrison said in August “Guardian”: “When the employees of the National Health Service realized that they had not received the expected resurrection.
It was angry with them."
Before the unusual meeting, the Royal College of Care recognised that it was wrong to make mistakes in the remuneration negotiations in 2018 and had misinformed about them.
It is also said, however, that the Royal College of Care campaign to abolish pay restrictions has forced the government to abandon this restriction and promise to gradually increase wages by 6,5 % over the three years.
The vote took place after an independent study, which found that college tended to go down the negotiations and Davies was accused of not having carefully assessed the transaction.
It is claimed that the Royal College of Care provided information which was not in line with the facts and therefore members could not reach a reasonable solution to the transaction and did not consider alternatives.
The college announced contradictory information as to whether all employees would receive an increase of 3%.
The short report before the college assembly was wrong to say that "an increase and increase of 3% in the implementation of the reform was planned".
Indeed, wages should have been gradually raised to 3%, and only some of the top earners would have been able to get up straight away.
"Almost all information on the implementation of the transaction provided to members after the meeting was erroneous (most importantly because it was tried to simplify it)", said a representative of the Election Reform Service who conducted the investigation.
"In the opinion of the EESC, the differences between the existing system and the proposed transaction were not understood and explained briefly to the decision-making parties, and the main advantages, including the 6,5 and 29% calculations, mentioned during the campaign were not clearly identified, and therefore it was not possible to adopt a reasoned decision."
The decision to express a lack of confidence was supported by 78% of the votes cast and 3.7% of the members of the Royal College of Care took part in the vote.
Lindsay Lohan shocked the viewers of Instagram's live broadcast by trying to "robot" children from the family
Lindsay Lohan has been criticised for the direct broadcast of Instagram, through which she followed the homeless family on the street and tried to separate her son from his parents.
At the beginning, the actor proposed to provide accommodation for the family, but the situation quickly became complicated.
“Good for everyone! I want to show what family I met,” she said to the audience, – refugees from Syria, I am very concerned about them.
They really need help.
Do you want to come with me?
Come on, I'll take care of you," she said to the family before she turned to one of the children: "Would you like to stay in the hotel?
To watch the movies?
It would be fun to watch a movie on TV or computer."
When Fathers refused, Lohan reacted hostilely.
“Your children should not be on the street, you should work hard and do everything for them to improve their lives.
“If someone offers them a home and a place for the night, as I am now, you should agree.
They'll come back to you.
I'm not going anywhere without you.
Now I know who you are.
Don't laugh with me."
When the family tried to leave Lohan on the street, the actor continued to broadcast it directly through Instagram.
“See what’s going on – it’s a trafficking in children, so you ruin the Arab culture.
Children, though they don't want to go with you.
Boys, don't worry, I see the whole world with you and now."
The transformation ended with a physical confrontation – it seems that the mother hit Lohan.
Video clips have spread to social media and some users have become interested in whether this could not be treated as abducting attempt.
The Independent contacted Lohan's representative for comments.
A third of the British believe that they will never pay all the debts they hold
Nearly a third of the British people believe that they will not be able to cover their debts during their lives, and one person in 10 believes that they will not even be able to reduce them.
A study conducted by Equifax and Gorkana, whose results are only revealed by The Independent, showed that the British, especially those belonging to the 18-24 age group, believe that they will have debts for their life and only half expect them to go out of them.
Last year, a report published by the Institute of Fiscal Studies reported that students who completed their studies would remain in debt of about 46,000 pounds, while poor students would remain in debt for more than 57,000 pounds.
Most graduates (81%) will never pay full debt, which means they will work under pressure for the first 30 years.
Public debt is rising: According to the National Statistical Department, family debt in the United Kingdom is record-sized and British spends an average of $900 more each year than they earn.
However, is it worth worrying about the statistics of this plant?
Is age-consuming debt simply a new common way of life for young adults (and for society as a whole)?
An example is the purchase of cars, which are another large purchase after purchase (if this is the case).
Auto Trader predicted this week that all new cars would be purchased for payouts within a decade, which would be the usual way to purchase vehicles.
Jeannie Boyle, director of EQ Investors and the certified financial planner, believes that expectations have changed.
“It is really normal today to have debts: it has popularized credit cards, interest-free refinancing, student loans and quick credit”, she said.
"The generation of our grandparents was ashamed to have debts."
In modern times, student debt and house price debt have become a normal phenomenon.
This statement is supported by Moira O'Neill, Head of Internal Investors' personal finance department, who believes that results can be alarming.
“If you borrow a huge sum that is four or five times your income, it may seem that you will have no additional debt,” she explained.
And thus people are in trouble.
The interest rates have been low for many years now, so people with large loans or other debts have to think about security, what would happen if the rates rise."
It should probably not be surprising that financial industry commentators are not in doubt.
Brian Bradie, Managing Director of Freedom Finance, the loan agency, says: “The score is not a tab.
The loan for house repair or purchase of a new car shall no longer be considered as the last resort.
As a result of low interest rates, many people have helped to save on fixed-term deposits, which generate higher returns, but less easily achieve savings.
The middle class is therefore borrowing more and more.
In the past six months, about half of new loans were taken by customers with an excellent creditworthiness assessment."
Richard Haymes, head of the TDX Group financial problem solving department of Equifax, considers that such expectations – such as life-long expectations – are really worrying.
He says: “In August inflation was the highest in six months (2.7 per cent), interest rates increased and wages increased little, and therefore the decision of many people to borrow without a realistic plan to repay their debts is worried.
Our analysis has shown that the number of people going bankrupt will increase by 17 percent this year, and the main factor is record consumer lending."
Debt may not cause much trouble while a person is in work and earns, but it is not clear how life’s debt will affect his old age.
The survey of the Economic and Business Research Centre, carried out together with the experts from More 2 Life on mortgaged assets lending, showed that over the last four years, over 55-74 people’s unguaranteed debt increased more than a third, i.e. more than twice the average.
This age group usually borrows through credit cards and spends 30 percent more on a monthly basis than it earns.
Boyle added: “When more and more people reach 55, they choose to pay their debts from pension funds, which will affect their life in retirement.
In most cases, it is the only savings they were obliged to save.
In addition, people think that by using the wealth they will pay later, but if they change the property they have, they do not receive as much money as they expected.
If the price of property falls, this will only make things worse."
On snatching to half Serena Williams finished with I Touch Mysself in order to draw attention to breast cancer
Serena Williams published a video in which she sings the classic Divinyls song "I Touch Myself" with her hands covering a naked chest.
Tennis’s ass shared the clip on its Instagram page and explained that the video was created to encourage women to check their breasts themselves.
"In this month of the fight against breast cancer, I recorded The Divinyls as a version of the world hit I Touch Mysself to remind women to check themselves regularly," wrote Williams.
“I came out of my comfort zone, but I wanted to do this because this problem affects women of all races around the world.
The most important thing is to determine as early as possible, which helps to save many lives.
I hope I can remind women of this."
Williams continued: “This music clip is part of the project “I Touch Myself Project”, which is implemented by the famous Chrisy Amphlett garbei – she died of breast cancer and gave us her hit to remind women of her health first.”
The project supported by the bottom-up trikota brand Berlei for Breaker Network Australia (BCNA) started in 2014 after the death of 53 years of Amphlet.
The video, published by the tennis star on his Instagram account, received over 1.5 million views and many fans commending the tennis player's song singing.
“The warmest wishes behind this clip and your courage to do so.
Thank you, Serena," wrote one fan.
Another added: “Serena, it’s an STABILITY.
20 years ago, I found my breast cancer and my nod, even when my mammograms didn't show anything.
You just have to check it out.
Thank you for not being afraid to leave the comfort zone – you're a dance!"
For the "Berle" project "I Touch Myself Project" was also released by a new snake leather bra "The Chrisy" inspired by a rock star.
100 percent of the profits from the sale of the vest will be donated to BCNA.
When checking your own symptoms and signs, it is important to know which signs and symptoms you should look for.
Signs of breast cancer are not only nodules but also changes in size or shape of the breast, rashes or wounds, discharge from acne, skin surface pitting, permanent pain or changes in the texture of the skin.
In addition, swelling may be warned of cancer by the udder or keystone, swelling of the vein, and suffocation of the jaw.
Women are advised to check their breasts monthly.
If you notice any signs of breast cancer, you should contact your family doctor immediately.
If your family doctor has considered that your symptoms need further evaluation after looking at you, he will send you to the breast cancer clinic.
Adam Driver made the whole SNL filming group quota
Adam Driver was the guest star of this week's "Saturday Night Live" and actually tried to make everyone laugh.
The best performance jokes are usually not related to a specific actual event – just like the new exhibition under the title "Karjera diena".
The U.S. high school day is seen when students bring their dads, and a teenager named Mortdecus (Pete Davidson) reluctantly agree that his father, the old oil magnet, Abraham H. Parnassus, should speak.
Parnassus, a calming lamp whose megaloman personality could be inspired by Daniel Day-Lewis character Daniel Plainview from the film "Bus blood", tells the story how he managed the oil industry.
"I got seven months too early," says Parnassus to the students.
“The incubator technology was just invented, so I was put in a cast iron pot and heated in a pizza oven until I learned to walk.
My bones didn't harden, but not my spirit!
Be strong and crush your enemies!"
Davidson and his colleague, SNL actress, Aydy Bryant, plays a teacher as soon as he stays in love and can't watch the Driver in his eyes.
However, the forces of the actor of "Star Wars" are only getting on track and he starts telling of his personal war with another oil mathematician H. R. Pickins.
"I married your granddaughter!"
"I filled her belly with my rotting seed and ruined your boy – it's my ultimate avenge, H.R.!"
Parnassus became the same famous character as Kylo Ren in two films in less than five minutes.
"Be damned, H.R.!"
Songs of Kendrick Lamar: eight unheard songs appeared online
A significant amount of unissued songs from Kendrick’s Lamaro appear to have been wasted.
On Saturday, eight still unheard pieces have been made online by SZA, Busta Rhymes, Jay'us Rock, Isaah Rashad and Abi Soul.
It is not clear where the song spread from and the name of the collection "Bad Kid Hill City EP" and the illustration of the cover (which the fan probably created) are not official.
It may be that only demonstrable and unfinished versions of songs are run out as if they were recorded at different stages of Lamar's career.
Gang Mamber could belong to the Era of Good Kid Maad City, and Heroin combined with SZA, more similar to the sound track DAMN./Black Panther.
The following songs shall be distributed in the package:
"Gang Mamber";
"The Only Nigga";
"Want In Life";
"Loved Ones" (with SZA);
"Own This City";
‘Heroin (with SZA, Jay'imi Rocku, Isaiah Rashad and Ab Soul)’;
Look Over Your Shaulders (with Busta Rhymes and Michael Jackson);
Swimming Poles Alternate.
The Independent contacted Kendrick Lamaro for his comment.
Smile on the musical "Čikaga": There are no tickets left in Klaipeda, invite you to travel to Vilnius or Kaunas
Lithuanian wish to see Klaipėda State Music Theatre musical musical museum "Čikaga" - does not pray.
For this reason, the most popular Lithuanian musical musician of all times set up to another tour through the largest arenas in the country.
However, about 1.5 months before the show, places on the halls begin to stink.
The organizers announce that all tickets to the museum in Klaipeda "Švyturo" are already sold, tickets are melting rapidly and to performances in Kaunas "Žalgiris" and Vilnius "Siemens" Arena.
There have been no tickets in the city for some time now, so all those who want to see this indifferent and unending musical are invited to go to Kaunas or Vilnius, where there are still some tickets.
The demonstrations will take place in December, so when you come from now you will not only see our musical, but also have a great opportunity to see the footsteps of the largest cities in the country," Lima Vilimienė, the head of the State Theatre of Klaipeda offers the way forward for fans of musical music.
The viewers of "Čikaga" will be welcomed in December by a certain change in the composition of the performers.
One of the key musical roles for the first time was entrusted to actor Tom Žiemb.
Talent and well-known actor of TV screens in Chicago, the unique Billy Flynn, the best and most influential lawyer in Chicago, who is free from sluiceous human fates.
Since the museum of Klaipeda State Music Theatre "Čikaga" is adapted to larger spaces, arenas, the composition of the artists appearing in it is also larger than that shown in Brodwey.
In Lithuanian "Chicago" appears almost half of the artists.
The main roles of women are entrusted to the charming soloist of Klaipėda State Music Theatre Beata Ignataviūtė (daughter Velma Kelly) and the charismatic soloist of Kaunas Music Theatre Gabriele Bielskyte (daughter Roxie Hart).
The Chiikaga Museum represents the criminal world of Chicago in the 1930s, which turns the walls of prison into a starry hill.

The musical persecute of sexuality and irony.
No matter where and whatever the main heroes - Roxie Hart and Velma Kelly - are - the meaning of life is to shine in a radiant star.
Their life - it's life for the message on the first page, for the headlines, for the glossies, for the glory of the alley...
On 13 December, Čikaga will be displayed on Klaipeda "Svyturo" Arena, on 18 December - in Kaunas "Žalgiris" Arena, on 20 December - in Vilnius Siemens Arena.

Living furniture in Kaunas
The site can be called the representative home zone, where we spend time with our friends, guests, etc. Therefore, it should be installed in such a way that it is convenient not only for the owners of the apartment or the house, but also for the guests.
Depending on the size of the website, the walls, ceiling decor, hosts’ taste, should select appropriate furniture.
The website should not only be beautiful, but also convenient.
It is best to invite the interior designer to help fill the space in the optimal way so that it is not crowded or vice versa - too empty.
It is advisable to begin by setting the main point of the site, i.e. the object you will combine with furniture and other details.
This can be the accent of the fireplace or other important website interior.
It would also be great to create a chat space where guests can communicate conveniently, so that they do not interfere with the space of furniture, etc.
Sofas, chairs should be located close to each other so that your guests can sit down and talk.
Thus, the arrangement of furniture must encourage communication, unite people, not alienate them from each other.
Do not push the furniture to the wall.
The size of the room depends on the distance that should be from the walls.
Although the room is small, leave at least a little room from the wall, do not push the furniture right next to it.
If the room is large, leave even more room for walls.
Indeed, the greater the distance, the better.
Make a balance when laying furniture
Consider the size and location of the various details to be found on your website.
All elements must be compatible with each other.
The living furniture must be compatible with the interior details.
A small contrast is possible.
It will enliven the interior of the site, but it should not be too large, because the interior will become uncontroversial.
We advise you to consult interior designers at all times.
It is your own website interior, if you do not have the necessary knowledge, that you run away from extremes: or that you create a bored interior because you are afraid to experiment, to make mistakes, to choose wrong or to try to improprovise.
Suitable lighting
This is a very important thing.
After all, different light reveals space differently.
Lighting must be arranged at various levels: ceiling lamps, wall lamps, on the floor lamps.
Public Prosecutor's Office appealed the victorious sentence to the heads of LCF
Vilnius Regional Public Prosecutor's Office appealed against Vilnius Regional Court's legal sentence to former heads of the Lithuanian Basketball Federation (LKF).
As announced by the prosecutor’s office on Monday, the complaint states that the Municipality of Panevėžys did not have a legal basis to contribute with the funds of the municipal budget to the reconstruction of the private hotel in Panevėžys.
In the course of the pre-trial investigation it was established that in order to find the possibility of financing the reconstruction of the hotel, public contracts for the purchase and sale of services were concluded in 2010 between the Lithuanian Basketball Federation and the municipality of Panevėžys.
According to the prosecutors, the services which the Federation had to provide to the Municipality of Panevėžys under the said contract had not been planned and could not be provided as part of the planned services had already been financed or financed by the State and its sponsors, the planned events had already taken place before the signing of the contract and had already been paid out from other funds, while part of the events had already taken place after the issue of the VAT invoices, with the cash on the invoices being transferred for events which had not yet occurred.
Vilnius Regional Prosecutor's Office states that it disagrees with the ruling of the Court of First Instance, emphasising that the State itself commissioned and commissioned the Municipality of Panevėžys to undertake the reconstruction of a private hotel, since no state obligation regarding a particular hotel existed, only expressed proposal to resolve the issues of development of hotels required for the championship as soon as possible.
According to the Public Prosecutor’s Office, the court had unfounded its finding that the heads of the municipality of LKF and Panevėžys tried to comply with the State’s obligation to do so without the lawful road, because the data in the case show that there was an opportunity to organise European Basketball Championships in other cities, without prejudice to laws.
The Vilnius Regional Public Prosecutor's Office by appeal seeks the annulment of the court's judgment of first instance and, in this case, the adoption of a new ruling - the accused - concerning seven natural persons and one legal person.
On October 15, Vilnius Regional Court fully justified the Secretary General of the LCF Mindaugas Balčiūnas for all the crimes committed.
This case concerns preparation for the European Championship of Men in Lithuania in 2011.
Mr Balčiūnas has been accused of abuse, fraud and other crimes.
The Public Prosecutor's Office accused Mr Balčiūnas of having agreed to the position of Secretary General of the LCF with the Federal Financial Minister and Executive Director to write in the name of the Federation the work performed which is not in reality – acts of transfer and other false financial documents and accounts regarding the services provided to the municipality of Panevėžys.
According to the pre-trial investigation carried out by officials of the Board of the Special Investigation Service (SST) Panevėžys, the funds of Panevėžys Municipality could have been fraudulently fraudulent and for the benefit of the managed LKF and the reconstruction of the "Romantic" hotel of Via Unica.
Dalia Kuklierienė, director of this hotel, has been accused of giving TV to her as a bribe.
All persons arrested with Mr Balčiūnas have been excused.
The accusations in this case were submitted to eight natural persons and one legal person - the Lithuanian Basketball Federation.
Remote workplace - like the Bermuda triangle
In Lithuania, the number of injured or killed people in work has already exceeded the total population of Alytus since 1992, reaching about 83 thousand.
If demands for a specific physical workplace and its safety are as clear as they are, then a new Bermuda triangle becomes an option to work remotely - from home, public spaces or even from other countries.
According to the insurance specialists, although the Law on Safety and Health at Work provides for conditions for workers working distance from other workers, the diversity of modern forms of work can raise a number of questions, reports the press release.
In the event of an accident at home, compensation shall be paid by the employer for the first two days of unemployment, from 80%, and for the remainder of the period "Sodra".
If it is found that an unfortunate event has taken place during work - as of the first day of incapacity for work, Sodra reimburses 100% of the wage.
When assessing the statistics provided by the State Labour Inspectorate and the damage managed by the BTA, it is obvious that an absolute majority of accidents and various injuries occur at the workplace.
In most cases, these are various physical tasks, where the risk of injury is higher: not careful about appliances or equipment, concentration or coordination is lost.
However, offices, where most of the most highly paid professionals are now concentrated, are also facing their challenges arising from freedom of mobility granted by employers and by employees," says Jevgenija Krikščiūtė, Head of the Human Resources Management Unit of the BTA.
The legislation in force in Lithuania recommends that the duties and limits of responsibility of the employee be clearly regulated, and that working time, place and function be defined, also applies when working remotely.
If this is done, it is easier to determine whether an accident occurred at work or not.
Situations and nuances certainly exist in different, each case being examined individually.
Workers are often also aware of the fact that when we go to or from the job or when travelling to or from work to work, the employer has responsibility for what is happening in the event of an accident.
However, there is a lot of nuances and reservations in this case, so I would encourage both workers and employers to initiate interviews, to find out and to find out clearly and to the maximum extent acceptable to both sides what situations are actually considered as accidents at work, and who will already have to have the status of domestic injuries", says a specialist.
J. Krikčiūnas claims that in these times, when computer and mobile telephone and secure internet connections are often completely sufficient to perform their function, the employee will not necessarily work at the location and at the time indicated in the agreement.
Workers are mobile, they can choose to work that day, not at home, but by drinking coffee in a coffee shop or in the park by enjoying the sun.
It's gonna be a place of work, isn't it?
What if the hours worked are still discussed are not in line with the agreement?
There may be quite a certain number of situations, the circumstances of which help to clarify the investigation being carried out, initiated by "Sodros" or by the State Labour Inspectorate", says a specialist.
According to her, the main financial difference between an accident at work and at home is the amount of unemployment benefit.
J. Krikčiūnė admits that it has been informally to hear unpleasant experiences when employers try to hide the real circumstances of accidents or injuries and try to persuade employees to go to doctors outside working hours, take responsibility for themselves, and thus make a financial loss.
This is an unfair, disrespectful approach to the employee and should not be tolerated.
On the other hand, the mobility of people mentioned above encourages the search for additional tools that could help companies in similar situations: this is also the insurance against employer's liability for damage to workers, the acquisition of insurance against injury, the disability of insurance, and even death, as well as the relevant health insurance," says Mr Kriščiūnas.
Mobile signature system running again
Following the elimination of the failure on Monday, the mobile signature system operates in Lithuania again, BNS confirmed the service provider's representatives of Estonian IT company SK ID Solutions.
This company reported distortions on Monday morning, inconveniences experienced by Betė, Telia clients and part of Tele2 users.
The disruptions were also recorded in Estonia, but the representatives of SK ID Solutions could not comment on the situation in that country.
Polish lessons for the Lithuanian regby collector
To date, it is difficult for a Lithuanian regbio collector, who is in the Trophy division of Europe to compete in higher level competitors.
The Trophy Division in the Old Land is the third in capacity after the Six Nations Championship and the European Championship.
There are 13-18 rating-rated continental teams.
Lithuanians competed in October for victory in Šiauliai 30:10 against the Czech team.
Last weekend the Lithuanian national team visited Łódze, where it did not match the Polish national - 0:33 (0:12).
Although Lithuanians were self - sacrificing, the ruins often violated the rules, and Polish eyewitnessers swung forward with shocks.
The three-, 10-, 27- and 37-minute penalty hit Wojciech Piotrowiczius, which gave his own 12-point victory.
In the first chair, the Lithuanians had 10 minutes to play without a yellow card.
In the second stage, guests held several attacks, but they were not able to complete them effectively.
At that time, the Poles managed to break our defence.
The ball's compression was carried out in the count area by Mateusz Plichta, then by Krystyanas Pogorzelskis and Mateusz Adamskis.
The Lithuanian team coach of PAR Ntando Manyosha, who played among a few important observers, acknowledged the advantage of competitors and claimed that such a match has provided many valuable experience.
"The Poles played very well and competed in all the components of the game.
Our goal was to keep this match as long as possible.
We have just gone to this higher level and we need to understand it.
We won the first match against the Czechs, but now we met very powerful competitors and had to accept their advantage.
The Polish national team provided us with useful lessons," said the specialist from PAR, who has been standing at the Lithuanian national team for four years.
The next match "Trophy" division Lithuanians will play on April 6, 2019 at home with Portuguese or Romanians.
The Dutch and Swiss teams still competed in this division.

The guard on the coast of Japan is looking intensely for the missing islands
Esanbe Hanakita Kojima - this name was given to the entire small island in the north of Japan in 2014.
A small, meaningless and unvalued island, which was, in principle, inappropriate for life, was very important for Japan.
So important is that the missing territory is now under intensive scrutiny - will there still be one?
Why does Japan need this island?
I don't think so.
It is likely that the ice and underwater landslides have caught this island once and for all, even though it had recently fallen to nearly two feet above the surface of the water.
There is hardly any doubt that the island simply collapsed, but at least its traces are expected to be found.
When the island disappeared, no one knows exactly - she was so useless that no one was too scared of it.
The Japanese fishermen who sometimes used the island as an aid to visual navigation probably first learned about the disappearance of Esanbe Hanakita Kojima.
Its disappearance is not a tragedy, even for these fishermen, because there are better ways of catching where they can fish and where the disputed waters of Russia are starting.
That is exactly what Esanbe Hanakita Kjamma meant.
This narrow strip of the land was the western edge of the Kiels island.
This is an island circuit that Russia calls the Kuri Islands and Japan is known as Northern Territories.
The conflict with some of these breaks has continued since the mid - 19th century, but full force has entered the 20th century.
These areas have natural resources, but historically Japan believes that the islands should belong to it.
The need for Japanese men to study these islands from the middle of the 17th century.
They first formed a map, took more detailed research, registering a lot of small straws.
The agreements between Japan and Russia signed in 1855 indicated that Sachalin was the owner of the latter, and Japan was the whole of the Kieli Islands.
Thus, these two states survived until 1905 when the Russian Empire lost the war in Sachalin to Japan.
In 1945, the Soviet Union took advantage of the situation in Japan and opened the Kuri Islands.
Japan, by the way, has great claims on the whole of the island does not mean, although it was the first to have four islands - Iturupo, Coranius, Schicotan Islands and Chabomai.
Japan feels that it has historical rights because the islands were first tested and that Japan was also part of the 1855 agreements.
In 2009, Japan proposed that Russia share these four islands equally, but Russia did not even consider accepting this offer.
Japan is quite close to Northern Territories, but now missing islands this geographical link is like lost.
That physical marker of the presence of Japan in those waters has disappeared.
This is a major loss, which is why the island's remains are being sought.
However, even if they find Esanbe Hanakita Kjama will not be in compliance with the definition of a simple island - this must be the drought.
This means a slight decline in the territory of Japan and a sharp decline in the exclusive economic zone, calculated from the shores.
I just wonder what the island's search mission expects - it will certainly not be lost or sailed.
Unbelievable drama of Lithuanian and Polish boxing teams in the bike
For more than a week, we had to wait for a final verdict of judges who became winners of a cross-border meeting between Lithuania and Poland in the boxing teams.
Nine Polish and Lithuanian bikes were held in Poland.
The four blinds won Lithuanians, as well as Poles.
The decisive two-way outcome was due to the lengthy discussions of the Chamber of Judges and the final decision of the Secretariat of the Competitions.
The national election meeting began with the victory of Lithuanian boxers.
The multiple Lithuanian champion Marius Vyšniauskas (weight category up to 52 kg) safely won Jakub Surms, soon Edgars Skurdelis (up to 60 kg) after the repeat battle 2:1 won Radomirs Obrušniak.
Two hosts followed: Damian Durracz (up to 64 kg) 3:0 overcoming Mantas Dugina, and Philip Wachala (up to 69 kg) 2:1 overcame Simon Bani.
Vytautas Balsys (up to 75 kg) returned the victory to Lithuanian collectors.
Lithuanian 2:1 defeated Bartosza Golebiewski.
In the next March, in the third round, the clear victory over Mr. Piotras Szczukowski (up to 81 kg) overcomes Mr. Aigrates and became the result again at 3:3.
The brothers Joculas had different results.
Robert Jokulys (up to 91 kg) 3:0 defeated Andrzej Colton, and Arvydas Jokulys (over 91 kg) had already recognised Adam Kulik’s advantage in the first part.
The debate resulted mainly from the fight between Tado Tamašauskas (up to 91 kg) and Michalo Soczynski.
It was precisely because of its cross-border meeting that the final outcome was announced more than a week.
One judge made a victory for Poland, two judges for Lithuania, but because of a technical mistake one of the judges was read to Soczynski.
After a long-lasting dispute, the Polish boxer was left to 2:1.
At the Lithuanian-Polish National Assembly, the winners won the result of 10:8 (two points are allocated for the victory).
They were able to repay to the Lithuanians for the threefold loss experienced by the last mutual macho.
During the meeting in Marijampolė in 2015, Lithuanian boxers won as many as five battles out of six and won the victory score of 10:2.
A meeting of the Lithuanian national team leaders in Poland was a general rehearsal before the Lithuanian Boxing Championship which will take place in Šilute on 14-17 November.
After the country's priorities a new Lithuanian boxing team will be formed, which will defend the country's honor at the World and European Championships next year.
How does the dog determine the direction in which the person went?
You already know that the dog's mouth is extremely sensitive.
They may smell hidden explosives, drugs, blood, and other animals, some of them even recognize diseases.
The dogs are well known for their footsteps, but their work is much harder than you thought.
How do they determine the direction in which the owner of the traces went?
In fact, this is a much more complex issue than you think.
The tracking of trails consists of three stages: discovery, direction and tracking.
The second stage is much worse than the other two, because it is difficult to decide on the direction in which the person took the step at the end of the trails.
It's not a second between the different steps, so it's not a big difference, isn't it?
Not exactly.
As early as 1990, a study published by the University of Oslo described experiments that brought the dog to an angle of 90 degrees near the path followed by man.
Tests shall be carried out on grass and asphalt.
And in many cases, dogs easily found the direction of human walking, even when he tried to mislead them by passing away.
Can you imagine the complexity of this task?
The difference between the next traces of smell is very small and in time it decreases even more.
However, scientists say that this is not so strange: dogs would be able to tell and some part of the foot touched the ground first.
This is because their mouthpiece is an incredible tool.
The dog’s brain is dominated by areas responsible for the egg (as our brain is dominated by regions responsible for vision).
The dog’s nose has 125-300 million scent receptors.
In general, the dog rosacea is at least 40 times more sensitive than humans, but even more important is their ability to interpret different smells.
Scientists then conducted similar experiments and traces left with bicycles, but it was much more difficult for dogs to trace their direction.
This is due to the fact that the cancer of the bike is not segmented as traces of the person going, which makes it more difficult to isolate different places for comparison - it is not natural for dogs, so more time is needed.
True, dogs are not the owners of the most powerful ussula.
This title is likely to go to the bows.
The male white bears have hundreds of miles of ready - to - be - ready - to - be - married females, and the brown bears smell a sticky animal even over 30 km away.
Private forests promise to regulate intersections
Minister of Environment Kęstutis Navickas will explain the felling of forests in Seimas on Tuesday.
At the end of August, there was public dissatisfied over the forests found in the Labanor Regional Park.
These forests were stopped during the month.
The Minister has recognised that investigations into crosses in Labanore have shown that there has been no violations.
However, the Ministry of Environment has already introduced part of the restrictions, taking into account the proposal by the Working Group to strengthen deforestation in state-owned forests.
The Minister promises that other legislation on forest felling will be prepared by the end of the year.
The same restrictions are being applied to the intersections of state forests and to private forest holdings.
Agnė Jagelavičiūtė revealed the strategy of 170,000 followers
We need to give people what they want and, together, put on what they want, on the LRT TV show "Culturing with Nomeda" says Agnė Jagelavičiūtė.
According to stylists, so she gradually set up a great crowd of fans.
"In the beginning, you start pricking the taste of a man, putting it to you, and, in the years to come, you get a little better with that taste," says A. Jagelavičiūtė.
A. Jagelavičiūtė has more than 170 thousand followers in her feisbukas account - it has reached this number using a certain strategy: "In the beginning, you start by plowing the taste of a man, you pull to yourself, and in time after a little bit of that taste you get better".
Stylaitė Jagelavičiūtė claims to be unhindered by uncertainty, so she shows her face as it is - authenticity and ability to find the best way of presentation are the most important criteria for popularity in social networks.
She notes that there is no human culture in the social networks anymore, because many internauts come to them to be proud of anyone or to read comments from other people who are multifaceted: "For example, during adolescence there was a time when I wanted to grow up with everyone and get lost - I now do not have that wish."
"Frequent life is the worst thing.
And there is a great deal in social networks.
It's a little less instagram in Feisbuke," she speaks.
A. Jagelavičiūtė, who has an education in interior design and painting, says a specific message sent in social networks - speaks of female emancipation.
It also promotes the production of magazines, and creations can also be seen in its work.
"I can't say that fashion magazine is an expression of pure art, but I know it's really a lot there.
I believe that there are many works in my work, just like vanity.
I'm balancing -- that's my key to these huge numbers.
I don't want to create a false life.
It is far better to give people what they want, and quietly put on what they want," says Jagelavičiūtė.
One of the most difficult events that attract young people - classical music concerts.
In order to increase their popularity, well-known people put forward life stories: speaking about backstages, failures, life-time events, thus remaining authentic.
It is such a strategy that Mr Jagelevičūtė proposes to apply to the whole of culture.
According to her, without anyone enjoying, no entertainment or real values, culture has no opportunities.
"As a boring teacher against students, are there chances?
If we do not find a certain way to present that art, advertise without advertising, it will never go.
When we are realistic and catch the reader - maybe something will change then.
I get once, the second and the third - and it's the addiction," she shares her insights.
Three people disappeared after a helicopter in the Gulf of Litua north of June.
On Saturday after the helicopter crash north of Jun, the search for three people began in Alaska.
One person was rescued after a day's disaster, and the other three could not be found.
The helicopter crashed near the Gulf of Litua, northwest of June.
It was established that it was Airbus H125 on a long journey to Grand Prerey Texas.
On Friday, the aircraft was found 100 feet off the shore.
According to "Associated Press", one saved person was 14 years old.
Mild hypothermia has been reported, but no other problems have been reported.
Two adults and two adolescents were flying in the fallen helicopter.
According to KTVA, David King (53), Josh Pepper (42) and Andrew Pepperd (11) disappeared.
It is established that Senior Pepperdo is the director of Davis Constructors & Engineers, the Alaska construction company.
I don't know what the accident caused.
The National Transport Security Council stated that an investigation had been initiated.
“I crashed a helicopter, which was completely new – just obtained from the factory, which operated two adults and two teenagers,” states a report from the coastal guards on the basis of the CPCA.
The pilot was found to have 40 years of experience in the operation of fixed wing aircraft and helicopters, including those in Alaska.
According to “Anchorage Daily News”, family friend Jeff Bradsky said that loved ones “not yet have hope of a miracle".
With the help of a coastal guard helicopter, rescuers updated on 17 February 2016 on the search for experienced climbers who disappeared from Scotland on Nevis Hill Fort William.
On Saturday, three people were found missing from the helicopter crash in Alaska.
"I have experienced sexual violence"
Presidential adviser Kellyanne Conway revealed the sexual violence he suffered on Sunday morning.
Conway commented on the heated disputes between Judge Bretto Kavanaugh, who is standing for the Supreme Court, and his accused Dr Christine Blasey Ford.
Conway was thrilled to discover that there was self-perceived sexual violence, and he defended Kavanaugh against the lead Jake Tapper, claiming that the judge was accused of the unfavorable facts by sexual violence.
“ I am very sympathetic to the victims of sexual abuse and violence.
I've experienced sexual abuse myself," said Conway in CNN Sunday's State of the Union.
I am a victim of sexual violence and I do not think that Judge Kavanaugh, Take Tapper, Jeff Flake, or anyone else is responsible for this.
We must be responsible for our own conduct."
Conway claimed that the news network should be ashamed of the Kavanaugh's comparison with Bill Cosby's, who last week was sentenced to three to ten years' imprisonment in the state of Pennsylvania.
Conway has also been criticised by the Senate Courts Committee because he was unable to remove former President Bill Clinton, who in his office occupied oral sex and lied to the U.S. people.
The survey showed that the Kavanaugh and Ford demonstrations divided the U.S. community
The Americans disagreed with the statement by Brett Kavanaugh and his accused Christine Blasey Ford, who claimed that the judge had sexually attacked her when they were teenagers.
Thinking that Ford or Kavanaugh is lying, the number almost coincides: 38 percent of those interviewed say that Kavanaugh would probably or certainly lied by evidence, while 30 percent of them said the same about Ford.
The Senate Courts Committee heard both parties when Ford sent a letter to Senator Dianne Feinstein with detailed accusations to the judge.
After sending a letter, both Ford and Kavanaugh said that they were ready to speak against the Committee.
When giving evidence, Ford claimed that it was 100 percent certain that at the beginning of the 1980s, it was tried to attack the Kavanaugh, not another person.
In her introductory speech, 51 years of age, she stated that she felt a civil obligation and could not remain silent.
"I'm so scared," she said.
"I'm here because I think it's my civic duty to tell me what happened to me when Britta Kavanaugh and I were in high school."
Ford and two other women accused of sexual abuse Kavanaugh said: “There was no sexual attack on anything at high school, college or at any time later.”
“Everyone like you could tried to find anything that would prevent me from voting for my nomination, no matter how unrealistic or disgusting it,” he said.
"It's the simplest disgusting last minute."
The results of a survey carried out by YouGov on 27 and 28 September, which surveyed 2607 people, are not surprising – people who felt different parties differed in opinion: democratic supporters believe more in Ford (73 per cent) and Republicans – Kavanaugh (74 per cent), even though Ford's shows believed more Republicans than Kavanaugh – democrats (14 per cent, compared to 11 per cent).
Founder of the "Body Worlds" exhibition, called Dr. Mirtim, wants to be cut and shown at its own exhibition
A German scientist who has invented plasticization wants to become an eternal part of his exhibition Body Worlds.
Gunther von Hagens has come up with an innovative method that provides an opportunity to demonstrate lavans, skulls and organs in an exhibition around the world, which has received both admiration and controversial assessments.
In 73 C.E., a husband with a fatal disease told his wife to plasticize him after his death to become a permanent exhibition at the exhibition "Body Worlds" which will be opened this week in London.
“It will be, in a real sense, the completion of his life work.
I now understand that I will have to do this because I will express my recognition and love," Angelina Whalley said to the newspaper "The Observatory".
She said that the husband gave strong instructions on what to do with his body and that the whole process would take about a year.
Muscles, nerves and arteries should be washed and silicone should be injected into the body and placed in the right position.
"He said to me, "Angelina, you can freeze me up to 25 degrees a year, but then you'll have to add your hands, otherwise I'll freeze."
So I can eat for a year, then I'll have to do it."
Then, in the ideal case, he will join the exhibition in London's Pavilion next to other bodies, which have stagnated in time with upright positions, such as riding horses or playing cards.
Von Hagens was famous in the United Kingdom for carrying out the flight on live British television (this was the first public flight in 170 years).
More than 47 million people have visited the Body Worlds exhibitions around the world since 1995.
Peter Tabernalis, founder of Body Worlds London, said to the newspaper The Guardian that 100% of the exhibition, which takes about 28,000 square feet, was bestowed by the people who “reached their consent because they wanted to help the living, to educate them and to help them see potential problems.”
“We see and read so terrible things that we fear death.
None of us will avoid her, death is common to us all, and I think "Body Worlds" shows that we do not need to be afraid", - said Tabernalis.
Ronaldo's lawyers threaten the court's claim for rape
On Friday, the lawyers of the Portuguese football stars Cristiano Ronaldo said that the German magazine, which published the obvious illegal American claims that Ronaldo raped it in 2009, would sue for law.
One of Ronaldo’s lawyers, Christian Schertz, stated that the article of the magazine Dere Spiegel was an "inadmissible statement of private accusations" and that he would seek legal redress for the magazine’s client.
The application was sent to Reuters by Ronaldo, representing the company Gestifute, in response to the request to comment on the article De Spiegel published online on Friday.
Gestifute did not answer specific questions about the content of the Deer Spiegel statement, which Reuters could not independently verify.
Deer Spiegel first announced charges in April 2017.
One of the world's most popular athletes, Ronaldo has earned the title of the world's best player five times.
This summer he went to Juventus in Italy from Real Madrid; the Italian club refused to comment on the statement by Der Spiegel.
The magazine announces that the suspected rape took place in the Las Vegas hotel room in June 2009 – this was said by the lawyer of Kathrynda Mayorga Leslie Mark Stovalla.
Stovalla told the magazine that Ronaldo and Mayorga had not agreed to court.
Mayorga agreed to sign a confidentiality agreement for the $375 000 paid by Ronaldo.
Stovallas did not reply immediately to Reuters' emails regarding comments, and Mayorga did not respond to home phone calls.
However, Stovallas said to Deer Spiegel that he had lodged a civil complaint in order to cancel the confidentiality agreement.
Mayorda said to Deer Spiegel that the contract was no longer tied to it, because it still felt the consequences of the nine years before the night.
"I have experienced serious crises," she said.
“And yet, the accusation of rape.
I blame him and blame myself for signing this."
Sustainable business ensuring creators' independence
Are you ready to test “Self-Publishing 3.0”?
The new White Paper, published today by the Union of Independent Creators on the website of#selfpub3.0, for the first time explains how to join other creators in business, become independent and start a sustainable creative business.
The founder of the Union of Independent Creators Orna Ross, has already been recognized for the first time as one of the 100 most influential people, at the conference Digital Book World 2018 will explain why developers should let Self-Publising 3.0 methods.
“Driving trends, such as the increasing number of personal brands, responsible consumption and reading on mobile phones, together with digital publishing technologies, create the most favourable conditions for developers’ businesses,” says Ross.
However, these opportunities can only be used by independent and creative creators who understand and understand the value of intellectual property.
"#selfpub3.0" encourages developers to create several sources of closedby through websites that create conditions for successful publishing and media.
It can be earned from direct sales, subscription models, crowded aid, large distribution models and other sources of income, such as online training and activities of the related entity.
"#selfpub3.0" also encourages the distribution of books in as many formats as possible through retailers and other services.
The main objective of#selfpub3.0 is to encourage change of mind and to learn to manage your creative business, so that intellectual property, which is the most important creative property, is not unimaginably transferred to another company, such as a specialised publishing agency or an independent publishing service provider.
According to Ross, the creators can increase their income, influence and impact and these methods must be consulted not only by every creator of the digital age, but also by publishers; it also stressed that the real independence of creators (as with others) is guaranteed by commercial and creative freedom.
The future is here.
And its prospects for independent developers are now the best.
The book Self-Publishing 1.0 describes computer publishing and printing on request.
The topic "Self-Publing 2.0" is the sale of books for e-book readers and telephones in online book shops.
Now starts a new "Self-Publing 3.0" era where independent publishers will be trained to start a viable and sustainable business.
The Union of Independent Creators is the only global non-profit organisation that unites independent writers.
The Union’s objective is to develop the skills of independent publishers, promote ethical activities, help start-ups sell books and encourage creators to carry out a sustainable digital business that will ensure their independence.
Presidents of the State and Central Bank warned the Italian Government of the planned deficit
After hearing the populist government's plans next year to significantly increase the deficit costs, the Italian President and the Head of the Central Bank warned on Saturday that the country's debt had to be managed.
On Thursday evening, the Governing Party (Possical Five Star Movement and Right North League) submitted a proposal for the 2019 deficit of 2.4 per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and three times the target of the previous administration.
This report, on Friday, has disrupted the market and led to the sale of the bonds and a blow to the bank's shares.
In addition, such plans are not compatible with the European Union, which applies and monitors compliance with EU fiscal rules.
Addressing the audience at the President's Palace, which mentions the 70-year anniversary of the constitution, President Serge Mattarella mentioned that according to the country's framework laws, "the budget must be balanced and debts managed".
"We will protect our citizens," he said.
A little later at a conference in central Italy, President of the Italian Bank Ignazio Visco said that the country's debt can no longer be further increased, which is the largest of all the major economies of the European Union and reaches 131 percent of GDP.
“Italy must give priority to public and private investment and manage and reduce public debt”, – said Visco, the State Knowledge Agency “Ansa”.
"School shall be reduced in a consistent manner."
The Head of the North League and the Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvinis responded to the words of Mattarella that the debt has risen as a result of the strict requirements imposed by Brussels for years.
"To calm down, Mr. President," said Salvinis in his statement.
"The public debt has risen for years due to Europe's imposed budgets, and we are after all changing the plans and seeking a better future and growth."
Earlier, before Mattarella or Visco spoke, the five-star movement leader Luigis Di Maio said that the previously stolen money would be returned to people" from the budget, but added that the government does not aim to oppose the EU or the financial markets.
The Governing Parties pressed with Minister for Economic Affairs Giovannis Trias who did not belong to any group to support their planned deficit expenditure.
The Italian media claimed that Mattarella had supported Tria'a's failed attempt to maintain a budget deficit below 2 percent of GDP.
The Presidents of the country and central bank shall not directly influence economic policy.
The President of the 77th century can reject the law and return it to parliament, but only once.
The Parliament can then again adopt and legitimise the unchanged law.
Official information: Indonesian tsunami sensors missed huge waves
The Indonesian geophysical agency withdrew the warning for tsunami 34 minutes after its release, and then a severe earthquake occurred, sending a huge wave toward the northeast coast of Sulawesi, where hundreds of people died and thousands were left home.
Car dunes after the tsunami in Pala, Indonesia, 29 September 2018.
During an earthquake and tsunami of 7.5 miles (940 miles) from Jakarta, an earthquake and tsunami struck a population of at least 384 miles (940 miles) away.
The officers said that the number of victims was likely to increase on Sunday.
On Friday, a large number of people gathered for the festival at Pala Beach, which was covered by the heights of six meters (18 feet) which had been lost.
The geophysical agency BMKG received criticisms in the social media on Saturday: many people wondered whether the warning of the tsunami was not withdrawn too early.
The Agency stated that it had conducted a standard procedure and decided to withdraw the warning according to data from the nearest flood sensor about 200 km (125 miles) from Pala.
“We have no monitoring data from Pala.
So we had to make a decision according to the data we had," said Rahmat Triyono, Head of the Center for earthquakes and tsunamis in the BMKG.
The nearest floodmeter, measuring sea level changes, only found a “minor” wave of six inches [2.5 inches] and did not notice huge waves at Pala.
“If we had had a floodmeter at Pala or if we had got data from there, of course, the situation would be better.
We have to think about this in the future," Triyon said.
According to officials, the tsunami hit Pala and the surrounding areas at a great rate – hundreds of kilometres per hour, but it is unclear whether it occurred before or after the revocation of the warning.
The population checks the lions on the street in search of their family members after the tsunami in Pala, Indonesia, 29 September 2018.
"We believe that the tsunami took place before officially withdrawing the warning," said Triyono.
The peak of the 9.5-point earthquake occurred on the second Christmas day of 2004 and resulted in a huge tsunami of approximately 226 000 people on the Indian Ocean, including 126 000 victims in Indonesia.
The visible city of Pala, which is home to 380 000 people, is located at a narrow bay in the northeast of the island of Sulawes.
According to the National Disaster Reduction Agency of Indonesia (BNPB), tsunamis destroyed the city in 1927 and 1968.
According to Baptist Gombert, a geophysical researcher at Oxford University, the earthquake had no cause for tsunamis.
The Friday earthquake occurred as a result of a horizontal break: the adjacent tectonic plates moved horizontally and not vertically, as is usual for tsunamis.
“It is believed that there was a recession in the sea that pushed out a lot of water and caused a tsunami,” he said, adding that the force of wave movements towards the shore could concentrate in the narrow bay.
Sutopo Purwo, a member of the Emergency Reduction Agency, said to Nugroho's correspondents that his team "was going to send easily understandable public warnings", when the tsunami warning was suddenly withdrawn.
According to the Ministry of Communications, citizens were repeatedly sent text messages with warnings, but Nugroho said that because of the earthquake, the electricity and communication lines were stopped and there were no Sires along the shore.
The Indonesians doubted in the social media that the CMKG had to withdraw the tsunami warning and were angry that the information had not been provided in time.
“I’m disappointed... Warning cancelled... And tsunami still happened...” – Twitter user @zanoguccy sent a direct message to the BMW.
Golf: The Mollywood duo is going to beat the ticketing record
After winning the quarts matches on Saturday, Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood became the first two of Europe to win all four pairs of machos, and will probably be recorded in history, as representing Europe is already leading the outcome of 10:6 against the Ryder Cup finals.
After defeating Tiger Woods and Bryson Dechambeau at 5:4, they became the first couple of Europeans to win all four matches.
Only Americans Larry Nelson and Lanny Wadkins managed to do this in 1979.
Triangling results – 3:1, 5:4, 4:3 and 5:4 – show not everything.
The couple three times won 14 important titles of Woods and twice won the Patrick Reed.
They also won a victory against Jordan's St.pieth and Justin Thomas, a U.S. team that won the next three competitions this week.
Molinari and Fleetwood will have the opportunity to become the first Europeans, winning five points of the five potential, at Sunday unit competitions.
Fleetwood has already earned the highest score in the Ryder Cup unit competitions as a new European.
The couple that the crowd of new fans mentioned "Mollywood" did not look at the possibility of leading the European team at first glance.
A newcomer from the Ryder Cup, such as Fleetwood, did not expect such an appearance, and Molinari failed at any of the previous six machos and four landed rivals.
But there was also hope: Fleetwood was the first in Europe last year, knows Le Golf National Square as his five fingers and won the French Open tournament here in 2017 and demonstrated a decisive temperament during U.S. Open this year.
Molinari is a new British Open champion and is regarded by many as the most consistent European tournament player – a useful quality in the past square, where a tall grass can cause destruction, as American failures have shown.
The features of these players and the harmonious game in the square made them insurmountable.
“Now I feel a little sensual, but only Saturday,” Fleetwood, famous for his relaxation, played the entire weekend with a wide smile face.
This afternoon, we have been a great show, and we have been stable and good.
If we join in history, this will be a special achievement.
I'm just glad we tried to do our best for the team."
The Molinari also rejoiced.
"It was great to play with Tommy," he said.
"We must do our duty, not just to get into record books, so tomorrow we will have to fight hard on the 4.5 point we need to win; it will not be easy."
It's a Riter's fever!
Ireland’s village turned into a medieval battlefield
The Claregalway Castle, located in the west of Ireland, was previously a powerful, 15 - century family for the wheeler, and this Saturday remembered its origin.
On 29 September 2018, at the Claregalway Castle in Gölvey, Ireland, the Rürterø d’Affaire d’Affaire d’Affaires.
The completely renovated Anglonorman period house with a tower has turned the yard into a medieval battlefield, where many enthusiasts from all corners of the world to small parts have restored the contact battles and games that were popular centuries ago.
Donna Dornan, dressed in Riteris, patrolled by Donna Dornan in Claregalway’s capital city, during the Medieval Battle Festival in Glvey, Ireland, on 29 September 2018.
“It’s a great weekend trip and something unusual,” Denise Fitzgerald said on the fire of the fire in the vegetables of the fighters from Kerry’s graphics, when he became the owner of the tavern for the weekend.
“This is how we came back to the simplest things.
I tried to do everything as needed," said the theatre employee, for the first time in the armed fighting festival.
In the field were played by authentic eavesty fighters, and although their swords were kissed, some helmets were folded, and one wounded the lips.
The horsemen demonstrated their skills by riding and cutting cabbage and aubergines in half.
By the way, metal castings put their armour, spices merchants made their drugs, and craftsmen wept and painted wool.
The participants, who were seriously inclined and very happy, sought to get into the roles.
“I think anyone can wear a suit, but the feeling of a role is art”, said Helena Stackpool, who played ledi Eleanor Fitzgerald and had a unique opportunity to use her fashion design knowledge.
“All suits are handwritten.
I've been wearing my belt for two years now, and I've been wearing my dress and I've only shot 800 pearls on her sleeves.
It matters to me," she said.
After the earthquake and tsunami, the number of deaths in Indonesia has risen to 832
According to the National Disaster Reduction Agency, the number of people killed by the earthquake and tsunami on the island of Sulawesi has risen to 832 on Sunday, while the area affected is larger than initially thought.

FBI appealed to the second woman accused of a candidate, Kavanaugh
The FBI agents investigating the case of the applicant for the US Supreme Court of Bretto Kavanaugh appealed to the second woman who accused him of a sexual assault, which was revealed by the lawyer of this woman on Sunday.
According to a report by John Clune, Deborah Ramirez, the investigation of the Kavanaugh case by the FBI will not only cover the individual accusations against the rape attempt made this week by Dr Christine Blasey Ford, the Conservative of the Federal Court of Appeal, to the dramatic meeting of the Senate.
Ramirez accused Kavanaugh of having shown her penis in a party where she was drunk, and which was held at a hotel at Yale's university, when they both studied there.
The U.S. President, Donald Trump, took the moderate Senate Republican pressure and instructed the FBI to conduct a study after a Thursday meeting of the Senate, at which Professor Ford, of the University of California, made extensive accusations that Kavanaugh tried to rape her at the party in 1982 when they both studied at school and were teenagers.
On Saturday, NBC News announced that the White House had restricted the scope of the FBI investigation.
A short message from Twitter was denied and declared: "I really want them to question all the people they need."
The representative of the White House, Ray Shah, said that Senate had determined the scope and duration of the FBI study (the study must be completed within a week).
“The White House allows agents to do what they are taught,” Shahas said.

Speaking at the annual Conference of the Conservative Party, Gove said that the United Kingdom would benefit from being aware of its quality food products and that the government would publish a strategy on food this year.
Europe has recovered the Ryder Cup in unit competitions
Francesco Molinari earned its glory on Sunday returning the Ryder Cup to Europe: it defeated Phil Mickelson at the 16th well and earned the necessary 14.5 result.
Mickelson took the first ball to the water at the well and Molinari was the first European to win all five match a week, although none of the previous six failed.
The victory of Europe was already guaranteed that it hit the ground and the continent was missing one point, and Henrik Stanson and Sergio Garcia were the first mache and had reached at least half the point.
At the beginning of the day they had the first result of 10:6 and had to earn four-and-a-half points of possible 12 to recover the trophy and establish their reign at home, which has continued since 1993.
Prior to that, the team managed to eliminate the four-point difference and win the unit matches only twice: this was done by the U.S. team in 1999 in Brooklyn and Europe in 2012 at the "Medina Wonder" competition, but no one expected yet another amazing return.
Justin Thomas, Webb Simpson and Tony Finau gave Jim Furyk the hope of winning the first match, but then European team points came across the square.
Thorbjjorn Olesen broke Jordan Spieth, and the newer Jonas Rahm – Tiger Woods: the sportsman who won 14 important titles lost four out of four.
Ian Poulter, the best player in the Ryder Cup, has probably received, mostly from the ovations this week, when the world's best player, Dustina Johnson, landed him in the 18th rind floor and brought Europe closer to the victory.
Then just had to wait, which match will end first, and it was a Molinari game that caused the happy wave in the crowd, which was the biggest in the history of the event.
“RT World News”: German policemen protecting Erdogan used the Neonazi name as a code word
According to local media, secret officials in eastern Germany, holding the custody of the Turkish President Erdogan during his visit to Berlin, used the name of the infamous Neonacian extremist.
The Ministry of the Interior of the Region claimed that the criminal police of Saxony, located in eastern Germany, investigates two members of the IEK of the elite anti-terrorist team.
The men were assigned to keep the Turkish President Reepek Tayyip Erdogan on his long - awaited journey to Germany.
Officials had to work secretly, so the protocol required the use of a code name.
They chose Uwe Boehnhardt, a sadly famous neonocian who belonged to the NSU group of extremists who killed eight immigrants from Turkey at the beginning of this century, one Greek citizen and a German police officer.
The local media report that the strange code name has been learned when two policemen asked for permission to access the internal documents needed to fulfil their task.
The governing officers were quick to remove the police.
In Saxony, chief of criminal police, Petricas Kleine first responded to the news.
He said that the decision to use the Boehnhardt's name was "must have been the most stupid" and that so "the victims and their loved ones are clearly ignored".
Mr Roland Woller, Minister of the Interior of Saxony, supported this statement and called the decision "smooth, fear and totally unacceptable".
The Erdogan's Friday visit to Berlin led to many controversial assessments in Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel was criticised for accepting a leader accused of growing authoritarianism.
Merkel said that this visit was very important, "because in the event of disagreement, it is necessary to resolve them at a personal meeting".
The public heard for the first time about NSU in 2011, when Boehnhardt and his fellow Uwee Mundlas were found in the burned-out trailer home in eastern Germany.
One was believed to have killed another, and then committed suicide following an unsuccessful attempt to rob the bank in Eisenach.
Soon a third member of the Neonazii group was arrested, the last living left in Beate'a Zschaepe.
In July of this year, the German court sentenced her to live in prison for 10 accusations of murder.
She refused to contribute to the murder, but her lawyer said that the accused felt moral guilt because she did not try to stop the murder.
After the NSU scandal, the German security agency was critical.
Lawyers, activists, and relatives of victims believe that the group had many more associates.
It was also found that BfV, the German Internal Intelligence Agency, has infiltrated a large number of informants into the NSU and has continuously prevented the investigation of group-related murders, murders and robbery.
Muskas is taking the position of Chief of Tesla and will have to pay $ 20 million penalty to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Elon Muskas agreed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which brought him to trial for Twitter fraud, in which he said he would make Tesla a private company.
Musk will have to withdraw from the position of head, but the Director-General will remain.
The documents of the agreement state that Muskas must leave his office as chairman of Tesla’s board of directors within 45 days and will be prohibited from returning to these positions for three years.
And he'll have to pay $20 million.
Everything started with a message from Twitter that was through negligence or deliberately written misleadingly, so Muskas will have to obtain confirmation in advance before saying or announcing a "Tesla" in any format, including, but not limited to, recordings in the social media (e.g., Twitter), corporate website (e.g. company blog), press releases and calls to investors."
Tesla will have to pay another $20 million because he didn't check Musk's initial Twitter messages.
In a complaint from the Securities and Exchange Commission Muskas was accused of misleading investors on 7 August by Twitter, in which he claimed that he had found funds to make Tesla a private company whose share would be worth $420 – so the company's securities cost more than 10 percent.
Musk soon withdrew his words saying that Tesla would remain public and angry with investors.
The Securities and Exchange Commission has decided that Musko's initial statement "was wrong and misleading because it was not influenced by facts".
Muskas himself explained in his blog that this error could be justified: after meeting with a representative of the Saudiian Independent Property Fund, he felt that he had reached an agreement on the funds.
It is reported that Muskas and the Securities and Exchange Commission had come close to a more lenient punishment: Muskas would have had to abandon the President's position for only two years and not be guilty, but Muskas refused this agreement on Thursday.
The price of Tesla's securities fell on Friday, and it is likely that it changed the opinion again and accepted stricter conditions.
However, according to the new agreement, like the old one, Musku does not need to confess to the fault of misleading investors.
The patriarch of Alexandria undertook to support the Canon Ukrainian Church and urged orthodox to unite
Theodore II, the patriarch of Alexandria, expressed itself on the basis of the canonical orthodox church of Ukraine, belonging to the patriarch of Moscow.
He spoke in response to the separation between the Russian Orthodox Church and Constantinople Patriarchate.
Theodore II arrived on Thursday in the city of Odessa in the south of Ukraine and met with the highest church representatives and believers in orthodox.
The patriarch of Alexandria is one of the most respected orthodox hierarchs, who descends only to the ecumenical patriarch of Constantinople.
"I came here to tell you: Do not give up orthodox churches and canonical churches," Patriarch Theodor II said.
Before visiting Odessa, he met the Polish orthodox church metropolist Savva, who also supports the Canonical Ukrainian church.
They also called for the prevention of conflicts arising from attempts to legitimise the autonomy of the Ukrainian church.
"We will always support those who seek orthodox unity," said Theodor II.
The orthodox Church recently experienced a major crisis following the decision of the Constantinople Patriarchate to recognise the independence of the Ukrainian orthodox Church.
The latter belongs to the Russian Orthodox Church, also known as Moscow Patriarchate.
Constantinopolis decided to send exarchs to Kiev, thus violating a rule prohibiting one orthodox church from interfering with another.
The Eczarches are special representatives of the patriarch who formally hold a higher position than the metropolitan of Onufrey, who is the current head of the Ukrainian orthodox church of Moscow Patriarchate.
The Moscow Patriarch reacted violently to the actions of Constantinople and removed all common church services and membership in organizations led or co-chaired by representatives of Constantinopoly.
However, it is claimed that in this decision Constantinopolis was warned not to take other hostile actions and that both churches were not considered to have completely ceased the bonds.
Of the three churches located in Ukraine, only one other church is recognized – the Ukrainian orthodox church belonging to the Moscow Patriarchate.
The majority of Ukrainian clergy recognize its authority, but the government has always openly supported one of the separate churches – the Ukrainian orthodox church owned by Kiev's Patriarchate, which arose in the 1990s.
This religious movement even has a patriarchal head Filaret who seeks the official recognition of the orthodox church, full independence and equality with the Moscow patriarch.
Damascus opened for the first time in three years a major Syrian-Jordan trade player
According to the State News Agency SAANA, the Syrian Government has claimed to open a crossing of the Nasibo border border border border bordering Jordan, which has been closed for three years due to the actions of the war in this area.
This can be done because the fighters on the Syrian side abandoned the land at Daraa's city.
Nasiba is the most important trade link not only between neighbouring countries, but also between Lebanon and the Gulf.
Key thoughts from Lavrov's UN speech
During his visit to the UN Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov attacked the West for “political blackmail and brutal force” and said that diplomacy should not surrender to dictatorship and unilateral sanctions.
On Friday at the UN General Assembly, Minister said that some Western countries are putting pressure on others in an effort to maintain “the positions of world leaders themselves”, without a conscience.
He did not name specific countries, but he said they use "political blackmail, economic pressure and brutal force".
The world has to pay a high price for the selfish ambitions of a small group of countries.
Lavrov, representing Russia in the UN for ten years, said at the meeting that diplomacy and negotiation culture were being replaced by dictatorships and unilateral sanctions, which were applied without the approval of the UN.
The Minister said that the sanctions imposed on many countries were "illegal or ineffective" and recalled the blockade that the USA has had for many years against Cuba.
"But history has taught us nothing," said Lavrov, adding that "The supporters of the West tend to blame only if it is "very likely".
We remember how such unjustified accusations often justified interference and wars, such as the 1999 bombings in Yugoslavia, the 2003 invasion in Iraq and the 2011 intervention in Libya."
Of course, Lavrov mentioned not all Western invasions and reminded of Syria's seven-year war as one of the latest instances.
Failure by extremists to turn the Damascus regime into an attempt could be disastrous for the whole country, opening the way for the establishment of a "terorist caliphate".
Lavrov praised the Astana peace process, which was jointly initiated by Russia, Turkey and Iran, and claimed that this process helped to prevent the Islamic State (IS, previously called ISIS) and other groups who wanted to take hold of the whole of Syria.
The most important thing now is to rebuild the destroyed areas of the country and to help refugees return to their homes safely.
Lavrov returned to the struggle of great forces and said that the UN was indeed established “after learning from the Second World War”.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Russia recalled that in 2018 there was an 80-year anniversary of the signing of the "glorious" Munich Treaty since 1938, whereby France and Great Britain agreed to allow the Nazis to annex the German part of Czechoslovakia to calm Hitler.
Although the then British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain said that the Munich Treaty "has brought peace to these times", a year later the war began.
"Munchen's betrayal" shows how far can lead to "the egoism of the countries and the disregard of international law", said Lavrov.
"The dictatorship and coercion of the colonial era must be in the history archive or waste bin."
Moscow believes that constructive dialogue can solve global problems, said Lavrov.
“If you have questions or concerns, sit down and talk, disclose facts, listen to your fellow arguments and try to reconcile your interests.”

RT World News: Israel's nuclear weapons are covered by fog, and Bibi's finger buffs into Iran
The Israeli Prime Minister said in the speech of the UN General Assembly that Tehran had secret nuclear weapons.
It may be that Israel, indicting others, conceals something himself.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyhu, who loves the submitted presentation, revealed news on Thursday, showing high photographed pictures of places where Iran has allegedly considered nuclear material.
Tehran replied, for a long time, that Tel Aviv would rather take care of its "undeclared nuclear weapons programme".
Although Israel has never accepted (but has not denied) nuclear weapons, RT journalist Murado Gazdiev tried to find out whether Tel Aviv should actually look for a cellar in his own eye.
Scottish Government: No complaints against Alexo Salmondo pending before January
The Scottish Government claimed that no complaints were recorded against Alex Salmondo before January of this year.
Two accusations of sexual harassment against the former first minister in January, although he strongly denies them.
He was notified of the investigation in March.
Salmon, who resigned from the Scottish National Party, brought an action against the Scottish Government regarding the complaint proceedings against him.
In response to the claim that one complaint was first dealt with in 2013, the Scottish Government stressed that no complaints were recorded by January.
A representative of the Scottish Government said: “The Scottish Government received two complaints regarding Alex Salmondo in January.
We could ignore them or hide them.
In the past, the first Deputy Minister received no complaints about Alexo Salmondo and, as we said, the first Minister heard for the first time about the investigation from Alexo Salmondo in April 2018.
We are convinced of the legality of our processes and will persevere in defending our position.
The Scottish Government will endeavour to obtain as much information as possible within the time available.
However, as we have already said, we cannot comment more on the Salmon case at the moment for legal reasons."
Alex Salmondo’s representative said: “We will not comment because our petition is now being dealt with at a hearing before a permanent secretary and we hope that a decision will be taken soon.
We'll talk to court.
Our aim is to prove that the Scottish Government's complaint procedure against Alexa is illegal."
Glazgs crashed Dragons results 29:13: The "Warriors" player Lee Jones Spurt
Glazgs has recovered the winner title in the "Guinness Pro14" league with extra points and winning the "Dragons" Scotstoun stadium, while the coach Dave Rennie's does not hide satisfaction, but believes that the game could be more accurate.
After an unexpected defeat to the Southern Kings team in Port Elizabeth last Saturday, Rennie's changed teams asked for a try and even though she was able to collect the necessary points to stay at the top of conference A, the windless and rainy air game was certainly not smooth.
“I think we defended perfectly tonight, played on the right side of the square, and our strategy was good,” said Rennie.
“We have to play more effectively and have been able to take advantage of more opportunities.
The conditions were unfavourable.
We have created many opportunities and are happy to do so.
You need to play more accurately, but 40 or 50 points earned today would not have been a good result.
We had to try.
We won extra points, but next week we need to make more effort to play at home with "Zebre" and next week with "Saracens" in Europe."
Although the air was winded, the Glasgo team early began to score points, but the TMO caught all the lost balls of Huwo Jones, including the inner hand of his caught Niko Matawalu in the left corner.
It took a long time for the disappointment: the left column Olis Kebble broke out in the middle of the fourth minute, and Adam Hastings easily caught the drop.
"Dragon" reduced the difference when Arwell Robson got a fine and turned the safety to another player immediately after 20 minutes the mark and the wolves scored a point.
The game after the pretty quiet first half ran off almost after the half-hour: Glasgow attackers consistently attacked the Dragons line, then a judge from South Africa Stuart Barry took a 22 minute to punish the wolves for the side of Hastings.
Warriors took the floor, but lost the ball after a smooth transmission, because the left edge of the left side of Matawalu could not control the ball and it was passed on to the left.
The second test was carried out two minutes after the interval: Hastings beat the Dragons line and wisely passed the ball away to Lee Jones.
The ball was returned to Hastings in his position and the result became 12:6 on the side of the game.
The first minute of the second half was a great success: the Alexo Dunbar ball was destroyed by Lee Jones for the second attempt and was assisted by Hastings.
However, Warriors did not succeed – after just four minutes they took the ball in the middle of the square and Adam Warren, the "Dragons" center, took him through the gate, making points, and later he took over Josh Lewis in the open game with Robson.
Warriors quickly returned to their leading position and, at 54 minutes after the fourth test, gained extra points when Huwa Jones went to the right and Hastings failed to pass the ball (this was the third failure of the four tests).
Glazga maintained a comfortable position and conducted the fifth test a few minutes later – Dunbar passed the ball after the struggle with George Horne, and Hastings won points.
Kebble is the best match player, but Rennie praised Hastings.
"They obviously prevented us from playing, but we opened in the middle," said the coach.
“ He missed a few meters, but he was slippery and still managed to get away.
It's good-shaped and you trust yourself."
Ayr United won Morton's results 1:5: Five stars Ayr crashed the host team
Lawrence Shankland and Craig Moore won two shots, and Declan McDaid added one more, thus helping Ayr to stay at the top of the championship table.

Players from Grinok's fourth second chair minute had the chance to pull ahead when Doohan got to Gary Oliver, but Michael Tidser launched a weak fine, which was easily caught by the goalkeeper.
Ayr passed the rivals for the second time on the 74th minute when the replacement long distance of Craig McGuffie was shot in the air and when he fell on the ground was sent to the gate by another substitute player Craig Moore.
Moore passed the ball over the same minute to Shankland, which beat 17 this season.
When the honorers slayed, Moore returned to his quarter of the edge of the site, and McDaidas sent the glittered ball to the gate.
Alloa and Falkirk have ended the match with 0:2: the first youth victory in the league
"I'm glad, I feel happy, I'm happy," said Ray McKinnon, extolled after the necessary first Falkirk victory in the league and earned season points.
Rangers borrowed attacker Zakas Ruddens (18 years) won a victory in both chairs and pushed the host team Allosa Athletic to the bottom of the championship and freed the club from the distressing troubles.
"It was an important game for us," said McKinnon.
“We probably deserve more during the last three competitions, so it was great to score three points in a tense situation.
I'm glad we got the first points.
It would not have caused anything, but it was important for us to win."
Rudden sent a ball to Patrick Brough in the middle of the second chair in the 26th minute, when Diamond Petravičius slowly kicked a ball above the goalkeeper Neilo Parry.
“We wanted to defend ourselves firmly, but failed,” said Jimas Goodwinas, Head of Wasps.

The Royal Archives and the Hamilton Music Museum have created a world of light about King George III.
After the Queen presented a project that opened a huge archive of documents collected during Jurgis III management year, it was hoped that letters, blogs and languages will help the public to become more familiar with the crazy king.
These documents will now reach a different audience – the Royal Archives have decided to cooperate with the Vestendo Massikla quite unexpectedly.
In order to reveal the true face of the king, the Academics invited the actor "Hamiltonas" Jurgis III to view the most important documents from the reign of Queen Proproprosen.
Researchers are trying to make old manuscripts accessible to a wider audience, so the crowd of performers will be able to access digital documents.
The members of the Royal Family have already publicly supported the creation of the musical, and the Duke and Duke of Sasex will see the performance twice, although Prince Harri's ancestor is always shown on the scene.
Michael Jybson, who plays the King of Westende, said that the documents made him think and helped the audience to get to know the king whose image was formed by the musical "Hamiltonas", the film "the madness of King Jurgis" and the series for the children "Frequent stories".

It's just like the whole party's "Golden" was decided by the Singy.
Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis says that there was a lack of democracy in the inner election of the Conservatives, and the party leadership actually appointed Ingridas Šimony to the president.
"The festival of "democracy" itself, however, was strange, mildly speaking, when party cream, the peak decided and actively supported one candidate.
Perhaps the second candidate had no chance to win even theoretically," Sskvernelis said to journalists in the government
"Conservators have appointed their candidate, and we congratulate them," the Prime Minister added.
The "National Green" delegate said that I. Simmony should be judged by voters who remembered her work at Andrius Kubilius Government.
S. Skvernelis does not comment at this stage on whether he himself will attend the presidential elections.
The Lithuanian Peasant and Green Union intends to approve its candidate next year.
President of the Governing "Nationals" named the Conservative election Ramūnas Karbauskas 'a failed experiment' due to the low activity of the partymen.
"First of all, we must welcome the experiment, which has failed in absolute terms.

Knowing what money was needed to organise those elections, it is clear accordingly that this has failed," Mr Karbauskas said to the news portal delfi.lt.
"I think the costs will not justify the result, because the result is no, the party decided that their candidate is so - all right, but for whom to spend both money," he added.
During the week of the internal elections, 79% of the Conservatives' members and their supporters voted in favour of Mr Simmonytė's candidacy.
Lithuanian wage laughs at Estonians: one area can change everything
This year, according to a study by Baltic Salary Survey, wages increased mostly in Estonia.
Lithuania and Latvia have not been far behind their neighbours, according to the company's press release.
"The survey of 850 companies and the changes in remuneration in the Baltic States shows that monthly pre-tax wages in Lithuania increased by 81.8% of employees this year and on average increased by 7.7 percent, while annual wages with accessories increased by 10.5 percent.
Latvia has slightly overturned us - and there has been a slightly higher annual salary here, but, as in Estonia, a smaller number of employees compared to our country," said Povilas Blusius, the company's representative for the remuneration investigation, adding that, with such wage trends, the general economic performance of the country, which dictates them, should also be taken into account.
The fastest wage growth in Estonia
Although salaries increased in Latvia and Estonia to a lower proportion of employees than in Lithuania, the increase was higher.
In Latvia, annual wages increased by 71% of the employees of the companies surveyed and reached a slightly higher rate than in our country by 11%.
In Estonia, pay rose by 73% of employees this year and on average increased by 13%.
Workers' change is also strongly affected by wage growth, as replacement jobs can be much higher than in previous jobs.
For those who have not changed their jobs in Lithuania in recent years and who have remained in office, the annual remuneration has increased by 8.8% - here, more often than in other Baltic countries, as well as additives.
In neighbouring Latvia, respectively, the annual wage growth of these employees was only 3.6 percent.
Estonia remains the leading player in the Baltic countries, not only as the average wage of young, but also long-term employees.
For those who remained neither in the workplace nor in the position, the pay here was the fastest: the monthly rate of 6%, the annual rate of 9 percent included the supplement.
According to the specialist in the remuneration studies, these trends often depend on, or go hand in hand with, the general economic indicators of the country: inflation or GDP growth, projections, sovereign policies, prevailing market conditions.
For example, forecasts of the economic downturn ahead of us encourage businesses to behave with caution and invest less.
The dominant and fastest-growing sectors of the country, such as information technology, construction, pharmaceuticals, can also rise in general statistics and overshadow smaller developments.
The biggest tax burden on Latvians
It is also important to take account of the different tax systems in these countries when comparing the rise in remuneration.
In Latvia, employees pay the largest share of taxes depending on salary - as much as 31 or 34%, which can increase to 42.4% for more earners.
For example, the 24 percent rate in Lithuania is stable, so higher wage growth in Latvia allows employees to grow at the same rate or even lower than in Lithuania.
Estonia has a tax rate similar to 23,6 percent in Lithuania, so we find the most favourable labour taxation in the Baltic States in this country.
In the field of IT - the most competitive wages
According to a study carried out in all the Baltic States, almost independently of the level of responsibilities, the position of IT specialists remains among the best paid.
The opposite situation in retail trade is the market indices of positions in this area, which makes employees earn lower than the average income of the market.
Compared to the previous year, the fastest wage growth was achieved by engineering professionals with higher positions, as well as by risk management professionals.
This increase in remuneration this year did not outweigh some of the IT positions - a large part of the organisation's information security specialists' monthly salary increases to as much as 14%.
Meanwhile, wages remained relatively stable in retail sales.
However, some companies have successfully restructured their remuneration systems, leading to an annual bonus salary of about 2 percent.
According to wage specialists, the trend is that wage growth is dictated by the need of the most demanding specialists – in the Baltic States, the demand of systems analysts continues to grow.
Ariana Grande again suffers — a former cowardice does not stop a mockery
After his divorce with Ariana Grande, the disgusted Pete Davidson pours out his pain by creating jokes about their relationship.
By participating in "Saturday Night Live" he chose to laugh at how it is falling into serious relationships too quickly.
The fans say that it is true, that in just three weeks ago Arian and Pete cancelled their engagement, which occurred just a few months later.
Pete tried to create scenarios that mention his failed relationships, but this will happen a little later on the screen.
The rumors tell us that the humorist who comes out of his former relationship irritated Aryan himself.
Such pranks hurt her and are not at heart.
At least this is the case for the foreign news portal TMZ was told by secret sources.
White or brown: Dietologist recommends choice of sugars
White or brown?
Which sugar should you choose?
The survey of shopping centers revealed that although Lithuanians still tend to choose white sugar traditionally, it is surprising that many Lithuanians refuse this white-death ingredient at all.
The fact that the brown sugar sales are growing is also not hidden by the representatives of the commercial networks.
According to the representative of "Maximas", brown sugar is becoming increasingly popular and nationals are buying it more and more, although common, white sugar is increasingly the first choice.
Organic sugar sales are also growing in specialised organic product shops.
One of the most popular products there is coconut sugar.
According to nutritionist Dalio Vaitkevičius, the main difference is the price, and the harmful health effects can both have.
"Red unrefined sugar is three times more expensive, but in health terms these sugars are multiplied by their excess consumption is harmful to the body," said D. Vaitkevičiūtė.
To live without sugar, the diet recommends a slight reduction in the amount of sugar in the daily routine.
This - the benefits - will fall and unwanted kilograms, and health will improve.
The month will be less consistent with the use of sugar, and it will be easier to withdraw from it at all.
"Every habit we form about a month's time, so when we have an experiment like this, let's say, when we take a sugar-free product for a month - coffee or tea, we will see how positive it works and I think everyone can give up a little bit of effort," ideological advice.
Doctors claim that white sugar has not been mentioned for death: abuse of sweets can lead to obesity, diabetes, cancer, and other diseases.
It is therefore worth trying to reduce its consumption as much as possible, because it is added to many foods, even to bread.
Another "Lietkabelis" step: Lipkevičius lends to another LKL crew
The Panevezys Lietkabelis team said goodbye to Vyteni Lipkevičius - the attacker is lent to Prienai Skycop crews.
In this season, Betsafe-LKLKL V.Lipkevičius in 22 minutes dropped 6.4 points, regained 2.8 balls, performed 2 effective transfers and won 8.5 efficiency score.
FIBA Champions League 29 years old 198 cm height play statistics reached 3.8 points, 2.5 countered ball, 1.5 effective transmission and 4.8 utility score in 21 minutes of play.
In the nearest future, "Lietkabelis" will publish a new purchase that will strengthen its composition.
The trainer’s staff was joined by S.Buškevicas
Sandis Buškevica, a well-known Lithuanian assistant of the chief coach of Panevėžys "Lietkabelis" team, has become Lithuanian.
41-year-old Latvian played in the season of 2005-2006 in Vilnius "Lietuvos Rytas", and in 2014-2017 he worked in the system of this club as a trainer assistant.
In the last season S.Buškevicas trained the team of Jēkabpils "Jekkabpils".
Sports director Jonas Vainauskas invited Stepon Babrauskas to the headquarters, but he is going to continue his career as a basketball player.
The invitation was also received from Vytenis Jasikevičius, but it was not possible to reach an agreement on both sides.
S.Buškevicas "Lietkabelis" trainer's staff will work together with Robert Kuncaitis and Algimtant Bružas.
Latvis will join "Lietkabelis" on Tuesday and will be on Cido Arena through the FIBA Champions League match with Dižonas JDA, but we will not get it on the bench, as registration expired 24 hours before the start of the game.
Reducing the price of biofuels will not be good for everyone
In order to reduce biofuel prices, more deciduous trees will be crossed in Lithuania in 2019, says Minister of Environment.
According to Kęstutis Navickas, the prices of biofuel are to be "effected" in this way.
"We have a huge accumulation of certain kinds.
The need to balance (...).
The concentration on soft deciduous leaves is because we can also have some impact on biofuel prices," K. Navickas said at the Seimas on Tuesday, presenting the situation of deforestation.
According to K. Navicko, the price of wood in Lithuania has risen by about 20% this year.
According to the Minister, next year the pines will be slaughtered as much as this year, and the spruce - about 80 hectares less.
According to him, there is more wood felling in Lithuania due to favourable natural conditions.
"The next year shouldn't be," said K. Navickas.
Now 10.2 million ha of forests are state-owned, and 800 thousand ha is private.
Action against food prices is questionable: it will encourage the purchase of food only in its own area
Among the measures presented by the Ministry of Economy to reduce prices, the proposed obligation for public institutions and organisations to buy 50% of food from local producers is published by the news portal 15min.lt.
"The law would apply not only to small traders operating in the regions, but also to other suppliers of goods and services.
For example, printing services or office supplies for the buyer in municipalities could also be provided by local companies that won the tenders," Minister of Economy Virginijus Sinkevičius said to the portal.
Egidijus Mockevicius, President of the Meat Processors Association, has no doubt that this provision would discriminate against part of the entrepreneurs and it would also be difficult to control whether the pasellers are using laws.
Valdas Sutkus, the Head of the Business Confederation, criticises the measure for inconsistency.
Macron calls on Europe to defend itself against Russia and the USA
On Tuesday, French President Emmanuel Macron called for the creation of a 'real European army' which is capable of protecting itself from Russia and even the United States.
Mr Macron, who has been calling for the creation of a common European force since he came into power, says that Europe needs to reduce its dependence on American military power.
He has recently gained an important argument, as U.S. President Donald Trump announced that Washington would withdraw from the important Cold War Treaty on the nuclear force.
'We have to protect ourselves from China, Russia and even the United States,' Mr Macron said to the radio 'Europe 1'.
This is his first radio interview from the beginning of work at the president's post in May 2017.
"When I see President Trump saying that he comes from an important disarmament treaty created after the 19th decade of Europe's missile crisis, what will be the main victim? - Europe and its security," the French leader said.
The aforementioned missile crisis was caused by the ongoing non-strategic nuclear weapon development race at the end of the Cold War, through which the United States deployed ballistic missiles in Europe.
This crisis has been a key driver for concluding an ITF in 1987 with the US and the Soviet Union.
"We will not protect Europeans unless we decide to have a real European army," said Mr Macron, at an interview recorded on Monday evening in Verden in north-east France, when the President visited World War I battles this week before the 100th anniversary of the conflict.
According to Mr Macron, in the situation, 'where Russia, which is at our borders, has demonstrated that there is a potential threat... we need a Europe that is better defended by itself and not simply dependent on the United States'.
The head of France became the main initiator of the project to set up a force in nine European countries capable of organising a joint military operation, evacuation from the war zone, or providing assistance in the event of a natural disaster.
On Wednesday, the Ministers of Defence of these nine States will meet for the first time in Paris to discuss details on how these forces will work.
The European Union has also set itself to significantly increase its defence budget since 2021 and to allocate around €13 billion to research and development in seven years.
The current EU defence budget does not exceed EUR 600 million.
However, Professor Bruno Alomaro, of the French military school preparing senior officers, said that Mr Macron's vision of a closely united European defence is difficult to implement.
"The idea of creating a culture of a common strategy is not bad," he said to the news agency AFP.
- However, there is a huge gap between Europe's defence, which Emmanuel Macron is dreaming of, and reality is a major disagreement between European partners."
Lukashenko NATO threatened with missiles: we are not idiots
On Tuesday, the President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenka, stated that his country would need a new armament if NATO continued to pool its forces on the western border of Belarus.
"If NATO continues to scare, deploy bases in Poland or anything else, Belarus will need a more effective weapon, especially missiles," says the state news agency Belta, which has met a group of American analysts in Minsk.
The Head of State also noted that Belarus already has its missile industry.
"In recent times - you have noticed, and we are not hiding - we have created our missile industry and we have produced our very precise (so-called) missile armor," the President emphasised.
Last week, Lukashenka stated that Minsk and Moscow were looking for an appropriate and inexpensive response to the plans to build a base in Poland and name it to the honor of Fort Trump, U.S. President Donaldo Trump.
"Of course we are concerned about this.
If, say, they are ready to spend millions of dollars in Poland to deploy it (...) some of the short-term fort, of course, we are not idiots and of course we respond to it," said Mr Lukešenko, who took part in the discussions of the main group of the Munich Security Conference in Minsk.
"It is understood that with our main ally (Russia) we are considering how to answer all of this and how to find an appropriate response to the minimum cost," he added.
The Western relations with Moscow have been greatly affected by Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014.
Their relations are also governed by Moscow's role in the Syrian conflict and this year's fight in Great Britain, as it is believed that Russia's special services attempted to poison the former dual agent Sergey Shripal nerve paralysing material.
The tension between Moscow and Washington was further exacerbated by the announcement by Mr Trump that he was planning to withdraw from the Cold War Treaty on the regulation of nuclear weapons.
Russia warned that that step could undermine the security system of the world.
A man who carried out his murderous execution revealed how he killed his wife’s raper
Brazil was shaken by a bloody crime during which the footballer Daniel Correa Freitas was subjected to a violent execution.
The sporter was killed during the 18th anniversary of the girl's birthday.
The 24-year-old footballer was found dead in the city of Parana, south-east of Brazil.
It is announced that it has been executed in the form of killing genitals, and severe neck injuries have also been reported.
After the murder of 38-year-old Edison Brittaes Juniore, a football player, he found himself guilty and claimed that this was due to the rape of his wife Cristian Brittaes.
When he committed a murder, the Brazilian later explained in detail the fate of the night on the TV.
"The guy had already gained momentum when I realized that I had never seen my wife, Cristiana, anywhere for a long time.
I went to our bedroom, but the door was locked.
I didn't wait to break the door, and I saw Daniel and my wife laying naked in bed asking for help.
I was deadly mad.
Together with my friends who had been at the party, we put him in the field and got him to the car.
This is where I had a knife with which I ripped my wife, a raper, with whom I was dying.
I was very angry, I couldn't do anything for myself at that moment," said the murders.
Together with his friends, he threw the dead body of a footballer near the river, where police officers are looking for and the main victim of the crime tool.
The Brazilian civil police detained E.B.Junior, as well as his wife and birthday daughter.
It is said that police officers investigating the event still lack evidence that the woman was raped during the evening.
It is true that the last messages and photos of the footballer recently distributed on the occasion of the WahtsApp can help the investigation progress.
The footballer sent two pictures to one of his friends through WhatsApp in which he captured himself in bed, next to a sleeping woman, which, as it became apparent later, is the killer's wife Cristiana.
"I can sleep here.
There are many women sleeping in various home rooms.
I'm gonna eat my mother of a couper, even though her father is somewhere nearby," the footballer wrote to his friend.
Daniel Correa Freitas, a member of the Sao Paulo Club, has been lent in the second season according to capacity in Brazil's league playing Sao Bento.

The Hurts album can no longer make use of suspension
Alabama reserve pledger Jalen Hurts will no longer be suspended after this Saturday.
Hurts is included in the top-rated Crimson Tide Saturday match against a weaker team of Louisiana, which is the fifth player match this season.
This year the NACAA has applied a new rule, which allows you to suspend a player who took part in four matches.
This month Athletic announced that Hurts was planning to do this due to conflicting assessments and the staff of the team's trainers' response to them.
Tua Tagovailoa changed Hurts at the beginning of the season, but the Crimson Tide trainer Nick Saban said he was still planning to use Hurts' skills.
In the last season, Hurts helped Alabama to enter the match for the national champion's title against the Georgia team, but in the second half he was replaced by Tagovailoa, who contributed to the Crimson Tide victory result of 26:23.
Hurts, a former attacker of the South-East Conference, started the last 28 machos of Alabama and entered the season with record results — 26:2.
In Saturday competitions, Hurts completed 22 out of 31 transmissions during the first four episodes of Crimson Tide, ran 276 yards, earned four points and took the ball once.
He also ran 15 times with a ball and ran 54 yards.
Owens: Desas must immediately sign the contract
Ex-Dalas Cowboys, an attacker of the Cowboys, said about to return to NFL.
Terrell Owens, a member of the Slave Museum, said that it was better for Bryanto to be quick.
In response to a question asked by Twitter when he was about to sign a contract with his team, Bryan announced on Friday one of the words "Twitter" message: "Sustainable."
Bryant has been selected to the Pro Bowl match three times since he was rejected in the event of a wage dispute in the mid-April by Dalas Cowboys.
After potentially refusing to contract with Baltimore Ravens, Browns was associated with Cleveland, just before the season said that he wanted to improve before signing the contract with the team.
In August, Owens, who entered the museum of professional American football glory, still talking about the return to the NFL, told the site of TMZ that Bryanta should try to return to sport as soon as possible.
"He must join the team and prove to everyone what he can," said Owensas for the site.
“All surveyors think that he’s no longer tracked and he’s no longer as good as he himself thinks.
Now he has to enter the team for any salary, accept one or two years of contract – this is no matter – and show everyone what he is capable."
Dr. Dales' team in 2017 caught the ball 69 times, ran 838 yards and scored six points.
In 29th century the player in his longest career – 23rds – did not run 100 yards.
After signing a $70 million contract for five years in 2015, Bryant did not drop 1000 yards in any season and did not catch more than eight points of the ball.
“If the Director-General or the owner thinks that your skills are deteriorating, you can’t guarantee or build up the money you want”, advised Owens.
He also warned that Bryant should enter the team as soon as possible, because later this could fail and he said that it would be possible to return to the difficult-time survivors of Cowboys.
“I don’t know if their relationship is damaged,” said Owens, who earned 38 times points for the three seasons playing in the Dalas team.
"I think in the case of Dezo, if Cowboys accept it back and he gets the chance, it will be useful for Des and French."
Supposed about the establishment of CERN Business Development Centre in Lithuania
Representatives of the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN), who visited Kaunas last week, appreciate the possibilities to establish a CERN Business Development Centre in Lithuania.
Today, there are ten such business incubators in Europe where businesses receive assistance in commercialising CERN technologies, developing innovative products and adapting them to societal needs.
Although Lithuania became a member of CERN last year, the establishment of the business incubator of this organization in the country has already been suspended.
CERN representatives visited Lithuanian University of Health Sciences (LSMU) and Kaunas University of Technology (KTU) Institute of Materials Science and Biomedical Engineering in the valley of Santokas.
At the meeting, guests from the National Centre for Innovation and Business (NIVC) discussed Kaunas innovation ecosystem and opportunities for young and innovative businesses in cooperation with KTU, LSMU, Vytautas Magnus University, Lithuanian Energy Institute, Lithuanian Academy of Sciences, Ministry of Economy and Business.
The visit of the CERN delegation is very important, because if the CERN Business Development Centre is established in Lithuania, it will be the only one in Central and Eastern Europe and will have a significant impact on the region's innovators of science and business.
"This would encourage CERN to apply the knowledge and technology gathered to solve important problems, such as new technologies and artificial intelligence, for diagnosis and treatment of diseases, processing of large data," says Dr. Leon Balaševičius, director of KTU scientific and innovation.
CERN incubators, like other new business development centres, provide assistance in business development – providing information and expert advice in adapting technologies to product development and helping to find sources of funding.
The difference is that CERN incubator is more science.
This centre includes experts from various fields in Lithuania: information technology, materials engineering, as well as specialists in the medical field.
The CERN is best known for the large hadron counter flow accelerator (LHC, The Large Hadron Collider) in Switzerland, the world's largest and most powerful particle accelerator.
However, CERN studies are carried out not only in quantum mechanics, but also in other areas, from cryogenic (high-temperature effect materials) to particle monitoring and radiation studies.
These technologies and the work carried out by scientists have many implications for society: medicine, safety and industrial development.
"Vilniaus brandy" has a new manager
The producer of butterflies appointed Rokas Mituzas as the new CEO of AB "Vilniaus džintas" to replace Raimondas Pilkis in this position.
Since last year, the head of the company Mr. Pilkė will continue to act as the financial director of Vilnius Degut, according to a report distributed through the Nasdaq Vilnius Stock Exchange.
Mr. Mituzas is co-founder of Buga LT, a sauce-producing company, indicated in his Linkedin account.
2012-2017 Mr. Mituzas served as regional director in SPI Group and previously worked in the Ruckitt Benckiser and Unilever groups.
In the first quarter of this year, "Vilniaus brandy" ended with a loss of 315.500 EUR.
Last year, the company made a profit of EUR 392.300 during the period considered.
The company’s excise duty-free sales revenue was EUR 4,956 million and decreased by 13,16% compared to the first quarter of last year.
The Vilnius burner employs more than 100 people.
STT detained R. Ača - Business knowledge
Former MP and former director of Raseiniai District Municipal Administration Remigijus Ačas suspected bribery.
He's in custody.
Special Investigation Service (STT) announces that the officers of the Board of Šiauliai carry out pre-trial investigation of possible corruption in Raseiniai district municipality.
"A suspected bribery by R. A. (Remigijus Ačas - p. p.) was the director of Raseiniai district municipal administration.
The circumstances regarding the non-transparent procurement are examined, R.A., while performing the duties of the director of the municipality - the possible exceptional advantage of concluding a public contract with an enterprise managed by the municipality of Raseiniai district for one private company.
It is suspected that Mr A. has accepted the bribe of high value (more than 250 MGL) in favour of this", says the STT press release.
BNS adds that this company is "Rassein Bus Park".
On Monday, the officials also detained Vladislovas Šiaitis, the head of the company "Raseinian Bus Park", which is suspected of corruption.
This was confirmed by the STT spokesperson for Renata Endruzytė.
The SSA report states that the suspicions also refer to two representatives of companies who bought Ač directly or who participated in the masking of bribes for the various financial operations.
All suspects are apprehended, at their workplaces and at home.
Suspended membership of the LSDD
Remigijus Ačas has for some time been the director of Raseiniai district municipality administration, but in April, following the Council's opposition to his report, he lost his office.
He was also the mayor of this district in 2011-2012. Mr Ačas - a long-term member of the Seimas, he was elected to the parliament since 2004, as a candidate for the party "Sustainability and Justice".
However, in 2013 he and the travels of this party separated, and in 2016 he could not win his own mandate in the Seimas elections.
Now, Mr Ačas is dependent on the dissenting social democrats and the newly formed Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party (LSDD) led by Gediminas Kirkil.
Shortly after the presentation of this message, Kirkilas, President of the LSDD, informed the press that Mr Ačas temporarily suspended his membership of the party until the investigation took place.
"The actions of the Special Investigation Service and the suspicions of Remigijus Ačuis are unpleasant surprise for us, but in all cases it is necessary for the law enforcement to take all the necessary steps to be able to find the truth.
R. Ačas suspended his membership in the party until the pre-trial investigation is taking place," says LSDD leader Kirkilas.
In 2003, Mr. Ačas was advisor to the then President, Roland Paks, who was subsequently removed from office on national security issues, and head of a group of advisers.
Mayor A. Gricius: I did not directly control the work of Mr Ačas
Mayor of the Nei Raseiniai district Algirdas Gricius and current head of municipal administration Liudas Kavaliauskas BNS said on Monday that he did not have any information regarding the specific purchase that law enforcement investigation might be involved.
Mayor Gricius said about the arrest of Mr Ačas when he learned from the media.
"I can't tell you, we were very limited in terms of functions, I worked as a mayor in my work, he (Ačas - BNS) - the work of administration, and I couldn't say either for what reasons or for what public procurement this case was made," the mayor said to the BNS on Monday.
He also claimed that, for the same reasons, he did not wish to assess Mr Ačo’s former leadership of the municipal administration.
I would be afraid to say something that I could appreciate his work, because I did not directly control his administrative work, as far as public procurement was concerned, when I was presented with tenders, and said that such public procurement took place, such tenders, and then contracts awarded in public space, which I already saw as a mayor.
I cannot therefore describe how he led the administration at the time as her director," said Mr Gricius.
He said he did not intervene in public procurement and did not influence them.
New advisor to the team of the Minister of Culture
The team of advisors to the Minister of Culture, Liana Rookytė-Jonsson, was complemented by Dr. Joseph Blaziūnas.
He consults on issues related to the management of archives, libraries, museums and cultural heritage.
The Ministry of Culture reports that Blažiūnas from 2016 until now was the director of the Lithuanian Literature and Art Archives, associate professor at the Faculty of Communication of Vilnius University.
By the way, in 2017 students of Vilnius Faculty of Communication selected Mr. Blaziūnas as the best teacher of the faculty.
The new minister's advisor is the author of many scientific articles on the issues of heritage and the preservation of values.
The Left Does Not Stop
The VŽ recalls that this May the team of Minister of Culture Rookytė-Jonsson was left by advisor Dr. Viktoras Bachmetjevas, who advised the Minister on issues related to the public information policy, and was also responsible for media literacy and strategic communication.
On 2 October, Renaldas Augustinavičius announced his resignation from the post of Deputy Minister of Culture.
He was responsible for cultural heritage, archives, museums and libraries.
Then Mr Rookytė-Jonsson said that the new vice-minister of her choice was fueling the same areas as Mr Augustinavičius.
Currently, apart from Mr. Augustinavicius, the team of ministerial advisors that takes over the area by Mr. Blaziūnas, consists of Rita Grumadaitė, Evaldas Stankevičius, Egidijus Gailiūnas, Rūsnė Rinkevičienė and Eglė Sadargaitė, chief adviser.
S. Gentvilas: Indestructive GPIS business is threatened with EUR 90 million fines
The Vice-President of the Seimas Environment Protection Committee Simon Gentvilas says that due to poor operation of the Products, Packaging and Waste Accounting Information System (PEIS) Lithuanian producers and importers may have to pay almost EUR 90 million in fines at the end of the year.
"The systemic crisis in the packaging sector is becoming more realistic as the end of the year and in the absence of a normal functioning of the GPIS system.
Informally, it is said that certificates confirming the handling of packaging waste, issued in just 1% of the intended recycling tasks," Mr. Gentvilas states in the press release.
On 7 November, the Seimas initiated an extraordinary meeting of the Committee on Environmental Protection to discuss the situation, to find out why the functions of this programme are not working, why the programme module is not actually implemented and how the Ministry of Environment intends to address the problem.
"Without the necessary legislative or legislative change initiatives, manufacturers and importers risk receiving huge environmental taxes again at the end of this year," says Mr. Gentvilas.
In his view, the shortcomings and inaction of the postal accounting system signal the serious crisis in the packaging waste management sector, which can be compared to the Metrail crisis.
Problems of concern
The fact that some companies may not be able to meet the state-run recycling targets for packaging waste in 2018 is also warned by some experts.
After the first half-year recycling performance of organisations has been made public, the experts confirm that there is a reason to worry that some organisations may fail to handle the required amount of packaging waste in 2018.
As a result, some companies may not be able to benefit from the pollution tax exemption and receive the pollution tax for a certain amount of their packaging placed on the market during the year.
The GOC stated that two out of three producer organisations currently operating are rejecting such fears and that one does not provide any comments.
Kęstutis Pocius, the Director General of the largest organisation VšĮ Green Point, said that at least formally, whether or not the tasks will be overcome depends on the solution to the problems of the product, packaging and waste accounting system.
Green Point plans to overcome all types of packaging management tasks this year, except glass.
Although glass will fail this year for the Green Point, the organisation promises to compensate members for the losses they incur.
Experts question the benefits of food vouchers
As the government plans to share coupons for less well-equipped people in order to promote family or farmers' businesses, experts question the benefits of such an innovation.
They agree that the new system would create an additional bureaucratic burden.
Marius Dubnikov, head of the Tax Commission of the Lithuanian Business Confederation, says that coupons are out of date and problems will not be solved, and the Government should focus on increasing people's income.
"The system seems rather strange and as if taken from older textbooks.
If we want to help the public to buy something or have greater purchasing power, we need to focus all our capacities on how to increase people's income and people themselves have to decide whether to buy one or another shop," BNS said Mr Dubnikov.
According to him, the Government, by offering food vouchers, would apply to people with lower incomes.
"In the case of people with lower incomes, as if there was a voucher on the tray on which it was written, yes, we, this government, gave you a voucher, and be favourable to us.
This sounds like certain pre-election promises, where you want to make your signature very clear," analyst said.
According to him, the food voucher system will require additional investment and will increase the administrative burden as it will need to monitor who and how they allow them, how they are protected against counterfeiting.
The chief economist in Swedbank, Nerijus Mačiulis, says that one instrument would fail to achieve both objectives - to support low-income residents and small entrepreneurs.
"If this is support for small businesses, the aid of vouchers compensates for price differences and the population can buy more expensive goods in smaller shops, then the difference in prices is compensated by the State from budgetary resources.
Then it is support for business, but not support for the population," - BNS said Mr. Mačiulis.
In his view, such a system would probably not have a significant macro-economic impact and would not substantially alter the competitive situation of small shops, on the contrary, create an additional bureaucratic burden and may hamper the arrival of new entrants.
"It is similar that this would be a quite bureaucratic instrument with high administrative costs, and the population would also be quite uncomfortable, they should shop in a not-big shop with a larger range of houses closer to, but to look for several specialised shops with a smaller range," said an economist.
According to him, in other countries coupons are used when there is limited volume of goods or services to be provided in the same way to all, or to some social group.
The residents then get coupons free of charge and can spend them on food.
According to Mr Mačiulis, they are also used in the labour market by providing temporary tax relief to enterprises, employing long-term unemployed, or, for example, former prisoners.
This practice, Mr Mačiulis said, was successfully applied in Lithuania.
Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis said on Monday that the new system of food vouchers under discussion by the Government would help the poorest people, increase competition, encourage small businesses and farmers.
Prime Adviser Dividant Malinauskas BNS said on Monday that the idea is most oriented to farmers and family businesses, and buyers with coupons could get a 20-30 percent discount.
According to him, the amount of coupons would be limited to prevent abuse by farmers.
According to him, 3-5 coupons would allow a person to benefit from 10-15 euros per month.
According to him, although the state budget for the programme is not yet available, it could be financed from this source, perhaps also from the European Union funds.
"Not everything that is currently scheduled or not foreseen in the budget will be in the final, yet it will change in the Seimas, so it happens, there may be funds from one line transferred to another, and from ministries, there may be funding items for the exchange.
There is always a fight of priority, as it would be self-determination - whether by refusing something, finding another additional source of income and so on," BNS said on Tuesday, Mr Malinauskas.
So far, the extent to which the innovation can be applied and the time from which it will be possible to apply it.
