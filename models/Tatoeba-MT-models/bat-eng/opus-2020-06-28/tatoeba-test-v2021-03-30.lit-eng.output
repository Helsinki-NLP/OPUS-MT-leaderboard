Sooner or later we will all die.
How long will it take?
It's a shadow.
Where is the Embassy of Germany?
Be friendly.
This rose is amazing.
But he knew that he couldn't continue.
Probably not.
I want it, too!
She looks but she can't see anything.
He can't eat anything sweet today.
She's eating.
I'd like to travel around the world.
Do you like Italian?
I got five years in prison.
I'm not the one.

Please?

Why did you call?
They discussed the problem.
If I didn't get his help, I would be dead.
He was almost asleep.
I have one brother.
Why did you come here?

Isn't it strange that Thomas isn't here right now?
Millions of people lost their lives during the war.
Compare your sentence with that on the board.
She met him joyfully.
They need our help.
Did you get Tom's message?
I don't like how he speaks.
I don't know what's going on with me anymore.
I learned a lot from him.
He killed that man.
Don't expect (n't wait) too much.
That brown hat is old.
He's playing golf every Sunday.
Be creative.
I couldn't understand what he said.

Where the hell are you going?
He promised me he would be more cautious in the future.
When did you hear the shot?
I forgot to buy one pillow.
I've heard a lot about you.
Don't come out now, we're going to eat lunch.
Italy is a very beautiful country.
It's an old brainless man.
Eat bread!
Although he lives in the United States, Thomas is not free to speak English.

I gave my guns.
Who ate all our food?
I know her bread will be delicious.
Please come.
Women are changing the world.
Singapore spitting on the floor is a criminal offence.

I don't understand German.
Yes, please.
I'll help you.
You're guilty.
What are you looking for?
What does that mean?
The apples on the other side of the wall are sweet.
Who's that?
I'm studying Japanese.
It's pointless.
She had a woman's head, a lion's body, a bird's wings, and a snake's tail.
Tell me how you solved the problem.
Would you like to dance with me?
Even if I wanted to, I could not explain what happened there.
I'm afraid of heights.
I don't know where to go.
If it doesn't happen, then let's go.
What's going on with me?
I agree.
Compare facts.

It's at least a story.
Have you mentioned any sport?
It's time you started a new business.
Let's wait here.
The girl I told you about who I was living here.
Please, just leave.
I can't believe she's older than my mother.
Look back and see a black cat.
His family traveled a lot.
Do you know him?
I don't know if to turn left or right.
I'll clean the kitchen later.
He came from a small town in the mountains.
I talked to my friends.
All your cats are gray.
I also remember the times when we were preparing with you to get up.
When we go to sleep, we say good night.
Skydal ruined his career.
Cats are complex individuals.
He was so poor that he could not buy bread.
I suggest that you ask Thomas.
This bag is not small.
There's nothing wrong with that.
If you invite him, he'll probably come.
I know you know I know.
Go home six.
It's fresh bread.
I'll be back in half an hour.
I don't want to be any more evil.
Are you a lawyer?
Where's your school?
The candles lit the room.
I'm sorry.
Fold the paper in half.

He drew a straight line on the wall.
You need a car?
Take off your hat when you get in the class.
They don't do anything but complain.
She rushed.
Please contact me when you come to Boston.
Thomas arose at 7:00.
This one is for us.
I'm listening to the radio.
The boy wants to know the truth.
Thomas ate the whole pizza alone.
You have to take care of yourself.
You need patience, Tom.
How are you?
Your trip starts here.
Can you believe what he said?
Tom asked where you were.
I'd like to help, but I'm very busy.
Tom couldn't stop thinking about Mary.
I think we should call Tom.
Don't be late on the bus.
All the apples are there.
You're gonna have to pay.
When should we go to the station?
The more I think about it, the less I like it.
I'll take you to a new store.
Everyone knows her.
She's incredibly naive.
Where are you living in Turkey?
Tom's gone.
I can't.
Get out of the class.
Three dogs sleep on the mother’s carpet.
Thomas has already finished his job.
If you can't have children, you can always get adopted.
That's exactly what I thought.
Although she ran as fast as she could, she still missed the bus.
They need friends.
Beef, please.
Can you wrap it as a gift?
You like to live like this?
It's hot today, isn't it?
Are you sure you don't have a home?
Are you playing chess?
Her boyfriend is Turk.
You tell me.
My mother can't come.
There are a lot of brewers in Bavaria.
Do you know if he has a girlfriend?

He did it.
He came into my room without permission.
You can't just leave.
Come on, move!
You can sit on the chair.
Where are you living if you don't have a home?
Our union can be perfect.
He told me I could use his car.

Did you understand what he said?
What color are her hair?
The sooner you return to that happiness your father will be.
Are you ready to start your journey?
Your watch is late for ten minutes.
They deceived you.
I thought you said she was yours.

We believe in God.

What is the price of the room?
We have to drive from here.
Thomas never wants to do it again.
I asked her to wait a minute.
How long did you start learning esperant language?
They're not a threat.
Her advice moved me to a foreign country.
You're the only one who can help me.
Where are those places on the tour?
That's why we're playing inside.
Your carpet is completely white.
But I don't want to.
I'm sorry I can't meet you tonight.
Thomas has a sister who is a lawyer.
I'm like my mother.
You look really charming tonight.
Doctor, can you hear me?
You know, don't you?
I hope to see him on Monday.
Thomas is ready.
It's hot, so be careful you don't want to protect yourself.
Did you find your letters?
For God's sake!
He doesn't remember if the room was empty or not.
The shop sells expensive accessories for women.
I don't like making mistakes.
It's not them.
I'm not getting up early.
Stay where you are.
The house is her.
The doctor advised him to stop doing so much work.
Are you sure?
You were busy.
I can't live like this anymore.

I just want to talk.
What music Thomas loves?
That tree grew up near her house.
Do not speak in a reader.
How are you, miss?
I'd change yen to dollars.
I hate winter.
I think Thomas is going to kill Mary.
There are only two correct answers.
If I were rich, I would have given you some money.
When and where did you meet her?
Where did you curse them?
Tom didn't show up.
Don't be so serious, it's just a game.
He told me a funny story.
I don't have time now.
Tom's the captain of our team.
This carpet is very long.
Listen to what the teacher says.
Why don't anyone eat my potatoes?
I asked Tom to play guitar.
What does that remind you?
She literally translated it.
What a great night!
I can't find Tim.
She called him Charles.
I'm not sure it's a boy or a girl.
Life is beautiful.
She takes them to school.
Tatoeba was temporarily unavailable.
Nobody believed what you said.
I didn't know what to say.
Do you think I should go alone?
Just answer the question.
I never want anyone to be in debt.
Look at the train passing through the bridge.
I'm not the only one who loves Thomas.
Now I'm really bored.
No, I don't think I'm guilty.
Where are we?
I'm a Cherry forty-five.
Her hat looked funny.
Don't bother her, she's too young to understand.
I bought this suit just for this occasion.
This is similar.
Be careful, okay?
That is the only explanation.
I can't believe I'm really here.
Don't you know the way?
I love it so much.
Tom'll need help.
I published a hundred pages.
I see and hear.
Don't forget your ticket.
Pick up your hand before replying.
Please change the flag.
Isn't it true you have a gun?
I was in bed all day yesterday.

When spring comes, the days become longer day after day.

Who stole this apple?
He lost his ticket to the film.
What would you do if you were in his place?
I don't like summer.
By the way, what's your address?

It has green eyes and light brown hair.
Does Thomas have any experience?
She left her umbrella on the train.
I'm a vegetarian.
You must definitely go there.
Why?
I can't see anything from here.
Since I did not receive the answer, I wrote her again.
She's standing behind the wall.
Don't expect too much of me.
They missed a great opportunity.
Fight for your right.
He's always talking to me when he meets me on the street.
Look at the book on the table.
I drank one of the beer and put myself on very drunk.
Thomas did not think he needed a security guard.
Somebody opened the door.
Do you have any questions about this lesson?
We saw her entering the park.
It doesn't seem like you'd be busy.
It didn't look like you wanted that book.
I have a red bike.
It's low and thick.
I want to go to Tokyo.
The journey was troublesome.
He's much smarter than me.
Thomas doesn't look interested.
The weather is terrible today.
I didn't want this to happen.

As I said, I will not do anything.
After that, there is a small brown pup.

She continued her speech.
Mike doesn't know how to play baseball.
The camels are often used while traveling in the wilderness.
Mary is a bookstore.
Good weekend.
I saw his car in the window.
Are you ready?
I'm happy I'm not a woman.
Stop wasting time and get back to work.
The more, the better.
Ten years is a long time.
Is that your car?
I can't believe you're still hungry.
It is normal that we want to be happy.
We have to move very carefully.
Did you get Tom's message?
I felt a pain last night.
If I were rich, I would have given you some money.
I don't have a computer at home.
My father doesn't eat much.
Can you give me a discount?
She kissed my cheek and wished my best night.
My friend's here.
Where are you now?
The older you are, the more difficult it is to learn the language.
Tom doesn't drink coffee, but he smokes cigarettes.
Not all people like dogs.
I'll stay here for a few days.
I feel bad.
Why did you say that stupid thing?
You can't defeat me.
I don't think I can do that.
Is that true?
She's crying.
See you in hell.
He is my father.
He doesn't want to wait for you.
He took his family to the zoo.
Thomas refused to go to the hospital.
Sixty-nine.
This car was manufactured in Japan.
Is this your first time in Japan?
Tony was happy.
My father asked me to open the door.
Make his photorobot!

I was in Canada then.
I made this food myself.
Write the pencil.
Somebody wrote his name on the wall.
Anyone who can turn in the wrong way will get the wrong one.
They don't have any sugar anymore.
I love your daughter.
Thomas hope he will not eat again tonight.
Somebody opened the door.
I'm not your mother.
Why isn't Tom in the car?
My name is Ricardo.
When did you get a telegram?
You shouldn't sail in that pond.
When will the snow melt?
He thought who I was really tired.
I think she doesn't want to eat anymore.
Either you and us, or against us.
Please, help me!
Thomas knows he likes Mary.
I like this music.
She scared the dog.
He went to the store, but stopped at her house.
Snow's falling fast.
We're lunch here.
Of course I should read this book.
Thomas is not in prison at the moment.
Tom and Mary went to the museum.
The ship was gone outside the horizon.
Good morning, my dear dog.
God blesses those who repent.
I can't work when you're standing there.
Mary had problems with her lungs.
We were one big happy family.
What color of car did she buy for herself?
The child wept all night.
Do you see me?
She testified against him.
My father makes rice.
We speak Japanese.
The result was disappointing.
I climbed through the window.
Meat is not ready yet.
Give me a piece of cracks.
She needs more sleep.
Did you hear anything?
Is she your mother?
Do you want to turn the lights on?
He's no longer trusting a doctor.
It was the first time I visited the museum.
We've had a great time.
I think Thomas would like to sit down.
What a wonderful family.
Are you still in Florida?
You shouldn't have eaten that raw fish.
Tomorrow is the last day.
We looked through the window, but we didn't see anything.
When was the last time you saw Tom?
The capital of Sweden is Stockholm.
They talked about love.
Thomas never wants to do it again.
I don't understand.
Leaving alone, the child would feel very lonely.
I don't know anything here.
Our team lacked mobility.
The cat passed the street.
There's a mirror.
Why don't you want to help the police?
I want to meet your father.
Please keep going.
He was busy.
I'm a widow.
I saw him.
I've learned Lozban.
"Good morning," said Thomas smiling.
I'm hurting my hand.
He needs ladders.
You shouldn't go.
You shouldn't trust him.
One week there are seven days.
You have to take your own way of life.
Without air and water, no one could live.
He slipped and almost collapsed.
They work eight hours a day.
I eat and drink.
I do this every Sunday morning.
She soon opened the letter.
Are you busy right now?
I got everything I said.
Where do you have all the keys?
I got inside the window.
Get Thomas to the hospital.
I have a white cat.
He quickly wrote our names.
Our son died during the war.
He is dissatisfied with the result.
Of course you're wrong.
I can't tell who's coming first.
I don't want to talk to you because you broke my heart.
Don't trust him.
We may as well be all go
Who is that person sitting at the other end of the table?
This idea is very attractive.
They're going shopping.
All that's genetic is simple.
Her students learn too much.
Thomas raised his hand.
Put on your boots, let's go for lunch.
The birds flew south.
This tea is very delicious.
I don't agree with him.
I'm guilty.
Not bad, but I'm a little tired.
This is an amazing idea.
He's very proud of his toy.
That's enough for us to do.
I'm not afraid at all.
The woman wants to know the truth.
Is this word often used?
Lithuania joins the European Union.
I want to be a speaker.
Where's the cat?
I'm sorry for what I did.
She's become a fiancée.
I learned to ride a bike when I was six.
He took out a piece of cracks.
Let me do that.
I like jazz.
I'm sure he's innocent.
Open the window and add fresh air.
Have you ever made a saga?
It's hard to singe.
Have you seen my mom?
I know his name.
Thomas doesn't want to live like that.
Do you agree with what it does?
He came here before the end of the class.
Do you know their address?
What the hell are you doing?
He looked down at his dirty shoes.
Her cat lay on my pillow and didn't want to get off.
There are several good hotels in the city.
From whom is this letter?
He doesn't want to learn today.
We're all different.
You don't know how much I love you.
I wrote a long letter to her.
He couldn't do what he wanted.
I feel a little weak today.
Life is interesting.
She's here?
I don't like making mistakes.
Be careful, okay?
I bought a camera of $30.
That's great.
It's no method, it's a provocation.
Answer English.
He wants to see us again.
Water here is very shallow.
Where are you living?
My friend doesn't use sugar.
I dropped from the ladder.
He knows how to interrogate people.
Bob washed the dishes at that time.
My brother is older than me in two years, but he's three inches lower than me.
I can tell you only what I know.
I'm thinking about you.
What's your home address?
He'll be free tomorrow.
Have you seen my wife?
Your daughter heard us speak.
Thomas'll die soon.
I'm used to go to sleep late.
I've met him before.
Look at that house with a red roof.
My apartment on the fourth floor.
She was already pregnant.
We're basketball players.
These clothes are good for you.
Don't blame her.
Do you know you're stronger than you think?
I love her so much that I can't leave her.
Can you come with us?
I don't care about him.
Tom could not find reason why he had to go home early.
Pick up your hand.
He didn't sell home.
No one has ever seen God.
She saw something waiting for her at school.
I don't think you'd be busy.
Where's Maria?
The new contract allows us to demand whatever we want.
Thomas is still a prisoner.
Go open the door.
I said I'm gonna wake up another one later.
Oh, God, help me!
She told him she was happy.
She needs it more than he needs it.
Have fun with your exits!
Tom, I'm back.
You wanted to see me?
This is not a mistake.
The airport is quite far from the city centre.
You can turn the radio off now.
You can turn the radio off now.
You're a very loving person.
Ankara is located in Turkey.
You're a very nice person.
I was in Boston several times.
You're a very nice man.
