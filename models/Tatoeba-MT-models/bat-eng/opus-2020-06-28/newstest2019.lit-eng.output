Ethics guards: Liberals Movement Board on Vilnius Division actions are right
"The decisions of the Board are in accordance with the Statutes," said Vytautas Tamošūnas, the Head of the Board after the meeting of the Commission.
"Our decision wasn't something new.
Explanation as the commission had already done in July, when the question of Pagėgiai and Utena arose.
We then said that, according to the statutes, this was a matter for the Management Board's competence.
And if the board decides that a section can behave as it wants - to go with the committee and the board supports it, then the department can go, but if the board decides that there will be lots of lists, which the board has adopted, then it is the decision that all sections should draw up party lists.
And if you do not agree with the board, then there is the possibility to suspend membership and to go with the committee," he added.
According to Mr Tamošūnas, the Board of the Party will now decide on further action.
On October 17th, the Liberals Movement Board cancelled Vilnius City Department's decision to participate in municipal elections not with the party but with a new election committee list.
According to the Board of the Party, the decision of the liberals of the capital to participate in elections in the form of a public election committee violated the statutes of the Party and the decisions of the Board.
Until October 31, the Vilnius Section had to withdraw its wishes to participate in municipal elections with the list of committee members.
But the chapter didn't.
Former Head of the Section of Parliamentary Aušrinė Armonaitė has already withdrawn from the Liberal Movement.
The mayor of Vilnius, the former Chairman of the Liberal Movement Remigijus Šimašius, who promises to reach the office of another head of the capital, has already presented team and ideas of the public election committee "Už Vilniu, where we are proud."
He also left the party.
Elections of municipal councils and mayors will take place next year in March.
The rural population in northern India had a twilighted by a tractor that had previously ruined one man, and officials announced it on Monday.
The forest guard Mahaviras Kaujlagi said that a man worked in silver fields later Sunday, the villagers surrounded the animal and, when they tried to get out of the house, took it over by a tractor.
The inhabitants say that this tiger also attacked and disciplined one young man about 10 days ago.
The village mentioned above is in the Dudhvo Tiger Reserve in the Lakhympur Kherio district, about 250 km southeast of Laknau, the capital city of Utar Pradesh.
Galabe tigrus in protected areas shall be prohibited.
Director Rameshas Pandey said that according to the Wildlife Conservation Act, the case will be reported to the police.
In April, the villagemen of Utar Pradesh, in the Nighasan district, beat another tiger, which suffered severe injuries.
Thigra is an Indian national animal and is considered a endangered species under the Wildlife Conservation Act.
Last year, government data shows that during the three preceding years, at least one person died every day in collision with wild tigers or elephants.
The number of people's conflicts with the tiger has been gradually increasing since the 1980s, when India launched a Tiger Protection Programme, according to which the Reserves were set up in national parks and the galaxy of large cats began to be considered a crime.
Although the tiger calculation methods have changed, censuses would show that the then population of around 1,800 tigers has grown to 2,226 individuals in 2014.
Mandatory microchip marking of cats and dogs
Kęstutis Mažeika, the Chairman of the Seimas Committee on Environmental Protection, together with other Seimas Members, registered amendments to the Law on Animal Welfare and Protection, offering compulsory marking of cats and dogs by subcutaneous microchips.
"We propose that cat and dog should be labelled with subcutaneous microchips, and that local municipalities, the Ministry of Agriculture and the State Food and Veterinary Service organise their registration and labelling.
In 2019, all dogs will be labelled free of charge with state funds, and in 2020, cats will be free of charge, so the population will not be in trouble and the costs will be covered by the earmarked state funding," said Kęstutis Mazeika, Chairman of the Seimas Committee on Environmental Protection.
The amendments to the Law aim to address the systemic need for the labelling of domestic animals.
It is expected that this will help to avoid problems caused by irresponsible animal producers, illegal reproductions or sellers.
It is estimated that the expected average price of the microchip and the provision of the service, which will be around EUR 5 per cent, will be reimbursed to all animal owners during the transitional period.
The total cost of labelling of all pet animals may amount to up to EUR 6 million.
The need for these funds is estimated to be spread over three years and to reach €2 million each year.
It is foreseen that the funds will be allocated to the labelling programmes through the Municipal Environment Support Specific Programme, the revenues of which will increase significantly this year as a result of increased taxes and re-allocations of natural resources.
The municipalities will be able to use these funds not only for labelling cats and dogs, but also for castrations and other programmes.
According to Mr Mazeika, compulsory labelling practices are widespread in almost all countries of the European Union, which also helps to protect the animals themselves (as the lost animals can be returned to the owners) and saves the time when the farmers themselves have to spend a lot of time and money on seeking a runaway and lost pet.
In addition, EU legislation provides that only labelled pets are allowed to travel.
At the same time, labelling requires responsible care of the animal throughout its life.
Previous proposals for mandatory labelling have been resisted by the fact that the relevant programmes were proposed to finance the population.
"The model now provided should avoid these criticisms, as animal protection is proposed to finance increased income in the environmental protection support programme and right to label not only veterinarians, but also the public, i.e. individuals from animal care establishments who have received special courses at the Veterinary Academy," the authors of the project say.
The draft law was registered by a group of Seimas Members representing different groups of the Seimas - Kęstutis Mažeika, Algimantas Dumbrava, Eugenijus Gentvilas, Edmundas Pupinis, Rimas Andrikis, Antonas Vinkus and others.

The bike will be drawn up in the capital for political reasons.
As of November 7, Vilnius "Ryta" will host Czechs "Cherkaski Mavpy" and "KB Prishtina" teams in the "Ryto" arena with a warm relationship with Ukraine.

Lithuania is one of the best basketball countries in the world, so our play here will be a real honor.
We hope that we will receive support from the Vilnius people.
Kosovo's team could not come to Ukraine because these countries have no diplomatic relations.

"Women lie better" star actress B. Arsobaitis persecute the liars
It's probably just a coincidence, but the charming brown bear actor Brigita Arsobaitė has been getting the roles related to the liars for a journey.
At first, the series "Women are lying better", then the performance "Melage" and, finally, the comedy "Melagiai".
In this film Brigita plays a square wife of the hero of Dainius Kazlauskas.
"It was a great pleasure to film in "Mingagiai", because I'm more a theatre actor and I've rarely appeared in the film.
A team of great colleagues from the beginning promised an excellent result.
This experience is very important and valuable to me.
But the most interesting thing that happened on the site was a puppies Sunny!
I thought it would be big and serious if I had a dog for the rest of my life.
I never admired those little, decorative "fiphs" quads.
However, during the filming Sunny was so attached to me that I had become mutual and, finally, wanted to buy it from the host, but failed," the actor smiles.
From the first minutes, a new Lithuanian comedy "Melagiai", produced by the hits of Lithuanian cinema "Intrusive" and "The Maker of Us, Boys..." Paul Virbickas and Producers Stasys Baltakis and Vladimir Razarionov, became part of the comical Periphery of family members.
Your dear girl just said she's waiting.
It would be good news, just... your beloved is your brother's wife!
But that's not all.
Before all the "good news" is announced, parents suddenly say - they are different!
50 years together...
And all this is happening just before the most beautiful festival of the year - St. Christmas!
But the end will surprise you even more, because no one expected such nuclear events.
All heroines are not the ones that seemed at first glance...
Without B. Arsobaitė's good mood in the comedy "Melagiai" will present four times film stars: Giedrius Savickas, Dainius Kazlauskas, Edita Užaitė, Giedrė Giedraitytė, Liubomas Laucevičius, Larrya Kalpokaitė and Gediminos Giedvainis.
Comedy "Melagai" - in Chinese since 9 November.
Whether or not to write 100 million euros of unpaid tax on emigrants
On Tuesday, the Seimas adopted a revision of the law on declaration of residence prepared by the leader of "States" Ramūnas Karbauskas.
56 Members of the Seimas voted for, 9 against, and 25 abstentions.
The Seimas will continue to take stock of the amendments on or after 6 December, following the Government's conclusions.
According to R. Karbauskas, these contributions are calculated for people who have not declared their departure from Lithuania.
According to the MP, in three years a person does not pay about EUR 1 000, and now there are about 100 000 of such persons.
Social Democrat Algirdas Syss regretted that in this way, the Seimas will "call some people not to comply with the obligations" - declare their departure and then no taxes would be counted.
A member of the Health Committee, conservative Antonio Matulas, noted that Lithuanians living abroad use the fact that they come to Lithuania for treatment by paying a small health insurance fee – they receive the same services as those paying this tax to residents.
The amendments provide that the persons who have left Lithuania will be considered to be those who will pay social insurance contributions in the European Union, the states of the European Economic Area or the Swiss Confederation, while Sodra will exempt them from paying health insurance contributions in Lithuania.
The leader of "Sodros" Mindaugas Sinkevičius has previously said that such a step will make life easier for people who have emigrated and the work of "Sodros".
Online spilled video about moving bear reveals a serious problem
Illustrate how the mother bear climbs in a straight snowy slope, while the baby is getting climbed, slipping down, and climbs up again.
The video has received plenty of views and comments.
People admired the perseverance of the little bear - repeatedly sloping down, and he went back to Mom.
Not once he has succeeded, but the little one does not try to give up and finally achieves his goal.
The video really paid attention, but it also reveals the human threat to animals.
Scientists claim that it is also necessary to talk about the fact that people’s desire to know wildlife can sometimes be harmful.
"For me, obviously, the bear drone scared a lot.
Their movements show that they panic.
If there were no drones around, they would probably have opted for a safer road, or had it been more slow or prudent to overcome.
This is a great example of how drones should not be used," said Ecologist Mark Ditmer.
Some time ago, Ditmer and his colleagues examined how well the bears worked.
The animals were equipped with heart measuring instruments.
When some bears approached, they began to run away, but the hearts of all of them began to beat up more often.
Scientists recommend that the animals be used to film in a responsible manner, not to fly too close, not to raise noise and not to fly where it is prohibited.
The runaway president was approached by a newspaper
On Tuesday, the Kyiv Court invited President Viktor Yanukovych to appear in a case on his alleged state betrayal meeting in an unusual way - a summoning was announced in the State's Official Journal.
At the invitation of the Court of Justice, published in the government news newspaper "Uriadovj Kurier", a former leader is invited to attend a criminal hearing on 19 November, which could lead to the hearing of his final arguments.
The document shall state that Mr Janukovičs is entitled to take part in a video-communication meeting.
On 30 October, the Kiev Court declared the outcome of the debate in the case of V. Janukovyčius.
The Russian lawyer, Mr Janukovičs, has been given an opportunity to register with the foreign lawyers' register until 19 November so that he can attend a meeting where he is expected to speak on the video.
The Kremlius-based V. Janukovičs was taken down and fled to Russia during the Maidan uprising in February 2014, which provoked the President's refusal to sign the association agreement with the European Union.
President Putin later revealed that former Ukrainian leader had been taken to Russia during a special operation organised by Moscow.
In March of that year, Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula to Ukraine, and later, in the east, a war broke out between the separatists supported by Kiev and Russia.
Since then, around 10,000 lives have been taken away by the fighting, despite numerous attempts by the international community to secure a long-term ceasefire.

Restrictions on cogenerative power plants against the Constitutional Court
The position of the Seimas, as promised, appealed to the Constitutional Court (CJN) about the decision of the governing bodies to adopt a law on the possibility of stopping the construction of waste incineration plants.
On Tuesday, the Seimas opposition to the Homeland Union of Lithuania's Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) Group announced that a group of Seimas Members had asked the CN to investigate the compliance of the law on waste management adopted by the ruling with the Constitution.
"The Parliaments stress that the provisions of the law are intended to question the existing projects of waste incineration plants, by entrusting the Government with the task of imposing new restrictions (20 km distance from the territory of residence) until the entry into force of the law on construction of waste incineration plants in Vilnius and Kaunas," says the report.
"The Parliaments note that in view of the fact that the prohibition on the construction of objects of national importance for the management of waste as laid down in the law (i.e. the distance and definition of the concept of "residential territory"), it must be concluded that this prohibition is disproportionately restricted or even denied the essence of the right to carry out the economic activities related to the incineration of waste for the production of energy, because the criteria laid down are formulated in such a way that, after assessing the density and distribution of Lithuanian residents in the country, it is practically impossible to build such facilities throughout the territory of the country," it is added.
The appeal states that the adopted law is contrary to the constitutional principle of the rule of law.
"The ECJ has repeatedly pointed out that legislation does not apply to legal facts and consequences arising prior to the entry into force of the newly adopted act.
In this case, the Government is empowered to apply the law back in accordance with an uncertain criterion.
The introduction of such legal regulation violates the principles of constitutional certainty, legal certainty, the protection of legitimate expectations, and hence the constitutional principle of the rule of law," refers to the referrals.
It also notes that significant financial investments have already been made in projects of Vilnius and Kaunas cogeneration plants.
With the suspension of the current projects, not only would the State incur a hundred million financial losses, huge losses and Lithuanian residents increase heating prices, which would increase environmental pollution caused by the increased disposal of waste in landfills.
Members from the Seimas TS-LKD, Liberals Movement, the Social Democrat Groups and the Deputy Head of the Social Democrat Task Force Algirdas Butkevičius signed an appeal to the CN.
A few weeks ago, the Seimas managed to gather 71 votes with votes to reject the amendments adopted by President Dalia Grybauskaitė to the Law on Waste Management, which provide for the right of the Government to stop the construction of cogeneration plants already started, and also established a zone of "carantine" residential areas for building such power stations.
The amendments to the Law adopted by the Seimas repeatedly will enter into force from 1 January 2019. The Court of Justice, which has already proposed to refuse to limit 20 km.
It is planned to discuss this proposal at the autumn session of the Seimas.
However, the right of the Government to suspend projects already started is not planned.
The CJ will deal with the case in turn - not earlier than one year.

"Lakers" started the season in four victories and six victories, and such a weak start helped to create rumors due to the possible dismissal of the coach Luke Walton.

V. Ačienė about the detention of R. Ačo: I believe in man's innocence and law enforcement
"It was the most unbelieving thing I could never think of.
On the other hand, services are likely to do the work that they have to do.
We're doing our job each time.
I believe in law enforcement, I believe in my husband that everything is right and honest, that no unfair actions of him should be done," V.Ačienė said.
R. Ačas Special Investigation Service (STT) stopped on Monday - the lawguard suspects that he, while being the director of Raseiniai municipality administration, took a bribe of high value, and in exchange he could create exceptional conditions for a private company who signed a contract with a Raseinių Bus Park managed by the municipality.
Representatives of private companies are suspected of buying R. Ača directly or having participated in the masking of bribes for various financial operations.
The Raseiniai district municipal council R. Ačas, on April 3, this year, at the third attempt, following a lack of confidence, dismissed from the position of head of administration.
The former "orderary" became a member of the working party of Lithuanian Social Democrats under the new establishment of Gediminas Kirkil, and he suspended membership of this party on Monday.
Several years ago he unsuccessfully applied to the mayor elections as a representative of the election committee "Your Raceiniai".
V. Ačienė says that the man did not intend to raise his candidacy in the Raseiniai mayor elections next year, but had not decided yet whether he would participate in municipal councils elections.
V. Ačienė was elected to the Seimas with the list of Lithuanian Peasants and Greens Union and is a member of the Anti-Corruption Commission of the Seimas.
The politician says waiting for further law enforcement action - it will depend on whether it will get away from work on the commission.
"I really don't do the big decisions today, this week, I think I'll decide.
I will see, if there is a need, of course, for some sort of decision to be taken.
It is probably necessary that I leave aside all the things that are being investigated in the Anti-Corruption Commission, but again - all the time she has set up in her seats," she said.
The representative of opposition Conservatives in Seime Radvilė Morkūnaitė-Mikulėnienė called on the Speaker of the Seimas Viktoras Pranckietis and the head of the "Stateist" Ramūnas Karbauskas to exclude from the statements of his colleague Vida Ačienė and to withdraw her from the Anti-Corruption Commission of the Seimas by transferring her to another Seimas committee or commission.
She claims that Mr Ačienė's further work in the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission "will create a mistrust based on society and discredit the work of an important parliamentary supervisory committee".

Dalia Grybauskaitė calls on China to create a more favourable investment environment for EU business
President Dalia Grybauskaitė invites China to create a more favourable investment environment for investments in the European Union (EU) countries and to facilitate foreign import conditions.
At the Chinese import exhibition in Shanghai, opening the Forum for Trade and Investment, D. Grybauskaitė stressed that, in view of the signs of economic slowdown, the common goal of Europe and China should be to 'unite efforts to halt the spread of protectionism in the world', taking account of the fundamental tensions caused by the trade wars, the causes of 'excessiveness and unfair competition'.
'The European Union is a key commitment from China to create a more attractive, open environment for investment - it is important for negotiations on a trade agreement with China.
It is important to conclude this trade agreement as soon as possible, ensuring that foreign business feels welcome and safe here, as well as strengthening the protection of intellectual property," said Dr. Grybauskaitė.
According to her, the opening up of China is important not only for Europe, but also for this country, as well as for global economic growth.
The President underlined that transparency in investment should be 'more in the interests of any business group'.
"Frequency, rule of law, strict compliance with international treaties - this must be a fundamental issue in the environment for new investment relations," Mr Grybauskaitė emphasised.
"Corporate capital flows should not be expected in any country in the world - not just here or in our countries," she added.
The Chinese import exhibition is trying to mitigate the criticism that it avoids opening its market and protects only its companies.
The exhibition is attended by several heads of state, more than 2800 companies from 130 countries and regions of the world, including Lithuania.
According to the Lithuanian Department of Statistics, China currently takes 25th place among its export partners.
Last year, Lithuanian exports to China grew by 50% - it reached 180 million euros.
At the same time, imports from China amounted to EUR 820 million.
Some officials worry about China's investment in Lithuania can have an undesirable political influence, while Beijing's particular attention to Eastern Europe is breaking the EU's unity.

The reason for the disaster on the Lion Air plane was revealed: the close anger of the victims
Data from the black box of Lion Air liner of the broken Indonesian airline indicate that the speed meter malfunctioned during at least the last four flights, reported by the investigators on Monday.
The chairman of the National Committee on Transport Security (NTSK) Soeranti Tjahjono said that a similar rick had occurred during the last four flights on the plane, including the fatal one, when on 29 October the liner fell in the Sea of Java shortly after the Jakarta rise.
All 189 people were killed during this disaster.
Many media reported leaks during the previous Boeing 737 MAX 8 flight from Denpasar to Indonesia.
"When we opened the black box - yes, in fact the technical problem was speed in the air, in other words the speed of the plane," said Mr Tjahjon during the press conference.
"The data of the black box showed that on two flights before the flight Denpasar-Jakar was also the same problem," he added.
"The social networks are full of rumours.
We now want to make it clear that four flights in the black box (data are still available) with problems with the air speed meter," the Head of NTSK pointed out.
During a meeting with members of the lost families, Mr Tyahjono said that the information from the flight recorder was in line with the announcement that the speed and height of the last flight had changed untimely when the aeroplane was in flight.
The search teams have not yet found the second black box to record conversations in the flight deck.
Lion Air indicated that during the flight from Bali to Jakarta it had been repaired in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations.
Rusdi Kirana, one of the founders of the company, was not invited to speak at the meeting of Minister of Transport and Communications Buddi Karyos Sumadi, who had moderated family members with officials in charge of searching for remains and disaster of planes and victims.
However, he stood up and bowed his head when angry and grieving family members demanded that Kirana, along with his brother Kusnan, set up Lion Air in 1999, be introduced.
Lion Air did not behave properly," said one man, presenting himself as the father of the passenger Shandy Johano Ramadhan who worked as a prosecutor on the island to which the plane was flying.
"I want Mr. Rusdi Kirana and his team to pay attention," he said.
- Since the beginning of the crisis, Lion Air has never reached me.
We lost our child, but Lion Air did not show us any empathy.
Following this meeting, Kirana went on an hastily to avoid questions from journalists.
Many families are looking forward to the results of the recognition process for those who have died a long time.
Police medical experts have been transferred almost 140 lavons, loaded into people's remains.
So far, only 14 victims have been recognized.
The relatives asked why a boat was allowed to fly two months ago, even though a failure occurred between Bali and Jakarta during the 28th of October, including by taking passengers down the frightening sudden drop in the plane immediately after the rise.
"Lion Air" said that this fault was eliminated.
Is it true that the problem was solved?
- If not, the technician concerned must be held liable.
The law is very clear, not saying that the plane was allowed to rise again.
These bad technicians have to answer according to the law to prevent aircraft crashes in Indonesia from reoccuring.
S. Tjahjono said that the large amount of small scrapes and the fact that the ruins spread to quite a small area shows that the boat was likely to sink into the water at a very high speed.
"The plane was solid when it fell into the sea.
He didn't blow in the air, and the engines of the plane, when he touched the water, worked in great turn - this shows all the broken Turbine blades," the officer explained.
Lion Air liner crashing is the biggest aviation disaster in Indonesia since 1997, when the Garuda plane crashed 234 people killed near Medan.

Presidency: no artificial facilitations for referendums
Following the confirmation by the Seimas of the proposal by the governing body to reduce the referendum cartel for the current more protective section of the first section of the Constitution, the President will vetuate amendments, says her advisor, Mindaugas Linge.
"For the Constitution, more than half of the population voted - this is a requirement.
It shall also be amended, in particular by the articles contained in the first section thereof , by a minimum percentage .
It is easy to predict that the President would really veto," said Dalia Grybauskaitė's advisor to internal politics to the Radio Knowledge on Tuesday.
He stressed that the main elements of the state as defined in the first section of the Constitution - language, flag, territory, capital, sovereignty of the state - would be created by reducing the number of votes needed to replace these Articles, according to Mr Linge, by creating a 'negative precedent' and 'to counter the unmanageable risk'.
"In the opinion of the President, there is no need for any artificial relief, more preparation for the referendum itself, more dialogue with people," he said.
On Tuesday, the Seimas plans to vote on the adoption of the Amendment to the Reference Law.
It provides that a decision on amendments to Sections 1 and 14 of the Constitution with higher protection is to be taken if, during a referendum, at least two fifths of the citizens with the right to vote agree.
Currently, more than half of all citizens with the right to vote can change the articles of Section 1 and Section 14 of the Constitution by referendum.
About 2.5 million citizens have the right to vote in Lithuania: half would be 1.25 million voters, two fifths would be one million voters.
This proposal was born after the adoption in September of Article 12 of the first section of the Constitution, which reduced the demands for the number of votes in the previous parliamentary amendments, by the Seimas.
A referendum proposes a reduction in the run-up to a referendum on dual citizenship, which should take place on 12 May and 26 May next year, when the first and second rounds of the presidential elections are planned.
After the restoration of independence, migrants cannot, at the moment, have double citizenship on 11 March 1990, except for some exceptions.
Double citizenship seeks the Lithuanian community of the world, but fear that, under the current conditions, the referendum will not take place - there will not be enough people coming to vote.
R. Masiulis: Lithuanian airports "brusha", therefore they need to be updated
Lithuanian airports and road infrastructure are beginning to demolish, therefore it is necessary to upgrade it, says Minister of Transport and Communications Rokas Masiulis.
According to him, the renewal of Vilnius Airport is the minimum task that the State must perform.
"Air transport infrastructure has already been scarce, as it was planned for smaller passenger flows.
We must upgrade Vilnius Airport - this is not even part of far-reaching planning, it is the minimum we must do", Mr Masiulis said at the conference on connection held by the Democracy Development Fund and the magazine Valstybės on Tuesday.
According to the Minister, the next decade will be very important, because important projects will have to be implemented - "Via Baltica" has been completed, "Rail Baltica" has been built in Klaipeda, Vilnius and Kaunas airports will have to be renewed, and a new airport may have been built.
"The next decade will be very important: we must finish the construction of roads, railways, external airports in Klaipeda, clean airports, perhaps decide on the construction of the new airport.
We must not sleep, we must now start projects that will exploit our potential after 10, 20 or 30 years," said the Minister of Transport.
Mr Masiulis said that in recent years there has been too little money available for road maintenance.
"The condition of the knees is not improving at this stage, as there are insufficient funds available.
We are able to build new roads, but even for essential care, such as motorway roads, there is a lack of funds.
We must establish the amount to be devoted to road maintenance if we are to see their condition improve," Mr Masiulis said.
He stressed that exports of services in the Lithuanian transport sector increased by 18.6% this year, while the largest export market became Germany, overcoming Russia.
Mr Masiulis once again criticised the European Commission's proposal that EU carriers will be obliged to periodically return wolves to the country of registration.
"We must make our exporters in Western Europe feel at home.
In my opinion, the proposal for a permanent return home for tractors is absurd, as empty trucks would be used in Europe, would burn fuel and increase emissions.
The main happiness is that railways will grow to such an extent that part of the transport will pass on to the railways.
We are looking for ways to defend our positions," Mr Masiulis said.
According to the Ministry of Transport, transport represents 12.2 %.
Lithuanian Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
It employs more than 118.000 employees and employs more than 7.500 companies.
Dispute with heritageists
Last week Mr. Masiulis announced in the Seimas Economic Committee that he started negotiations on changing the cultural purpose of Vilnius Airport building, which would allow the old terminal to be destroyed and a new one to be built.
However, the interim head of the Department of Cultural Heritage (CRD) Algimantas Degutis called the deliberations of the Massul a political pressure.
According to him, the building built in the 1950s is a value entered in the register in 1993 and not a political one, but specialists have to decide on its removal.
Mr. Masiulis then commented that a modern arrival terminal would contribute to the improvement of the image of Lithuania.
"To extract that old terminal from the heritage would be a politically important step to be able to fall it down and build a new modern arrival terminal, so that if the fall is to feel in a modern country, and not such an interesting, really unrepresenting our country as an innovative one, Mr Masiulis said last week.
Mr. Masiulis then also reported that it was planned to build a completely new passenger terminal in Kaunas and to connect the airport with the Rail Baltica track, building the underground station.
This transport unit should operate in 2026 after the completion of the Rail Baltica construction process.
Last year Vilnius Airport served about 3.7 million people, with 4.8 million passengers expected this year and 5 million are next year.
Last year, Kaunas Airport handled 1,2 million passengers.

Next year from Vilnius to launch direct flights to Madagascar
In the spring of next year, the largest passenger plane Boeing 767 flying on regular flights will land at Vilnius Airport, which will operate passengers from Lithuania directly to the island of Bee belonging to Madagascar, based on information from the organizer of the trip, Itaka Lietuva, writes the portal "madeinvilius.lt".
Blue Panorama is announced to be available to passengers from the 259 economic and 8 business classes.
The new holiday course will be reached directly from Lithuania since April 2019.
Dominic Milowskis, CEO of "Itaka Lietuva", says that tourists from Lithuania are trying to offer new holiday destinations.
Madagascar is an island in the Indian Ocean, near the east coast of Africa.
New holiday trips for the summer season 2019 were also prepared by other tour operators.
For example, "Novatura" and "Itka" will start flying directly from Vilnius to Tirana (Albania).
Minister of Finance on the possible crisis: it is important not to talk about illness
"We must always prepare for more difficult times.
What I would like to welcome is that for the third year in a row, for the first time in Lithuania's history, we accumulate reserves.
But also very important thing - not to talk to the disease," said Mr Šapoka while visiting Brussels on Monday.
ELTA recalls that on Monday and Tuesday Minister of Finance and Vice-Minister Miguel Tuskienė participates in meetings of the Eurogroup and the EU's Ecofin.
The ECOFIN meeting discusses the taxation of digital services.
This new tax is intended to avoid fragmentation of the EU single market, as some Member States have already introduced or intend to introduce a certain tax at national level.
In the short term, it is proposed to agree how the revenue generated for the provision of certain digital services in the EU Member States should be taxed, pending global agreement.
The Eurogroup will review draft budgets for the euro area countries presented to the European Commission (EC).
On 23 October the EC rejected the draft Italian budget as incompatible with the Stability and Growth Pact.
This is the first time that the EC takes advantage of this possibility.
For further information, please refer to Belgium, France, Portugal, Slovenia and Spain.
The Eurogroup will also discuss the issues of deepening the Economic and Monetary Union: the feasibility of implementing the European Deposit Insurance System and the reform of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).
Lithuania has a stronger role for the ESM in financial support programmes, but the functions of the ESM should be clearly defined to avoid duplication of functions between the ESM and other EU institutions.
Balys Burach.
Lithuanian work traditions and customs
Recently it was 120 years since the birth of famous Lithuanian photographer and art writer, ethnographer and national historian Balis Buračs (1897-1972) in Sidarai, Siaulėnai State, at the time Siauliai Gubernia.
In commemorating the 100th anniversary of the Lithuanian state, we have a great opportunity to remember how the nationwide rebirth in life has called many people of Lithuania, including Brothers Burachus - Balis, Jonas, Brothers - from the very depth of the village - all creatively we can engage in the fostering, perceptive and preservation of our cultural traditions.
Balys Burach spent over 50 years travelling around his home country with a camera in his hands, presented a wide and realistic picture of customs, traditions, folk art and material culture in our country.
He sought to preserve the rapidly vanishing cations of national culture and had a rare ability to understand the continuing value of his work.
In Bali Burach's photographs, Lithuanian landscapes, hillocks, everyday life and celebrations, our people decorated the pages of Lithuanian newspapers and magazines with national costumes.
This publication contains a considerable number of the legacy of Bali Burach, intended to describe national working practices and related traditions and, above all, their attractive iconography.
The published material not only shows the distinctiveness and beauty of those traditions, but also the progress of our civilization over the past century, regardless of the two world wars and the difficult occupation.
The book’s manuscript contains an abundance of works of interwar Samogitia, especially of kupely, northern, tentish, as well as the works of the people of Aukštaitija and Dzūgija, their holidays and other traditions and customs written by Bali Burach.
More than 400 rare photos, mainly those that have not been published, have been selected from museums and archives, which have been grouped according to the selected texts.
They reflect unique aspects of ethnic culture specific to courgettes, estuaries, other areas of Aukstaitija and Žemaitija.

Tragic fate of the couple: Only a few hours after marriage
In the southwest of the U.S. Texas, during a helicopter disaster, only a couple of young children who had been married only a few hours before were killed.
William Troy'us Byler and his co-ager's wife Bailee Raye Ackerman Byler died on Sunday shortly after midnight the helicopter fell into the hill 16 km northwest of Juvald and 129 km west of San Antonio, said local peace judge Steven Kennedy.
Surprisingly, the disaster occurred after a flight of about 12 miles [24 km], just as much as the years were for young ones.
The helicopter pilot, 76 years of age, Gerald Douglas Lawrence, also died.
The newlyweds studied at Sam Huston State University in Texas City of Huntsville.
They were married on Saturday night at the Byler family ranch near Juvaldis, and after the feast of their spouses they had a helicopter belonging to the family.
The accident occurred when the helicopter flew about 12 miles [24 km] away.
The newlyweds flew to Sant Antonio International Airport, where they intended to board the plane and fly honeymoon, said S. Kennedy, without specifying the final couple's destination.
"It is a very heated, uneven terrain, and that hill is about 120 to 150 meters high," said Mr Kennedy.
Mr Lawrence has been piloting aircraft of that family for many years.
According to Mr Kennedy, he piloted helicopters and served in Vietnam.
After the autopsy, you should find out what the pilot's physical condition was and whether it could not have been the cause of the disaster.
The helicopter was damaged about 5-10 minutes after the climb.
It was scrapped with a wide radius on a rocky hill slope, and the hull remained "dangerously fixed", said on Monday at a press conference the air safety investigator Craig Hatch from the National Transport Security Board (NTSB).
Researchers are going to take out the ruins and then inspect them thoroughly, but it will not be easy for the tractor and the truck to reach that place, he said.
The cause of the disaster has not yet been established and the preliminary report of the NTSB should be published two weeks later.
The Israeli Prime Minister calls Iran's entry into force of the new sanctions 'historic day'.
"Today is a historic day," said Mr Netanyahu, to the Members of his party "Likud" Parliamentary Committee.
"Today is the day when, under the leadership of the President (Donald), the US introduces particularly severe sanctions against Iran, the most severe sanctions against Iran throughout the time the efforts to curb his aggression began," said the head of the Israeli Government.
Earlier on Monday, the Israeli Minister of Defence, Avigdor Lyberman, declared that the new sanctions would be imposed on the "decided" blow to Israel's actions in the region.
The measures that Washington calls 'the most severe sanctions of all times' started to apply after Mr. Trump May's decision to withdraw from the world's power agreement with Tehran on his nuclear programme.
The sanctions seek to significantly reduce Iran's oil exports, which have fallen by about one million barrels a day since May, and to exclude Tehran from international financing.
Israel has long opposed this agreement with Iran and says that its scope and terms are too limited.
The Jewish State also says that the abolition of sanctions has allowed Iran to finance groups of fighters and its own military activities.
Israel is particularly concerned about Iran's actions in neighbouring Syria and promised to refuse to allow him to stand there in military terms.
The other participants in the agreement with Iran - Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia - are not in favour of the US's decision and say that, as has been envisaged, the agreement has so far not allowed Iran to acquire nuclear weapons.
The Court again expands the circumstances of the death of a young motorcyclist
The death of a young motorcyclist in Vilnius, the Northern Town, in the accident proceedings ending will be heard by the court of the witness.
On Tuesday, the Vilnius Regional Court decided that one Witness would be interviewed at the next meeting on November 26 in order to clarify all the relevant circumstances of the case.
In the present case, a reasoned judgment has already been issued, but the prosecutor’s office does not agree with it.
On August 22, the Vilnius City District Court, on the grounds of the death of a motorcyclist accident, justified the driver of the vehicle, who, for 79 years, announced that the motorcyclist had been driving at high speed and committed a gross violation.
Vilnius Regional Public Prosecutor's Office is asking the district court to set aside the judgement of the district court and claims that E. Osipov is the main fault of the accident, and the conclusions of the district court are unfounded.
The lawyer of the deceased motorcyclist's family is also asking for the order to be annulled.
The accident took place on August 11, 2015, at about 3 p.m. when E. Osipovo drives a car called Škoda Fabia from Lakūnai Street to Žirmūnai Street and faced with a motorcycle driving the main road.
The Prosecutor's Office accused the man of the violation of the Road Traffic Regulations by the car driver and caused the accident - the death of the main road motorcycle Piggo man.
Initial police reports indicate that the driver, but later after investigations, was killed, that the vehicle was in power equivalent to a motor cycle.
Rolandas Bužinskas BNS, the judge of Vilnius City District Court, has said that experts found that the motorcycling driver had been driving at 89,2 km per hour, although the speed allowed at that place is 50 km per hour.
"The driver could not predict that the motorcycle would drive at such high speed," said the judge.
At the time of the age, the car driver claimed that he was driving at a speed of just 5 - 6 miles [5 - 6 km] per hour.
After seeing the obstacle, the motorbike driver tried to stop and dropped from the vehicle before facing the Skoda Fabia.
The prosecutor's office believes that E. Osipov had been driving from the side to the main road.
Novaja Gazeta: Six Vagner hired men died in Syria
Five Syrian troops and six persons, belonging to Vagner, a military company, were killed.
The source of "Novaja Gazeta" in Syria declares this.
According to a source, one of the units of the 5th Syrian Armed Forces Corps was deployed in the said territory, joined by a number of Syrian volunteers and "military mercenaries".
Novaja Gazeta sent a request to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia to provide information on Russian fate.
The former Belgian king will have to carry out a paternity test
This decision is a partial victory for artist Delphin Commission.
It has been seeking recognition of the child of the former monarch since 2013.
The 50-year-old woman claims that her mother, Baronienė Sybille de Seys Longchamps and Albert II, had a mild love novel decades ago.
The 84th-year-old king denies paternity.
According to the RTBF of the station, he may apply to the Supreme Court in opposition to DNA testing.
According to the Court of Appeal, Jacques Boel - the former man of the Delphi mother - is neither a biological nor a legal father of an artist.
With regard to the relevant investigation, Delphin applied to be recognised as a daughter of the "threshold" father Albert.
Money distributed to the parties of the CoR, but nothing will be given to the social partners
This week, the Central Electoral Commission (CEC) intends to allocate a budget grant of almost EUR 3 million to the largest political parties.
This year, the Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party (LSDDP), established in spring, led by Vice-President Gediminas Kirkil, has not yet been foreseen to allocate funds from the budget.
However, they may be awarded in the near future by a separate decision of the CoR if there is a change in the legal environment governing the allocation of grants to lots.
Laura Matošaityte, President of the CoR, informed the CoR that "this Thursday is the commission meeting to decide on the budget half-yearly grant allocation for the parties".
According to her, the decision on this point must be taken by the CoR by 15 November.
Seven parties, six of which are parliamentary, are scheduled to be allocated EUR 2.751 million.
The opposition Union for Homeland – Lithuanian Christian Democrats should receive over EUR 0.66 million, the ruling State and Green Union - about EUR 0.55 million, the opposition to the Socialist Party - about EUR 0.5 million, the opposition to the Liberian Movement - almost EUR 0.4 million, the Labour Party without the Group - about EUR 0.23 million, the recent participation of the ruling Party for the Sustainable and Justice - about EUR 0.22 million, represented in the Parliament, but neither the rulingman nor the opposition announced the Polish election campaign to the Kingdom Union for the Christian Families - about EUR 0.18 million.
In accordance with the law currently in force, which will guide the CoR in allocating budget money, grants are awarded to parties who meet the statutory requirements and have received at least 3% of the votes in the last elections to the Seimas, municipal councils and the European Parliament.
Therefore, the current legal framework does not allow only the LSD, established in spring this year, to expect money from the budget.
Because this party has not yet participated in any of the elections.
It is true that the governing coalition is trying to change the law so that social workers can receive at least a couple of hundreds of thousands of euros for the next year's three elections - the self-government, the President and the European Parliament.
The corresponding amendments to the political parties and budget laws adopted by the Seimas this year were adopted by President Dalia Grybauskaitė.
The Seimas has not yet decided on this veto, but the representatives of the ruling Members, Mr Kirkilas, and the peasant-green leader Ramūnas Karbauskas, believe that the MPs will seek to reject the opposition of the President.
However, this will not be done before this Thursday meeting of the CoR, so, according to Mr Matošaitytė, 'grants will be divided according to the legal order which has existed and which has existed so far'.
It is true that the President of the CoR did not rule out that if the Seimas rejected the veto of the President this week or the next week and a new amendment to the appointment of the budget to the parties would enter into force, the panel could consider the decision on the award of an additional grant to individual political forces, including the LSDDP.
"By taking the decision we will take into account the entire legal environment in force, because we are an executive institution to implement the laws that are adopted," she said.
Should the Seimas be able to reject the veto and new laws enter into force, the additional funds would be distributed to the parties by the Government, which would have borrowed the corresponding amounts in addition.
Grants already allocated to seven lots would not undermine this decision.

Ponaugenka: murdering activists of Handziuk must be punished
"I want to state that no version - and their more than 20 today - will be rejected.
Each will be checked very carefully in accordance with the investigation procedures.
As President, I do not have the opportunity to obtain information that could undermine the course of the investigation.
However, the authorities must ensure transparency, and law enforcement authorities must work effectively.
Only in this way will it be possible to learn the truth and punish evil," said Mr Porooshenko at the meeting with young people on Tuesday in Kiev.
He stressed that he is the most interested in explaining Handziuk's murder and "take the necessary responsibility" to murderers, perpetrators and customers.
"After this case was re-qualified to murder (the case), they are absolutely right and rightly threatened with imprisonment until a live head", said the President of Ukraine.
He rightly referred to the public demand for an open and impartial investigation of the case.
Mr Poroshenko stressed that the statements of the representatives of law enforcement authorities in the parliament should show that 'the authorities are determined to take criminals and murderers to the justice of whatever they are'.
He also said that political speculation on this subject would not help to clarify the situation, but would confuse everything even more.
"I call on all, and the power and the forces that support the opposition, not to waste unfounded arguments, and, protect God, not to use this murder for public relations," the President said.
- On the contrary, we now need to unite and ensure that the study is effective, fair and transparent, quickly, so as to create public confidence.
We just don't have another way."
"No one will be allowed to take advantage of this situation in the country for destabilising," he assured.
In July, before the corruption K. Handziuk was attacked and poured on acid in the city of Cherson.
She was a adviser to this mayor of southern Ukraine.
After the attack, she was hospitalized, but died on Sunday in a hospital.
On Tuesday, the Prosecutor General of Ukraine, Jurijus Lucenka, who did not explain the perpetrators of this attack, presented a resignation statement.
After her death, authorities have been accused of being unable to carry out the investigation properly.
The activists also requested the resignation of the Prosecutor General and the Minister of the Interior.
"I will present my statement of resignation today", said Mr Lucenka to the Members of Parliament by reading his study report.
Parliament still needs to support the resignation of the prosecutor.
Mr Lucenka has accused activists of exerting pressure on the investigation and delaying important information, which makes it difficult to identify the perpetrators of the murder of Handziuk.
Bill Gates introduced the toilet without water
By presenting futuristic toilets, Bill Gates compared the transition from traditional such facilities to water free against the computer revolution of the 1970s.
The founder of Microsoft Bill Gates at the exhibition in Beijing introduced high-tech toilet, which does not need water in water pipes, announced Reuters.
The water-free toilet shall be operated in accordance with the principle of separation of solid and liquid waste.
Both types of sewage are processed into chemical fertilisers.
"The technologies you see here are the greatest achievements in the sanitary field in the last 200 years," Bill Gates quoted "Bloomberg".
The technological toilet was created at the expense of the charity fund set up by Bill Gates and his wife, Melinda.
Over seven years, work has been done on a machine that turned man’s waste into fertiliser or water, and that fund has spent $200 million.
A total of about 20 toilet models were developed, according to Bill Gates.
The device is now complete and can be sold.
But in order for such toilets to be made massively, the Gates Foundation is ready to spend another 200 million.
According to the Trust Fund, every year 500 000 children die under five years of age due to poor sanitation conditions in the world.
Combating ill-hospital problems, such as cholera and others, increases health spending, which is already worth 233 billion.
To better illustrate the sanitary situation that needs to be improved, Bill Gates is presenting a glass with faeces in the toilet.
According to him, this is a good reminder of the fact that in the small example "may be 200 trillion rotavirus cells, 200 thousand bacteria causing infectious diseases, 100 thousand worm parasite eggs".

Anxiety in France: people's deaths are of concern
The French health officials announced, on Monday, a permanent ban on a widely used pesticide in the event of concerns about several dozens of people recently poisoned in the west of the country.
The Health Agency ANSES announced that the decision to ban all pesticide-based products was taken following a new safety check launched earlier this year in the Department of Men and Luara before at least three poisoning waves in the Department of Men and Luara started in September.
In these cases, the government had already suspended the use of the pesticide.
This soil disinfection chemical should not be in contact with plants or farm workers.
In order to be effective, the product must be used in large quantities.
In France, it was used annually for about 700 tonnes.
At least 70 people, including many farm workers, in Anže region, where there is a large number of salad broths, complained about the passage of eyes and throat and breathing problems.
"These episodes confirm the correctness of our decision, but did not hurry it," said Francoise Weber, Deputy Director of ANSES, to the newspaper "Ouest France".
Metamas, one of the most commonly used pesticides in the US and Europe, is considered by the US Environment Agency (US EPA) as a 'probable human carcinogen'.
This pesticide, sold under names such as "Vapam" and "Sectagon", is authorised in Europe until 2022, when a new safety test is to be carried out.
"There was no other choice to remove him from the market, regardless of whether he had alternatives," F. Weber said to the newspaper.
"We are making sure that the difficulties will be encountered for the producers of salad sultans, for the common farmers, but for public health more important," she said.
Farmers have already expressed their disappointment at the government's decision last month to stop the use of metam in the region whose economy is heavily dependent on intensive agriculture.
More than half of 35 thousand tonnes of salad broths consumed annually in Europe are produced in the region near Nantes.
In the following season, there will be "to a great extent less saloon broths, radishes and pairs", last month, after the government stopped using the metam, the news agency AFP said the head of the Nantes growers' Federation Philippe Reinere (Filipp Retjeras).
In Tallinn, 70 million euros invested in the shopping centre with the viewing wheel.
The new T1 shopping centre is opening next weekend in the capital of Estonia, to which the local capital development company Pro Kapital Grup has invested EUR 70 million.
The 130,000 sq.m. total, or 55,000 sq.m., area shopping centre will host 150 shops or entertainment places, over 30 cafes and restaurants, according to the development report.
In comparison, the total area of Vilnius Akropolis (including the offices of the area) amounts to about 110.000 sq. m. O rent - 91.000 sq. m.
"T1" - the first shopping centre with a view wheel on the roof, claims the developer.
It will be operational at the beginning of next year.
In addition, international transport gates will also be integrated into the territory: trams will soon be in service for inter-urban buses alongside them.
The main Rail Baltica terminal is also nearby, and it is forecast that in 2026 it will serve 1 million passengers per year.
Paolas Michelozzi, Director General of the Pro Capital Group, says that the global business of supermarkets is undergoing fundamental change, and the development of T1 has succeeded in facing them.
"We have created a new generation shopping centre that provides emotions and experiences that are not achieved online.
It is a place of attraction in the very centre of the city, the travel gate, an impressive and worth-seeing object and the same quality time spent with friends or family", - Mr Michelozzi is quoted in the press release.
Great focus on entertainment
According to the manager of the shopping centre "T1" also has the largest entertainment and discovery center in the Baltic States.
A total of 12,000 sq.m., or a fifth of the total leased area, was allocated for entertainment at the facility.
Exclusive accent - a viewing wheel on the roof.
It will lift guests to a height of 120 m above sea level - Tallinn is only a higher TV tower.
After the review of the wheel, on the fourth floor there will be a trampoline park "Super Skypark", where the largest trampoline centre in Europe and the first basketball and plaster square in Estonia will be opened, says the company.
At the interactive SkyLAB research and discovery center, children are expected to occupy at least 5-6 hours.
There will be 360-degree panoramic 4D Chinese in the entertainment complex.
In addition to the usual cinema shown on six halls, visitors will be able to experience the movies of virtual reality with an interactive 7D cinema.
In addition to visual effects and moving according to film rhythm the feeling of reality here will strengthen the sense of wind, rain or snow effects, as well as select smells, smoke or smoke in the cinema.
According to the developer, the opening of T1 is expected to increase Estonian revenue from tourism by EUR 13 million per year, attracting over 300,000 visitors.
Pro Capital Group is listed on Nasdaq Baltic Exchange, as well as on Frankfurt Exchange.
Last year, the group in Lithuania received 1.8 million EUR of sales income and it suffered losses of 350 thousand euros, as indicated by the financial report of Pro Capital Group.
In 2016, almost €9 million of sales income was received on the Lithuanian market and €2.4 million was earned on net profit.
"T1" shopping centre was built by Estonian company "Merko Ehitus".
President Paul Biya is attached to the seventh term after the controversial elections
During a ceremony supervised by Parliament's President Cavaye Yeguie Djibril, for 85 years, Biya promised to protect the unity and unity of the West African state.
The oldest African President, who has ruled his country for 35 years, has been announced as a winner in the 7th election on October, with 71% of the votes.
However, the elections were covered by the low turnout, violence and suspected fraud.
On the eve of Biya’s inauguration, 79 students and three school staff, including the director, were kidnapped in one presbiterion school in the north-western region, where English-speaking separatists carry out a campaign of armed independence.
The majority of the population of Cameroon's 22 million are French and a fifth are English.
In 2016, autonomy was required in the north-west and the neighbouring south-west province in the event of dissatisfiedness with regard to alleged discrimination in the fields of education, courts and economics.
In 2017, when P. Biya refused to relax radically announced the independent state, "the Republic of Ambazonian", and raised weapons.
According to non-governmental organisations, at least 400 civilians and more than 175 security forces were killed during separatist attacks and government response operations this year.
More than 300 thousand people have fled from violence: some cross the border to Nigeria, but many have been forced to live half-breaded in the forests.
During the October elections in the Nordic region, only 5% of voters voted, while 15% in south-western provinces voted in Electorate.
In both parts of the country, Mr Biya collected two thirds of the votes.
Conservative primary elections: errors were caused by a lack of expertise
"Somewhere there was a lack of places, understand that the party organized everything with its resources.
Some municipalities have allowed their own premises, but not everywhere there have been voting booths, because we cannot buy them ourselves.
Thank you to those who lent away," said the politics.
According to him, complaints have been received but their content does not change substantially and violations are not of a malignant nature on their own.
"It was a lesson.
Not all people who took part in the elections had experienced it, and it was also a news for them.
Thus, not all of our actions were in line with our procedures.
Therefore, the CoR had to warn against the principles we described.
Those complaints do not, however, give cause for doubt," said Anušauskas.
According to the President of the CoR, there have been cases where ballot papers have been not stamped - if you know this, ballot papers found in ballot boxes without a stamp have been cancelled.
Some towns lacked space, but according to Anušauskas, complaints and irregularities relate to several tens of ballot papers.
"Well, since the difference is several thousand, it really does not make a fundamental difference for the results of the election," said Anušauskas.
It is argued that the party's participation in the elections was 55%, while the number of non-party voters was 69%.
Both candidates had 400 observers and 600 people worked in commissions.
The results announced on Sunday are also unchanged - 79% of voters voted for the winning Ingrida Simmony, while 21% voted for Vygaud Ushack.
On 17 November, the TS-LC Council will officially support Simmonytė's candidacy in the country's presidential elections next May.
A brief say it's probably not going to meet Putin in Paris
White House National Security Adviser John Bolton previously said that D. Trump would meet with Putin in Paris, where the 100th anniversary of the end of the First World War will take place this week.
However, while leaving for the last motifs before the U.S. Congress mid-election, Trump announced to journalists that he would not be sure if this would be a good opportunity to meet the President of Russia.
"I'm not sure we'll meet in Paris.
Probably not," noted the President of the United States.
However, the President of the White House added, they will meet two at the G-20 Summit and 'likely to meet many times' afterwards.
D. Trump is still trying to "reload" his relations with Moscow, despite suspicions that Russia interfered with the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
Kęstutis Strupas asks the VTEK decision to be annulled
Kęstutis Strupas, the former CEO of Santara clinics of Vilnius University, calls for the annulment of the decision of the Central Commission for Official Ethics (CEC) – it recognises that the transactions have not been declared in due time and that the law has been violated.
Mr Strupas's complaint was examined by Vilnius Regional Administrative Court on Tuesday.
The decision will be published on the 26th of November.
The applicant requests the annulment of the VTEK judgment of 23 May, BNS informed the court representative Sigita Jacinėvičienė Baltadonė.
Mr Strupas believes that the gifts given to family members should not be declared, but he claims that he understood the exception of the law.
In May, VTEK announced that the Director General K. Strupas and Silvia Strupienė, Head of the Ambulatory Rehabilitation Division of the Republic of Vilnius University, had violated the legal provisions regulating declaration of private interests.
The study found that four transactions were declared in non-compliance with the specified deadlines: loan from the bank's spouse in 2010, purchase of securities from the bank in 2017, gift was given to the daughter – apartment in 2017 and loan was granted and not repaid with the spouse's natural person in 1996.
S. Strupienė has also declared these transactions within the deadlines.
Persons who have violated the Law on Harmonisation of Public and Private Interests in the Civil Service may not be encouraged for a year.
The law obliges you to declare not only your particulars but also the details of your spouse.
The study was carried out by VTEK on the basis of information from Info TV.
It has been clarified whether K. Strupas and his spouse, S. Strupienė, Head of the Ambulatory Rehabilitation Division of the Republican Vilnius University Hospital, declared his transactions in due and timely terms.
Last year, according to Info TV, Strupas gave his daughter real estate, worth EUR 125 thousand.
However, the aforementioned data were used by the former head of the clinics of Santa Maria and his wife did not indicate his own declarations of interests.
The legal protection of K. Strupas, together with at least ten more people, has expressed suspicions of corruption investigation - according to law enforcement, the successful procurement of public computers and software in clinics from companies is demanded by illegal financial reward and buried as support.
In this way K. Strupas is suspected to have held at least five times during the Santara clinics in the field of information technology procurement.
Mr Strupe himself denies his fault.
Professor K. Strupas, suspected of corruption, was dismissed from the position of head of the Santa Rican clinics in September.
According to the decision of the Ministry of Health and Vilnius University of Santara clinics, the employment relationship with K. Strups should be terminated at his request.
He has been in charge of the hospital since 10 November 2013.
Professor Juozas Raistenskis continues temporarily to lead Santara clinics until the competition to elect a new Director General is held, promising to announce it this year.

Happily on the occasion of the honorable anniversary, the President thanked the artist for the significant and enriched works and wished him inspiration, happiness and success.
Schools already want to teach otherwise: promises less tests, more practice
Such changes in educational content are planned by the Ministry of Education and Science, which presented them in the forum "Replacement of educational content: foreign experience for decisions in Lithuania" which took place in Vilnius on Monday.
In the debate, Minister of Education and Science Jurgita Petrauskienė said that in the last ten years more than 30 million euros have been invested in updating the content of education, but no results can be seen.
"It is possible that the results of the international study of students' achievements in PISA, the achievements of students are below the OECD average," said Minister of Education and Science Jurgita Petrauskienė.
The report of the Ministry of Education and Science quotes OECD expert Phil Lambert said that Lithuania is too focused on providing knowledge and not on applying it in practice.
According to him, in Lithuania general education programs focus on the literacy of pupils, critical thinking, respect and responsibility, but it is also necessary to develop children's creativity, entrepreneurship, financial literacy, and empathy.
Deputy Minister of Education and Science Gražvydas Kazakevičius presented changes in the content of general education, saying that the scope of the renewed programmes launched this school year will decrease and that they will be more specific, disciplines will be linked more strongly together.
According to the vice-minister, pupils' education will be more individualised, schools will become more independent, and they will be allowed to prepare from 10% to 30% of their unique educational content, and the current system of pupils' assessment will change to the cumulative score, higher weight gain and informally acquired student competence.
Less standardised tests.
Aware that general curricula will be digital, user-friendly, linked to e-resources and task bank.
The aim of updating educational content is to improve pupils' achievements in an international PISA study by at least 10%, while a third of the gap between pupils' achievements and the contemporary competences acquired by pupils at school would be reduced in many areas.
Lithuania plans to allocate EUR 7.8 million from the European Union and state budget to update the content of education since May 2018.
The draft general education programmes updated in the 2019-2020 academic year are expected to be tested in part of the schools and will be implemented in all schools from September 2021 onwards.
At the beginning of October, the Ministry has been criticised for the nearly EUR 8 million project of the Centre for the Development of Education to update the initial, basic and secondary education framework programmes.
The first purchase of EUR 1.3 million was published in early October, looking for programme producers for four years.
After the experts' criticism of this purchase, he suspended, Minister of Education and Science J.Petrauskienė dismissed the Director of the Education Development Centre Giedrius Vaidelis.
Lithuania is a exercise to respond to extreme flooding
On Monday, Lithuania begins a ten-day exercise designed to improve the reaction of institutions to extreme flooding.
As reported by the Fire and Rescue Department (PAG), exercise will check how state institutions are prepared to work on the announcement of state-level emergency situations, such as the flood, to eradicate its effects, to coordinate people's search, rescue and immediate removal from the affected areas, to organise their supply of drinking water, food, to ensure the necessary energy supply, and to provide other means for the protection of the population.
More than 100 representatives from all ministries of the country, other institutions, as well as members of 12 municipal emergency operations centres will participate in the exercise.
On the 5-13 of November, a preparatory exercise phase will take place, during which the municipality, which received information from the Hidromeorology Service on the ongoing criticisms and the beginning of the flooding, will take decisions on emergency management.
The active exercise phase is planned for 14-15 November.
During its period, the Department will be operated by the State Emergency Operations Centre, and in state and municipal institutions - centres for emergency operations of institutions.
Following the announcement by the Government of a state-level emergency due to the effects of the floods, the operation manager appointed by the Prime Minister will lead the emergency response, its relief effects, protection of residents and assets and rescue actions.
Deputy Director of PRTD Mindaugas Kanapickas says that it is most important in the exercise to check the institution's readiness to perform the functions provided for in legal acts, to assess the possibilities for exchanging information, to check how the threat of the disaster is prepared to alert and inform residents, state and municipal institutions, institutions and businesses and to "improve state institutions' emergency management skills".
The exercise will also demonstrate the overall capacity of Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian firefighters to pump large amounts of water from the affected areas.
The BaltFloodCombat module was established for this purpose in 2009.
Retiring Prosecutor General of Ukraine, Yuri Lucenka
On Tuesday, the General Prosecutor of Ukraine, Jurijus Lucenka, announced resignations in the country parliament due to the resonance caused by the death of the people fighting against corruption by the acids, Katerina Ganziuk, the Ukrainian news agency Unian.net.
Under the laws of Ukraine, the Prosecutor General must submit a request for resignation to the President of the country, and this must be submitted to the Supreme Rada for approval by a majority of votes.
On Tuesday, Prosecutor General J. Lucenko introduced the course and results of the law investigation regarding the murder order of K. Gandziuuk in Supreme Rada.
In his speech, the MPs described his study as effective, but expressed the indignation that Mr Ganziuk's death was being exploited by politicians for public relations.
Gandziuk was Ukrainian activist, a fighter against corruption, who spoke publicly about the corruption of the police in her native southern Ukrainian city of Cherson.
On 31 July, an unknown attacker K. Ganziuk snucked his face with acid.
On 4 November, she died in a hospital because of her injury.
Oppositionrs under the Ministry of the Interior of Ukraine require a reply, who killed Mr Gandziuk, Mr AFP/Scanpix.
According to J. Lucenko, the law investigation represents 12 possible persons related to K. Ganziuk's murder order.
However, one of the most likely versions of the study was wasted on the media, which threatens the success of the investigation.
According to the Prosecutor General, as a result of the leaking of information, suspects gained essential knowledge for them.
Mr Lucenko added that he had personally known Mr Gandziuk and was outrageous that some politicians were using its blood for public relations.
"When no one has reason to say that someone is adhering to the government, I want to state that I will make a petition for resignation.
I will present it to the President of Ukraine today and you will have to discuss this issue in the parliament," said Mr Lucenko in Rada, quoted the publication "Obozrevatel".
It is written that Mr Lucenko added that "it is impossible to allow the country to do two-manship, when the law enforcement system is destroyed without any evidence, even for the crimes discovered".
Mr Lucenko is considered to be a close associate of the country's President, Petras Porošenko.
He was appointed Prosecutor General on 12 May 2016 to remove from this post his predecessor suspected of top-level corruption involving officials and politicians.
Minister of Energy Ž. Vaičiūnas meets representatives of Orlen Lietuva
As Elta has been informed by the Minister of Energy Adviser Aurelija Vernickaitė, the meeting will address the achievement of renewable energy targets in the transport sector by 2020 and beyond.
According to the European Commission (EC), transport is the only sector currently falling short of the overall EU-level projections of renewable energy in the national renewable energy action plans, which accounted for 6% of renewable energy in 2015.
In the EC's view, progress towards the mandatory 10% target in the transport sector is rather slow due to a variety of difficulties, including relatively high greenhouse gas reduction costs and unclear regulation.
Renewable energy in this sector is mainly derived from biofuels (88%) and electricity plays a smaller role at this stage.
The Seimas took the initiative to complement the questions of the investigation of corruption with the referral of conservatives to the CT
On Tuesday after submission, the Seimas supported the proposal made by Agnė Širinskienė, the "State" of the political leader for the investigation on the illegal influence of political processes.
For there were 58 Seimas Members, against - 27, nine Parliamentaries abstained.
The draft will be further discussed by the Seimas Committees, appointed mainly by the Committee on Legal and Legal Affairs, under the authority of A. Širinskiene.
Following its conclusion, the decision to amend the resolution will be put to the vote.
Currently, the temporary investigation commission of the Seimas, which is conducting a new political corruption investigation, has been indicated as to what possible illegal influence may occur in 2008-2016.
A. Širinskiene has proposed an extension of this period, stating that "in public space there has been significant information about possible illicit influence and influence on political processes and state institutions".
A. Širinskienė in the project refers to "the possible representation of the interests of pension funds in the legislative process or appealing to the Constitutional Court or attempts to influence decision-making processes of significant independent institutions such as the Chief Official Ethics Commission".
The appeal to the Constitutional Court on pensions was initiated by opposition conservatives.
The rulers of "States" found that the Conservatives relied to a large extent on private pension fund lawyers' arguments in their application.
The leaders of the "Stateists" are accused of the former fellow Paul Urbšis by the leaders of the Chief Official Ethics Commission (CEC).
According to them, the former Chairman of the Committee on State Administration and Local Authorities of the Seimas was able to instruct the members of the VTEK to dismiss the former head of the Commission's Prevention Division, Mindaugas Siauru.
At the end of September, the Seimas drew up a commission to explain the possible illegal influence of interested persons or groups of persons, influence on the conduct of elections, formation of coalitions, work of parliamentary groups, individual politicians, activities and funding of parties and public movements, legislative processes, appointment of members of state-owned enterprises, heads of public bodies, management or supervisory bodies.
It is also proposed to look at the information provided by law enforcement and intelligence authorities to the competent authorities on how it was responded.
The investigators should submit their conclusions before 1 May of the following year.
The President, the European Parliament's election campaign, will take place at that time.
Of the 12 members of the Commission, seven are representatives of "States".
Two social workers were also appointed as members, one "orderary", liberal, and a representative of the Lithuanian Polish Elections-Critical Family Union.
Conservatives and social democrats refused to participate in the work of the commission.
The new investigation was initiated by Ramūnas Karbauskas, the Chairman of the ruling Lithuanian Peasants and Green Union.
According to him, the last session of the National Security and Defence Committee (NSGC) investigation has, in principle, shown the need to continue the investigation for the same reasons.
German Head of Internal Intelligence lost his post
The 55-year-old Maasssen controversy was further moved to declare that he was responsible for his problems in the coalition of 'radial left-wing forces' by Merkel.
As a result, he was not transferred to another post, as promised, but forced to leave the reserve.
Among other things, last weekend it became apparent that Mr Maassensen criticised the 'naive' immigration policy at the European Inter-Intellectual Intelligence Organisations' meeting in Warsaw a few weeks ago.
After defending the head of intelligence for a long time, Horst Seehofer, German Minister of the Interior, said at a press conference on Monday that the recent comments by Mr Massen were unacceptable and 'responsible in person'.
Mr Seehofer, who himself was under pressure both because of this dispute and because of the poor performance of his party in the Bavarian local government elections, asked President Frank-Wallter Steinmeier to release Maassen to the reserve.

The humiliated girls are destroying stereotypes about wedding dresses
Wrinkle girl with a white snooze dress - mission (no) possible?
Can a white swan floating towards the altar be larger than the size of S or M and still look attractive?
The participants of the plus size reality show "Evolution of Dydžio (r)" will prove today that the beauty and elegance of brides will certainly not depend on the kilogrammes of a woman.
But that's not all - one of the girls in the project will be a happy tears tonight - the filming spot will show up her boyfriend.
"There are some who think that bigger girls don't get boys' attention or looks.
It's just a myth - my boyfriend's himself a sportsman, but I like him as I am, he doesn't require a figure that conforms to some standard from me," Aurika will be taking part in the show before the show with a wedding dress.
Wedding dress is not easy, all meanings, clothing - it is a complex construction, it is a lot of materials, it is a heavy dress, it is uncomfortable to move.
Some women also think that a bigger girl in the white dress will look even bigger and thus less self - confident.
I can assure you that the appropriate dress model solves this "problem" really," explained one of the board members of the show, fashion designer Robert Kalinkin.
The fate of the girls in the project R. Kalinkinas is decided together with the commission - the house of the plus size of fashion is opened in Erika Vitulskiene, photographer and social networking star Nagliu Bieranca and TV producer Laura Pukše.
"When you decide which girl has to say goodbye to the show, there is a lot of strife among the members of the commission - because we all represent different spheres and we think differently of the winner of the show.
The task of demonstrating wedding dresses has been further complicated, and that - and I can now disclose - there have been two newcomers who have certainly not been worse than they were.
It was a special evening for all purposes," says Kalinkin.
Young people - 23 years of scandalous behavior on one summer reality show famous Ieva and 31 years of exceptional beauty for two children Dovile - like other girls, participated in "Dydžio (r) evolution" selection and came to the top twenty.
Unfortunately, after the first highly open photo shoot of girls on the streets of Vilnius city, they had to say goodbye to the project.
On the show, the girls were returned to the LNK spectators who voted for their favorites on the TV portal.
Having received international recognition, the reality show of the carnivores in Lithuania is already taking place for the second week, where plus girls competed for the first country plus the name of the star.
So far there are only eight of them - and they all understand perfectly that the winner will only be one.
The exciting and unpredictable reality show "Evolution of Dydžio (r)" starts already this Monday evening at 20.30 p.m. on LNK.
Actor I. Elba has been chosen as the most sexual man in the world
The U.S. magazine People has published this year's most sexy man in the world.
It became British actor Idris Elba, a 46-year-old actor.
Although the man claims that this message was unexpected, he did not feel embarrassed about the new title.
I thought, "You can't be!
Seriously?"
Then I looked at myself in the mirror and thought about -- yes, today I look sexy -- laughing at the actor.
Speaking openly, Idris pointed out that this title, which is a very pleasant feeling that comforted his ego.
The British star believes that he has often received outrageous words and taunts that have made his childhood difficult, because, as the name suggests, he was "very high and inexpensive".
The young actor would not believe in and become the object of taunts because of her rare and unusual name and her African origin.
"I've just raised my mustaches and my muscles, and I have become the strongest guy in my city area," said Idris.
When a man loses his pride on Osse screens, Elba works for a discord at the parties organised in Spain and especially in the lush Ibiza.
During his leisure time, he enjoys the Thai boxing and has a hymn of fashion that he realizes, creating his own line of clothing.
The British actor believes that the most important thing for him in the world is family, so he plans a wedding with the engagement Sabrina Dhowre.

A fatally beaten man in an irrigated area
On Monday evening, a man was killed with death in the Šalkiškiai village of Sirvintai District during a drinking room.
According to data from Vilnius County Police, at 21:16 a notice was received that during the drinking sessions the man beat the neighbor.

Managers no longer require 20 km in the construction of waste incineration plants
Vilnius cogeneration power plant is being built, near the Gariūnai market.
The governors no longer claim that the construction of the waste incinerators would maintain a distance of 20 miles [20 km] from the settlements.
On Monday, Kęstutis Mažeika, the head of the Environmental Protection Committee, registered in the Seimas an amendment to the Waste Management Law which waives such a requirement.
According to Mr Mazeika, the Group of "States" who previously supported the provision for a distance of 20 km, the amendment to her refusal promises to support.
The amendment by Mr Mazeika provides that from January 2019 the waste incineration plants could be constructed with statutory environmental and public health protection requirements.
He acknowledged that the amendments had led to the President's doubts about such a ban.
"Being in mind the definition of the territory of residence, it is clear that it is almost impossible to discover a place where the above objects can be built," says the chairman of the committee.
In October, the Governing Body opposed the veto corrections to strengthen the construction of waste incineration plants.
In addition to the insurance of building power plants closer than 20 km from settlements, the amendment authorised the Government to take decisions on the future of the two power plants already under construction, taking into account the interests of public health.
The latter, Mr Mazeika, is not proposing to change.
The electricity group "Lietuvos energija" is built with waste and biofuel in Vilnius and together with the Finnish energy group "Fortum Heat Lietuva" company "Fortum Heat" in Kaunas.
The latter is already burning waste in Klaipeda.
Talking about a possible compromise in the Brexit negotiations
On Monday, the British and Irish leaders discussed a possible compromise on the difficult Northern Ireland issue, which was the result of the Brexit negotiations, reported by Dublin.
Speaking by telephone, British Prime Minister Theresa May offered the opportunity to review the so-called 'insurance agreement' mechanism, which would allow the United Kingdom to remain at an open border between the province of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland belonging to the European Union.
Irish Prime Minister Leo Waradkar promised to consider this proposal, but rejected any possibility for Britain to withdraw unilaterally from this agreement, as stated in a report published by the Irish Government.
In his conversation with Mr May, 'an opportunity to review the mechanism of insurance measures' was set out in it.
"The War has allowed us to understand that new proposals are open to review, provided that the outcome of such a review does not relate to a unilateral decision to terminate the use of insurance measures," said the Government report.
Brexit's negotiators do not find an acceptable solution for avoiding checks at the UK-Ireland land border, when Britain will withdraw from the single market and customs union next year.
The two parties agree on 'insurance measures' to maintain the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland open pending the signing of a larger trade agreement to ensure that no additional customs checks at the border are carried out.
The EU wants Northern Ireland to continue to comply with EU customs rules, but London wants it to be applied temporarily to the United Kingdom as a whole.
The Daily Telegraph newspaper announced on Monday that Dominica Raab, Secretary of Brexit, would like Britain to withdraw from the cartel agreement unilaterally after three months.
However, Varadkars told journalists in Dublin that his government 'could'.
"The three-month or limited-term insurance measure shall not be a valuable paper on which it will be drawn up," he said.
Previously, London and Brussels did not approve information on the outbreak of Brexit in negotiations after the weekend of the report in Britain that the agreement was reached - hand.
"I would say that we are continuing to make progress in the negotiations, but there is still work," said Mr May's representative in London.
Margaritis Schin, European Commission representative, also said to journalists: 'We are not there'.
Nobel Prize winners call for access to reliable information
On Monday, the group will welcome thinkers, including Nobel laureates, by issuing a declaration calling for the right to have reliable information at the Internet era.
Among the 25 signatories to the International Declaration on Information and Democracy, there are economists Amartya Senas and Joseph Stiglitz, an Iranian lawyer and human rights activist Shirin Ebadi, who won the Nobel Peace Prize, as well as the winner of the Nobel Prize, Mario Vargas Losa.
'We call on the leaders of good will on all continents to take action to strengthen democratic models and open public debate, through which citizens can take decisions on the basis of facts,' says the Group report.
They argue that the 'global area of information and communication' is a common good, which 'must be protected in order to strengthen freedom of expression and opinion'.
"People have a fundamental right to information that is freely collected, processed and disseminated in accordance with the principles of commitment to the truth, pluralism of attitudes and rational methods of establishing facts," the authors added.
The document asks for help from world leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump (Donald Trump), who often criticises the "false news" but who are regularly accused of a distortion of the facts.
World leaders should express their position on this issue when they called on the signatories to the Peace Forum to be held in Paris on 11-13 November.
This declaration was made within two months under the authority of Mr Ebadi and Mr Christophe Deloire, head of the media freedom and media protection organisation "Reporters without frontiers" (RSF) based in Paris.
Among others, Signatories are the former President of Senegal, Abdu Duuf, a Chinese lawyer and human rights activist, Teng Biao, and political scientist Francisco Fukuyama.
The Seimas confirmed higher penalties for harmful products
The Seimas approved amendments to the product safety law providing that penalties for breaches of product safety should be increased.
The amendments were adopted unanimously in the Chamber.
As the Seimas Health Committee member, Mr Vinkus, said about the new draft, it is to be welcomed that the objectives set are linked to better consumer protection for products.
It also adapts its provisions to the requirements of the Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
"My head, the proposed draft law, is more perfect and concretely distributed among all actors involved in the supply and distribution process: producers, service providers, importers, distributors and others.
As has been shown in practice, the current system of fines does not always prevent further infringements, because entities who pay fines continue to commit repeated infringements," Mr Vinkus said.
The project was prepared by the Ministry of Economy, after approval by the Government, and was supplemented by proposals by the Seimas Economic Committee.
The amendments to the law aim at increasing penalties for infringements, strengthening consumer rights protection, giving more power to market surveillance authorities and establishing a clear framework for the enforcement and enforcement of requirements on product safety.
According to the Ministry of Economy, producers are currently not obliged to properly label the product and thereby ensure its traceability.
Moreover, according to the Ministry, the state control of product safety by the market surveillance authorities does not grant access to the territory, buildings, premises and inspections of manufacturers and suppliers, which makes it difficult for the authorities to carry out their work.
In the opinion of the Ministry, the six-month time limit for imposing fines and warnings is too short to establish the infringement, carry out the investigation and impose the fine.
Moreover, according to the Ministry, the fines imposed are not sufficiently effective.
Businesses often repeatedly violate the requirements of the law - in 2017 alone, they did 14 companies.
The Ministry of Economy has proposed to impose an obligation on producers to properly label the product and thus to ensure its traceability in order to facilitate the clarification of non-compliant suppliers by market surveillance authorities.
It is also proposed to grant market surveillance authorities the right to have access to checks of operators who produce, place on the market, territory, buildings, premises, and operators when carrying out the state control of product safety.
The intention is to increase the amounts of fines for violations of the law.
A fine of EUR 150 to 2 500 (now EUR 144 to 1.448) shall be imposed on the manufacturer, importer or authorised representative who has placed on the market dangerous products and on the distributor who has made them available on the market.
A fine of between 1 000 and 5 000 (now between 868 and 4 344) would be imposed on the State Consumer Rights Protection Authority (CRSA) or other market surveillance authority if it decided to prohibit the placing on the market and making available on the market of dangerous products or the provision of dangerous services.
Failure to comply with the requirement to withdraw, recover and destroy dangerous products from consumers would result in a fine of between 2500 and 6 500 (now EUR 1.448 and 5,792).
A fine of EUR 2 500 to EUR 15 000 (now EUR 1.448 to 11584) would be imposed in the event of damage to the health of the consumer by dangerous products.
If dangerous products caused the consumer's death, a fine ranging from EUR 6 500 to EUR 25 000 (now EUR 5,792 to EUR 23 169) would be imposed.
According to the Ministry, a fine of up to EUR 25 000 is imposed for infringements of product safety legislation in Poland and Austria (the minimum fine is not fixed), in Belgium a fine of between EUR 26 and EUR 600 000, in Romania a fine of between EUR 155 and EUR 666, and in Bulgaria a fine of between EUR 125 and EUR 7 500.

Norwegian armed battalion participated in NATO exercises in the outermost and harshest areas
Wars from the Norwegian armed forces participated in a series of difficult training mountains located north of Oslo the capital.
This is part of NATO Exercise Trail Connection 2018 - the largest NATO exercise since the end of the Cold War.
Most troops from the second Norwegian military battalion spent much time away from home, in places like Afghanistan - that is, in the warm lands, after September 11th terrorist attacks.
But most of all, they have learned to fight under Arctic conditions, and these skills are especially useful now when NATO changes its focus.
In recent days, in the east of the mountains of Tinset, often in the outermost and harshest areas, soldiers have been involved in in incensated battles against the real British soldiers.
Wars have the ability to survive in this cold in the wild, but in a harsh climate they have to drag much more weight on their shoulders - one hut weighing about 50 kg.
The commanders say that they share their skills in how to survive and war under such conditions with other NATO troops.
According to the soldiers, these exercises, which, like anything else in particular, resemble a real war, will teach them to be ready if there is a serious threat.

According to the paper, the roofs will be canopy.
"The cover worn by an emergency condition threatened the surrounding - people could fall into contact and injury - so it was necessary to replace it.
The roofs were no longer resistant to moisture, so the heritage was also damaged," explained the director of the museum.
Will these rooftops be similar to those of centuries ago?
"All the works are combined with heritage and other institutions", - G. Jažeidėlis added that the result should be as authentic as possible, but at the same time an important and practical side - roofs must protect values from moisture.
A universal solution is chosen when working with the heritage.
Prior to this, the elements of Kaunas Castle were covered in the Soviet era, so they no longer had historical values", – detailed the director of Kaunas City Museum.
The contract of employment was signed on 2 October.
It is planned that the works will not last longer than three months after the signing of the contract.
"Of the hope that it will be completed by the end of November," said the museum director.

This amount, according to Mr Pasnekov, was foreseen in the budget for this year.
Works are carried out by the company "Statija".

Eastern Europe Studies Centre will cooperate with two major US brain centres
According to Linas Kojala, head of the EESC, based in Vilnius and counting for 13 years, the engagement of the USA will allow to implement projects and make Lithuania's voice heard more easily on the other side of the Atlantic.
"In this direction, we have worked purposefully for several months.
I am pleased that two large institutions see us as partners and are looking for opportunities for joint activities.
I have no doubt that niche activities will occur, because the topics of NATO, security, disinformation and development of the Eastern Partnership countries that we analyse are also priorities for them," said Kojala.
The agreements note that the EESC and the US authorities will work together to prepare proposals for international projects, exchange of expertise and knowledge, and conduct expert visits.
This should be particularly useful for Lithuanian analysts, since both partners have a great international reputation.
FPRI has been active since 1955 and unites almost one hundred top levels of analysts.
The FPRI has been the seventh place in its category in the latest global rating of analytical centres at the University of Pennsylvania.
At the time, CEPA, whose analysts were repeatedly invited to consult and work on the highest US political institutions, is in the same category as the top ten.
"This will provide more opportunities for Lithuanian analysts working in various institutions to get into the U.S. information space and encourage us to raise our cartel", Kojala added.
One of the first practical steps should be to assist partners in distribution of the soon-to-vessel EESC analytical publication "Lithuanian Foreign Policy Review" among US decision makers and the public space.
The Eastern Europe Studies Centre operates on the basis of projects implemented and is not supported by targeted grants.
EESC partners with which joint initiatives are being implemented include the European Commission, NATO, USAID, various international funds, etc.
