When an English speaker observes that a foreigner who he speaks with does not understand something from his words, he repeats it exactly, but louder, as if he were deaf. Not at any time, he does not come to mind that his choice of words could be difficult, or that his expression could be easily understood by a foreigner, and that he could say it more easily with other words.
