The members of the Wales Assembly are concerned that “began to look like dolls”
Some members of the Assembly have made a suggestion to change their name to the MWP (in Wales).
This concerns the intention to change the name of the Assembly, the Wales Parliament.
The Assembly was concerned that this could make sense at political level.
One member of the "Work" Assembly said that his group was concerned, "that's why it is worried about "Twp" and "Pwp".
Not for Wales' readers: In Valu language "twp" means "little", and "pwp" means "something".
"Plai" Assembly member said that the entire group was "unsatisfied" and suggested an alternative.
The conservative of Wales claimed that his political group was "open" due to the change of name, but noted that this was a shortening of the word from MWP to "ple".
The letter of Matthew is similar to the letter of Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing draft legislation to change the title, said: "The final decision on all names of members of the Assembly will, of course, be a matter for its own members."
In addition, the Commission received comments from several interested parties.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on proposals that received strong support to the Assembly to call the Wales Parliament.
As regards the name of the members of the Assembly, the Commission preferred the members of the Wales Parliament or the WMP, but during the public consultation MWP received the greatest support.
The members of the Assembly clearly offer alternative options, but efforts to reach an agreement can become a headache for the Presidency, Elin Jones, from which it is expected to submit draft amendments within a few weeks.
Legislation on reforms will include other amendments to the Assembly's work, including rules on the disskilling of a member of the Assembly and the committee's framework plan.
During the legislative debate, members of the Assembly will have a decisive vote on how they should be called.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing the name of the country
On Sunday, voters will vote to change their country's name to the Republic of Macedonia.
The general vote was held to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province, called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour means claims to the territory of Greece and reiterated its opposition to Macedonia's aspirations for accession to the EU and NATO.
In opposition to the plebiscit on the change of name, Macedonia's President, Gjorge Ivanov, said that he would not vote.
However, referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that changing the name is simply a price that simply needs to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martynas and other churches in Harlem’s difficult times were darkened
“The people I spoke to said that they could find a bar and a church historically on every corner,” said Adams.
- You can't find one or the other today."
He said that it was understandable why the bars were gone.
“Today, people are interacting differently, ” he said.
- Bars are no longer a neighbour's website where people are constantly gathering."
When he talks about churches, he is concerned that the money that he obtains when he sells property will not be sufficient for the long term, as the leaders expect, “and sooner or later they will return to the place where they started.”
He added that churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with co-operative apartments with people who would not help the rest of the temples.
"The majority of people who will buy co-operative apartments in these multi-apartment buildings will be white," he said, "and will therefore extend the moment when the churches will close completely, because it is unlikely that most of these people who have moved to these co-operative apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built in 1870 by the white-congregations, before Harlem became a black metropolis – a community of metropolis, and St. Martyn Church was built ten years later.
The initial Cogregation of the White Methodists was established in the 1930s.
The black cogregation that had made a service nearby took over the building’s name.
St. Martynas Church was taken over by the black cogregation with the clergyman John Howard Johnson, who led the retailer boycott on the 125th street, the main store in Harlem, which refused to employ or appoint higher positions in black.
In 1939 the building was severely destroyed by fire, but since the parishion of the spiritual father Johnson was planning to rebuild it, they ordered a caylion.
The priest David Johnson, the son of Johnson the spiritual father and the heir in St. Martyn's church, called the poor bells the proud caylion.
The experts who closed the caylion in July called it otherwise – the "cultural treasure" and "an indispensable historical instrument".
Michigan University expert Tiffany Ng also mentioned that this was the first calories in the world to be played by a black musician Dionis A. Lind. 18 years ago he started playing as a calories in the Riversaid church.
Merriweather said that St. Martyn's church did not change his other musician.
What happened in the church of St. Martynas in the last few months was a difficult story of architects and contractors – some of them were invited by church worlds and others – by the bishopy of the Episcopal Church.
Zacristia is a parish management body made up of world leaders, and in July the Bishop expressed his concern that the Bishop “will try to shift costs” to the zacristy, although she did not hire architects and contractors sent by the Bishop.
Some parishioners complained that the bishopy was not transparent.
Shark in California wounded the lobster catching during the 13th century
The officers reported that a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy on Saturday when he caught lobster in California on the opening day of the lobster catching season.
He was attacked 7 a.m. morning in Ensinitas near the Spartan beach.
Had Hammel San Diego KSWB-TV wires said that he would dive with friends on Saturday morning for about half an hour when he heard a boy shouting for help, and then came with a group to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said to me at first that the boy was thrilled when he got the lobster, but then he realized that the boy was crying: “I got bit!
I'm bitten!"
Hammel said that when the boy came near, he noticed that all his key bone had been removed.
“I began to cry to everyone to climb out of the water: “Freshing in the water!” added Hammel.
The boy was deployed by plane to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was recognised to be in critical condition.
The type of shark attacking a boy is unknown.
Captain Larry Gilles said to the media that a shark was observed in that zone a few weeks ago, but it was decided that it was not a dangerous species of shark.
He added that the victim had injury to the upper part of the body.
Officials closed the beach from Casablad Pont to Ensinitas Swami for 48 hours due to investigation and protection.
Gilles mentioned that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the zone, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to rush to the UK beauty market
"Sainsbury's" takes over "Boots", "Superdrug" and "Debenhams" with beauty departments of universal shop style, which will be made by specialist consultants.
The active push to the market of GBP 2.8 billion of beauty, which continues to grow, while the sales of fashion and household goods fall, larger beauty product divisions will be tested for 11 shops across the country and, if they are successful, there will be more shops next year.
Investment in beauty is growing, and supermarkets are looking for ways to use shelves, once dedicated to televisions, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's announced that it will double its beauty range up to 3 000 product names, including "Revlon", "Essie", "Tweezerman" and "Dr. PawPaw" for the first time.
The existing "L'Oreal", "Maybelline" and "Burt's Bees" range will also receive more space in trademark zones similar to those in stores such as "Boots".
The shopping centre is also again publishing its product range of Boutique makeup, most of which are vegan products – this is increasingly required by younger customers.
In addition, the "Fragrance Shop" perfume store will test discounts in two "Sainsbury's" shops, from which the first opened last week in Croidone, South London, and the second will open later in Seli Ouke, Birmingam.
Due to online shopping and the desire to buy small quantities daily from local commodity shops, supermarkets need to make more effort to attract people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said that the sales offices increasingly look like department stores, because chains in supermarkets are trying to combat sales of goods cheaper by Aldi and Lidl, offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's included Argos in hundreds of shops and also installed a large number of Habitat shops, because two years ago it bought both networks that claimed to have strengthened the sale of food items and their acquisition was more profitable.
The previous shopping centre's attempt to upgrade its beauty and medicine department ended in failure.
At the beginning of the 1st century, Sainsbury's has tried a joint venture with Boots, but the union has ended a dispute about how to distribute income from pharmacy shops in shopping centres.
The new strategy emerged after Sainsbury's sold $125 million three years ago in its 281 store, the owner of the Linyds Pharmacy network Celesio.
It was claimed that Lloyds' contribution to this plan was added to the expanded range of luxury leather trademarks, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We changed the exterior and atmosphere of beauty departments to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be ready to give advice.
The assortment of our brands is designed to meet every need, and due to the attractive environment and convenient places we are now an attractive place of beauty, challenging an old method of purchase."
Peter Jones is "included" due to the fact that Holly Willoughby interrupted a GBP 11 million deal with him
"Dragons Den" star Peter Jones has "included" after Holly Willoughby, the TV conductor, cut off 11 million pounds of his way of life brand to focus on new contracts with "Marks and Spencer" and ITV
Willoughby has no longer time for their home-based brand "Truly" and accessories.
The two businesses were compared with the Gwyneth Paltrow Goop brand.
The Head of This Morning's 37-year release at Instagram has announced his departure.
Holly Willoughby's last moment left a profitable lifestyle brand to focus on his new big deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV, angry Den star Peter Jones.
Sources say that Jones was "included" when, at a peak on Tuesday, a golden TV girl admitted at the headquarters of his business empire Marlou (Bakingamshire) that new transactions aimed at up to GBP 1.5 million would no longer be sufficient time to give him a mark of his household goods and accessories "Truly".
Business was compared with Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand, and it was alleged that he had to double his GBP 11 million assets.
Since "Truly" has been announced in the 37-year-old H. Willoughby Instagram account, Jones has moved from Britain to one of his summer houses.
The source said, "Truly" has so far been one of the top Holly priorities.
It must have been its long - term future, which will last for the next few decades.
Her decision to leave all was extremely surprised.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday because the beginning was so close.
The office of Marlou shall have a full warehouse of ready-to-sold goods.'
Experts believe that the exit of The Morning lead, which is one of the most financially successful stars in Britain, can cost the company millions of investment in products, from cushions and candles to clothes and household goods, as well as the delay in starting.
And that could be the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children, Mr Willoughby, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, had a close relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for decades.
In 2016, Willoughby with T. Cappu founded "Truly", while 52-year-old P. Jones joined the fight as President.
The couple are on holiday together, and Mr Jones has 40 % of the shares in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the ambassador of M&S brand and will replace the head of I'm A Celebrity.
The immediate source of Jones said yesterday: "We will not comment on his business."
We had a tough talk and "so we fell in love"
He laughed at the criticism he received from the media about the comment that some might consider to be "non-presist", as well as about the fact that he is making a positive contribution to the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
A brief, judicious "new driver" said: "
"I didn't give up anything."
He mentioned that Kim was interested in the second meeting after the first meeting in Singapore in June, which took place in Singapore, as a major step towards North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
However, negotiations on nuclear disarmament are on a string.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top-ranking diplomat Ri Yong Ho said to world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea does not receive an "appropriate response" from the US regarding North Korea's early disarmament.
It noted that the US maintained instead the sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
In his brief speech, he expressed a much more optimistic view.
“We are doing well with North Korea,” he said.
- We kept fighting with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We now maintain this wonderful relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had produced positive results: the end of rocket trials, the release of hostages and the return of support from American troops home.
He defended his unusual attitude when he spoke about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s easy to be a president, but instead of having 10 000 people who want to get to this blocked arena, we’ll better have about 200 people standing here,” said Trump, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
The Indonesian tsunami and earthquake destroyed the island by killing hundreds of people
Following the Lombard earthquake, foreign non-governmental organisations were informed that their assistance was not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombard was deployed, this was not announced in a national disaster as a necessary condition for international assistance.
“In many cases, unfortunately, it has been said very clearly that there is no need for international assistance, so it is a little complicated,” said Sumbung.
Although “Save the Children” prepares a team that will go to Pala, it is still unclear whether foreign workers will be able to work on the ground.
A representative of a national disaster agency, Sutopo, said that the Indonesian authorities assessed the situation in Pala in order to find out if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid.
The country is still sadly unprepared for natural wrath, given the constant earthquakes that Indonesia is experiencing.
Although the shelter from the tsunami was built in Aceh, it is not common on other shores.
In spite of the announced warning, Pala, due to a lack of obvious tsunami warning, the loss of life is likely to have increased.
The best time to travel between many of the Indonesian islands is difficult.
As a result of natural disasters, logistics is becoming even more complex.
A hospital ship deployed in Lombarda and treated against the earthquake victims sails to Pala, but it will reach a new location at least three days later.
President Joko Widodo chose his election campaign centre to rebuild the Indonesian infrastructure destroyed, and he generously spent money on roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding did not cause the administration of Jacob to be calm, as he would be reinstated in the coming years.
There is also no pressure on the remaining sectarian tension in Indonesia, where the majority of Muslims adhere to more conservative forms of faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands have been expelled from their homes because Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets using machetes, bows with arrows and other ordinary weapons.
Look at: Daniel Sturidge, Liverpool player, wins a far-reaching match with Chelsea.
Daniel Sturiridge saved Liverpool from his defeat at the Premier League (89 minutes) at the Stanford Bridge stadium in London.
With their team falling behind 1:0, Xherdan Shaqiri passed the ball about 30 meters from the Chelsea gate to the former Sturidge.
He jumped the ball on his left feet and hit towards his long-distance steps.
The ball, raised above the fine spot, flew to the right of the top corner of the network.
He finally passed over the jumping kepa Arrizabalaga and reached the grid.
“I've just tried to get a ball and players like Shaq always play as far as possible in front of it, so I just tried to keep as much time as possible for impact – LiverpoolFC.com said Sturibridge.
- I saw Kante coming back, set the ball in one thing, and, without thinking too much, I just kicked off."
After the Belgian star Eden Hazard's 25-minute victory "Chelsea" from the first chair of 1:0.
During that attack, the “blue” attacker returned the ball to Mateo Kovaccici and hurried towards Liverpool in the middle of the square.
In the middle of this square, the wall was quickly broken.
Then peacefully sent the ball between the opponents to the finefield for Hazard.
Hazard overcame the protectors and directed the ball to the net by the far-way wrestling of Alison Becker's left leg impact.

The number of deaths from Indonesian tsunami is already 832
As reported earlier on Sunday by the country’s disaster agency, the number of deaths in Indonesia from the earthquake and tsunami rose to 832.
The agency’s spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho announced at a press conference that many people were trapped in ruins caused by an earthquake of 7.5 on Friday, causing waves of 6 metres.
The city of Pala, with more than 380 000 people, was demolished by collapsed buildings.
Police arrested 32-year-old man suspected of murder after death of a woman
The murder study was started after a woman’s body was found in Berkenhed (Mersisaide) this morning.
A 44 - year - old woman was found at 7.55 p.m. at Graison Muuse, John Street, with a 32 - year - old man arrested on the suspicion of murder.
The police urged people who had seen or heard in the area to speak.
Detective inspector Brian O'Hagan said: “As long as the investigation phase is early, I would like to appeal to all who were near John Street in Berkenhed and have seen or heard something suspicious that they would contact us.
I would also like to appeal to all drivers, especially taxi drivers who could have recorded anything in the video recorder, and contact us because they may have information that is essential for our investigation."
The police representative confirmed that the woman whose body was found is a resident of Berkenhed and that she was found in the building.
This afternoon, my friends who knew the woman came to the site to ask where she was found this morning.
Studies are still ongoing as the police reported that the victim's nearest relatives were informed.
A taxi driver living in Graison Muuse just tried to return to his apartment, but the police said that no one should enter and leave the building.
He's lost his promise when he found out what happened.
The people are now told that we will have to wait a few hours before they are allowed to return to their homes.
It was heard how a police officer told one man that now the whole territory is considered to be a crime scene.
The woman showed up at the scene of the crime.
She kept saying, "It's so scary."
At 14:00 two of the police vans stood in front of the barrier on the inside, and another van behind it on the outside.
Many officials stood on the inside of the barrier and watched the block of multi-apartment buildings.
Anyone with information requested to write @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, indicating the number of September 30.
The statues of Parliament's Kromwell are hit by the last impact of the "historic rewriting" dispute.
Its removal would be a poetic justice for the destruction of the cultural and religious heritage of England, which resembles Taliban actions, under the responsibility of the fanatical Puriton followers of Kromvely.
However, the Cromwell Society described Mr Crick's proposal as "false" and "the attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the course of the current debate on the transfer of statues, the statue of Oliver Krumwell at the Westminster Palace would inevitably have become a target.
The kromvel did not order or execute the iconoclasm of the English civil wars.
Perhaps not that Kromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of the ancestor Thomas in the last century.
The wonderful image of Kromwell, created by Sir William Ham Thorneycroft, is a reflection of the 19th century perspective and a historical part of the figure, which many still consider worthy of honor.
Goldsmith The Sunday Telegraph said: “Many people, perhaps more than today at the end of the 19th century, Kromvelis was regarded as a parliamentary defender from external pressure, which was, of course, a monarchy.
Whether it is quite accurately portrayed, historians have so far argued.
One thing is clear is that the conflict between the mid - 17th century was the later development of our nation, and Cromwell became an exceptional figure representing one of the sides of this section.
His achievements as the protector of the Lord are also worthy of mention and honor."
A slaughterer killed a Chinese farmer
According to local media reports, in the south-west China market, the pig attacked and destroyed the farmer.
On Sunday, Morning Post reported that a dead man named Yuan had been found. Because of the damaged artery, he had been covered with blood and lay next to the pig girl in the Lupanshua market in Guidjau Province (South China).
On 30 May 2005, a pig farmer prepared vaccines for pigs in a pig in Sining, Chiinghai, China.
He reported that on Wednesday, along with his cousin, he is going to travel to the markets to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, a cousin found a relative dead and found a door open to a nearby pig.
He said that there was a big bitch in the pig, whose mouth was uncleaned with blood.
According to the report, the expert confirmed that a pig weighing 250 kg had a farmn’s silvered.
"Guiyang Evening News" quotes: "My cousin's legs were bloody and injured," said the cousin, referring to his name Wu.
The security camera video showed Yuan in the marketplace at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday.
His body was found about an hour.
A man was not part of Yuan or his cousin.
The Turkish leader reported to Evaming News that the pig had to be locked to prevent other people from attacking, and kept the police collecting evidence on site.
Yuan’s family and market power are reported to negotiate compensation for death.
Although few have been reported, cases of human pigs have been reported in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, and her husband was particularly dangerously injured.
Ten years ago, the pig weighing 295 pounds [95 kg] pushed the Wales farmer to the tractor and pressed the animal until the wife died.
After the pigs at Oregon farm in 2012, one Manitoba farmer, CCC News, told that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that their aggressiveness can lead to blood taste.
“It’s just playful.
They like candy, they're very curious... they don't want to harm anyone.
You just have to respect them accordingly," he said.
Urragan Rose's "remains" bring a lot of rain to the southwest of the USA
The storm Rosa is forecast to decline by moving through the cooler waters along the north coast of Mexico.
In the coming days, however, Rose will bring plenty of rain to the whole north of Mexico and to the southwest of the United States.
On Sunday, 5 p.m., Rose moved 137 km/h as a Category 1 storm and was 620 km southwest of Euchenian bribery (Mexico).
Rose is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, the Pacific is beginning to form a whole range of low-pressure areas and to the east, towards the west coast of the United States. Since Rosa will approach the California Peninsula as a tropical storm, it will begin to carry a large tropical humidity to the north, south-west of the USA.
On Monday, Rose will cause rain in some areas of Mexico to reach 25 inches [25 cm].
Then, tropical humidity, interacting with the approaching outlying low - pressure area, brings in the next days a widespread ditching rain to the southwest.
Instead of 2.5 to 10 centimetres, the rain will cause a dangerous sudden flood, a stream of ruins, and a potential landslide in the desert.
High tropical moisture in some places, especially in the south of Nevada and Arizona, will fall from 5 to 8 centimeters per hour.
Rains between 5 and 8 centimetres are expected in south-western regions, especially in large parts of Arizona.
Due to the irregular nature of rain, possible sudden flooding and rapidly deteriorating conditions.
A particularly poor idea of rising tropical storms would be to get into the desert on foot.
The heavy rain canyons can be turned into raging rivers, and thunderstorms can cause wind and dust.
The approaching area of the low - pressure range brings a bit of local rain to the south coast of California.
It is likely that more than one centimeter of rainfall will be expected to cause a slight stream of collapse, and roads may become slippery.
This would be the first criticisms of the wet season in the region.
Some tropical lions will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, and later rain will spread late on Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rain after Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Juta will spread on Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
In October there will be intense temperature fluctuations in all US due to the cooling of the Arctic, but in the tropical zone will be quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to huge changes in temperature over short distances.
On Sunday there was a great example of huge temperature differences in the central United States.
Kansas Sishi (Misour) and Omaho (Nebraska) temperatures vary by almost 20 degrees from the temperature of Saint Louis and Di Moino (Ayova).
Summer heat that stays in the next few days should rise again to cover more places.
It is expected that in the central and eastern part of the United States, from the Great South League to the northeast, a warm October with a prevailing temperature of 27 degrees is arriving.
New York would be temperatured up to 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would exceed the average of about 10 degrees.
Our long-term climate forecast shows that in the eastern US the temperature in the first half of October will be higher than the average multiannual temperature.
More than 20 million people were watched at the hearing in Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people on Thursday during six television broadcasts were watching the embarrassing remarks of the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the woman Christine Blastey Ford's accusations of sexual violence in the 1980s.
However, the political impasse continued after the broadcasters had ceased their regular programmes due to the last day of Friday: the Senator of Arizona agreed that the FBI would carry out a study which would last for a week on the subject of false accusations.
She said to the Committee on Ford Senate courts that it is quite certain that she was hung by Kavanaugh at the high school party and tried to take her clothes off.
The Kavanaugh, in an angry witness, said that he was absolutely certain that he did not.
Nielsen announced on Friday that probably more than 20.4 million people watched the broadcast.
The company calculated the average number of viewers who watched the broadcast via CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available to other networks, including PSS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen has a number of difficulties in calculating the number of people watching TV in offices.
To explain more clearly, it is an audience of the same size as would be the result of the playoffs or the award of Oscar.
Nielsen announced that Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly supported Kavanaugh's candidacy, was the leader of all the networks, when the number of viewers reached an average of 5,69 million during the day's hearing.
ABC, with 3.26 million spectators, was in second place.
Nielsen reported that CBS had received 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, CNN 2.52 million.
There was also great interest in the conclusion of the court hearing.
The main figure of Friday drama was Flake.
After the small Republican Bureau issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was captured by CNN and CNS cameras on Friday morning when protestors shouted on him while he was trying to get up to the Court Committee.
The CNN directly filmed him down eyes when he was floating by people.
“I stand here in front of you,” one woman said.
- Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
He was told: "You have power when so many women are helpless."
Flake said that his office issued a statement and, before closing the lift, added that he would have to say something more at the hearing of the Court Committee.
Later cable television and broadcasting networks were discussed directly when the Committee on Courts voted in favour of Kavanaugh's candidacy to the Senate.
However, Flake said that this would only happen by knowing that the FBI would investigate the rejections against the candidate in the coming week, whose investigation called for a minority of democrats to be conducted.
Flake, having talked to his friend, the democratic senator, Chris Coons, was partially persuaded.
After talking to Coons and several senators, Flake made a decision.
The choice of Flake had the power because it was clear that the Republicans will not have the vote to confirm the Kavanaugh's failure to carry out the investigation.
President Trump opened an FTB inquiry into suspicions against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister responsible for the criticisms of "Peace of politics" regarding "Brexit"
Prime Minister Theresa May accused the newspaper of an interview with Sunday Times of her plans to get out of the European Union critics "in the play of politics" with the future of Britain and in order to damage the national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives on 29 September 2018 at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Great Britain.
In another interview published after a photo on the front page of a newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued to attack her so-called "Brexit" plan, that Britain and the EU should collect tariffs for each other, and claimed that this was "total absurd".
Wayde's Simso Shooting Police arrested the suspect Dyteon Simpson for the death of the LSU player
The police arrested a person suspected of a 20-year-old LSU basketball player, Wayde, who died in Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Division reported that Dytheon Simpson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned after being accused of a second - grade execution.
The officers published a video on the upsurge of Sims and Simpson, and the police mentioned that during the fight, Sims lost his glasses.
The CIS branch WAFB reports that the police took the glasses from the site of the event and found the DNA on them.
After listening to Simpson, the police reported that he shot Wayde dead.
The lawyer informs that his release security is USD 350 000.
On Friday, the Eastern Baton Ruža parish expert service published a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was shot in the head, deviating to the neck.
The section is dedicated to the Louisiana State Police Task Force, the State Police Crime Laboratory, the Southern University police and the district residents who helped during the investigation leading to the arrest of a suspected person.
The director of LSU Sports Joe Alleva thanked the law firm of the district for "decisiveness and the enforcement of justice".
Samss was 20 years old.
A 1,98 meter tall guy grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball LSU.
In the last season, the young man had an average score of 5.6 points during the game and caught 2.6 bucks of the ball.
On Friday morning, the LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the team is "blocked" and "tancing".
"It is always thought about it," said Wade.
Fireflying ashes in Mexico City
The ash that reached southeast of Mexico’s capital city broke out from the volcano of Popokatepetle.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano on Saturday, when the activities of the quarry were recorded and within 24 hours, 183 times of gas and ash emissions were recorded.
The center was watched by a number of embarrassment and quakings.
The pictures in the social media show a thin layer of ash-coated car windscreens around Mexico, for example, Chočimilke.
The Geophysicians noted that the volcanic activity of 72 km southeast of the capital has increased since the earthquake of 7.1 points in September 2017 shocked Central Mexico.
The Fire Hill, called Donu Goo, has been active since 1994.
Before the vote on independence, the annual police intercepted Catalan separatists
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after the protestors had crossed the riot police for their independence and thousands joined the opposition demonstrations to mark the first year of the opposition vote on Catalonia.
The Rifle Police, which is stopping a group of culling separatists, was put on eggs and powder paint, and caused dark cloud of dust in the streets, which are usually filled with tourists.
The police used bats to stop the fight that started later.
In a few hours groups faced with the unionised protesters who cried out: "Let Spain live!"
The local press reported that fourteen people were being treated for minor injuries during protests.
A year after the referendum on 1 October, which Madrid considers to be illegal, but which is being decorated by Catalan separatists, who remain under pressure in the region of independence.
The majority of voters decided to become independent, but because of the large part of the boycotters who do not want to separate, the turnout activity was low.
According to Catalonia's authorities, in the last year's attempt to stop the vote in the polling districts, almost 1 000 people were injured during violent clashes.
The Independent Group established a camp on Friday night to prevent demonstrations that support national police.
The demonstration took place but was forced to change the route.
68-year-old electrician Narcis Termes, who is involved in separatists' protests with his wife, said that he was no longer certain because of Catalonia's perspective of independence.
“ Last year, we survived at one of the best moments.
I watched how the parents joyfully call on those who are able to vote, but we are now stuck," he said.
Despite the fact that a vital and difficult victory has been plundered in the regional elections last December, Catalonia's independence parties have been hard to maintain momentum this year when many of their most well-known leaders have gone into voluntary exile or are detained and are waiting for the court to play a role in holding the referendum and subsequently proclaiming independence.
A 42 - year - old mechanic, Joan Puiga, filmed an protest on his own phone, said that the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"The tension is constantly increasing," he said.
On Saturday, Oriel Junqueras, one of the nine Catholic leaders in prison in pre-trial prison since the end of last year, announced that he would attend the European Parliament elections next year.
"Canding in the elections to the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the decline in democratic values and the repression shown by the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonder — Detaining men entering the house
Three men, aged 33, 34, and 39, were arrested after their car was reinstated in Londonder.
The incident took place on Thursday about 19:30 (BVL) in Ballinagard Crescent.
Detective inspector Bob Blemmings said that the gates and the building were damaged.
At a certain point in time, the car could also have been shot with a crown.
The men's blow guaranteed the Livingston victory of 1:0 against the Rangers
Livingston player Dolly Menga first win guaranteed victory
Livingston was transferred to the upper league and surprised Rangers, forcing Steven Gerrard, the leader of the Ibrox Club, to lose the second of the 18 matches.
Dolly Menga's blow turned out to be very important, because during a moment Gary Holt's team compared to Hibernian.
Gerrard's team in this season of "Premier" League remains unfortunate for the trip match and will meet the leaders of "Hearts" next Sunday, from which they fall by eight points.
Prior to that, Rangers European League matches at home on Thursday will be played with Vienna Rapid.
At the time, Livingston prolonged its unparalleled series of unscrupulous matches in a division to six, while the chief coach Holt has not yet felt the taste of a defeat, because Kenny Miller was replaced only last month.
Livingston will miss the odds in the match with just guests
The team of Holt, before he beat the battle, because of his perseverance, raising Rangers' various problems, long ago had to be in front.
At first, Scott Robinson burst into a crossway gate, then Alan Lithgow was unable to reach the corner transmitted by Craig Halkett’s head by slip.
The family, allowing Rangers to play in front, did not worry because they knew that they could make trouble for guests by creating standard positions.
That is exactly what was a decisive battle.
Rangers had a free strike and Livingston started to hit ahead; Declan Gallagher and Robinson jointly transferred the Menga ball, which stopped him from the middle of the court.
Since then, the ball has been controlled longer by Rangers, but the protection of the hosts has been insurmountable and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly had almost no work.
The game of this kind of thief continued in the second chair, although Kelly had to work to support Alfredoe Morelos' blow to the gate.
Allan McGregor, the goalkeeper of the "Rangers" shot by Scott Pittman, has beat his leg, and the ball, which was sent by the impact of the "Livingston" standard position, ran next to the gate.
While transferring the ball, the Livingston was always present in the fine area, but every time it was exhaled, and two demands were imposed – one due to Halkett’s collision with Glenn Middleletton, and the other one due to the raining of the ball – was not satisfied.
Analysis of the Phenomenal Livingston Performance
BBC Scotland reporter Alasdair Lamont from Tony Maði arenas
The mineral "Livingston" game and the result.
All to one were excellent and continued to exceed expectations for a growing game.
The style of the game and the staff have almost not changed since returning to the highest league, but it is appropriate to allocate great rewards to Holt, because when he arrived he set the command on fire.
He was assisted by many heroes.
Captain Halkett was wonderfully playing with a well-organized defense, and Menga's value was Connor Goldson and Joe Werralla.
However, Ranger lacked inspiration.
Although they play perfectly under Gerrard, they did not have much to reach their level this time.
They didn't beat any decisive blows and only once bursted through the protection of the hosts. A certain alarm call was placed in the middle of the table for the Rangers team.
The Erdogan in Cologne was met in various ways
Saturday (September 29), there was a smile and blue sky when Turkish and German leaders met breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, when it was intended to restore relations between NATO allies.
The leaders have argued against such problems as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new giant girl.
The largest Turkish population community located in the city outside Turkey.
The police banned 25 000 people who met in front of a machete on security, but many of them arrived to see their President.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of them - the Kurds, also tried to be heard by condemning both Erdogan's policy and the German Government's decision to accept him in their country.
Different protests show the fragmentation of visitors: some German Turks consider it as a hero, while others flow and call it a dictator.
A road accident in Deptford, a bikeman died with a car
A biker in London died and faced with a car.
The accident occurred near the Bestwood and Evelyn streets intersection, with Deptford road, in the southeast of the city, at about 10.15 p.m. BVL.
The driver stopped and paramedics arrived, but the man died on site.
The accident occurred a few months after another biker died on Childers Street, hit by the accused who then fled, and this accident occurred about 1.6 km from the accident on Saturday.
The city police said that officials are trying to recognize a person and inform his nearest relatives.
The roads are closed and bus routes are replaced, drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartino Prison. Six injured officers during the conflict
The prison service reported that six prison officials were injured during a serious insurgency in a special security prison in men.
The Suirutė took place in the HMP Long Lartin prison in Vusšinyre on Sunday about 9.30 a.m. at BVL, where it continued.
Special Tornado officers were invited to control this uprising, involving eight prisoners and taking place in a single prison wing.
Officials shall be treated against minor facial injuries at the site of an accident.
A representative of the Prison Service said: “In order to control the ongoing incident, specially trained prison staff were invited to the HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six staff have been treated against injuries.
We cannot tolerate violence in our prisons and we are ensuring that those responsible will be surrendered to the police and perhaps spend more time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin is held in prison in more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, he was reported to be treated as a prison manager after he was attacked by a prisoner.
In October of last year, riot control officers were brought to prison in order to control a serious upheaval in which some of the workers were put on billiard balls.
Urragan Rose threatens Finix, Las Vegas, Solt Lake City on its sudden floods (it may be useful for dry areas)
It is not common for tropical depression to strike Arizona, but that is what will probably happen next week, when the storm Rose with its remaining energy will dive through the south-west of the desert and this will cause a sudden flood risk.
The National Meteorology Service has already announced to observe a sudden flood on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, moving toward southern and eastern Nevada, south-eastern California and Juta, including Fix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Solt Lake City.
It is expected that, as late as Monday comes to the rain, on Tuesday, Rosa will get straight to Finixa.
In Finland, the National Meteorology Service mentioned that only “ten tropical cyclones had maintained the status of tropical storms or tropical depression at least 12 miles [322 km] since the 1950s!
Katrina (1967) was a storm which is no more than 64 kilometres from the border of Arizona."
The most recent models of the National Urganic Centre predict that a drop of between 5 and 10 centimetres of rainfall is expected, and in some parts of Arizona Mogolon Rim the rainfall will reach 5 centimetres.
Other areas of the southwest desert, including the central Rock Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to reach between 2.5 and 5 centimetres, and in some cases up to 10 centimetres of rainfall.
For people who are not under pressure from sudden floods, Rose rain can be a blessing, because the region is suffering from drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some of these falls can be beneficial, as south-west is currently suffering from droughts.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitoring Centre, slightly more than 40% of Arizona suffers from extreme drought, which corresponds to the second highest category," reported Weather.com.
First, Urgan Rosa travels to the coast throughout the California Peninsula, which belongs to Mexico.
On Sunday, Rose, still similar to the storm category with its huge 137 km/h wind, is 619 miles south of Euchenian kuskule (Mexico) and moves north at a speed of 19 km per hour.
Aura is facing colder waters in the Pacific region and is therefore becoming serious.
So it is expected that it will reach the coast of Mexico with a tropical storm force on Monday afternoon or evening.
The flight that will fall in certain parts of Mexico may be severe and pose a high risk of flooding.
“From the California Peninsula to the north-west Sonora is expected to reach 8-15 centimetres, but perhaps up to 25 centimetres of rainfall,” reported Weather.com.
Then Rose will go north through Mexico as a tropical storm, and then, on Tuesday morning, it will reach the border of Arizona as a tropical depression, and on Tuesday late evening it will take the south way to Yuta.
“The main danger expected from Rose or its remains is the very high amount of rain in the California Peninsula, the north-west Sonora and the south-west of the U.S. desert,” reported the National Urganic Centre.
It is believed that these rainy rains will cause life - threatening sudden floods, runoff in the deserts, and landslides in mountain areas.
Attack at Midsamer Norton. Arrested four suspected murderers
Three teenagers and 20 years of age were arrested by a suspected attempt to kill a boy who had been found in Soomersete after a 16 - year - old boy had been identified.
The teen was found injured in Midsamer Norton's Excelsior terrace area, approximately 04.00 p.m., on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital and is now in a stable condition.
The police of Eivon and Somersete reported that at night, the district of Radstok was arrested at 17 years, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man.
Officials have referred to any person who may have any material on a mobile phone about what happened.
The short one says that Kavanaugh was “a victim of the hatred, anger of the democratic party."
"Bals for Judge Kavanaugh has a voice that we would like to reject the merciless and offensive tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said in his speech in Viling, West Virginia.
The short one said that during his candidacy process, Kavanaugh “exercised the wrath, anger of the Democratic Party”.
On Thursday, the Kavanaugh witnessed to the convention a strict and emotional denial of Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation that he had been sexually assaulted when they were teenagers a few decades ago.
During the ford hearing, he also proved his accusations.
On Saturday, the president said: “The Americans saw on that day the Kavanaugh’s great, noble and brave.
– The vote for judge Kavanaugh is a voice for one of the most experienced legal minds of our time, it is a lawyer with a reliable reputation in public services," said the crowds of Western Virginia supporters.
The President indirectly mentioned Kavanaugh's candidacy, while talking about the importance of the Republican elections in the middle elections.
"There are five weeks left of the most important elections in our lives.
I don't participate, although I really do, he said.
- That's why I fight for great candidates everywhere."
The short one said that the democrats are trying to "remove and prevent".
The Senior Assistant to GOP Heads CNN said that the first most important procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh should take place no later than Friday.
Hundreds of deaths due to the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia continue to rise
The authorities reported that at least 384 people were killed, many were lit up due to huge waves breaking the beach, when a strong earthquake and tsunami struck the island of Sulavesi in Indonesia.
Hundreds of the people gathered to the beach festival in Pala on Friday, when the waves of six-metrething [6 m] high began on the coast, many of them called to death and destroyed all that happened on the road.
After the tsunami there was an earthquake of 7.5.
“When the threat of tsunami occurred yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not run immediately, so they became victims,” said Suptopo Purwo Nugroho, representative of the Indonesian disaster mitigation agency at the time of the information report in Jakarta.
– The tsunami did not end alone, he drew cars, logs, homes, and hit everything was on the ground", – said Nugroho and added that before blowing the coast, the tsunami ran at 800 km/h.
He said that some people were sticking to trees to avoid tsunamis, so they survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 Palu’s centers.
The pictures of the disaster agency from the air showed that a large number of buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges have been girded and broken, and the mosque has been surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the seaside city was hit by repeated blows.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) reported that energy released during the particularly strong earthquake on Friday was about 200 times higher than the energy of the nuclear bomb shot on Hiaugim during World War II.
The tsunami has been reported to have been able to increase due to the city's geographical location, as it is located at the end of a long, narrow bay.
Nugroho described the damage as "large" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were destroyed.
He said that the bodies of some victims were found trapped after the ruins of the buildings, then added that there were 540 injured people, and 29 missing without knowledge.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and the damage may be greater along the coast located 300 km north of Pala, an area called Dongala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Nugroho said that communication networks “were completely paralyzed, so no information was received” from Dongala.
"There are more than 300 000 people living here," said the representative of the Red Cross, adding that workers and volunteers travel to areas affected by the disaster.
It was said that "this can already be seen as a tragedy, but the situation may deteriorate even further."
On Saturday, the agency was very critical of not saying that the tsunami hit Palu, although the officials said that the waves were coming after the announcement of the warning.
The amateur material of social media can be heard by a man on the upper floor of the building who, while keeping up with it, cryes out about the approaching tsunami for people below the street.
In a few minutes, the water wall, buildings and cars hit the shore.
Reuters couldn't confirm the film immediately.
As a result of the earthquake and tsunami, electricity supply was disrupted, communication networks around Pala were cut off and the authorities had difficulty in coordinating the aid.
The authorities have reported that the troops from Jakarta and other cities have started sending cargo planes with emergency supplies, but the evacuation still requires food and other essential supplies.
The Commission therefore concludes that the measure in question constitutes State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) of the Treaty.
On Sunday, President Joko Widodo planned to visit Palai’s evacuation centres.
The number of victims of Indonesian tsunami exceeded 800.
That's very bad.
Doseba reported that when the staff of "World Vision" safely traveled from Dongala to the town of Pala, where the staff was hung in the tarmac tents built in the office yard, the destroyed images were accompanied on the way.
"They told me a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
That's very bad.
Even when relief teams began to take difficult steps to provide disaster relief, some people complained that they had a lot of experience in foreign aid workers were banned from travelling to Pala.
According to the Indonesian regulations, financing, provision and foreign-based personnel can only be assisted once the location of the disaster is declared to be a national emergency area.
This has not yet happened.
“This is still a disaster at provincial level,” said the Indonesian Red Cross spokesman for press Auli Arriani.
– When the government says, "Yes, this is a national disaster", we can call for international aid, but this status has not yet been published."
The second night after the Friday earthquake and the tsunami of Pala, friends and relatives of missing people expected that their loved ones would become part of a miracle that would have a deplorable history of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, the rescuers delivered a woman who was pressed under the ruins next to his mother's body for two days.
Gendon Succinon, a national team coach for parasparing in Indonesia, was trained by two missing Asian players who ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other of the violent "Roa Roa" hotels, including Mandag, were his disciples.
“As I am older than I am in the field of parasper sport, I carry my emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon explained in detail how, in a few hours, when he announced the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel, he traveled around a parasparous sports community. He sent messages with the WhatsApp app to Pala competitors who participated in the beach festival.
However, his messages contained only one gray, not two blue frogs.
"I think this means that the messages were not received," he said.
When completing the ATM, thieves stole 26 750 US dollars at the Newport on the Leee entertainment centre
According to a press release from the Newport Police Department, on Friday morning the thief stole USD 26 750 from a Brink's employee, who performed the ATM at the Newport on the Levie entertainment centre.
“The car driver was knocking the ATM in the entertainment complex and ready to add more money,” Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
While he was busy, another person “came from the back of Brink’s employee” and stole a dedicated money bag.
According to a press release, the Witnesses noticed a number of suspects who fled the site but the police were unable to identify the number of persons involved in the crime.
Every person with information about their identity should contact the Newport Police by phone 859-292-3680.
Canye West. Reper has changed his name to Ye
Repery Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
After announcing the change in Twitter account on Saturday, he wrote: "A person previously officially known as Canye West".
West, 41 years old, has for some time been called Ye and has called his eighth album, which was published in June.
The changes started before the show "Saturday Night Live", where West was expected to present his new album "Yandhi".
The show must replace the singer Arian Grande, who has cancelled the performance for “emotional reasons,” said the creator of the show.
This is not only a shortening of the current professional name – West said earlier that this word had a religious meaning for him.
"I think "you" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," – this year Mr West said earlier about the title of the album with the radio supervisor Big Boy.
“So I am you, and I am us, which means us.
It started from Kanye, which means the only, and turned just Ye, which means the reflection of our good, evil, confusion, everything.
Album reflects more what we are."
He is one of many known rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Dady, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year has declared the name of the preferred Love and Brolical Love.
The former West colleague JAY-Z also changed his name and used it with or without a dash and in capital letters.
The Mexican policy, Andrés Manuel López Obrador (abbreviated AMLO), promises not to use troops against civilians.
The elected Mexican President, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, promised never to use military forces against the civilian population when the year of the 50th bloody repression of students approaches the country.
López Obrador promised at Tlatellco on Saturday “no use of military forces to tame Mexican citizens”.
On 2 October 1968, at a time when the movement of left students began across Latin America, representatives of the military forces held a peaceful demonstration in the square, and 300 people were killed.
López Obrador promised to support young Mexicans on a monthly basis by subsidising students and opening up more free state universities.
He said that unemployment and a lack of education involve young people in criminal groups.
The US should double funding for artificial intelligence
"As China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount spent on research in this area," says the investor and artificial intelligence specialist Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These comments come from the announcement by various US government bodies of artificial intelligence, even the lack of an official artificial intelligence strategy in the US as a whole.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year to lead the field of artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"The double budget for artificial intelligence research would be a good start, given that all other countries are more advanced than the US and that another breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence is expected," said Lee.
Double funding could double the likelihood that the next major achievement of an artificial intelligence would be in the US, as Lee said in an interview this week with CNBC.
Lee, whose book “The superstates of Work Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order” was published by “Houghton Mifflin Harcourt” this month, is the Director General of Innovation Ventures, investing in “Face ++” among the leading Chinese companies of Artificial Intelligence.
In the 1980s he worked with an artificial intelligence system at the Carnegie Mellon University, which won the top American Othello player and subsequently was the head of Microsoft Research and president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee acknowledged earlier US government technology competitions, such as the "Robotika Challenge" of Defence Advanced Research Project Agency and asked when to find more intelligence people.
Lee said that US researchers often have to work hard to win state grants.
"It's not China taking away academic leaders, it's companies," said Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired the bright minds of universities to work with artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy can also help the US to strengthen its efforts for artificial intelligence.
“I think that doctoral students working in the field of artificial intelligence should be automatically offered green cards,” he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese Council of State published its New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan.
In addition, Lee said that the Chinese National Foundation for Science is funding academics people, similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations are spending money on US scientists, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Defence Department set up a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence to involve partners from the industry and academic community, and the White House announced the establishment of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA (the Agency for Advanced Research Projects in Defence) announced an investment of about USD 2 billion for the AI Next initiative.
NSF is currently investing in research into artificial intelligence in more than $100 million a year.
However, nothing has been done in the coming months about US legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonian people vote in referendum on whether to change their name
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday's referendum to change the name of the country 'Nordic Republic of Macedonia', which would be an action to resolve the decades of dispute with Greece, which blocked its aspirations to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, where the province of Macedonia is located, states that its northern neighbour's name refers to claims on the Greek territory and led to Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments agreed on the proposed new name, but nationalists claim that the change of name would undermine the ethnic identity of the most famous Macedonian population.
President Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign expressed doubts as to whether the turnout will reach the minimum 50% necessary for the referendum to come into force.
The question of the referendum was put on the voting card: "Are you in favour of NATO's membership and the EU in agreement with Greece?"
The supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is worth paying a price for Macedonia, one of the countries that came from the collapse of Yugoslavia in order to join institutions such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I came to vote for the future of the country, the young Macedonian people to be able to live freely, to protect the European Union, because this means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79 years in Skopje.
Although legally non-binding, enough Members said they would stick to the outcome of the vote and do it decisively.
The amendment of the title would require two thirds of the majority parliament.
The State Electoral Commission has announced that no violations reports were made by 13:00.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of voters gave their vote.
“I came to vote for my children, for our place in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, voter of 62-year-old Skopje, capital.
Macedonian MP Zoran Zaevas, his wife Zorica and his son Dušk vote in a referendum on changing the name of the country in order to open the way to NATO and the European Union. Macedonia, 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, during the 54-year-old age, Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small scene and drew chairs in front of the tents that he built in a boycott referendum.
“We are in NATO and the EU, but we want to join the raised heads and not enter the door of the servants,” said Kavadarkov.
– We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and participate in Eurasian integration."
Prime Minister Zave says that membership of NATO in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 percent, will attract the necessary investments.
“I believe that the vast majority will be in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,” Zaeva said after giving his vote.
He said that the result "Yes" would be "ensuring our future".
The results of the survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Policy Research indicate that 30-43 per cent of voters should participate in the referendum, less than the required turnout.
According to another survey carried out by the Macedonian TV Telema, 57 percent of respondents are going to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote "Yes".
For a referendum to succeed, 50 percent of voters plus one vote must take part in it.
If the referendum did not succeed, it would be the first serious failure of pro-Western government policy since it took over power last May.
See: The Manchester City Player Sergio Aguero overcomes the whole Brighton defense and profit victory
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling won Brighton's defense, and the team Manchester City on Saturday, playing at the Etihad stadium in Manchester, England, achieved a winning result 2:0.
Aguer's 65-minute beat seemed incrediblely easy.
The Argentinian attacker received the ball in the middle of the square at the beginning of the attack.
Before he crashed into an open field, he passed between three Brighton defenders.
Then Aguero surrounded four green T-shirt players.
He jumped through one defender, ahead of the "Brighton" penalty spot, overcoming several others.
Then passed the ball to the left where Sterling was.
The English attacker returned the Aguero ball with one kick of the fine spot and launched the ball with the right foot impact to the right side of the gate network, exacerbating the rightson goalmaker Matshew Ryan.
“Aguero has problems with his feet,” said Pepas Guardiola, Head of City.
- We said he would play for 55-60 minutes.
That's what it was.
We're lucky that moment he won a victory."
However, it was Sterling that helped Sky Blues to first turn forward in this "Premier League" game.
The catch was made in 29 minutes.
Aguero got the ball at the bottom of the Brighton spot during the attack.
On the left side of the square between the two adversaries he beautifully handed over the ball to Leroy's Sane.
Sane kicked the ball forward with a few springs until Sterling ran toward the next cuff.
The Sky Blues attacker launched the ball into the gate just before slipping out of the square.
On Tuesday, at 12: 55 min., City meets with Hoffenheim in the game of the Champions League, which will take place at the Rhein-Neckar Arena of Zinsheim (Germany).
Scherzer wants to play a friendly match with Rockies
After the Nationals fell out of the playoffs, the reason for the forsing was no more.
Scherzer, who is competitive, hopes to overcome Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockies still have the chance to remain in the opening competition; in the national league "West", they turn "Los Angeles Dodgers" one point.
Rockies, after overcoming the national results at 5:2 on Friday evening, at least ensured the chance of getting a preferential road map, but still has to make sure that the right to play in the first division is guaranteed.
“Even though we are playing for nothing, at least we can run to the field, knowing that the atmosphere in Denver, where the crowds and other teams will gather, will probably be at the highest level we can reach this year.
Why won't you talk?"
Sunday match team's starter composition "Nationals" has not yet been announced, but they are clearly inclined to drop the ball in this case.
Scherzer, who will have a 34th game in the building, has had a stop training on Thursday, and will take his position on his regular rest day – Sunday.
Statistics on the right-hand side of Washington this season: 18-7, 2,53 ERA and 300 estuaries in 220 2/3 chair.
A brief talk in West Virginia
Speaking of the importance of the participation of the Republican voters in the mid-term elections, the President indirectly mentions the situation regarding the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh as the Supreme Court.
“Everything we have achieved will be put on the scales in November.
We have five weeks until at least the most important elections in our lives.
This is very important, I don't run... but I actually run, that's why I fight for great candidates everywhere," he said.
He then went on to say: – You see this terrible, terrible group of democrats, you see what is happening right now.
And they are determined to recover power by any means, see how it is low, how evil is.
They don't care what they hurt, what they got through to get power and control; that's what they really want – power and control, but we won't give them that."
The Democrats, he said, have a mission to "remove and prevent".
"And you can see this for the last four days," he said, calling the democrats "smooth, abominable, low-adverse and wrong people."
He referred to the Senate's Judicial Committee, noting the name of the democratic senator Dianne's Feinstein, which led to huge innovations among the audience.
"You remember her answer?
Did you get down the document?
Hey, hem, like.
No, hm... no, I'm waiting for one – it was really a bad language of the body – the worst body language of everyone I've ever seen."
Leiborists have lost their views.
They Don't tolerate the openly pronouncing of their opinions
When "Momentum" activists in my local party voted in favour of distrust of me, it is unlikely that this should have been monitored.
Finally, I am the newest of the Labour MEPs who have been told that I am undesirable – and that is for what I have said.
My fellow Member, Joan Ryan, had similar threats, because she was determined to stand up to anti-Semitism.
I was distrusted in criticising me that I did not agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on European, ironic, on similar issues that Jeremy did not agree with the previous leaders.
The report on the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated that "we want to see many members involved in the meetings and to make the meetings productive."
Most of the eight-year-olds, when I am the local Labour Parliamentary, the Friday-night GC meetings were exactly so.
It is a pity that today's tone of many meetings is not so much the "softer, more pleasant" policy promises have long forgotten, even if it has ever been implemented at all.
It is increasingly obvious that a different opinion in the Labour Party is not tolerated and each opinion is assessed according to whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
It started shortly after the Group became a leader in Jeremy, and the political views of colleagues who, as I believed earlier, are similar, I started to expect to turn around 180 degrees and to follow the views I would never agree with, whether for national security or for the EU's single market.
When I speak publicly – and even whatever – I find myself in social networks having the insults that encourage my cancellations, it condemns the center's policy and says that I am not a place in the Labour Party.
And that's not just my experience.
In fact, I was lucky more than some of my fellow Members, because the comments directed at me are political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who have to withstand the body of sexual and racist insults every day.
One of the most disappointing things in this political era is how insults have become normal phenomena.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour Labour should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a party of the same opinion, and with every "untrust" procedure or amendment of the electoral system this party is becoming increasingly weaker.
In the last two years, I have received a lot of advice to keep up with myself, not to mention so loudly, and then to me "all will be fine".
But I didn't come to politics for that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, when I was still a schoolmate in Leiborist, provoked the negligence of Thatcher's government, which has caused my entire school class to collapse in the sense of that word, I wanted to win better public services for those who need it most – whether as a member of the local council or a minister of government.
I have never hid my policy, including the last elections.
No one was surprised by the political opinions and disagreements with the current leaders in any way by Nottingham East.
I can tell those who encouraged the procedure on Friday that, when a country goes to Brexit, which will be hit by households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy because of my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But, in fact, one message I have for Nottingam's Thoughtum is for my constituents, Members of the Labour Party (or not): I am proud to be able to serve you and I promise that no threat of withdrawal or political accuracy will prevent me from acting in accordance with my beliefs and the best interests of all of you.

Ayr-Melrose 38:17 Ayr conquers the tops of the tables inexactable
Two late attempts have distorted the final results, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves this triumph moment in an impressive, promising game of Tennent's Premiership Day.
Now the team is at the top of the table – the only one is out.
Finally, their victory has resulted in their excellent defence and well - exploited capabilities, so the coach Peter Murchie can really feel satisfied.
“We raised all the trials during all the matches that have been held so far, and we are still out of action, so I am really happy,” he said.
Robynas Christie from Melrose said: "Ayr" appeared good, players took advantage of their chances better than we did."
Grant Anderson's 14th minute, which was successfully completed by Frazier Climo, led Air forward, but the yellow card for Scotch Rory Hughes released by Warriors, allowed Melrose to collect figures, and Baggot stopped the result test.
The Climo increased the advantage of Ayr by a fine, when previously, in the middle of the competition itself, earned points and effectively completed the personal test by helping Ayr before the break to open the result at 17:5.
However, the second set of Melrose began well, and Patrick Anderson's test, which came to a successful conclusion by Baggoth, reduced the gap to five points.
The match was suspended for a long time because Ruaridhas Knott had a severe injury and moved from the door to the vehicles. After the extension of the match Ayr continued to push forward when Stafford McDowall’s test was successfully completed by Climo.
The captain of Ayr Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, and Melrose tried to take advantage of the surplus of players, but Bruce Coline's attempt after the outstretched pressure was unsuccessful.
The player of the home team came back, but when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for stopping the Climo without a ball, MacPherson pushed the ball from the penalty line for the continuing places of the Ayr rink.
The Climo has successfully completed his test, as has already been done almost since the start of the game, after Kyle Row stopped David Armstrong's kick into the square's corner and prevented the country's attacker Gregor Henry from holding the fifth home team's attempt to score points.
Still Game star seems ready to start a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kiernan seems ready to move to the accommodation and catering sector after having been appointed as the director of the licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old man plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC comedy, writes scripts and plays with his long-term comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the coming ninth season will be the last season of this release, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning his life after Craigang.
Officially, he became Director of Adirftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this fact, although Scottish Sun’s sources alluded that Kiernan was looking for ways to get involved in the Glasgow restaurant business.
"We belong to the sea": Bolivia, imprisoned on land, expects the court to open the way to the ocean again
The sailors are patrolling at the headquarters of the navy in La Pasie.
The ocean’s blue flag blows on public buildings.
The sea’s fleet bases from Lake Titika to Amazon are decorated with a slogan: “We rightly belong to the sea.
It's our duty to recover it."
All on earth, Bolivia still has memories of access to the ocean, which had to be sacrificed to Chile in the 19th century bloody conflict, living and longing to be used in the Pacific again.
The hopes that have been built up over recent decades have now been particularly reinforced, as, after five years of discussions, Bolivia awaits the International Court of Justice judgment, which will be published on 1 October.
"Bolivia is focused on the spirit of unity and peace and, of course, hopes to have positive results," said Bolivian diplomat Robert Calzadilla.
Many citizens of Bolivia across the country will be following the publication of the ECJ ruling on large screens, hoping that the Hague Tribunal will take a positive decision on the Bolivian complaint – Chile will be obliged to negotiate the access of the Bolivian State to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia, who is waiting for a counterproductive election fight for re-election, is also very interested in the ending of the Monday solution.
"We are very close to the opportunity to return to the Pacific," promised him at the end of August.
However, some analysts tend to believe that it is unlikely that a court would make a decision in favour of Bolivia — even if it were to be accepted, it would not change much.
The UN authority based in the Netherlands has no power to exclude Chilen territories and has indicated that it will not determine the outcome of the negotiations.
The fact that the decision of the ECJ will only be published six months after the last arguments were heard is unlikely to indicate that the case “was not complicated”, – said Paz Zárate, an expert in international law in Chile.
And even if Bolivia managed to make some progress, the past four years could have blocked her back.
"This question of sea access was raised illegally by the current Bolivian administration," said Zárate.
She believes that any remnants of Chile's good will have been destroyed by the venerable rhetoric of Morales.
Bolivia and Chile are going to continue the conversation some time, but after all this discussion will be extremely difficult.
The country has not changed its ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Mr Rodríguez Veltzé, the representative of Bolivia in The Hague, objected to the idea that the judgment was rendered at an unusual speed.
"On Monday, Bolivia will have an exceptional opportunity to start a new relationship with Chile and to end disputes that last for 139 years with a view to mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales is still one of the most popular Presidents of Latin America, and uses the maritime issue as a political manipulation.
“Bolivia will never deny the right to have access to the Pacific”, he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to see that we have to deal with the past."
North Korea claims that nuclear disarmament is only possible if it can trust in the US
The North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, assures us that his people will never give up nuclear weapons first if they cannot trust Washington.
The United Nations General Assembly spoke on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep its promises agreed by the leaders of the rival countries at a meeting in Singapore.
His comments were made at a time when the Secretary of State, Mike's Pompeo, seems to have planned to renew the violent nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the meeting with Kim Jong Unu in Singapore.
Rí says that the "extopian dream" is that, in the course of the continuation of sanctions and the withdrawal by the US of the declaration on the end of the Korean war, North Korea could ever go.
Washington avoids accepting the declaration if Pyongyang does not, first of all, act with persuasive disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to hold a second meeting.
But the widespread sceptical opinion that Pyongyang does not seriously intend to abandon the arsenal which the country seems to see as the only guarantee of its own security.
Pompeo is going to visit Pchenjane next month to prepare the ground for the second meeting of Kim and Trump.
The Paris fashion show was revealed that the latest trend is massive head covering, and they will soon conquer the nearest trendy stores
If you want to supplement your hat collection or completely protect from the sun, this trend is just for you.
The designers Valentino and Thomas Browne have presented a wide range of eccentrically large head covering in their 2019 spring and summer collections, and he simply found the viewers of the Paris Fashion Week in his style.
These especially impractical hats have conquered the social network Instagram this summer, and these designers presented eye-catching works on the podium.
The distinctive work of Valentin was a large body - colored hat decorated with a wide, feather -like edge, encircling the head of the manikin.
Other accessories of a non-standard size were gems engulfed by watermelons, a sailor's hat and even ananas – but they were not designed to protect your head from cold.
Thomas Browne has also presented a collection of strange masks – at the same time to Helovin.
Many of the colorful masks were tied with lips and more reminded Hannibal Lecter than the high fashion.
One of the works looked like a cage suit, with a tube and a underwater eyeglasses, and the other looked like a coat of dissolved ice cream.
And if you follow this trend of fashion of huge size, you won't fire.
Still’s experts suggest that these huge blankets can enter shops.
The big hats were popular with the heels of La Bomba, and the hats with the edges of two feet were worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
A cultural brand, which has created extremely unpractical hats that have conquered all social networks, has released another huge piece on the podium – a straw-show bag of beach, almost the same size as a swimsuit carrying it.
The red brick-coloured raft basket, decorated with cherubs and a white leather handle, became an exceptional accent of the Jacquemus collection “La Riviera SS19” in Paris Fashion Week.
Glorious Stylist Luke's Armitage, FEMAIL, said: "I think that the next summer there will be huge hats and beach baskets, because the designer has made such a huge impact, so it would be difficult to ignore the need for non-standard-size accessories."
John Edward: “Salb payment is a key skill for the people of the world”
The Scottish independent schools have improved the record of academic achievements, not just in 2018, and have once again demonstrated the exceptional results of the exams, which are only further reinforced by individual and collective achievements in sports, art, music and other community achievements.
When there are more than 30 000 students in total across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), aim to provide their pupils and their parents with the highest possible services.
Independent schools seek to train their pupils for further and higher education, their chosen careers and to be world's citizens.
Working in the education sector, which can create and implement the planned school programme, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and are willing to meet in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you want to talk to someone in a language that he understands, he will understand you.
If you talk to him in his own language, you will talk to his heart."
It is a strong reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to make relations and build trust in people from other countries.
According to the results of the recent exams of this year, languages are well-known at the top of popularity and in independent schools with the best maintenance ratings.
A total of 68 percent of students who learn foreign languages received the highest A assessment.
Data collected from 74 schools that are members of SCIS showed that 72 percent of students received the highest A assessment during the Mandarins language exam, the highest A assessment received 72 percent of German students, as well as the highest A assessment received 69 percent of French students and 63 percent of Spanish students.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland consider the knowledge of foreign languages to be a key skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages, such as optional languages, are now regarded as important in independent school curricula and elsewhere as basic things (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
According to a survey carried out by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014, 17 percent of all the reasons why employers had found it difficult to fill jobs were lacking language skills.
As a result, language skills are becoming increasingly compulsory in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
As future employability will depend heavily on languages, these skills are becoming essential in a globalised world.
No matter what kind of career a person chooses when he learns a second language, he will in future be far better than others if he has these lifelong skills.
By being able to communicate directly with people from abroad, a person learning several languages will be much more competitive.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov in 2013, involving more than 4,000 UK adults, 75 percent were unable to speak foreign language well enough to participate in the conversation and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage of people, i.e. 15 percent.
That is why investing in language teaching is important for children of the present time.
By learning several languages, especially in developing countries, children will have better opportunities for meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school differs according to the languages they teach.
Many schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered the most important for the United Kingdom for the future of 2020, such as mandarins or Japan.
Whatever the interests of your child, there will always be a lot of languages from which you can choose from in an independent school with teaching staff and professionals in this field.
Scotland's independent schools are ready to create a training environment that will train children and provide them with the skills they need for life in the future.
It is undisputed that languages in today's world business environment remain vital to the future of a country, and this must also be reflected in the education system.
Indeed, modern languages should certainly be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this opportunity, diversity and results to the young people of Scotland.
This must be done.

LeBron will launch the debut “Lakers” in San Diego on Sunday.
There is little to wait for the fans to see LeBron James start the season in Los Angeles.
“Lakers” coach Luke’s Walton announced that James would play at the Sunday season opening competition with Denver’s “Nuggets” in San Diego.
But for just a little bit of a minute of play, it's not clear yet.
"This will be more than one minute and less than 48 minutes," said Walton on the official Lakers website.
"Lakers" reporter Mike's Trudelas Twitter said in his account that James was likely to play for a limited time.
Earlier this week James was asked about plans at the Laker team in six preseason matches.
“At this stage of my career, I no longer need preseason matches to prepare myself,” he said.
Short language in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts his campaign this evening in Williams, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five planned short languages next week, including pauses in friendly areas such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Following the confirmation of the suspension procedure of the nomination of the Supreme Court candidate by the vote, Trump seeks to concentrate his support in the forthcoming mid-term elections, because the Republicans were threatened with losing control during the November vote in Congress.
A short talk in West Virginia will take place this evening and how to watch it online?
A short speech in Viling, West Virginia, scheduled at 19:00 Eastern Time evening, Saturday, 29 September 2018
You can watch Trump's language in West Virginia online in YouTube.
The short question of this week's Supreme Court candidate Bretto Kavanaugh is likely to touch on the subject, as it has passed a lot of stress on suspicions of inappropriate sexual behaviour, when the Senate voted in favour of suspending the candidate until a week until the FBI conducted the investigation.
But the most important goal of this campaign is to help the Republicans to gain some strength in the coming November elections.
Therefore, President Trump's campaign representatives say that the aim of these five meetings next week, as Reuters announces, is to "energee volunteers and supporters in the Republicans' efforts to defend and expand most of those held in the Senate and the House of Representatives".
“Congression control is so important on his agenda that the President will go to as many states as possible because the campaign season starts very hot,” said the short campaign representative, who did not want to disclose his name.
“The language of this evening planned at Wesbanco in Vilnius should attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw the attention of Pittsbergs,” states West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia for the second time in the last month, in the country where he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
The short one tries to help the West Virginia candidate for Senata, the Republican Patrick Morrisey’s, who is on the ground rating in surveys.
“It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the President had to come to the top of the ratings,” said Simon Haeder, political scientist at the University of West Virginia, “Reuters”.
“Ryder” Cup 2018: U.S. team is peaceful and hopes to join the Sunday unit matches
After three personal steps Saturday afternoon four can be exactly what was needed during this Ryder Cup tournament.
Such a change of success is completely fictional, but players really believe it, especially in events like these.
So what side is success now?
"They were first in six points and now in four, so I guess we can keep this sort of success," said Jordan Spiethha, preparing for the day.
Europe is, of course, the leader, has a four-point victory, and there are twelve other matches.
The American enthusiasm, according to Stieth, is not lacking, not to mention the form of Sieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each gathered three points out of four.
Siethhas was invincible from the beginning to the end and was the perfect leader.
These wild victories of victory became famous for the round. To end the fourth match, Thomas gained two points from two possible points.
His blow, having won them in this macho on the 15th hole, was accompanied by similar slogans, which, as he said, said the end of the American team isn't progressing yet.
"We just need to concentrate and care for our games," said Spithehas.
Now each of these players is left to play separately.
To a successful end – 18 wells.
The only players who have gathered more points for Spieth and Thomas in the last few days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the story of the Ryder Cup is indisputable.
It is amazing, but a charming couple from Europe have gathered four points out of four possible and can be calm.
Moliwood was the only couple who did not need additional blows not only Saturday afternoon, but also Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning.
That course of events and the reaction of stray audiences only confirm that they will be players who will be lucky on Sunday and will not be able to achieve anyone else's popularity as Fleetwood or Molinary, who have the chance of ensuring Europe's victory after the last sunrises in the Le Golf National field.
It would be good to make both of them happy at the same time.
Although it is too early to talk about the glory of Europe.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson briefly played with Sergio Garcia, the eastern hero of four balls when he was coupled with Alex Noren.
An extra blow and two double extra strokes in the first series of nine wells led Spain and Sweden into a trouble from which they failed to get through.
But no one will get out of trouble on Sunday.
The four balls and quarts make it so interesting to observe the interaction between couples, the advice they give and do not give, and the fact that the strategy can change immediately.
Europe was better playing as a team, and therefore came to the final stage with decisive leadership, but this four-stage also showed the fact that the US team has a fighter spine, some of which have doubted, especially in the states.
On the last day of the "Ryder" Cup, Europe takes lead in 10:6
Europe will meet on the last day of the Ryder Cup with an important victory, first before the UK score 10:6.
Instilling the duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari continued to heat the atmosphere by winning two victories against the hard fighting Tiger Woods and began to lead Le Golf National by four points.
The European side of Thomas Bjorn, in order to preserve the trophy that had been lost two years ago in Hazeltin, was dominated by morning-four-year-old machos against the unsuccessful American side and the stage ended with a result of 3:1.
U.S. show more resistance in fouries when winning two match, but failed to overcome the overpointing
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points from the 12 units of match on Sunday to keep the trophy in his hands.
Fleetwood is the first newcomer in Europe to win four points in a row, when Molinari and Molinari duplicated Melliwood after the sensacing weekend, and they are only the second couple who won four points through their first four match "Ryder" Cup history.
Overcoming Woods and Patrick Reed in four, they perfectly destroyed the lost trust in Woods and the American rookie Bryson Dechambeau for even better result of 5:4.
Woods, having previously overcame two Saturday machos, at some points demonstrated a high level of professionalism, but had already lost 19 and 29 in the fours of his machos, of which seven in a row.
Justin Rose in four in the morning rested and returned to play with his partner Henrik Stanson in four; in the result 2:1 they overcome the 2/1 Dustin Johnson and Broox Koepka in world ranking first and third places.
No matter how pleasant, mildly windy day in the south-west of Paris, Europe did not go through butter.
The three-time winner Jordan Spiethh and Justin Thomas raised the American cartel, winning two points on Saturday.
They won an intruder victory in a macho of four balls 2:1 against Spanish John Rahm and Ian Poulter, and a quarter of a macho overcame Polish and Rory McIlroy’s score of 4:3 without having a ball in the first two wells.
Only twice in the "Ryder" Cup history the team managed to recover the four-point victory while going to separate match, although Furyk's half would have enough equal to keep the trophy alive.
Although two days were in the second place, their success seems to have failed on Sunday.
North Korea says that it will in no way disarm itself unilaterally, without being able to trust
The North Korean Foreign Minister said to the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions deepen their distrust in the United States and that, in such circumstances, the country will not give up the nuclear weapon unilaterally.
The General Assembly of the Ri Yong Ho World Organization said that North Korea has in recent years taken “marked good will measures” such as stopping nuclear missile tests, dismantling the nuclear testing base and committing not to proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we did not get a similar response from the US side," he regretted.
"With no confidence in the US, we will not be able to trust our national security, and in such circumstances we will in no way be disarmed unilaterally by the first."
Until Ri repeated North Korea's complaints against Washington's ethical approach to nuclear disarmament, according to which North Korea would be rewarded in the course of its steps, his statement was divided in the fact that he did not completely reject the idea of bilateral disarmament, as Pyongyang did in the past.
He referred to the joint statement by Kim Jong Unas and Donald Trump at the first meeting of the US President and North Korea's leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim undertook to work for "Korea Peninsula disarmament", and Trump promised to ensure North Korea's security.
North Korea is aiming for the formal end of the 1950-195 Korean war, but the United States says that, first of all, Pyongyang must abandon his nuclear weapons.
Washington also refuses to mitigate strong international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. requires nuclear disarmament first and increases the pressure on sanctions to achieve its goal by forceful methods, even refusing the end of the war," said Ri.
“To think that sanctions can put us on the road, they are the same as those people who don’t care about us, who have utopian dreams.
But the problem is that the continuing sanctions deepen our distrust."
Mr Ri did not mention plans for the second meeting between Kim and Trump, which was highlighted by the US leader in the United Nations as earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings in the past five months by the leader of Kim and South Korea, Moon Jae: "If another country on this issue of nuclear disarmament were South Korea instead of the US, the issue of nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula would not have come into being."
However, the tone of Ri was dramaticly changed compared to last year when he said to the UN General Assembly that when "Mr. Blog President" Trump called Kim the "missile pon", which is a suicide mission, the targeting of North Korea's missiles to the US was absolutely inevitable.
This year, in the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to "fully destroy" North Korea last year, has lauded the Commission for the courage to take steps towards disarmament, but said that much still needs to be done and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea fulfils the requirements of nuclear disarmament.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time schedule for this, and he said: “If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia have claimed that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the actions it has taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mique Pomeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday that "The security Council's sanctions must be strictly continued without any concessions until the complete final evidence of nuclear disarmament has been confirmed."
The Security Council has supported sanctions since 2006 with all votes in order to prevent the funding of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri in the backstage of the UN General Assembly and then said that he would come back to Pychenan next month to blow the soil for the next meeting.
There were already three visits this year in Pompeo North Korea, but the last trip was unsuccessful.
In July he went out of Pyongyang, saying that all progress was only to declare North Korea a few hours later that he had submitted “Gangsterical claims”.
At a meeting with Moon, North Korea promised to dismantle the missile base and nuclear complex in this month if the United States took "appropriate measures".
According to him, Kim claimed that the "appropriate measures" he sought were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and shifted towards normalising his relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn enough to rest
New course at Harvard University this year encouraged all of his students to sleep more in order to combat growing macho culture in studies, using caffeine and not sleeping nights
One academic found that students at the best university in the world often do not even have basic knowledge on how to take care of themselves.
Charles-Szeisler, budget manager at Harvard Medical School for sleep medicine, and Brig Site, a women's hospital specialist, developed a course that, according to him, is the first of the type in the United States.
The inspiration to prepare this course visited him after talking about the effect of sleep deficit on learning.
"It was at the end of the day that one girl came to me and said to me, "Why is this told me only now, in the last year of study?"
She said that no one had told her about the importance of sleeping, and that surprised me," he said.
The course is proposed for the first time this year. It explains to students how the most important quality sleep habits help to achieve academic and sporting outcomes, and improve overall well-being.
Paul Barrira, a psychiatry professor at Harvard Medical School, and executive director at the University Health Service Department, said that the University decided to offer this course when it became apparent that the students had a very low weekly sleep rate.
The hourly course shall include a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of the room room where students can click on a coffee cup, curtains, trainers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine, light, and sleep shortages affect sports performance and the importance of going to sleep routine.
In the next section, participants learn how long-term sleep shortages can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Students' town map with interactive icons to encourage participants to think about their daily routine.
“We suggest that this will not change students’ behaviour immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know about the health consequences of choosing to smoke", explains Professor Czeisler.
The pride culture does not sleep overnight, according to him, still exists. Modern technologies and increasing pressure on students have led to a growing problem of sleep shortages.
“To ensure that he has been adequately and qualitatively sleeped, students should have a secret weapon to fight stress, fading and anxiety – he said – to avoid gaining weight, because sleep deprivation turns the brain into a hunger regime, so students are constantly hungry.”
Roymundas So, 19 - year - old Kalifornitis, who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to prepare a course when he attended one of his courses last year in Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to ask for a course available to the entire student town.
He hopes that the next step will be to invite all students in the second stage to listen to this course before starting a visit to this competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set up an alarm when they time to go to sleep, just like lifting, and protect the harmful effects of blue light caused by electronic devices and LED lighting, because they can beat your circadian rhythm out of balance, so it may be difficult to sleep.
Livingston 1:0 "Rangers": The Menga victory saddened the men of Gerard
Rangers experienced another disappointment when Dolly Menga Livingston managed to overcome the weakened outcome of Steven Gerrard 1:0.
Ibrox was hoping to earn his first victory in the trip after February triumphs in the result of 4:1 in St Johnstone, but the second time Gary Holto team won Gerrard during the 18 match manager's post and now the latter's team is lagging behind the Prime Minister Hearts who fled away.
Menga beats seven minutes before the break, but without inspiration the players Rangers did not see any way out of the score.
Rangers now fell down to sixth place, Livingston went to three, and the Hibernian lags behind just one victory.
And the concern of Rangers does not stop, because the butter must have been put on the head by the side judge Calum Spence and wounded it.
Gerard made four changes, which allowed Ayr to roll over and lead him to the semi-final of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, trusted in the same monk, which took a point from Hearts last week, and he would have liked his well - thought - out combinations to make opponents in every step.
Rangers was dominant in controlling the ball, but he did more at Livingston.
They could have hit him for the second minute when Menga hit the ball with a close touch towards the Allan McGregor gate that hit Scott Pittman, but the safety was destroying his chance by directing the ball away from the gate.
After the free impact of Keaghan Jacobs far off, the ball reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his fellow defender Alan Lithgow asked for a country.
Rangers took control, but the last third of the match was only the play of hopes, not the play of faith.
The remaining 15 minutes, Alfred Morelos thought he deserved a penalty when he was faced with Steven Lawlesss, but Judge Steven Thomson put the complaints of Colombian at his hand.
"Rangers" was hit only twice in its first chair, but the former Ibrox goalmaker Liam Kelly hardly threatened or threatened with Lassana Coulibaly's blow or gentle Ovie Ejaria's return.
Although Liv's 34th minute's victory may not corresponded to the course of the game, no one will argue that they deserve it for their own efforts.
Rangers once again failed to overcome the viscosity of Jacobs' defense.
Scott Arfield didn't respond when Declan Gallagher transferred the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his distinctive name and transferred Menga to the light end.
During the break Gerrard took steps to replace Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and that change almost immediately gave the fruits when the country's safety was overcame Morelosa, but when the impressively playful Kelly came up and struck up.
Livingston has included guests in the same game as he himself loved – with far-reaching transfers of Lithgow and Halkett ball.
The Holt team at the end could have increased his victory, but McGregor would have defended himself from a Jacobs blow after a Lithgow landing out of the corner.
After changing the square, the Rangers player Glenn Middleletton once again appealed for a penalty after a collision with Jacobs but Thomson did not respect it again.
Almanac: Firemeter Inventor
Now, the page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, it's been today 136 years ago, and it's more than that... The future physicist Johannes Wilhelm (Hans) Gaeger was born in Germany that day.
Geyer invented a method to detect and measure radioactivity. An invention by which a device, known under the name of the Geier meter, was developed later.
Since then, this device has become the hit of the world of science, and later the hit of popular culture, when, in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado played cowboys not particularly like scientists Roy respective to Rogers and Dale's Evans:
Man: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: “This is the Geier Meter Meter used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear the way atoms work, touch radioactiveally in minerals."
Evans: "Hey, now it's really shooting!"
Hans Geyer died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that receives his name continues to exist.
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to develop bad cells
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to develop and kill bad cells
The vaccine has taught the immune system to identify bad cells – this is part of the treatment
The method involves the recovery of immune cells from the patient and their replacement in the laboratory
The cells can then “see” proteins that are found in many forms of cancer, and are then injected back
The vaccine has shown promising results in the treatment of patients with various types of cancer.
A woman who is being treated with this vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognise bad cells, has lost ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method involves the recovery of immune cells from the patient and their laboratory substitution, then cells can see proteins typical of HER2 cancer and can be re-administered.
Professor Jay Berzofosky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a promising vaccine."
“HER2 promotes multiple types of cancer growth, including breast, ovaries, lungs and rectum”, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to the recovery of immune cells from patients and to the development of cancer cells has been successful in the treatment of leukaemia.
And West of Kayae launched the Tyrade of Trump, wearing a MAGA hat, after his SNL show.
Good didn't end this
After an unfulfilled performance at the Saturday Night Live, the audiences were ashamed of the slogans of Kayae  in West, which praised U.S. President Donald Trump; he said that he would participate in the campaign in 2020.
After performing the third song "Gost Town" that evening, during which he was wearing a hat with the inscription "Make America Great", he continued to condemn the democrats and expressed his support for Trump.
“How many times have I talked to white people, they said: “How can you like Trump, for he is racist?"
Well, if racism would cause me trouble, I would have been from America a long time ago," he explained.
The SNL show started with a comic scene where Matt Damon was laughing at the Bretto Kavanaugh's edition to the Senate's committee on accusations of inappropriate sexual conduct presented by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the film with West's replies had been brought to social networks by Komis Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock tried to hit this tape from West.
West also complained to the audience that there were troubles behind his head covering.
“They mocked me in the backstage.
He said not to go there with this hat.
They're mocking me!
They said I got to the bottom," he said, "Washington Examiner.
West added: “Do you want to see what the bottom is? ' he asked. 'I wear my superman's hat and that means you can't tell me what to do.
Start to love."
His statements made at least two times in an audience of disapproval and SNL broadcast seemed embarrassed, as reported by “Variet”. One man began: “The death-death silence occurred in the whole study."
West was invited to quickly change the singer Arian Grande because her former ladder Mac Miller died a few days ago.
West has embarrassed many of his performances by performing the song I Love it by wearing Perrier bottle costume.
He received support from the conservative team's TPUSA leader, Candace Turner, who published a record on Twitter account: "One of the bravest spirits for a man: WHY FOR A WHY WHY.
But Karen Hunter, the head of the chat show, announced in a Twitter account that West was just "beside himself and this is extremely amazing".
“But I mean to NEREMTI a man (by buying his music or his clothes, or by maintaining his “art”), whose beliefs are poisonous ideology, to the detriment of my community.
He's free.
But we are also free," she added.
Before the show was started, Twitter announced on its account that its name has changed and that it is now formally known as Kanye West.
He was not the first creator to change his name, but he went on the same path as Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The colleague rapper Snoop Doggas was originally called Snoop Lyons; the music legend of PrinceSpree has changed the name of the symbol and has later become known as Prince’s.

Star of "Sports Wars" Next Harrington criticises the distorted attitude towards masculinity
Next, Harington became famous as a sword-mousing figure, John Snau HBO's fantastic adventure series about the Middle Ages "Sport Wars".
But the 31-year-old actor criticises the stereotypes of the macho hero. He claims that such roles on the screen often make young boys feel as if they were to be tough to be respected.
Speaking “Sunday Times Culture”, the other said that he thought “something is wrong” and raised the question of how to tackle the problem of distorted masculinity in the *MeToo era.
Another, who recently married 31-year-old Colleague Rose Leslie, admitted that this theme was "strongly touching".
«I feel that this topic is really touching me now. Where have we made a mistake in promoting masculinity?» he asked.
"What do we teach growing men that we are facing such problems?"
Another believes that this distorted man - made wave could be a responsibility for TV, because it is made up of very man - made characters.
He continued: “Who is born, and what is learned?
What is it that is taught on television or on the street that young people believe they should have this type of masculinity?
I think this is one of the important issues of our time – how do we change this?
Clearly, we made a mistake somewhere with the young men."
In an interview he also confirmed that he would not participate in any of the prehistory or continuation of the “Sosto Wars” when the series ended next summer and said that “he already has enough battlefields and horses”.
Since November, Sam Shepard's "True West" is a modern version of the film about the robber of filmmakers and his brother.

The Emmy winner played in the fantastic Rose series, Igritė, the love object of John Snow from another character.
The couple got married in June 2018 in a property belonging to the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% in new cases
China reports that the number of people infected with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
According to the health authorities, more than 820 000 people were infected by infection in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018, alone, some 40 000 new cases have been reported.
Most newly infected people had sexual transmission, which is different from past statistics.
Traditionally, HIV infection has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV fell almost to zero  Done at a conference in the province of Junan by Chinese health authorities.
Over time, however, the number of people living with HIV infection and AIDS in China has risen to 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sex is a sensitive issue in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality in China has been decriminalized in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT persons is widespread.
As conservative values prevail in the country, between 70% and 90% of men who have sexual relations with men ultimately lead women.
Most cases of infection with this disease are due to inadequate protective measures during such sexual relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as one of the ways to combat this problem.
Maxine Waters denies that the employees had run down the Republican senator's data, condemns "dangerous lies" and "conpiration theories"
US Representative Maxine Waters denied suspicions that one of her employees published personal information of U.S. senators from three Republicans on the pages of the legislators Wikipedia.
In Los Angeles, the democrat believed that the accusations were made by ultra right-wing experts and websites.
“Male, lie and a blasphemy lie again”, – said Waters in his Twitter account.
It is reported that the disclosed information included US Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike’s Lee and Orrin’s Hatcho, both of them from Juta, home addresses and phone numbers.
Information on the Internet appeared on Thursday, and it was announced by an unknown person from Capitol Hill at the time when the accusations against candidates for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaughu, were handled in the Senate.
The resulting information appeared a little later when these three senators asked Kavanaughu questions.
"Conservator websites such as the "Gateway Pundit" and "RedState" have been informed that the IP address for which the source of these records was found in relation to the Waters Office and the information of a member of the staff of Waters has been disclosed,"  Done at Kapitoli.
“These unjustified suspicions are absolutely false and absolute lie”, hereinafter continued Waters.
“My staff member whose identity, personal information and security have been affected by these false and false suspicions is in no way responsible for the disruption of this information.
These unjustified suspicions are totally false and absolute lies."
Waters' statement was quickly criticised on the Internet, as well as the press by Ari Fleischerio, a former representative of the White House.
"This denial sounds angry," wrote Fleischer.
“It says that it does not have enough distinctiveness to be a member of the Congress.
If someone is accused of things he has not done, he should not be angry.
He should not defend himself.
He should not question the motives of the accused.
He should be calm and humble."
Fleischer seems to have tried to compare Waters' reaction with the democratic criticism of the judge Kavanaughu, who was accused of being too angry on Thursday.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, participating in the mid-term election campaign to replace Waters, also said his thoughts on Twitter.
"It's true if it's not a lie," he wrote.
In its statement Waters stated that its office had informed the relevant authorities and enforcement bodies about these false allegations.
"We will ensure that the organisers have been clarified," she continued, "that they would legally be responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous for all of my employees without exception."
Review of the comedy "Jonis Inglišs again smogiga" – breathtaking spy show with Rowan Atkinson
The tradition has already become the search for "Brexit" clues in any British film. This seems to be true of the revitalization of the action spy comedy "Jononis Inglišas" – "Jononis Inglišas" was started as early as 2003 and returned to the screens with the comedy "Resurition of Gionis Inglišas".
Is this sarcassical autosacracy about how we have apparently fallen apart into a new possibility of national exports?
Whatever the case, the incompetent Johnny Inglish has a second chance to bring down unpleasant truths to the surface, since the title clearly shows that this piece of comedy is not for English-speaking cinematograph regions.
Of course, this stupid secret agent, who, although having claims for luxury, has also acquired some features of the inspector Clouseau, a little bit of the similarity between Mr. Byn's features and slag to that guy that was used during the 2012 London Olympic opening ceremony to create the theme of the drama "Fignies Transfers".
He is also a slightly based character about the traveler and the mysterious man who raised the chaos that Atkinson once played in the forgotten Barclaycard TV ad.
This latest film by Johnny Inglish has several beautiful moments.
I enjoyed when Johnny Inglish approached the helicopter by wearing a medieval suit and armor, and the blade rotor hit his helmet.
The Komed Atkinson talent is obvious, but humor itself seems breathtaking and strange, especially when serious film brands such as 007 and "Mission Not Possible", bravely inserts elements and comedy elements.
Humor's kind of more dedicated to children than adults, and the adventures of Johnny Inglish that I don't believe don't seem as inventive and applied like Atkinson's quiet laughter in the play of Mr. Bena.
The most common topic at present is that Britain is in serious trouble.
The cyber hacker has successfully entered the British highly secret spy Internet network and revealed the identities of all British spys in this area, causing the agent to get out of touch with an overly insignificant role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last drop to the cup of the Prime Minister, the pop-pical character and the corner, which is already suffering from a trenching political unpopularism: Emma Thompson from Teres May expresses everything it can, but in the scenario there is little good material for that.
Wise counselors inform her that the identity of all its agents has been revealed and that she will have to look for people between retired people.
This means that John Ingliš himself, who is currently a school director in some Spanish institution, will have to apply for illegal lessons on how to work as a secret agent. There were several good jokes when Ingliš offered the School of Rock type spy Academy.
The Inglish is sent back to Whitehol to discuss the emergency situation and meets there for a long time its common Bough, which Ben Miller once again plays.
Bough is now married to a submarine chief, and Vicki Pepperdine, who plays a high-level girl, seems to be underused.
That is why Batman and Robin, able to confuse all things in Her Majesty’s secret service, are taking action again and meet the fatal beauty of Olga Kurylenko.
The Prime Ministers are dangerously turning their head to the charismatic billionaires who say that they can solve the British computer problem, the evil-won Wallt, which is being played by Jake's Lacy.
Inglish and Bough start their odyssor: when they change the waitress, they cause a fire in the French restaurant, causes chaos in a luxury Volta yacht and Inglish starts a complete anarchy, trying to use virtual reality headphones to meet the interior of the Volta House.
All stoppads were clear to stand up for this last series, but whatever it was nice or wild, all of this is a great reminder of children’s television.
It's kind of average.
As for other films by Johnny Inglish, I could not get rid of the idea: is it not the British film industry capable of giving Rawan Atkinson a role which would certainly deserve his talent?
The Labour Party denies a plan for British work for four days a week, but to pay for five days
The Jeremy Corbyn Labour Party is planning to consider a radical plan that will allow the British to work four days a week, but to pay a fee for five days.
It is reported that the party wants company leaders to share the savings generated by the artificial intelligence (DI) revolution by giving their employees one free day.
This would allow employees to enjoy the three - day weekend and bring the same amount of pay to their home together.
The source says that this idea is in line with the party's economic agenda and plans to turn the country's development into a favourable position for the workers.
The Week for the transition to the four working days also welcomed the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to benefit from the benefits of changing economies.
One of the top-ranking Labour Party sources, The Sunday Times said: "Review of political provisions is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
This will not happen overnight, but the four-day week is in line with the party's approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of employees, as well as the overall strategy of the party's industry."
The Labour Party is not the first to promote this idea; during the 2017 Global Election campaign, the Group of the Greens also promised it.
At the moment, however, this is not entirely supported by the Labour Party.
The Labour Week of the Labour Days is not a party policy and it is not discussed in the Party.
The shadow government representative John McDonnell used the opportunity last week to present his vision of the Socialist Revolution in the economy at the Labour Party Conference.
Mr McDonnelis said that he was determined to reclaim power from the utilities of "scrupulous dictators" and "profit hunters".
Such plans by the shadow Chancellor also mean that current shareholders of water companies may not recover all of their shares, because the Labour Government may deduct something once the wrong has been seen.
It also approved plans to involve employees in the company’s board and to create equity funds to transfer 10% of private sector capital to employees and to receive up to GBP 500 annual dividends.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy answer to the question of 60 Minutes whether the FBI's investigation into Mr Kavanaugho might change their opinion.
In the course of the investigation conducted by the FBI against the accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaughu, at least a week's final vote was postponed to appoint it to the Supreme Court, so the question arises whether the investigation Bureau could influence the opinion of any Republican senators so that they would not be opposed to that judge.
On Sunday's interview, Scottas Pelley, correspondent of 60 Minutes, asks senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, whether it's possible for the FBI to find out something that will change their opinion.
It seems that Senator Kennedy takes a more liberal attitude than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Well, yes, of course," says J. Kennedy.
‘As I said when I went to the sitting, I spoke to Judge Kavanaughu.
When these charges appeared, I called him and asked, "Did you do this?"
He answered decisively, firmly, unequivocally."
So, Mr Graham's opinion seems to be no change.
“I have decided on Bretto Kavanaugh, it would be a real shocking accusation,” he says.
“Ford for Dr. Ford – I don’t know what was there, but I know one: Brett is definitely denying it,” said Graham, bearing in mind Christine Blasey Ford.
‘Nothing that it refers to can confirm.
It's been 36 years.
I don't think there's gonna be anything new."
What is the World Citizens' Festival and has it contributed anything to reducing poverty?
This Saturday, New York City will host a World Citizens' Festival, an annual music event that shows an impressive number of stars and aims to achieve the equally impressive goal of eradicating global poverty.
For the seventh year the World Citizens' Festival will meet tens of thousands of people who will not only listen to stars such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also extend the message of the real goal of the event to eliminate extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens' Festival was held in 2012 and is a follow-up to the Global Anti-Effort Project, an international mediation group that hopes to eradicate poverty, which has increased the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (unless they wanted to buy a paid VIP ticket), the concert visitors had to perform various tasks or actions, such as volunteering, e-mail to world manager, call or anything else to help raise awareness of their goal of eradicating poverty.
However, do the citizens of the world succeed in achieving this goal?
Is it just another example of so-called clactical, fictitious activism that people think will really change the situation by signing an online petition or publishing an entry on the Twitter network.
According to the organizers of the World Citizens' Festival, since 2011 movement has recorded more than 19 million actions by its supporters, promoting a wide range of objectives.
They say that, under pressure, world leaders have announced USD 37 billion worth of commitments and policies to replace the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, this group referred to 390 commitments and declarations triggered by the group's actions, of which at least USD 10 billion has already been paid out or collected.
Almost 649 million people worldwide are already directly affected by the pool's calculations.
Some key commitments include "The Power of Nutrition" – a partnership between investors and actors in the UK to "help children grow up and discover their full potential".After receiving more than 4 700 news messages from World citizens, Twitter promised to give Rwanda USD to help the country cope with its nutritional problem.
"With the support of the United Kingdom Government, supporters, governments and people like you, the World's citizens, we can achieve social injustices such as nutrition deficiencies as the past," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of "Mitty Power" to London's crowd concert in April 2018.
This group also pointed out that, following a 5 000 referrals calling for an improvement in the diet of mothers and children in the United Kingdom, the government announced funding for the project "Purchasing Power", which will reach 5 million women and children by means of nutrition interventions.
Answering one of the FAQs on our website: "Why do you think we can put an end to extreme poverty?",
World citizens respond: “It’s a long and difficult path – sometimes we will fall away and fail.
But like the great movements for human rights and for apartheid, we will win, because we are all stronger together."
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the performers participating in this year's event in New York.
According to the Secretary of the Interior, the US can use the fleet to prevent Russian energy exports
"If Washington is needed, it can use the fleet to distort Russia's energy access markets, as well as the Middle East markets," says U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, according to Washington Examiner.
Mr Zinke claims that Russia's participation in Syria, especially when it acts on the invitation of legitimate authorities, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I think Russia interferes with the Middle East because it wants to regulate the energy field, as it does in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe,” R. Zinke said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to resolve this issue.
"The United States can do this through the fleet, ensure that seaways are open and, if necessary, can block, make sure that they do not reach the market," he said.
Mr Zinke said this to the participants at the event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group known as "the voice of energy consumers" in the USA.
He then compared Washington's methods with those of Russia and Iran, and pointed out that they were essentially the same.
"The economic alternative for Iran and Russia is to find a bigger or less counterweight to replace fuel," he said, and he also named Russia, a country whose entire economy is dependent solely on fossil fuels.
These statements have appeared in the context of Mr Trump's administration's mission to increase its exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe and to replace Russia in the market, which offers a much cheaper opportunity for European consumers.
Therefore, the officials of the Trump Administration, including U.S. President Donald Trump, try to convince Germany to withdraw from the unwitting Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Dr. Trump, Berlin became a prisoner of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is just an economic project.
According to Kreml, whether the reason for Washington's opposition to this project is purely economic, it is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we all agree that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and that consumers must be able to choose their suppliers”, said Russia’s Minister of Energy Alexander Novak after meeting with U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position was preceded by an anti-German reaction and reaffirmed its determination to continue with this project.
The German Industry Organization, the German Industry Federation (BDI), called on the US not to engage in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I do not really agree with the intervention of third countries in our energy supply matters," said Dieter Kempf, Head of the German Federation of Industry (BDI), following the recent German Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Putin's meeting.
Ms Elizabeth Warren, Senator of Massachusetts, says he will seriously consider the possibility of standing for Presidential elections in 2020
On Saturday, Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said seriously considering the question of presidential election after mid-election.
During the meeting at the Holjok Hall, Massachusettse E. Warren confirmed that he would consider candidates.
"The year for women to go to Washington to manage our failed government, they have to go to the highest post," she said.
"As of November 6, I will be serious about whether to take part in the presidential elections."
At a meeting in the town hall, Mr Warren presented President Donald Trump with a statement that he led the country in the wrong direction.
“I am very scared about the way Donald Trump treats our democracy”, she said.
Mr Warren openly criticises Mr Trump and his proposed candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a Twitter message published on Friday, Mr Warren says that "by the vote there is a clear need for an FTB investigation".
However, a survey on Thursday shows that most of Mr Warren's own national voters believe that she should not stand for President in 2020.
According to a survey conducted by the political research center of Safolk University and Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of the likely voters of Massachusetts say that the senator should not participate in the elections.
Thirty-two percent support its candidacy.
The survey showed that former Governor Deval Patrick receives more support, with 38 percent supporting his possible candidacy, while 48 percent opposed him.
Others discussed the names of the representatives of the elected democratic party – former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Mr Biden says he will take his formal decision in January, as "Associated Press" reports.
At the Donald Trump Summit, Sarah Palin talks about Tracko Palin’s post-traumatic disorder
In September, Trackas Palina, aged 26, spent a year in military service in Iraq.
On Monday night, following an incident of domestic violence, he was arrested and accused.
“I see what my son is experiencing when he comes back to his everyday life, so I understand the other families who feel the consequences of a traumaous disorder, and the particular vulnerability of our troops with whom they return to him,” she said to the gatherings at Donald Trump’s in Talsa, Oklahoma.
She said that the son and the other veterans of war “returned a little bit after the change, they return a firmer heart, they come back in doubting whether they will receive respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots have done, and all the other soldiers have returned to their country.”
He was arrested on Monday in Vasla, Alaska, in charges for domestic violence and violence against a woman, as well as charges that prevented the announcement of domestic violence with a weapon and in the event of an accident, as reported by Dan Bennett, a spokesman of the Vasilla Police Department.
18 states and Colombia County supports resistance to the new asylum policy
The eighteen states and Colombia regions support the legal challenge of a new US policy which refuses to provide asylum to victims of gang violence or domestic violence.
On Friday, in Washington, 18 states and representatives of this constituency submitted amicus curiae (a judicial adviser) to support the challenge of asylum seekers' policy, reports NBC News.
The applicant’s full name in Grace v Sessions, which the American Civil Liberties Union started against federal politics, is not undisclosed.
She says that her partner "and members of his criminal gang" violently opposed her, but on 20 July, U.S. officials rejected her application for asylum.
She was detained in Texas.
The state lawyers supporting Graze described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which the US receives a large number of asylum applications, as states, to the suffering of the persistent problems of gang violence and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy has been repealed by the 2014 Decision of the Immigration Board, which allowed non-documented immigrants who have been victims of domestic violence to apply for asylum.
On Friday's report, Carlos Rēcēnu, Regional Prosecutor General of Colombia, stated that the new policy "is not in line with the laws of state, federal and international law of decades".
‘The federal law requires that decisions on asylum applications be taken in the light of specific facts and circumstances of the application, such as the prohibition of this principle being violated’, says the comment of amicus curiae.
In this remark, lawyers also claim that immigration policy is damaging the US economy and that immigrants are more likely to enter the business and "provide the necessary labour services".
In June, Prosecutor General Jeff Sessions ordered judges on immigration issues to stop issuing asylum to those who are fleeing from domestic violence and victims of gang violence.
"Religion shall be granted to those who leave their home country in connection with persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or certain political opinions," said Mr Sessions in his policy report on 11 June.
The asylum provided has never been aimed at solving all (and not all serious) problems that people face every day in the world.
Double the number of the victims, Pala, desperately searching for the rest of the living
The situation of the survivors is constantly deteriorating.
“It is very large,” says the 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, in the evacuation centre of Palu, a feverish child.
“The faller does not stop carrying more or more bodies.
We don't need clean water."
It has been observed that residents return to their ruined homes, collect water, and try to save whatever they can find.
Hundreds of people are injured, and 7.5 - point earthquake hospitals are dry.
Some injured people, like Dwi Harris, have had back and shoulder fractures, placed outside the Pale Army Hospital, continuing strong repeated strokes in hospital patients treated outdoors.
His eyes are filled with tears when he tells us how he felt at a severe earthquake in the hotel’s fifth - floor room, where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save others.
I think I got through the ruins of the wall," said Harry Associated Press, adding that he came with his family to participate in the wedding.
“I heard my wife cry for help, and then – quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and her daughter.
I hope they're okay."
U.S. ambassador accused China of intimidating propaganda
Last week, when China's official newspaper distributed four pages of advertising in the US daily, putting an end to the mutual benefits of US-China trade, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday mentioned the supplement of China Daily paid to the most expensive Iowa newspaper Des Moines Register and accused China of affecting the U.S. Congress elections on 6 November. China denies this accusation.
"D. Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to influence the US elections is marked by a new phase of a stronger Washington campaign aimed at exerting pressure on China," U.S. officials told Reuters Agency.
While it is common for foreign governments to distribute advertising in order to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a stronger trade war, and both sides are raging tariffs for imports of each other's goods.
According to experts from China and the USA, the Chinese response rates were imposed on exporters from Iowa and similar states, which supported the Short Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, a former US Ambassador to China, former Governor of Iowa and one of the major exporters of agricultural products to China, claimed that Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
On Sunday, in the opinion article published by Des Moines Register, Branstad stated that China "has become even more wrestling in printing propaganda ads in our free press."
"As a result of propaganda, the Chinese authorities took advantage of the freedom of expression and the press in America and ordered the paid-up notice "Des Moines Register," wrote T.Branstad.
“However, in the local press of Beijing, you will not find any opposing voices and will not create a true picture of different opinions that Chinese people may have about the worrying economic trajectories of China, as the press is under the firm foot of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
Mr Branstad also added that “one of the most famous Chinese newspapers has turned away from the proposal to print, ” but did not mention which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn: As the middle elections approached, B. Kavanaugh fiasco deterred the Republican voter
Although many Republican leaders remain loyal to the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of even a few accusations of sexual harassment, analysts warned that this would be a negative response during the forthcoming mid-term elections, especially from women.
The situation is very strong, and many Republicans have already formally stated they want to vote.
Such things cannot be taken back later," said Professor Grant Reehner of the University of Syracuse, Professor of Maxwell, of the School of Siareuses, in the article published on Saturday.
Mr Reehler expressed his doubts as to whether the last minute of the calls by senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for the start of the FTB investigation would be sufficient to calm down the wrong voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday," said Karine Jean-Pierre, Chief Adviser and National Representative of the MoveOn Group of progressive views on Friday.
On Friday morning, the protesters said: "The lazibrist is coming!" during the demonstration in the foyer of the Senate, when the Republicans who control the Committee of Justice decided to call Kavanaugh despite the exhibitions by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford announced kzip to "Mic".
“Democrat enthusiasm and motivation lean across the edges,” said St. Rothenberg, an independent policy analyst for the site.
– People say that it was already strong, and they are right.
But it could further strengthen its position, especially in the suburbs of undecided women's voters and younger voters between the ages of 18 and 29 who, although not interested in the President, often do not vote."
Even before Mr Ford made a public statement, when she set out in detail the accusations of sexual harassment against a candidate for the Supreme Court, analysts said that if the Republicans confirmed the candidacy, this could lead to indignation.
"This caused great confusion to the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former Chairman of the Republican National Committee at the beginning of last week, "NBC News".
"Not only about the committee or the final vote, but also about the appointment of Kavanaugh as a judge, but also about the way the Republicans managed this situation and how they dealt with Mr B. Ford," said Guy CEcilas, Director of the "Priorities USA" for news channel, "The Group helping democrats in elections".
However, it seems that the Americans do not agree yet on how to believe after the Kavanaugh and Ford shows, although it has a little more support.
A new survey of YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents believe that Mr Ford is totally or probably true, while 35 percent say that Mr Kavanaugh is fully or probably hopeful.
In addition, 38 percent said that Mr Kavanaugh really or probably lied when giving evidence, and only 30 percent said the same about Mr Ford.
In response to a statement by Mr Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the accusations made by Mr Ford and the announcements by at least one other accused, Deborah Ramirez, said “The Guardian”.
Mr Ford swore evidence to the Senate's Committee on the Courts last week, claiming that Mr Kavanaugh had attacked her when she was 17 years old.
Mr Ramirez claims that a candidate for the Supreme Court showed her his genitals at the party in which they attended a study at the University of Yale on 9th.
Web inventor plans to create a new Internet to resist Google and Facebook
World network inventor Tim Berners-Lee is developing a new start to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this legendary inventor "Inrupt" is a company that works on the basis of the Berners-Lee open source platform "Solid".
“Solid” allows users to choose where their data is stored, as well as who and what information they have access to.
In the exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Lee laughed that Inrupt’s goal was to beat the world.
“We have to do this now,” he said.
- It's a historic moment."
The "Solid" technology-based app allows people to create their own personal online data store – POD.
It may include lists, work lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal or work tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Black and Spotify would be available in one browser at the same time.
The online store of personal data is unique in that only the user decides who and who can access the information.
The company calls it a personal tool through data.
According to John Bruce, the company's CEO, the idea of Inrupt is to provide resources, processes and skills to make Solid available to everyone.
Currently, the company consists of T. Berners-Lee, J. Bruce, a safety platform purchased by IBM, several developers who would be hired to work with the project, and a voluntary programmer community.
Since this week, technology developers around the world can develop their own decentralised applications using the tools provided on the Intrut website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team did not agree with Facebook or Google on changes that would turn all business models up overnight.
"We did not ask for their permission."
In the Medium report published on Saturday, Berners-Lee says that "Inrupt is a mission to provide trade energy and ecosystem to protect the durability and quality of a new Solid network."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet from Massachusetts University of Technology into a Media Consortium.
In recent months Berners-Lee had an influential opinion in discussions on internet neutrality.
Even when working with Inrupt Berners-Lee, the founder and director of the Media Consortium, the Media Fund and the Open Data Institute will remain.
“I feel great optimism about this new era of the web,” added Berners-Lee.
Friday Bernard Vann – a clergyman awarded the First World War by the Victorian Cross
On the occasion of the 100th anniversary, the only clergyman of the Anglon Church, who was awarded as a cross of Victoria during World War I, was honoured in his home city.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 during the attack of Belenglyz and Lukucur.
Unfortunately, after four days, the pastor was shot by a sniper, so he remained unaware that he was awarded the highest-level British army award.
Two granddaughters were exposed to the memory stone at the time of St.
One of the grandparents, Michael Vann, said that the fact that the stone was opened exactly 100 years after the Grandfather's prize was won is "developingly symbolic".
According to "London Gazette", on 29 September 1918 the Lt Col led his battalion through the Old Kenten channel "in the face of highly purged smoke, with a sharp drop in dung and automatic fire."
Later, he rushed to the shooting line, and “particularly galantically” led the way forward, and then one attacked the tent and killed three troop fighters.
Lt Col. B. Vann killed German sniper on 4 October 1918 – only more than one month before the end of the war.
In 72 years, Michael Vann said that his grandfather’s actions were “something that himself would never be equal, but at the same time is an extremely inspiring thing.”
After he found out what he was married by the Brentwood Emperor Youth Orchestra, Michael and his brother Dr James Vann helped him to crown him.
Micheal Vann said that he had a great honour to participate in the parade, adding: "The true hero's membership is a support that will be provided by a large number of people."
MMA fans were not sleeping all night to see Bellator 206, but had to meet Kuulte Pepa
Imagine that you are not going to sleep all night to see the “Bellator 206”, but finally you are not getting to see the main view.
San Chose has 13 fights in the Afghan, of which six are in the main card and are broadcast live in the United Kingdom all night during Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock in the morning,gard Mousas and Rory MacDonald prepared for combat, the UK viewer was stunned by the film "Kiaulė Pepa" that stopped the broadcast.
Some viewers, to put it mildly, were not impressed because it was precisely because of this struggle that was not going to sleep until the parties.
In Twitter, one fan called a broadcast change with a children's cartoon "a kind of ligive joke."
"The rules laid down by the authorities were not suitable for this content at 6 o'clock in the morning, so the children's programme had to be enabled," Dr. Dave Schwartz, the Vice President of Marketing and Communication, answered for the broadcast."
“Yes, “Peptus Peptus.”
The President of Bellator Scott Coker said that in the future, efforts would be made to adjust the timetables to take account of the audience in the United Kingdom.
"When I think of repetition, I think we could probably do it," Cocker said.
“But at that time it's 6 o'clock in the morning, Sunday, and we can't solve it by Sunday, our time – Monday.
However, we are already working on this.
After the broadcast has changed, believe that many messages are exchanged, which were not all friendly.
We tried to correct the situation, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But it is not a matter of government.
I can promise you the next time it's not gonna happen.
We will reduce the number of fights to five instead of six – as we usually do. We wanted to give fans more, but just failed.
This is a failed situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tomas Daley felt unworthy because of his sexual orientation
Tom Daley, an Olympic jumper in the water, states that he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexual orientation, but this gave him the motivation for success.
24 The sportsman said only in the main school that he understood that he was not the same as everyone.
For the first time in the Radio 4 show "Desert Island Discs" by Lauren Laverne, he said he had taken a public talk about gay rights because he wanted to give others hope.
He also said that the success of the Olympic Games was less important when he became a father.
Kirsty Young, the permanent head of this long - term program, withdrew from work for several months because of illness.
The first show by Laverne, whose guests are asked to imagine travelling to an uninhabitable island, T. Daley said that he was growing up with less feelings than everyone else, because it was socially unacceptable to enjoy boys and girls.
He said: “Everything in today’s world, that feeling of pity and differentity was an incentive that gave me the strength that helped me to succeed.”
He claimed that he could prove himself worthy of this, so that he would not be disappointed when they finally learned about his sexual orientation.
The winner of the two Olympic Bronze Medals has become a high-level activist of LGBT and has taken the opportunity to encourage more countries to decriminally decriminate homosexuality as part of this year's British Arab Games.
He said that he had taken this into consideration publicly because he felt that he was lucky that he could live openly without consequences, and he would also like to give others such hope.
Three times the world champion said that in love with her husband, Dustin Lance Black, the U.S. film producer, who met in 2013 – he was unexpected.
Mr Daley got married to a 20-year-old Oscar laureate last year, but says that the age difference never caused problems.
According to Mr Delay, when he was so young as to be so young – he was involved in his first Olympics only 14 and after three years of cancer his father died – something that would be of the same age but that he had the same height and lowness.
When the couple became parents of their son Robert Ray Blacko-Daley, the perspective of T. Daley has changed completely.
“If you were asked last year, I would have said that it was the most important thing for me to win a gold medal,” he said.
– But, you know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
Robby is my Olympic Gold Medal."
The son's name is the same as Grandpa Robert, who died in 2011, at 40 years of age, after having diagnosed brain cancer.
Mr Daley, the father did not want to deal with his death, so one of his final questions was whether the tickets to the 2012 London Olympic Games that he intended to observe while sitting in the first row had already been bought.
“I couldn’t tell him that he won’t live so long as he could sit in the first row,” T. Daley said.
– I held my hand when he stopped breathing, and only then finally I realized that he was not unpunished," T. Daley said.
A year later, he competed for the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze.
“I just knew that I had dreamed of this all my life – to dance to the water by watching local audiences at the Olympic Games – there is no better feeling,” he said.
This has also inspired the first song selection – the Heather Small song “Proud”, which has given his feelings to prepare for the Olympics and is still pleasantly raging his skin.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast through BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11.15 p.m. in British summer time.
After Ph. Mickelson lost his shape, he spent the Ryder Cup tournament on a bench.
The American Phillip Mickelson will reach the record on Sunday because he will have to take part in the "Rider" Cup tournament for 47 times, but in order not to be successful, he will have to improve his form significantly.
Mr. Mickelson, who already played every 12 years at two-year-old events, placed Captain Jim Furykas on the bench at Saturday quadrant competitions.
Instead of being in the center of action, as was often the case in the United States, five times the main winner spent a part of the day in the support team, and the rest was improved in his machinery square to correct the troublesome mistakes.
Even on a career height, the 48 athletes are not an ideal player in Le Gold National squares, whose long rough grass section is extremely unpretentious to minor blows.
In addition, as if the square itself were not scary enough, in the ninth maze to be held on Sunday, Ph. Mickelson will play against the extremely precise British Open Tournament champion Francesco Molinari, who won all four match of this week together with his newer Tommy Fleetwood.
If four-point Americans manage to start the next 12 units of match well, Ph. Mickelson's match can become absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, but would probably not be able to speak differently.
“He understood the role he has played today, and he has spread to me through my back, and he has said with his hand that he is ready to play, even tomorrow,” Furykas said.
- He doesn't have enough self-confidence.
He has given a lot to these teams both in the past and this week, on the list of most glorious athletes.
Maybe I didn't imagine he was playing two match.
I imagined more, but we left this way, so we decided to do that.
He wants to play like everyone else."
On Sunday, Ph.Mickelson will improve Nick Faldo's record and become the most "Ryder" Cup match player.
It might mark the end of his Ryder Cup career, which does not match his personal record heights.
Ph. Mickelson owns 18 victories, 20 victories and seven equal, but Furykas claims that his presence also brought intangible benefits to the team.
“He’s a fun, sarcastic, cunning, likes to laugh at people and is a great guy with whom to be in the team room, ” he explained.
– I think the younger players this week also had fun with him, it was good to look at it.
He brings a lot more than a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great expanse can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from his experience that a great victory towards the last "Ryder" Cup competition can easily grow into a hard fight.
The Danish sportsman debuted in May of 1997 in Valdemara, where the team of opponents taken by Captain Seve and Ballesteros had a five-point mark against the Americans, but the finish line was only just straight from leading the result 141⁄2:131⁄2.
“We remind ourselves that we had a big victory in Valdera; we had a big victory in Brooklyn, where we lost, and also in Valdera, where we won but only barely,” said T. Bjorn (in the picture), after watching the 2018 release at 5:3 on Friday and 10:6 in Le Golf National Square.
So the story will show me and all the team members that it's not all over.
Tomorrow, we'll need all the energy.
Go and do everything right.
Until there are points on the board, the game is not complete.
We have the goal of trying to win this prize, and so we need to work towards it consistently.
I always said, I trust those 12 players who are on our side, but we know very well what is on the other side – the best players in the world."
Satisfied with the appearance of his players in a difficult square, T. Bjorn added: “I would not want to run away from myself.
The morning's gonna be a very different hair thing.
Tomorrow, the most important will be an individual game – it's something else.
It's great to play with a partner when everything goes well, but when you're on the square alone, you're trying to limit your ability to play golf.
This must be introduced by players – everything will have to be pressed out of themselves tomorrow.
We'll have to stand out with my partner now and he'll have to get out of himself."
Unlike Mr Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk expects his players to show up individually rather than as partners, except for Jordan's St. Pieth and Justin Thomas, who collected three points out of four.
Furyk himself experienced both sides of the last day's surprises, because he was in Brooklyn on a winning team until Europe did not perform the Medina miracle and did not turn them into losers."
“I remember every goddamn word,” he replied, asked as Captain Ben Crenshaw in 1999, motivated his players to prepare for the last day.
- Tomorrow we have 12 important machos, but go for a quick start – the one you saw in Brooklyn and Medina.
When acceleration occurs in one direction, the middle macaque becomes very tense.
We accordingly formed our team and released players in a way that we know... we're trying to create some magic tomorrow."
Thomas will have the task of trying to counter the fight and to negotiate with Rory McIlroy at the highest level in Mache, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jonas Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are among Europeans.
“I chose these guys in this order, because I think they will be successful in the whole game,” T. Bjorn told about his choice for team matches.
delivery of the new German military ship delayed
The latest German navy charter had to start work as early as 2014 and replace military ships in the Cold War, but according to local press, we will not see them at least until next year due to rising systems and high prices.
According to a representative of the army, quoted by the Die Zeit newspaper, Rheinland-Pfalz is the main charter ship of the new Baden-Württemberg class, which has now been postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship had to join the military fleet in 2014, but the fate of this ambitious project was covered by problems that had already occurred.
Four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class, ordered by the navy in 2007, will replace the old Bremen class Fregat.
It is believed to include powerful ramps, a series of anti-aircraft and anti - missiles, and certain sensitive technologies such as reducing radar, infrared, and acoustic footprints.
Another important feature is longer maintenance intervals, which would allow the latest freight offices to fly far away from home ports for up to two years.
However, according to Die Zeit, the continuing delays in the state-of-the-art technology are caused by military vessels which, as it has been said, should allow Germany to channel military power to overseas territories until they begin to be used.
Last year, the failed F125 fregat entered the headlines when the German Navy formally refused to accept the ship and returned it to the Bolhm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time that a navy returns a ship that has already been delivered to the builder.
Although the reason for the return is not known enough, the German press mentions some of the fundamental defects in the software and technical equipment that would have led the ship to have lost faith in the military mission.
Software gaps are particularly important, as ships of the Baden-Württemberg class will be operated by about 120 seafarers – half the capacity of the older Bremen class.
It also proved to be far too heavy, reducing its effectiveness and limiting the ability of the military fleet to introduce various improvements in the future.
It is estimated that 7 000 tonnes of Rheinland-Pfalz are twice the size of the similar class ships used by Germans in the Second World War.
The cost of the project as a whole – including training for crews in addition to the genomic equipment – is also gradually becoming a problem.
It is said that it rose from an initial amount of EUR 2.2 billion to an amazing amount of 3.1 billion ($3.6 billion).
The recent fregatous problems have become very significant since the recent warnings that the German navy's power is being reduced.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Chief of Defence Committee of the German Parliament, acknowledged that the military fleet was indeed "let us lack suitable ships".
The officer said that over a certain period of time the problems were caused by the fact that old ships had already been written down, but there was no way to change them.
He regretted that none of the Bagen-Württemberg class-speakers could join the military fleet.
National Trust listens to secret bat life
A new survey, carried out on a Scottish highland estate, aims to reveal how bats use the landscape when hunting food.
The findings are expected to provide new knowledge on the behaviour of unique flying mammals and provide guidance for future nature conservation activities.
The researchers of the National Trust for Scotland will watch the assholes, soprano spongies, brown ears and water-sanding Wester Ros Inverevo gardens.
Special recordings will be provided in certain areas of the territory to monitor bat activity throughout the season.
The national health service staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile tests on manual detectors.
The analysis of all sound recordings by experts will determine the frequency of signals emitted by bats and one or another type of activity.
A map and report will be produced of residential arenas, which will help to create a picture of detailed behaviors across the landscape.
The National Trust for Scotland (NTS) expert on conservation affairs, Rob Dewar, hopes that the results will be revealed, which live range are the most important for bats and how each species is used.
This information will help to identify the benefits of residential care, such as the creation of grasslands, as well as how best to care for forested areas to be suitable for bats and other related species.
During the last century, bat populations in Scotland and the United Kingdom have shunned.
They are threatened with construction and real estate development, affecting sites and destroying residential areas.
Windmills and lightnings are also at stake, as are ours, and some chemicals used to treat construction materials, as well as cats that hunt home.
The bats are not really blind.
However, getting a prey during night hunting is more of a help for the ears than for the eyes.
Strings shall determine the location of the insects or obstacles present in the flight path with precision by means of a self-sustaining method.
The NTS, which is responsible for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land across the country, is particularly responsible for looking at bats.
There are ten trained experts who regularly carry out tests, transhipment checks and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization has even created the first and only reserve for bats in Scotland in the Threave Manor in Damfrise and Gaukai, where eight of the ten species of Scottish bats live.
Manor overseer David Thompson says that the Manor Territory is ideal for them.
“Threave Manor has a great place for bats,” he said.
- We have old buildings, many mature trees and great areas to live.
However, we still do not know much about bats, so the work here and in other places will help us to understand better what they need to be able to flourish."
He stresses the importance of checking the absence of bats before the site begins to work on surveillance, since the accidental destruction of one hatchet can lead to the death of up to 400 females and juveniles, which can lead to the destruction of the entire local population.
The bats shall be protected and shall not be killed, irritated or damaged, nor shall they be destroyed.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an officer of the Scottish String Protection Fund, called on the public to contribute to the rescue of bats.
She said: "We all need to learn a lot about our bats, and we do not know how many local species are going."
Mr Ronaldo rejected the accusation of rape – lawyers intend to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called him accusations by rape "melagues" and said that people, using his name, are "speakable".
His lawyers are prepared to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which has issued charges.
The attacker of Portuguese and Juventus clubs has been accused of raped American Kathryn Mayor in 2009 in Las Vegas hotel room.
Der Spiegel announced on Friday that he had then allegedly paid her $370,000 to do so.
Speaking 142 million followers lively broadcast in the Instagram image a few hours after the charges, 33 C. Ronaldo critic reports and called them "melages".
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they say today – liars – said five times “Ballon d’Or” laureate looking at the camera.
- Using my name, they want to be famous.
It's normal.
They want to be famous and say my name is part of my work.
I'm a happy person, I'm okay," said a smiler.
According to Reuters, Mr Ronaldo's lawyers are going to sue Der Spiegel to the court for charges which they called "inadmissible suspicions of private space matters".
Judge Christian Schertz said that the sportsman would seek compensation for "moral damage, the amount of which would correspond to the materiality of the violation – perhaps one of the most serious violations of the rights of a person in the last few years."
It is claimed that the alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in the casinos and hotel apartments of “Palms” in Las Vegas.
According to the documents submitted to the District Court of Nevada Clark, after meeting in the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the gym room where he allegedly raped her by analogy.
Mayorga states that after the alleged incident, Ronaldo attacked her knees and said to her that there is a “99 percent good person” who was betrayed by the remaining “one percent” of his personality.
The documents state that Ronaldo acknowledged that the couple had sex, but they claimed that they had been agreed.
Mayorga also claims that she had applied to the police and that her injuries in the hospital had been photographed, but later she agreed to agree not to court proceedings, because “remained in response” and worried that “publicly humiliated” would be.
A 34-year-old woman says that she is now seeking to withdraw the agreement because she continues to feel traumatised by the alleged incident.
At the time of the attack, Ronaldo was known as bepereuins from Manchester United to the Real Madrid club, and this summer, after signing a 100 million euros contract, joined the Italian giant Juventus.
Brexitas. The United Kingdom would have forever regretted the loss of car manufacturers
According to Secretary of Business Affairs Grego Clarko, the United Kingdom would "remove forever" if the global status of car manufacturing leadership was lost after Brexit.
He added his concern about the statement by the Toyota unit in the United Kingdom to the BBC that if Britain withdrew from the EU without an agreement, production in the Burnaston factory near Derby would be suspended.
"We need an agreement," said Mr Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer claimed that the loss of border traffic after the "Brexit" would mean job losses without agreement.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota models Auris and Avensis, produced almost 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other European Union countries.
"In my opinion, if Britain suddenly leaves the European Union at the end of March, our factory will have to stop production," said Burnaston Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover, also expressed concerns about withdrawal from the EU without agreement and its consequences for international trade.
For example, BMW claims that after one month Braxit will close its Mini plant.
According to the car manufacturers, the main concerns are the threats that Brexit will face in the case of the supply chain without any contract.
The Toyota production line works where necessary, since the parts of the cars produced on the order are delivered from both UK and EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If the UK leaves the EU without a contract on 29 March, there may be problems at the border; according to this industry, this may lead to delays or a lack of detail.
Toyota claimed that it would not be possible to hold more than one daily stock at the Derbishyr plant, so that production would stop.
According to Clark, the plan for the future relationship with the EU for the Theresa May Chequers is "prepared precisely to avoid such border checks".
“We need a contract. We want to have the best agreement that I say will allow us not only to enjoy the success today, but also to take advantage of this opportunity,” he said to the Radio 4 program “Today”.
"Not only the Toyota data, but also the data from other car manufacturers show that it is necessary to continue with the very successful operation of the supply chain."
Toyota could not say for some time that production would be stopped, but warned that, in the long term, additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately the cost of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallar, who has been working at the Burnaston factory for 24 years and who is responsible for the Unit trade union meetings, said that members of his trade union are increasingly concerned: "I say from experience that once these jobs are lost, they will never return."
The representative of the Government said: "We have proposed a plan for objectives and faith in future relations with the EU."
According to the White House, the Trump meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again
“Continuing the fight for a candidate for the Supreme Court, the important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein can be postponed for a week,” the White House announced on Sunday.
Rosentstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller – the latter investigates Russia's interference in the elections, the relations of short-term assistants with Russia and the possible interference of President with justice.
The question is whether Trump will dismiss the Deputy Prosecutor General, thus threatening Mueller's independence, has been in the rumors of many months in Washington.
This month, New York Times reported that Rosentstein discussed carrying a microphone for conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the President with Amendment 25.
Rosenstein denied this report.
However, when he died of reports of resignation, he went to the White House last Monday.
Instead, it is announced that the meeting with Trump, which was then held at the United Nations in New York, will take place on Thursday.
A brief comment was made that he did not wish to forgive Rosentstein. Later, the meeting was postponed in order to avoid meeting with the Senate's Committee on Judicial Affairs, where both Kavanaughas witnessed and Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of improper sexual conduct.
On Friday, he said to the FBI that he should investigate the accusations made by Kavanaugho in a week, thereby once again postponing the vote at the plenary session of the Senate.
The short press representative, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Day on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “It is not a date, and it can happen this week, but in view of all events related to the Supreme Court, it can be postponed for a week.
But we will see. I always like to announce news to the press."
Some journalists disagreed with this statement: Since 10 September, Sanders has not compiled any press conference in the White House.
Wedder Chris Wallace  set out to ask why.
Sander replied that press conferences are rarely held because they don't like "effects for viewers" TV journalists. It is true, I added, "I must agree with the fact that they are seeking effects for viewers."
Then he mentioned that Trump more often uses the press directly.
"The President answers questions more often than any previous President," said she, without providing any evidence, adding, "We're reviewing this statistics."
According to Sander, press conferences will be held, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, this is much better than talking to me.
We have often tried to do this and you have seen that this has happened many times over the last few weeks. Press conferences will replace your direct communication with the President of the United States."
A brief regular response to questions is given by departure from the White House, participation in public meetings or press conferences with honourable guests.
One person’s press conferences are rare.
The free and sometimes strange appearance of the president against journalists this week in New York must have explained why.
Health Minister Scotland's NST staff from the EU wrote about the concerns of Brexit
Health minister at the Scottish NST from the EU wrote a letter expressing the country's appreciation and willingness to stay after Brexit.
A letter from Mr Jeane Freeman, a Scottish Member of Parliament, was sent less than six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the costs of applications for permanent resident status for EU citizens working in the public services sector entrusted to it.
In his letter to Mr Freeman, he wrote: “The summer negotiations between the UK and the EU continued and are coming to the anticipated solutions this autumn.
However, the UK Government began to speed up its preparations and a possible scenario without a contract.
I know you're all very worried right now.
That is why I wanted to reiterate how I appreciate the contribution of all workers, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and elsewhere bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the healthcare system to patients and communities that we serve.
Scotland is really your home and we want you to stay here."
Urgency in the head injury to Christion Abercrombie
On Saturday, 31:27 Christion Abercrombie, the defender of the Ternesse State Tigers, lost his competition head injury to the Väderstad Commodores team, reported Turnnessean journalist Mike respectively.
Rod Reed told journalists that injury occurred just before the break.
"He came to the sideline and just fell there," said Reed.
Trainers and doctors at the sideline Abercrombie gave breath to oxygen, then put on the carriers and sent for further research.
Chris Harris from Nashville (Tessville) WSMV said that the Abercrombie operation at the Vanderbilt Medical Center was completed.
Harris added that “there is no information yet about the type and extent of the injury,” and Ternesse State is trying to determine when it happened.
The second year Abercrombie, which officially launched the sports season, moved from Illinois and Turnese State to participate in the first season.
Before leaving the game, he got five balls back on Saturday, and the total number of balls he has recovered during the season reached 18.
Foreign buyers purchasing property in the UK will have to pay higher stamp fees
According to the new sectoral plans, foreign buyers buying real estate in the UK will have to pay higher stamp fees and receive extra money to help homeless
This step will reduce the risk of success of the Corbyn campaign aimed at attracting young voters
Increased stamp duty will be levied on UK non-taxable persons
The Ministry of Finance hopes that it will be able to raise up to GBP 120 million a year to help the homeless
Today Theresa May will announce that foreign buyers buying property in the UK are expected to be subject to a higher rate stamp tax and that the additional money received is being used to help the homeless
In the run-up to more affordable housing and high-income people, this step is expected to reduce the risks posed by the Jeremy Corbyn campaign to attract young voters.
The increased stamp duty will be levied on UK tax-free persons and businesses, and the additional money is allocated to the government's campaign to combat homelessness.
Additional toll – to be paid in addition to the current stamp duty, including two years ago for the rental of second houses or houses, which were introduced two years ago – can reach as much as three per cent.
The Ministry of Finance hopes that this step will allow the collection of up to GBP 120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of the newly built real estate in London is bought by non-UK residents, leading to higher prices and more difficult for first-generation buyers.
Many foreign buyers spend most of their time outside the country, and many rich areas of the country, especially the capital, have become ghosts in cities.
The new strategy was presented just a few weeks later, when Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty to help more young people get their first homes.
He accused large construction companies of buying land quickly, without using it, maintaining high real estate prices, and called on Maya to face the shame of British housing by abandoning affordable housing quotas.
Corbyna announced several eye-catching proposed housing reforms, including the control of rental prices and the prohibition of landing without fault.
He also wants more power to build new houses for municipal councils.
Maya said: “I told you last year that I would try to get my British dream back to the office of Prime Minister: for every new generation, life needs to be better.
This means that we have to clean up our poor housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and create life.
It is, however, unfair that people who do not live in the UK and businesses established abroad can buy their homes as easily as the hard-working British people can.
For many people, the dream of having a home has become almost unreal, and the threat of humiliating homelessness is still too real."
Jack Ross: “My ultimate goal is to lead the Scottish Collection”
The head of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says that his ultimate goal is to ever become the leader of the Scottish national team.
The Scotch of the age of 42 likes the challenge of revitalising the North-East club, currently located in the third place of the first league and falling from the first-place club by three points.
Having taken St Mirren back to the Scottish Championship last season, he moved to Stadium of Light this summer.
“As a player, I wanted to play for my country.
I got into the B national team and it's over," Ross said to the Scottland's Sportsound program.
“But when I was a kid, I grew up at the Hadden Stadium with Dad watching a lot of Scottish team competitions, and that always attracted me back.
It is true that this opportunity will only happen if I manage the club successfully."
As far as Ross Sunderland was concerned, Dicko Advocatas, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Royúus Keane, Gusas Poyet and Paulo Di Canio were in charge.
After rejecting the proposals of Barnsley and Ipswich Town, a former manager of Allosa Athletic says that he did not feel worried when starting to work after such well-known leaders in such a big club.
“Now my success will be assessed in response to the question “Can I return this club to the "Premier" league?
According to its structure and conditions, this club is undoubtedly owned by the Premier leagues," he said.
“It’s not easy to take it out, but after I’m just returning my club to the league, I think I’ve been successful here.”
Ross's leadership career lasts only three years, and previously he worked as a chief assistant at the Dumbarton Club and replaced the Hearts Trainers for 15 months.
Later, it helped to recover to the third division, Allloa, and St Mirren’s club, which was threatened to fall, turned the championship’s winners into the next season.
Ross claims that it is now more satisfying than it has ever felt during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academy clubs.
“This change was probably radical,” he recalls.
“I truly believed that I was fit for leadership – it is more suitable than playing.
This sounds weird, because I was lucky, earned a lot, and enjoyed satisfactory achievements.
But playing may be difficult.
You have many problems every week.
And now it is not easy – working stress and stress, but I feel that leadership is exactly what I need.
I always wanted to lead, and I'm doing it now. When I grew up, I always felt at my sleds, but leadership gives me the greatest satisfaction."

Studies showed that the best time for beer was Saturday at 5.30 p.m.
The summer heat waves have increased the income of the poor British beers, but they have made it even more difficult for restaurant networks to bear.
The figures showed that in July sales of beer and bars groups increased by 2.7 per cent, but in restaurants income decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin of the business consulting company CGA said: “The unfinished sunset and the longer than expected, England’s participation in the World Championship meant that in July followed the same trend as in June, when beer revenues increased by 2.8 percent. It is true that restaurants suffered even more than before.
In June, restaurant trade decreased by 1.8 percent, and in July the situation became worse.
The results of beer and bars in trade in beverages were certainly the best and trade in them grew stronger than in restaurants.
Although not as strong as restaurant companies, the sunrise was also affected by the main revenues from food trade beer.
It looks like people wanted to just go get out.
In well-organized breweries and bars, sales of beverages increased by 6.6 per cent this month, and food sales dropped by 3 per cent."
In the analysis of the leisure and fertility sector, RSM states: “These results have continued the trend since the end of April.
As regards catering facilities, the effects of weather and key social and sporting events continue to be a key factor.
It is true that the drop in sales of 4.8 percent of the year will be particularly painful, as it will contribute to the constant cost-related pressure.
The largest income from food trade, a long hot summer, could not come at a worse time. Time will tell you whether a softer August feels the temperature will give you the necessary breathing."
The overall increase in sales in breweries and restaurants, including newly opened places, was 2.7 percent in July and reflected the slowdown in the development of networks belonging to brands.
In the UK, the sales monitoring tool for the beer, bars and restaurants sector and its guidelines are recognised as the ‘The Coffer Peach Tracker’ sector, which collects and analyzes data from 47 existing groups with a total turnover of more than GBP 9 billion.
One of five children has social media accounts hidden from their parents
The study revealed that one in five children, some just 11 years old, has social media accounts that are hidden from parents and teachers
A survey of 20 000 secondary school students revealed an increasing number of false pages of Insta
The new news has strengthened the fear that sexual content is being published
Twenty percent of students said they had a basic account to show their parents
One of the five children, some just 11 years of age, is creating secret social media accounts and hiding them from adults.
A survey of 20 000 students in high school revealed that the number of false pages of Insta is rapidly increasing, referring to the Infogram photo sharing site.
The new news has strengthened the fear that sexual content is being published
Twenty percent of students say they use a censored basic account for their parents, but they also have secret accounts.
One mother, after accidentally finding a secret 13-year-old daughter’s site, learned that her teen insisted on saying, “Reject me”.
Research carried out by the Digital Awareness UK and the Independent Schools’ Directors’ Conference (MDK) found that 40 percent of students aged 11–18 have two appointments, while half of these students recognised their account as hiding.
The Head of the MDC, Mike's Buchan, said: "The temptation of so many teenagers to create virtual spaces in which they cannot find parents and teachers is worrying."
Eilidha Doyle will be a sportsman's voice in the Scottish Sports Council
At the general annual meeting of the management body of the Scottish Sports Council, its director was elected as a consultant to Eilidha Doyle.
Ian Beatti described this step as a great opportunity for those who lead sport to take advantage of a wide range of international experience gained during the last decade.
“Eilidha deserves great respect throughout the entire Scottish, UK and world sports community, and we have no doubt that its inclusion in the Scottish Council will bring great benefits to Scottish sports”, hereinafter said Beatti.
Doyle said: “I want to serve as a voice for athletes, and I hope that I will really contribute and help lead the sports in Scotland.”
The American, now appearing as a permanent BBC expert, was unable to walk after an experienced short-term attack of an ischemia, at the age of 200 and 400 metres in the 1996 Atlantic Games and the total of four Olympic gold medals.
"Twitter" he wrote: "In the month, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would show if and to what extent I would recover.
I had to work before I was exhausted, but I fully recovered, I learned to walk again, and I am doing my mobility exercises today!
Thank you for the message of encouragement."
Advertising of breast milk in which mothers compare with cows has received different assessments online
The company producing breast milk received different opinions on its advertising, comparing nursing mothers with dairy cows.
In order to mark the beginning of the trade of the product described as the world's first quiet portable breasts, Elvie, user-oriented technology company, issued an inspired advertisement for an ironic music video record, aimed at demonstrating the freedom provided to mothers by the new milk train.
In this full ward, four true mothers dance according to a sound record, for example, the words: "Yes, I lie to myself, but no tails can see" and "If you haven't noticed, here's not the tales, here's my breasts."
The attachment continues: “Get him away, remove him, feed him, remove him, remove him, and lie with my beauty.”
However, advertising published on Facebook page caused an online dispute.
A video received several hundred comments and 77,000 times reviewed has responded in a variety of ways, and many said that it is an underestimatingly viewed by the dairy industry.
"This product to promote the use of cows is a very poor solution.
Like us, they must become pregnant and give birth to produce milk only after their newborns have been taken away a few days from them", hereinafter wrote one woman.
Elvie breast milker invisibly room in the feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: “It is understood that this hurts both the mother and the newborn child.
But why not use them for advertising, which presents a breast milk container for mothers from which babies are not taken away?"
Another one added: "Advertise is a total misunderstanding."
Another commentator defends the ad – one woman admitted that the song appeared to her "very heavy".
“I think the idea is genius.
I would buy if I was still feeding.
When I stopped milk, I felt like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I accepted it as what it is.
This product is a genealogical", hereinafter wrote one.
Another comment was made: “This advertising is targeted at mothers who lose milk (often at workplaces or toilets) and feel like cows.
Its purpose is not to drink or condemn the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women reveals that all the unobservable milk in the dance with bras is placed.
The idea of the campaign is based on the insight that many women who stop milk from breasts claim to feel like cows.
However, Elvie’s milk train does not reveal any sound, has wires or tubes, and an unobservable space in the power bra, thus allowing women to move their milk freely, keep their infants, or even leave their homes.
“Moter” partner and executive creative director Ana Balarin commented: “Elvie” milk train is a revolutionary product that deserves to be started boldly and provocatively.
In comparison with dairy cows, we wanted to draw attention to the ending of the milk and to all the challenges it poses, at the same time as it has fun and as far as possible to show the incredible sense of freedom that the new milk train will give.
Elvie's milk has come to the headlines for the first time.
During the London Fashion Week, Marta Jabubowski’s mother of two children showed her on a podium using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children silently moved to the tent camp near Texas border
The number of border crossing people has not changed substantially during the month, but the number of children of migrants detained increased considerably – partly because of the strict rhetoric and policies of the short-term administration made it more difficult to accommodate them with guardians.
Traditionally, the majority of guardians themselves were immigrants without documents and feared that applying for child care would risk staying in the country.
When the federal government announced in June that potential carers and other adult members of their families will have to give fingerprints and this data will be shared with the immigration authorities, the risk has increased.
Last week, Matthew Albence, Chief Executive of Immigration and Customs, witnessed to Congress that the institution had detained tens of people who had applied for care for unaccompanied minors.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not been judged before.
“Almost 80 per cent of these persons – guardians or members of their family – live in the country illegally, and most of them are foreign criminals.
That is why we will continue to persecute these people", - said Albence  application.
According to the shelter staff, in order to consider cases of children faster, the officials introduced new rules, which some children must appear in court within a month of detention, not within 60 days, as was the case earlier.
Many of the requests for legal status against a judge on immigration issues will try to defend not when he comes personally but when he uses a conference video call.
Recognised people who do not have the right to receive aid will be promptly deported.
According to shelter workers and reports received from the system in recent months, the longer children remain detained, the more likely it is to become anxious or depressed, and this can lead to abuse or escape attempts.
The defenses claim that this is even more worrying in the large institutions, such as the shelter of Tornilla, where it is more likely to ignore the sign that the child is suffering.
They added that the transfer of children to the tent city without giving enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends may exacerbate many of the injuries that have already occurred.
Syria told the U.S., France and Turkey to leave immediately
In addition, when addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualham invited Syrian refugees to return home, although war has taken place in the country for eight years.
Moualham, also Vice-President of the Minister, claimed that the foreign forces under the pretext of combating terrorism are illegal in Syria and will be treated accordingly.
“They have to leave immediately and unconditionally”, said the Assembly.
Moualham claimed that in Syria, where more than 360 000 people died since 2011, and millions had to leave their homes, the terrorist war was almost over.
He said that Damascus would continue to fight this holy struggle until we have eradicated terrorist groups and any aliens in all parts of Syria.
Syria has approximately 2 000 troops in the United States, which mainly train and advise the Kurd forces, as well as the Syrian Arabs that oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 land soldiers in a war - torn country.
Speaking of the refugee problem, Moualem said that the conditions for their return were good, and at the same time accused some Western countries of spreading unjustified fear that deters refugees from returning.
"We took us to the international community and humanitarian organisations to help them return", he said.
"They are politicising what should be a purely humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria's reconstruction aid will only be achieved once Assada and the opposition reach a political agreement and end the war.
UN diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major rebel fortress, has created the conditions for greater progress in political negotiations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack on the Syrian forces supported by Russia, directed towards a province where there are three million people.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement contained clear deadlines, and also expressed the hope that military action would be directed towards Jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front related to Al-Qaeda, which would be destroyed.
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene shortly the first meetings of a committee set up by the Government and opposition members, which would prepare a post-war constitution for Syria and prepare the ground for the elections.
Moualham set out the conditions under which the Syrian Government will participate in the committee – the work of the group must be limited to reviewing the articles of the current constitution and warned against interfering.
Why will Trump be elected for the second term?
On the basis of such logic, Trump would be elected in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers may expect, his Presidency would end in the past with an impeachment and scandal.
Of course, this would be the dramatic end of the previous Presidency ever!
So far, we cannot see signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, the best broadcasting time on CNN's television has grown more than twice to 1.05 million and MSNBC to almost three times to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers of the best broadcasting time, an increase of 1.7 million from four years ago, while MSNBC The Rachel Maddow Show takes the first place in cable TV ranking with even 3.5 million viewers at the main news evenings.
“It’s a fire that attracts people because we don’t understand something,” says Neal Baer, who is promising ABC series “Decedents” about the secretary of the Cabinet of Ministers who, after the attack in Congress, becomes the president.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedia writer and author of “Only entertaining parts and some unpleasant truths to access the Hollywood Boys Club” has another theory.
She remembers the taxi in Boston against the 2016 elections.
The driver said he would vote in favour of Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"He said, "He makes me laugh," said Scovell.
Chaos is valuable in having fun.
Of course, unlike the rest of the show on television, the scenes coming from Washington can lead to the future of the Roe v Wade case, the opportunity to unite immigrant families and the state of the global economy.
A lack of watch is a luxury that can only be given by privileged viewers.
However, it is more than necessary to be informed by a citizen when you realize that you have been watching a group of experts for six hours now, how Bob Woodward uses sensitive data for his book "Family" and Paul Manafort demonstrated a stream of US-$ 15 000 (the "thickness-to-thickness-to-throwing" she wrote "The Washington Post") and what is meant by the shocking description of Stormy Daniels Trump's anatomy.
At least I will never look at Super Mario again.
“His actions remind you of the reality show, because every evening he throws something down to you,” says the CEO of the Wheelhouse Entertainment and Father Brent Montgomery, who created the Pawn Stars.

When I contacted Fleis this week, there was a heat and a sun of 27 degrees outside his home on the northern coast of the Caucasus, but he was inside of the tower and watched by MSNBC when he recorded the CNN.
He could not open up – certainly not when Brett Kavanaughu had to stand before the Senate Court Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanged on his hair.
“I remember when we once created this crazy show, people said, “It is the beginning of Western civilization”, Fleis said.
"I thought there was a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Money pours out from around the tense middle elections to the House of Representatives
No wonder, as a result of the restructuring of the Congress Districts, which ended with the attempt of two Members of the House to win the same post, the 17th region of Pennsylvania was covered by money.
Recently, the rehearsal of Pittsberg County has included a democratic Member of the House of Representatives Conor Lamb in the fight – last spring he won his place in another constituency during special elections.
Lamb competed with another Member of the House of Representatives – Republican Keithu Rothfus, currently representing the former 12th District of Pennsylvania. A large part of it overlaps with the new 17th.
The rehearsal of the maps when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that, in violation of the constitution, the old county was consolidated for the benefit of Republicans.
During the election battle in the new 17th constituency, financial institutions of major parties – the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC) – expressed concern about campaign finance.
Lamb in Pennsylvania became famous when, at the 18th Congress District, he won a small victory for the widely watched special elections in March.
Over a decade this place was occupied by Republicans, and President Donald Trump won 20 points.
The political experts gave the democrats some advantage.
U.S. considered El Salvador to be punished for supporting China, but then calmed down
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already accepted Beijing, but did not receive, in principle, a negative reaction from Washington.
In June 2017, Trump attended a warm meeting with Panaman President Juan Carlos Varela and had a hotel in this country until the partners moved to Trimp Organisation.
"The officials of the Taiwanese State Department have decided to withdraw heads of American diplomatic missions from Salvadoro, Dominican Republic and Panama for the recent decisions," said Heather Nauert, in a report published earlier this month.
But sanctions are being considered only for El Salvador, which received some USD 140 million worth of American aid in 2017, as well as for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions would have been painful for a Central American country with high unemployment and homicide rates, including a reduction in financial assistance and visa restrictions for individuals.
In the context of internal meetings, the Nordic and Central American officials postponed the high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which was due to take place after a similar meeting last year, which was considered an important step forward in preventing migrants from entering the United States.
But in the middle of September, the top administrative officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, and so in essence concluded any deliberations on the sanctions against El Salvador.
"In order to show the importance of the administration for this assembly, Vice President Mike respective to Pence and the list of speakers of the conference planned for mid-October is now included", said diplomats.
And three American envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without reporting any reprimands or punishments from Washington.
The representative of the White House refused Bolton's comment on the details of the debate that three American officials, including two diplomats, told about, and agreed to discuss their internal deliberations only if their anonymity was preserved.
Their stories are confirmed by an analyst close to the administration, as well as by speaking if its anonymity is preserved.
Learn History
The report by the special advisor Robert Mueller about the possible short-term disruption to justice can then be expected: its very strong evidence is now available in public archives.
In addition, as has been said, Mueller is asking the question whether the short campaign has been carried out in secret cooperation with Russia, which is damaging to our elections.
If Congress moved into the other hands, Trump would have to take responsibility in this institution – at the same time as he is going to get back before voters and perhaps also before the municipal commission.
There's a lot of "if" here, and I don't say that the end of the short-term is inevitable – just like its equivalents in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic will have to choose, and these choices will determine whether the fight will last for a long time.
In 1938 German officials were ready to decelerate Hitler, and only the West needed to oppose him and support Czech Slovaks in Munich.
We have recovered and missed the opportunity to prevent later slaughterhouses.
The history is moving around such crucial turning points, which is then accelerated or suspended by the undisturbed march of democracy.
The Americans have now come to a few of these crucial points of turn.
What can we do if Trump forgives his deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein, a person who depends on Mueller's trial?
Rosentstein's problems began when this newspaper announced that last year the official had offered to keep a secret record of the President and discussed his inability to perform these duties.
Rosenstein claims that the story of The Times is inaccurate.
“How will we react if the new FTB investigation of Bretto Kavanaugh appears incomplete or incorrect, or if, despite convincing accusations of sexual coercion and false testimony, this candidate will be assigned to the Supreme Court?
Finally, will we vote in favour of Congress in the middle elections, which will make the short term take responsibility?
If we fail to keep these tests, democracy is threatened by a long winter.
But because of the lesson I learned in Prague, I believe that we will keep them.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia, and she was taken to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime, once established in the homes where I lived as an ambassador.
She survived, emigrated to America and after 60 years sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the table with svastic.
When I have an inheritance like this, how can I look at our future unoptimised?"

Graham Dorrans from the Rangers revolt with Rapid Vienne is waiting optimisticly for
On Thursday, Rangers "Rapid vienna" will be welcomed, knowing that if, after earlier this month's impressive events in Spain with Willarreal against the east, we could find ourselves in a strong position to leave Group G.
Due to the trauma of the road, Graham Dorrans could have appeared for the first time this season only in 2:2 final competition with Willarreal. But he expects the Rangers Club to use this result as a trample towards more important goals.
“We had a good result because “Villarreal” is a great team,” said 31-year-old player.
“We started playing by believing that we would achieve something, and we completed it.
Maybe we could have been more peaceful at the end, but overall the competition was good.
They must have played the first chair better, and we've done the second, and we've shown us who we're a better team.
On Thursday there will be another important evening of the European League.
I hope that we can get three points. The game will be difficult, because the result of these events has been a great one, but I do not doubt that with the support of the audience we can go ahead and achieve a good result.
Last year it was really difficult – and what happened to my injuries, and changes in the club itself, but now there is a good mood.
The team is good and the guys are really happy; you're great training.
I hope that we will now be able to move forward, forget the last season and succeed in playing."
This fear of pension savings is causing women to suffer sleeplessness
Although the surveyers had a clear idea of what kind of care they wanted to receive, few talked about it with family members.
About half of the respondents to the Nationwide survey said that the spouses talked about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to the kids about it.
“People want to take care of them as a family member, but they don’t try to talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, Vice President of Life Insurance Company.
That's where we need to start.
Talk to your spouse and children, and if you don’t know your preferences in advance, your families will not be ready to take care of you.
Talk with your counselor and family about where and what care you would like to get, as these factors can play a role in predicting costs.
Call for a financial adviser, and the counselor can also help you to think about how to pay these expenses.
With long-term care, you can decide to pay for these costs by means of a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a mixed life insurance policy, or by covering your property for as long as you have money.
Develop legal documents. Do not prevent legal disputes from being protected by the enabling documents.
Provide a secure person to take care of your medical care and ensure that specialists respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
In addition, consider the authority to care for your finances.
You should choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and make payments if you become inactive.
Imagine that your elderly father or mother needs urgent medical attention and takes it or travels it to a hospital.

Ilfraukme pneumatic gun shot several times
After spending the evening in town, the man who was in the house was shot with a pneumatic gun on several occasions.
The victim was shot at his chest, abdomen, and hand for forty years in the Oksford Grauvo District, Devon.
About 02.30 p.m., British summer - time shooting officers described it as a casual act.
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His life is not a threat to injury, and the police are asking for the help of witnesses.
earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
“At least 384 died when the city of Indonesia was shocked by a powerful earthquake and tsunami”, officials say. It is believed that the number of people who died will increase further.
As a result of the destruction of communication, the officials of the emergency services were unable to obtain any data from the renaissance of Dongala, a region north of Pali, close to 7.5 points of the earthquake epicenter.
In the event of a disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Pala.
Here are some key facts about Pala and Dongal on the island of Sulawesi.
In 2017, the city of Pala, some 379 800 inhabitants, is the capital of the province of Sulawes, which was founded at the end of the Gulf on the narrow west coast of Sulawesis.
When the earthquake hit and the tsunami hit, the city celebrated the 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a renaissance stretched along the coast of more than 300 km (180 miles) in the northwest island of Sulawesi.
As a rule, around 299 200 inhabitants lived for the province in a smaller administrative region in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the main pillars of the economy of the province of Sulawes, in particular the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is true, mostly concentrated in Morovale on the coast of Sulawes.
According to the Indonesian disaster relief agencies, Pala and Dongala have suffered several times over the past century from tsunamis.
In 1938 the tsunami in Dongala killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In addition, 9 people were killed in 1996 to the western tip of the tsunami.
Indonesia is constantly suffering from earthquakes on its seismicly active Pacific fire ring.
Some of the most important earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years.
On December 26, 2004, a strong earthquake on the west coast of Aceh Province, Indonesia, caused tsunamis in the northern Suumatra, affecting 14 countries and killing 226 000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
At the end of March and early April 2005, several severe earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people were killed near the island of Nias.
In 2006, an earthquake of 6.8 points hit the southernmost densely populated part of the Indonesian island, Java, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast and destroyed almost 700 people.
In 2009, an earthquake of 7.6 points shocked the area near the western city of Sumatra, the capital of the city of Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
In 2010, one of the islands of Mentavai near Sumatra hit the 7,5-point earthquake, causing tsunamis with waves of up to ten feet [10 m], excavating dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
In 2016, the reprehensible renaissance of Pydie Jai in Aceh, which was the result of a slight earthquake, resulted in panic, as people remembered how everything was destroyed following a terrible earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This was not a tsunami, but more than 100 people were killed by the destroyed buildings.
In 2018, the strong earthquakes shocked Indonesia's tourists' island of Lombardok and killed more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists temporarily stuck on the coast.
Senior son of Saraha Palin arrested for domestic violence charges
Indicted by the attack, Track Palin was arrested, and the chief son of the Governor and Vice President of the former Alaskan Republic and Vice-Presidents, Saraha Palin.
According to a report published on Saturday by the Alaskan police, the 29-year-old Palina of Vasila (Aliaska) was arrested in the face of domestic violence, the possibility of declaring domestic violence and resistance in detention.
According to a police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report suspected crimes, he took the phone out of it.
As reported by KTUU, Palina was returned to Mat- su pre-trial detention facility and released for USD 500 deposit.
"He appeared on Saturday at a court where he, being asked to justify, said he was totally innocent", hereinafter reported the network.
Palina is accused of three Class A offences, which means that a fine of USD 250 000 may be imprisoned and punished up to one year.
He is also accused of class B misconduct, of a sentence in prison, and of a fine of USD 2 000.
This is not the first time that Palin was charged with criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was accused of attack by his father Toddo Palino.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported a suspected attack.
The case is currently being discussed by the Alaskan Veterans Court.
The incident involved domestic accusations against him in January 2016, delaying the reporting of domestic violence and the possession of arms in the short term.
His girl said he hit her face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin received veteran criticisms when his son’s violent behavior was related to a post-traumatic stress disorder resulting from his service in Iraq.
The earthquake and the tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of people died
At least 384 people died after Friday in the island of Sulawesi, Indonesia, at least.
An earthquake of 7.5 has caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks are not operational and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near the central Sulawesi, northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Videos are shared in the social media, where the moment of the tsunami blows are visible.
The tsunami struck the coast when hundreds of people gathered for the beach in Palu.
Federal prosecutors of New York terrorist attack suspects of rare executions
In New York, federal prosecutors seek the death penalty for Sayful Saipov, a suspected terrorist attack in New York City, in which eight people died. It is a rare punishment that has not been committed in this state for federal crimes since 1953.
It is suspected that on 31 October, 30-year-old Saipov from the home Depot rented a truck and held an attack on a bicycle path along the western highway in the Land Manhattan – on the way, he stowed pedestrians and cyclists.
According to the report on the intention to pursue the death penalty in the southern New York County, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov deliberately killed eight victims and deliberately caused serious bodily injury.
According to the court document, both of these indictments may lead to the death penalty.
After the attack a few weeks later, the Federal High Representative’s jury against Saipov announced an indictment of 22 points, covering eight accusations of murder involving the use of property (usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime) and charges of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
Prosecutors say that the attack was planned and premeditated very well, and that the way Saipaw did it, he called it a disgusting, cruel and immoral.
“The actions of Sayful Habibullaevicius Saipov caused injury, injury and loss of family members and friends of the following families: Diego Enrique Angelic, Nicholas Cleveso, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alleyandro Damiano Pagnuccico,” states the letter of intent.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
The last case, which required the death penalty, was dealt with in New York South a decade ago.
Khalid Barnes was sentenced to the murder of two drug providers, but, finally, in September 2009, he was sentenced to life imprisonment.
The last time the death penalty was executed in 1953 in the Federal case of New York for the spouses Julius and Ethele Rosenbergs, when they were sentenced two years ago to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on June 19, 1953 in an electric chair.
According to the court documents, Saipor, from Uzbekistan, did not regret his actions immediately after the attack or a few months later.
According to the police, he told researchers that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the act indicted, Saipov revealed to the officials that he had inspired the video recordings of the Islamic State (ISISIS) that he had been watching on his phone.
The police reported that he also asked the hospital to hang the Islamic State Flag.
He did not recognise his fault in accordance with paragraph 22 of the accusation.
David Patton, one of the federal state-funded defenders of Saipov, said that they were obviously disappointed with the decision of the prosecutor’s office.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, not to recognise the guilt and to put life in prison without the possibility of being released, will only extend the trauma of these events to all persons involved”, Patton said.
The saipov Defence Team previously asked prosecutors not to pursue the death penalty.
The Tori Parliamentary says that Braxit should be responsible for the negotiations NIGELAS FARAGE hereinafter.
Today, during the protest at the Regional Conference, Nigel Farage have promised to mobilise a nation's army.
The former UKIP leader said that the politicians must feel the heat of the Eurosceptics, and one of the MPs of Theresa May has suggested that he should lead negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bone, a member of the Conservatives’ House of the Communities, said to the demonstrators in Birmingham that the UK would now have left had Brexit as Secretary had been Farage.
But the difficulties May's attempt to unite the divided ranks of its supporters revealed for the survival of the EU-speakers who joined the city in a separate protest against Brexit.
It is difficult for the Prime Minister to implement the compromise plan agreed by his Czech Republic when it is attacked by the supporters, opponents and the EU.
The allies insisted that it would try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the opposition and force the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose its package or chaos.
Bonne  subject to the Leave Means Leave said that he wanted to destroy the Checkers' plan.
He claimed that Farage, or Farage, should have been an equal partner and that he should be given the responsibility to negotiate with Brussels.
"If he had led, we would have left the EU," he said.
The Velingboro Parliamentary added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we must reject the Checkers Plan."
In expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: “In the world wars, we did not fight to obey others.
We want to have our laws in our country."
‡Boone denied the suggestion that the public opinion changed since the vote in 2016: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and wish to stay in the EU is totally untruthful."
The supporter of Brexit continued to include Andrea Jenkins, and said to journalists: “I just say, Prime Minister, hear people.
The Checkers' plan is not popular among the general public, but the opposition will not vote for it; it is not popular with our party and the activists who go to the streets and, above all, vote in favour of us.
Reject the Checkers' plan and start listening."
In her critical report, May, she added: "Premiers retain their positions when they keep their promises."
Farage have said that hosting politicians must be forced to feel hot if they issue a referendum decision in 2016.
"Now it is a matter of trust in us, people and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to give "Brexit", so we're here today to tell them that we won't let this go."
He added: “I want you to force our political class, which almost betrayed Braxit, to feel the heat.
We are mobilising the army of the people of this country, which has brought us the Braxit victory, and we will not stop until we become independent, self-government and pride in the United Kingdom."
And Brexit's opponents marched on Birmingamo streets before organising a two-hour humiliation in the city center.
This weekend, after the group was formed, a bunch of activists were platoons "Toris v. Brexit."
Lord Adonis used the conservatives for the safety concerns they had experienced as a result of the party program at the beginning of the conference.
“These people who say they can install IT systems and all the technologies needed for the “Canada plus”, for the borders without friction and free trade without borders with Ireland,” he said.
“This is a complete farce.
There's no such thing as good "Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to take part in the presidential elections seriously
American senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the November elections she will seriously consider whether to participate in the presidential elections.
Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts democrat spoke about her future at a meeting with the public at the West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who regularly criticises President Donald Trump, participates in the reelections in November, in which he will negotiate with GOP State Representative Geoff Diehlu, one of the leaders of the 2016 Short campaign in Massachusetts.
It was reasonable that it could negotiate with the short-term in 2020.
Since Trump became President, the Saturday afternoon event in Holjoke was its 36th meeting with voters using a format of public meeting with the public.
One participant asked whether she planned to take part in the presidential elections.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington and fix a subjugated government, and women must lead this.
Detention of suspect in the LSU Sims case
On Saturday, the Baton Ruža police reported that they had detained a suspect who had been accused of shot by the basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
At a press conference at 11.00, the Baton Rouge Police Department reported that Dyteon Simpson, 20, had been detained.
The police distributed on Friday's shooting video and asked for help to recognize a man there.
Sams, a 20 - year - old, was shot and died near the town of South University early Friday.
According to “247sports”, police commander Murphy J. Paul reported to the media on Saturday that Wayde’s Sims was shot into his head and died as a result of injuries.
Wayde's stand to protect his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was at the scene of the crime, had a gun and shot at Wayde’s Sims.
Simpson was detained without opposition and was arrested by the district police department of East Baton Rouge.
The 198 cm-hides pre-school student Simsas grew up in Baton Rouge, in the last season he played 32 matches, 10 of which started in the five-year start, spent an average of 17.4 minutes on the playing field, earned 5.6 points and won a 2.9-point ball.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton came to the title of the world championship when the team instructed him to give victory to Sebastian Vettel
When Walter Boott won Lewis Hamilton on Saturday class drive, it became clear immediately that the orders of the "Mercedes" team in the race would be of great importance.
After starting the race from the first place, Bottus was well-started and, defending his position in the first two turns, barely left Hamilton in trouble, encouraging Vettel to attack his teammate.
He first went to the two-way garage, left Hamilton, and he returned to the race in the tail of the band, so it was fatal.
"Mercedes" went to the two-door garage after the wheel and returned to the track behind Vettel, but Hamilton went forward after the steps that had not ended just with his contact, when the Ferrari driver, after a double manoeuvre to preserve position in the third turn, reluctantly freed the inner side of the track.
At the 21st birthday, Max Verstappen started to celebrate, but at the end of the first round was seven.
He was the fastest part of the race because he was driving without changing the tires to get the finish as fast as possible, pass Kim Riikkonen and finish the fourth.
Finally, in a 44 - wheel circle, he went to a two - wheel garage, but in the remaining eight - wheel circles he could not increase the pace and Riikkonen cut the finish line into the fourth.
“Valtter had a difficult day, because he had a great success all the weekend, and when he was asked to spend me, he acted like a gentleman.
The team worked well and won two first places," Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body language
President Donald Trump, during his Saturday meeting with the people, anointed Senator Dianne Feinstein because of his perseverance of Christine Blasey Ford's letter, in which the candidate to the Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh was accused of sexual abuse.
While speaking in West Virginia, the President did not directly name for Ford's testimony to the Senate's Committee on Legal Affairs, but said that what is happening in the Senate showed that people are wicked, indecent and wrong.
“What could have happened and actually happened in recent days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people being angry, wicked, indecent and wrong,” he said.
“When you see official statements and leakages, and then you say: “Oh, I did not.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, are you married?
You remember her answer to the question, did she get the document off?
Not at all.
I didn't get married."
Well, wait a minute.
Whether we were run out...no, we didn't get out," he added, depicting the senator.
In July, Feinstein received a letter detailing Ford's accusations against Kavanaughu, who had been married earlier in September, but Feinstein denied that the letter had been run out of its office.
According to The Hill, the Feinstein Committee said: "I didn't hide Dr Ford's accusations and her history."
"She asked me to keep it secret, and I did as she asked."
However, the president did not agree with her denial, and he said at the meeting with the people on Saturday evening: “You know that it was really bad language.
Maybe she didn't get married, but it was the worst language I've ever seen."
In further defence of a candidate for Supreme Court judges accused of sexual abuse by three women, the President stated that democrats used the accusation for their own benefit.
"They are determined to recover their power by any appropriate means.
You can see indignity, indecentness; they don't care what they hurt or what they have to cross to get power and control," said the president's speech "Mediaite".
Elitium league: "Dundee Stars" 5:3 "Belfast Giants"
Patrick Dwyer has won two plays in the match with Dandi Club Giants
"Dundee Stars" has stunned for the defeat of Friday in the Elite League Belfast Giants and won the Saturday response match Dandi score at 5:3.
The Giant early went forward when Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauviller made two kicks.
Mike's Sullivan and Jordan Cownie's Cownie's score was the result of the return of Giants before Dwyer.
Franco Bouhard of Dandi's team agreed to the result, but later two victories of Lucas Lundwald Nielssen secured the victory.
The men of Adam Keefe have experienced a third defeat this season in the Elite League, before that on Friday night at Belfast, won the Dandi club with the result of 2:1.
It was the fourth team meeting this season, the three previous match winners won by Giants.
Dwyer first beat the fourth minute (3.35) after the transfer of Kendal McFaull, and four minutes later, Beauviller doubled his handover to David Rutherford.
In the difficult-start match Sullivan returned the arena hosts to the game, earning the counter 13:10, and after Matt Marquardto passed Cownie's ‐he levelled the score at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that Giants would leave for the first break at the beginning, and at the end of the first chair they won their second night victory.
With a quantitative overrun, the hosts of the square regrouped and Bouchard rebalanced the result of 27:37.
Cownie’s and Charles Corcoran have joined forces to help Nielsen in the first match to the Dandi team to break forward at the end of the second chair, and have established his victory by earning the fifth victory of the team in the middle of the last chair.
The Giants, who have lost four last matches from five, will meet Milton Keynes's team next Friday.
The flight manual died to help hundreds of aircraft passengers escape the earthquake
The Indonesian flight manual was published in a hero when it was killed by helping several hundred passengers to take their flight to the air safely.
More than 800 people died, and many are considered missing after Friday’s island of Sulawesi, a violent earthquake that caused the tsunami.
The area continues to shake strong, repeated underground shocks and many people trapped in the ruins of the city of Pala.
Although colleagues fled to save their lives, the 21st-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position in a highly volatile management tower at the Mutiaras Sis Al-Jufri airport.
He remained at his place of work to help the 6321 aircraft that had to fly “Batik Air” to take off safely, which was already on the runway.
Then, thinking that the flight control tower is falling, he jumped from it.
Later, he died in a hospital.
According to Australia’s ABC News, the Indonesian air navigation representative Yohannes Sirait claimed that his decision could save hundreds of lives.
We had a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimanne to a larger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Pala.
"We have this painful news," he added.
On the other hand, governments fear that the number of deaths may rise to thousands because the country’s disaster relief agency reports that cities in Dangala, Sigigo and Boutong are difficult to reach.
“The number of victims is expected to increase, as many victims are still under the ruins and we cannot reach them,” said the agency’s representative Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The city of Pala was destroyed by waves up to six feet [6 m] high, and there will be a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and supply supplies.
Risa Kusuma Sky News, a 35-year-old mother said: “Each minute, high-speed cars bring victims.
Clean water is missing.
All over the world, robbing self-service shops."
Janis Gelfandas, director of the International Red Cross of Indonesia, said: “The Indian Red Cross is urgent to help those who are survivors, but we do not know what we will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but the situation may get worse."
On Sunday, the President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, arrived at Pala and asked the army of the country: “Please all of you work day and night to accomplish all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" said CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was shaken by earthquakes in Lombarde, with more than 550 deaths.
The plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugin is now saying that one person is missing when the plane falls to the lagoon.
The flight that ended the flight in a Micronesia Pacific lagoon, which has operated airlines, now says that one person is missing, even though earlier stated that all 47 passengers and crew members were rescued from a sinking plane.
The Air Niugini report said that they had no knowledge of one passenger man on Saturday afternoon.
Airlines have indicated that they cooperate with local authorities, hospitals and researchers in seeking a man.
Airlines have not immediately responded to requests for more information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew when the plane, trying to land at the airport of Chuk Island, fell into the water.
On Friday, the officers announced that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airlines said that six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday, all of them stable.
It remains unclear why an accident occurred and what was the exact sequence of events.
Airlines and the U.S. Navy reported that the plane landed in the lagoon without reaching the runway.
Some of the accident witnesses believe that the plane has not been hit by a landing path.
The American passenger Bill Jayns said that the plane fell from very low.
"It was very good," said Jaynessa.
Jaynes said that in the sinking and lashing, he and others were able to reach the emergency exits.
He said that the flight satellites were panicd and shouted, and he himself suffered a slight injury to his head.
The U.S. navy reported that their sailors had repaired their nearby berths as well as rescued people who had been taken to shore by an inflatable boat before the plane went to a depth of about 30 feet [30 m].
According to the Air Safety Network, in the last two decades 111 people were killed in accidents of air carriers registered in New Guinea, but none of them were part of Air Niugini.
Analyst set out the night that a woman was burned alive, a sequence of events
The Public Prosecutor's Office presented the facts available on Saturday at the repeated case of a man who was accused of burning a live woman from Mississippi in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett witnessed several hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He wrote to the jury how he used the mobile phone records to connect the 29-year-old indicted Quintoon Telllis to the 19-year-old victims of Jessica Chambers in the night of death.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said that he got the location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chamber at her death evening, which contradicts earlier statements.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he was saying to be a friend of Michael Sanford, the police went to question Sanford.
Sanford told me his position on Saturday and showed me that there was no one in his city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Teller had told the truth, saying that he was on Sanford's truck that night, Sanford replied that he "saided because his truck was in Nashville."
The other coincidence was that Teller said he knew Chambers about two weeks when he died.
Mobile phone records show that they knew each other during the week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers died Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He took her out of his life," said Hale.
It is provided that the defence will begin to teach its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge claimed that the case would be handed over to the jury later on the same day.
The High Breed: Who is a conscious hippopot?
The Hiphop Trio wants to change the negative attitude towards this genre by spreading her music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol claims that hippo is away from the roots of political messages and draws attention to social problems.
They want to return to hippopotamus and once again popularize the conscious hippopotamus.
Artists like The Fuges and Common have recently reborn in UK such performers as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?
The New York educator sued the couple after they had been dismissed on account of the "resist" message
The New York educator brought a couple to court for dismissal on account of discrimination following receipt of a false address message from a mother complaining that she was "one more black".
The couple denied the existence of racists and called the action a "prediction".
The mother of two children, Lynseey Plasco-Flaxman, was upset to find out that the new childcare overseer Giselle Maurice was black when she arrived on the first working day in 2016.
“NEEEEEEE, DO ALL JUDODAY,” Mr Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to his husband.
However, twice she sent her to her husband, not to her husband, but to Mr Maurice.
According to New York Post, Plasco-Flaxman, who understood what had been done, was uncomfortable and dismissed by Mr Maurice, claiming that the previous nurse, who was an African American, had done her job badly and was expected to have a file in place.
Mr Maurice was paid for one working day and she was sent home by a Uber car.
Maurice has now sued the couple to court by claiming compensation for dismissal and is seeking to pay up even USD 350 a day for half a year's life and work at the customer's home, to which she was originally hired even without a contract.
"I want to show them that we cannot do such things," she said to Post on Friday, adding, "I know that this is discrimination."
The couple turned down to rejections of racism and claimed that the dismissal of Maurice was reasonable because they were afraid that they could not trust her after they offended her.
“ My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists", – husband Joel Plasz said "Post."
“ Would you believe your children to be rude to someone you had, although that was a mistake?
Your newborn?
I don't think."
Plasz said that his wife had a baby just two months ago and was in a very difficult situation.
You're trying to judge that?
This is not a very nice behavior," added an investment banking specialist.
While the trial was being conducted, the media were shocked to condemn two social networks, criticising their conduct and logic.
The new letter reveals that the publishers of Paddington were afraid that readers would not understand the meshshk
The daughter of Bondo, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It’s hard to feel in another place that reads the book for the first time before it was published.
Now it's very interesting to know what we know about Paddington's huge success."
Saying that her father, who worked as a BBC operator before finding inspiration to write a book about a twig bear for children, would not have been too upset if his work had been rejected, adding that the 60th year after his father’s death had been pleasant and sad.
Speaking of Paddington, which she describes as a “very important member of the family”, she added that her father was silently proud of his success.
"He was a pretty quiet man and didn't like drunkenness," she said.
“As Paddington was so like him, he felt like having a child who had achieved something, that you might be proud of him, even though it is not your job.
I think he had a similar appreciation for Paddington's success story.
Although it was his work and the fruit of his imagination, he always gave merit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her by phone
After her daughter landed, she was taken to the Nica Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, where doctors were unable to save her life.
“Nothing kept calling and said the condition really bad, not expecting it to survive,” said Mr. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I received a call from Nado, who called to say that she had had two minutes to live and had to say goodbye to her.
And I say goodbye.
I told her: “Tashi, dear, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
Doctors have been given medicines that support her heart beat, and they have stopped working slowly and left the body.
She died a little earlier and it was the end of everything.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing that all this was going on.
I couldn't fight, scream, or weep because I was in an environment surrounded by families and people.
I should have kept it in myself."
Finally, Mr Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving her daughter, went on a plane with other passengers who did not understand what a difficult test she had to face.
“No one knew,” she said.
“ My head was decapitated, and my tears continued.
It is difficult to explain why, but it was on the plane that I felt a great compassion for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Guilting women's posters aim to prevent suicides on bridges
Two women who have lost deadly loved ones try to prevent others from taking their lives off.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys distributes postcards with inspiring messages and phone numbers on the Wales Bridge, which allow people to call and call for help.
David Davis’s son, Tyler, was 13 when he was depressed and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any single father to feel the way I have to feel every day”, she said.
The 45-year-old Mr Davis, who lives in Lidney, said that her son was a promising chef, an outrageous smile.
“Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said his smile lit the room."
But he dropped his job before he died because he was “a real dark spot”.
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at that time, found his dead brother.
Mr Davis said: "I am afraid that a chain reaction can take place."
“ To make sure that there are people around you, you can talk to and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don't sit in silence, you have to talk."
Humphreys, a long-standing friend of Davies, lost his 15-year-old partner, Mark, who withdrew from life shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say that he felt depressed, depressed, and not complained to anyone,” she said.
“We noticed a change in his attitude several days before Christmas.
At Christmas time, the situation was totally bad: when the children had pulled out their gifts, he didn't look at them and responded to anything."
She said that his death was a great injury to them, but they have to overcome it: “In the family, it has been left empty.
It stunned our heart.
But we all have to live on and fight."

At the start of the study by the FBI, the future of Bretto Kavanaugh was suspended on the hair
I thought if we could actually get something that he asked for – a limited investigation of time and scope – maybe we would bring some unity", - said Mr Flake on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the committee was "bare" in the hard side.
Why did Mr Kavanaugh and his supporters of Republicans not want the FBI to launch the investigation?
Time alone is the reason for their opposition.
Until the mid-term elections on 6 November, only five weeks remain, and if the Republicans are expected to appear poorly, their efforts to elect the desired person to the highest court in the country will greatly weaken.
George Bush called to the senators, trying to convince them to support Mr Kavanaugh, who worked at the Bushui White House and met his wife, Ashley, former personal secretary of Bush.
What happens when the FBI submits his report?
A vote will take place in the Senate, which currently includes 51 Republican and 49 democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr Kavanaugh Senate can obtain 50 votes to allow Vice President Mike Pence to terminate the relationship and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
On the arrival of Kim, the number of deserters in North Korea "dezertries decreased"
The South Korean legislator said that the number of North Korean detectors to South Korea fell when Kim Jong-unas came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-Seugas, citing data from the Ministry of Association of South Korea, said that in the previous year there were 1 127 detectors, compared with 2 706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that the key factors were increased border controls at North Korea and China and increased human smuggling prices.
Pyongyang did not make any public comments.
Many deserters in North Korea are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that since the end of Korea’s war, more than 30 000 Koreans were illegally crossing the border in 1953.
Many fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross, than a heavily protected demilitized zone (DMZ) between both Korea.
China treats the deserters as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forced to return them to their homeland.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still fighting, have significantly improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pchenjane for the negotiations, which were centred on negotiations on the surrender of nuclear weapons.
This happened after the historic US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-uh meeting in Singapore in June, when both in principle agreed to make the Korean Peninsula a zone free of nuclear weapons.
However, on Saturday, Ri Yong-ho, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea, accused the US of not changing their sanctions since then.
"If there is no confidence in the US, we will not be able to trust our national security, and in such circumstances we will in no way be unilaterally disarmed by the first one," said Mr Ri, speaking in the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi Bretta Kavanaugh states that it is inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court
The leader of the minority in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called Britta Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, and said that he was not fit to serve at the Supreme Court for his temperament.
N. Pelosi made these comments during an interview at the Textile Tribune Festival in Austin (Texas).
"I can't really think that if a woman did so, she would be said to be hysterical," N. Pelosi said to show his response to the Senate's committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the accusation that he had committed sexual abuse against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when he was both teenagers.
During his introductory speech, when he spoke about family and high school times, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes in vain to cry out or overturn.
He also fully condemned the former democrats in the committee, by calling him the accusation of "a playful and coordinated destruction of reputation", which was not organised by the liberals who felt angry that Hillary Clinton lost the Presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi argued that the evidence provided by Mr Kavanaugh proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court because he revealed his biased attitude towards democrats.
“I think he disqualified himself by his statements and by attack of the Clinton and the Democratic Party,” she said.
The question was whether he wanted to remove Mr Kavanaugh, if his candidacy had been confirmed, and if his democrats had received a majority in the House of Representatives, Mr Pelosi objected.
"I will say yes – if he is lying to Congress or the FBI, not only in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he is now employed," N. Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge of the District Court of Colombia.
Mr Pelosi added that she was concerned as a democrat about the possible decisions of Mr Kavanaugh regarding the Accessible Law on Health or in the "Roe v Wade" case, because he was considered as a conservative judge.
During the approval sitting, Mr Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether certain decisions of the Supreme Court would be revoked.
“Now it’s not a time for us to say “How wonderful!” when a hysterical, partial personality becomes a judge, N. Pelosi said.
The power that women should use
It is a legitimate criticism, which is ultimately a stroke accumulated for months and even years, which it cannot express without tears.
"When we get angry, we cry," said Miss Stein. 45 years later.
"It doesn't seem unusual to me, but for you?"
She continued: “One woman, head of a company, helped me to know that she also weeps when she got angry, but she developed a certain method: When she was angry and weeped, she told the man with whom she was talking: ‘ You may seem to me to be sad because I am weeping.
Actually, I'm angry."
And she would just cry on.
It seemed genius to me."
The tears are regarded as an acceptable expression of anger, partly because they are generally misunderstood.
One of my most prominent memories is from one of the first jobs in the office where men worked, where I started to cry once because of the inexpressive anger.
“Never let them see you weeping,” said to me.
- They don't know you're crazy.
They think you're sad, so they'll be happy to overcome you."
A member of the Democratic Party Congress from Colorado Patricia Schroeder worked with the Gary Charter during his election campaign.
In 1987, when Mr Schroeder was caught on a ship that was a foreigner on board the Monkey Business (aphorism, which means an easy-to-use time) and withdrew his candidacy, Mr Schroeder concluded that there was no reason why he could not stand as Presidents himself.
“It wasn’t a well thought-out decision, ” said me laughing at me in 30 years.
– At that time, there were seven other candidates, so there was no need for another.
Someone called me "Neguole with seven dungons."
Lately, when the campaign started, there was little time to raise funds, so she swore to hold up her standing for two million dollars.
It was a bit like a fight.
She noticed that some of the supporters, at a cost of $1,000, would only have given her 250.
“Have they thought I was getting a discount?" she thought.
Speaking of a speech that announced the launch of a formal campaign, it was so covered by the emotional system of disappointment for those who supported appreciation, which made it extremely difficult to raise funds and reach voters, not representatives, and anger about sexism, that they do cry.
“You would have thought that I had a problem with nerves,” recalled Schroeder's press reaction to her speech.
- You would have thought I was supported by “Kleenex” servette business.
I remember thinking what would be recorded in my grave monument.

How the U.S. and Chinese generations of trade can be of benefit to Beijing
The first straw in the U.S.-China trade war was fueled, and although the battle has not yet been completed, experts say that strife may eventually be beneficial to Beijing.
U.S. President Donald Trump gave the first warning this year that he used to tax the main Chinese exports, including solar cells, steel and aluminium.
The most serious resistance took place this week, with the entry into force of new tariffs on goods worth $200 billion ($150 billion), i.e. half of China's exports to the US will in principle be taxed.
Beijing replied to all the measures at the same time – the latest decision provided between five and ten percent of the customs duty on American goods, with a total value of $60 billion.
China has promised to fight US teeth for teeth, and it seems that this second world market is not going to land in the near future.
Washington would only mitigate sanctions if China obeyed claims, but publicly bowing to the US would be too difficult for the Chinese President, Xi Jinping.
However, the experts claim that if Beijing properly attacks its party, the difficulties of the US trade war can eventually have a positive impact on China as it will reduce the interdependence of these markets.
"The fact that a sudden political solution in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that would lead to economic decline in both countries is indeed much more dangerous than observers have so far recognised," said Abigail Grace, an employee of the scientific institute "Asia in the New American Security Centre".
According to Syrian Minister for Foreign Affairs, the country is ready to receive returning refugees
Syria claims to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for assistance in reconstruction of a country that has been destroyed by war for more than seven years.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, the Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualham said that the conditions in the country are improving.
"The progress made in the fight against terrorism has made the area much more stable and safer," he said.
The authorities continue their efforts to rebuild the damaged areas of terrorism and to restore the normal situation.
All the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country which they had to leave as a result of terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions against daily life and well-being have already been put in place.
According to UN estimates, from the beginning of the war, Syria has left about 5.5 million Syrians in 2011.
Six million people in the country still need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualham said that the Syrian regime would gladly accept assistance in restoring the destroyed country.
However, it was also stressed that the country would not receive conditional support or assistance from countries supporting the uprising.
Europe's "Ryder" Cup victory in Paris
The European team, following the final result of the U.S. team 16,5:10.5, won the "Ryder" Cup in 2018 at the Le Golf National Square near Paris (France).
The USA has already lost in Europe for the sixth time in a row and has not won the Ryder Cup on this continent since 1993.
Europe has returned to the crown when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team collected 14.5 points, which was sufficient to defeat the United States.
The U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who was hard at all the time during the tournament, hit the opening floor straight into the water on the 16th well, 3rd night of the mache against Francesco Molinari.
Italian player F. Molinari got into the round and became one of the four players who achieved the result 5-0-0 since 1979, when the tournament acquired the current form.
The American Jordan St.pieth 5:4 was overcome by Thorbjornas Olesen, a member of the lowest ranking European team from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson 2:1 with the highest ranking worldwide lost English Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup tournament.
Spaniard Sergio Garcia has become the most successful European tournament player of the eighth "Ryder" Cup, collecting 25.5 points of career.
“I often cry, but today I can’t control myself.
It was a bad year.
I am very grateful to Mr Thomas for choosing me and for believing me.
I am very happy and very happy to get the cup back.
Everything depends on the team, and I'm glad I could help," said S. Garcia.
He sends his essay to John Ram, his homeland, who in the Sunday unit game 2:1 expressed himself to the U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods.
“I was incredibly proud of my victory over Tiger Woods – I grew up watching him play,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his match in France and now owns a record of the career of the "Rider" Cup 13-21-3.
It's strange statistics for one of the best players of all time who won the 14 biggest prizes and landed only to Jack Nickus.
The U.S. team was not able to hit the party all weekend, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showed a high level game throughout the tournament.
Capt. U.S. captain, Jim Furyk, after having shown a disappointing team, said: “I am proud of these men and they are fighting.
This morning, there was a moment when we began to force Europeans.
We shouted.
I'm on my hat before Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will regroup, I will work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
It's enough to bend your head.
Our opponents were superior."
