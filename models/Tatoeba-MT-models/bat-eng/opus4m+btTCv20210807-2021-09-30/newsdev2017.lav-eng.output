New Questions About California Water Supply Project
Critics and state legislators say they want to know in more detail about who pays for the $16 billion project backed by Governor Jerry Brown, according to a spokesman for the leading California Water Supply Authority, that the Brown administration offers government funding to complete the construction of two huge water tunnels.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
The initial cost of construction of tunnels in the amount of USD 248 million, which still needs to be authorised by the supervisory authority, has already started a federal audit study.
On Wednesday, the state legislators also ordered an audit of the state budget for the construction of tunnels.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
However, tunnel opponents and a group of taxpayers were critical on Thursday, and Assembly spokeswoman Susan Ega, one of the state legislators behind the audit ordered this week, asked the state for explanations on Thursday.
“It’s a game with toes,” said David Wolf, legal director of Howard Jersey Taxpayers’ Association.
In my opinion, this coincides with yesterday's audit (question): there are many more questions than answers.
The tunnel project has been approved by Browns and some politically influential water administrations and water consumers in Central and Southern California.
Supporters claim that tunnels will benefit the environment and provide more safe water supply for Californians.
Opponents argue that they are concerned that the state will use tunnels to divert too much water from the Sacramento River and the Gulf of San Francisco, causing damage to Northern California and further endangering local species.
Metropolises and other water administrations, which are expected to receive water from tunnels, still have to commit themselves to paying for them for their insecurity as to whether investing huge funds will actually bring enough water to pay off.
The same water supply authorities also announced this year that they will not pay for the completion of the current preparatory work unless the project first obtains the permission of the supervisory authority.
On Thursday, the monthly report on the tunnel project published by the Los Angeles Water Supply Authority states that “the State has indicated that additional funding for the completion of the planning phase will be allocated from the state budget or federal budget funds –
After all the local water supply authorities have spent on the project, including $63 million from his water supply management, “it is expected that the state will use public money to complete the planning,” said Bob Muir, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Water Supply Authority.
Next, he directed the questions to Vogel, a state spy.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
However, opponents of tunnel construction point to a regulatory framework issued in 2009, which, according to them, prevents the state from spending money on tunnel construction until the water supply authorities benefiting from it undertake payment obligations on them.
“The contracting entity has promised to pay for this project and has used financial tricks to circumvent these commitments,” said Patricia Šiferle, environmental consultant and long-standing opponent of the planned tunnels.
This raises questions about where this money was suddenly found.
Business Group on the Chinese Cyber Security Act
The coalition of international business groups has addressed China with a request to change the proposed cybersecurity rules by warning that they will harm trade and will insulate the country.
The letter to Chinese Prime Minister Li Kecyan has been signed by 46 groups from the US, Europe, Asia and Latin America, showing global concern that the rules could restrict or suspend access to the Chinese information security product market.
The signatories include the US Chamber of Commerce, the European Service Forum and groups from Japan, Korea and Mexico.
The proposed rules require suppliers to show the Chinese authorities how security products work and how information about Chinese citizens will be stored in the country.
The last letter, dated Wednesday, says that it could make data theft easier and reduce access to Chinese customers.
Chemical explosion in Tianjin: a year has passed since the tragedy
Zhang Mengfan claims that society deserves to know what happened in Tianjin.
China's leaders are planning silent memory events to commemorate the first anniversary of a large-scale chemical explosion involving 173 deaths, but not everyone agrees.
John Sadvort reports from Tianjin.
Almost anywhere else in the world, an anniversary of such a scale disaster would be a moment that the people remember and remember.
But not in China.
Although there is a memorial service in the city of Taichina for the memory of some dead firefighters, such memorial events are excluded elsewhere.
The media controlled by the Communist Party have been told what they can and cannot say, and some survivors, as well as the family members of the deceased, have been warned not to talk to the foreign press.
However, the 23-year-old Zhang Mengfan does not want to remain silent.
“This year, the public should somehow know what happened,” he tells me.
I don't want silence.
On August 12, last year, Zhang was a radio operator in the military fire brigade, just a mile from the epicenter of explosions.
“The call was received that evening at 22.53 p.m. and we started sending my teammates,” he said.
They could arrive within 10 minutes.
To clear the vast fire in the chemical warehouse also rushed teams from other parts of the city.
None of them drew attention to the fact that large quantities of volatile and toxic substances were illegally stored, well above the permitted levels and also without proper monitoring.
The fire started when it was allowed that the batch of nitrocellulose - chemicals used in nail varnishes - dries and then ignites in the summer storm.
Then it spread to a huge area - to 800 tons of ammonium nitrate fertilizer.
In the explosions, windows and firewalls were ejected, where Zhang Mengfan waited at the radio attack for news from the scene of the event, the roof was invaded.
This information was not received either.
“When I saw the mushroom cloud, I fell into despair,” he tells me.
I knew what it would mean for my friends.
Of the 26 firefighters of his unit, who were sent to the explosion site that night, eight never returned.
Many others suffered serious burns and other injuries.
The largest of the two major explosions was equal to the earthquake, and the wave of the explosion was felt many kilometers away.
The total loss is estimated at more than $1 billion, including more than 300 destroyed buildings.
In total, 173 people lost their lives, 104 of which were firefighters.
The deadly remains of eight people have not been found.
Official government investigative bodies are unequivocally guilty of corruption, political links and formal collusion, which led to circumvention of rules and disregard of security systems.
First of all, such a warehouse should under no circumstances be built near residential buildings.
More than 100 officials and representatives of the management of the company have been sued for a type of disciplinary or criminal investigation.
Thus, while the government can point to progress made - the thousands of homes gathered in order and the compensation of the population, these sensitive issues are still relevant.
The tragedy has revealed a gap in a system where rapid economic growth is a priority and the lack of independent supervision is a fact.
The courage of the evening and the feeling of duty are not questionable, and yet without a firefighter as a character of the hero, not a very pleasant picture opens up.
It contains a firefighter as a victim who has been sent without knowledge to fight a man-made disaster that could be prevented.
It’s not that I don’t know what to do, but that’s what I’m looking for.
He will bring a message to his heart about his dead members.
Most of all, I want to say to them, I have visited your parents and they are doing well.
Leave your parents to me.
I am now a member of your family.
I will fulfill your duties as sons.
The cold spring could affect the scaffolding season of the rubbing season
The Scottish rubbing season will begin later, because this year the number of birds has decreased due to cold weather.
In several properties, shooting is postponed, because many of the young rubies have not survived in the cold spring conditions.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
However, the OneKind Animal Protection Charity Foundation calls for the end of the \"brutal bird killing\"
The director of the organization, Harry Houston, said: “The work that is being invested in providing a large number of game birds for shooting is huge and undoubtedly includes some rather contentious activity.”
It is no surprise that society is avoiding this so-called sport and calls on the government to ban the cruel, unnecessary work that is enjoyed by only a very small part of the Scottish population.
Landowners both insist that they undertake to keep the number of birds and that the shooting of rubies is important for the development of the rural economy.
The president of the SGA, Alex Hogg, said that the industry provides 8,800 full-time jobs per year in the outermost regions and that it has been a “rich patch of work” in uncertain times.
He said: \"In comparison with many European countries, Scotland is not so deeply rooted in the culture of hunting, and some people do not even know how shooting seasons affect the country economically.\"
Howard said the number of jobs provided during the shooting exceeded the number of jobs created at the Edinburgh International Festival, the Frangge Festival, the Tattoo Festival and the New Year’s Eve celebrations together.
He added: \"The employment situation in Scotland is currently quite worrying, especially in the oil and gas sectors, so game operators and their families want to see the growth of the sector.
We want to work with the Scottish Government to make sure that hard-working people can rely on these jobs in the future.
It is also important to note that there is no risk of a serious injury to the body.
Many game operators admit that rubble shooting is not generally popular, but the SGA claims that the industry has \"have taken significant steps forward in terms of best practice\"
The Opening Day of the Ruby Shooting Season is traditionally known as the “Holy Twelve”
However, there is still a lot of discussion about this sport, and the management of rubble shooting sites is associated with persecution by some nature conservation authorities.
On Thursday, RSPB Scotland said that eight ringed gold eagles had disappeared in the Monadliaths, southeast of Inverness, in less than five years.
The Nature Conservation Charity Foundation considers that they have been illegally killed near rubbing places and their satellite bracelets have been destroyed.
Scottish Minister of Environment Rosanna Kaningema said the reports were “very alarming and sad.”
Mrs Kaningham asked officials to analyse evidence of about 90 surviving and missing eagles with transmitters to determine whether there is a trend in criminal activities.
The group of Scottish purees blamed the RSPB for trying to seduce the shooting sensations before the start of the rubbing season, as well as mentioned that there is no clear evidence that the birds would even have died in the vicinity of the Monadlita mountains.

Rio 2016: Fiji fans celebrate the victory of gold medals in Rugby-7
12-year-old boy to see the game, cut half a mile both sugar cane fields to the nearest TV
This is the first time I’ve been in the United States since the beginning of the last century.
Banks closed, shops closed and the celebrations took over Suvas streets, dancing, singing and gloating
Fiji won a gold medal at the Deodoro Stadium in the Rugby-7 final with 43-7 destroying Britain.
Thousands of people across the island nation stopped their usual work to watch the historic game.
Fiji celebrates the first Olympic medal in its history
Many fans were dressed in Fiji colors and rugby shirts, carrying a national flag and encouraging the team.
When the end of the game was shattered, the celebrates went on the streets, gleaming and dancing.
“Some people even on the streets of the people in Suva stopped their vehicles and joined Fiji’s flags for celebrations that would not address their minor congestion,” reports the Fiji Times.
The celebrations will continue over the weekend and next week.
Ireland: Finn Harps 0-5 Derry City
It’s a great way to make sure that you’re on the right track.
Derry City has risen to the second in the Premier League, gaining a persuasive victory with a score of 5-0 in the fight against Finn Harps.
Aron McKeneff put forward, under the leadership of a “sourcing dispute,” a successful implementation of two first-time penalty beats awarded for violations against Lucas Schubert.
It’s a great way to make sure that you’re on the right track.
Derry is for one point in front of Cork City, and both teams will meet in the crucial game Monday evening in Brendiwell.
It was Derry's first victory over his northwestern rivals in the highway, and they were disrupted by me on the HARPS side.
Makenef saved the match's opening beat in the 17th minute after Cyran Kola's march against Schubert, although the violation turned out to be outside the penalty area.
There was no doubt about the second blow of the penalty, with former Caramel stripper Barie Moloe putting Schubert down the ground and making Makenef score 2-0 in the third minute after the break.
It’s a great way to make sure that you’re on the right track.
It’s a great way to make sure that you’re getting the best possible results.
Schubert kicked the ball past Columbus before he broke out in the 83rd minute, and soon followed Varda’s smart rebound over the guard Richard Brass, a guard at the Harps Centre.
It was Derry's biggest victory in the race series and a great preparation for the closing game with Cork.
Test after mass unarranged tests at the University of Highlands and Islands (UHI) course at Inverness College
The entire course of 20 students could have gone through the highest media course test at the Inverness College UHI.
Most of them were 17- and 18-year-old students who hoped to use the mark they received in their studies to enter the university.
Inverness College UHI claims that quality assurance processes are applied, adding that the Scottish Qualification Authority (SQA) investigates the case.
It is also important to note that this is not the case in the United States, but in the United States.
Twenty students signed up for the course offered and evaluated by the Inverness College UHI.
Many of the students were young people living in rural areas who were studying online, but often had to go to Inverness College from their homes, such as Ločeibera.
It’s a great way to make sure that you’re getting the best results.
He told the BBC News Scotland live that about five more people who learned this course at Inverness College last year, and who were able to communicate with, said the same thing happened to them.
The situation means that his daughter cannot provide a place at Glasgow University, but she will be able to accept the offer of another university thanks to the qualifications acquired at school.
However, her father said there were others who attended a school-led media course that failed and were now “forgotten” and were unsure whether their course work would be reviewed and evaluated with a mark so that they could join universities.
Inverness College UHI is part of the University of Highlands and Islands.
Diana Rovlinsone, head and executive director of UHI at Inverness College, said: “Our exam results and student success are very important to us.”
This is also evidenced by the excellent report of Her Majesty’s Education Inspectorate (HMIE) this year, as well as the improved achievement levels both in further education and higher education compared to the previous year.
As every year, we carry out an overview of all published results, comparing them with those forecasted for each student.
In the case of this particular course, standard quality assurance measures were taken and the assessment body recently reported \"significant improvements in the performance and management of this assessment\" and confirmed that \"assessments were in line with national standards\"
SQA is currently investigating this case at our request.
SQA press secretary said: “We are pleased that the highest media evaluation of 2016 has been carried out as planned and that the candidates had the opportunity to show their understanding of the subject –
Many candidates have shown good performance and a slight increase in the A-C performance was observed compared to the same qualification last year.
It was developed according to previous and sample documents and according to our course and evaluation specifications.
Brothers put in prison for samurai sword-blood alcohol in Kilmarnock
Jason Braden was attacked by a samurai sword, knife and nunchak
Two brothers in prison for murdering a man with a samurai sword after drug-related theft in Airshire, which turned into a “blood alcohol.”
The victim Jason Briden (38) was struck several times at his home in Kilmarnock on 5 July 2015.
In the High Court in Glasgow, James Clark (36) will be sentenced to at least 22 years in prison after being convicted of murder.
His brother John (38) was sentenced to 10 years in prison after being sentenced to less severe charges of murder without prior intent.
By imposing a prison sentence on both men, Judge Bill Danlop told his brothers that they had committed “a cruel, cruel and wild attack.”
He rejected any assumption that Mr. Braiden had slept and waited for them, armed with a samurai sword.
Judge Danlops added: “You are planning to enter illegally with at least one knife and nunchaks.
Jason Bridden may have been a drug addict, but he was a son, father, and friend.
You slayed him.
After the incarceration of both men in prison, the criminal police inspector who led the investigation said: “The violent and terrible actions of John and James Clark have caused the death of Jason Bradden.
In such terrible circumstances, a heartbreaking situation must be experienced by the family at the age of 38.
The court heard earlier that the Kilmarnok brothers decided to kidnap Mr. Braden’s gold bracelet, which they had given him in exchange for drugs.
Both of them went under the influence of alcohol and drugs to his house, masked their faces with scarves and armed with a knife and an oriental fight for nunchaks.
It is believed that the sword used in the murder belonged to the deceased.
The neighbors said they saw Clarkes attacking Bradden when he sat on the sofa next to the window and heard him screaming.
Prosecutor Richard Godard said at the hearing: “The attack on this man was long-suffering, chaotic,
The murder site was then described as “blood alcohol.”
In addition to injuries from knife stitches, Braidens suffered a strong injury during the attack with a troll object.
Three days later, he died in Kilmarnoka Kroshaus hospital.
Both brothers did not recognize the murder.
By providing evidence, James Clark, who had previously been tried 38 times, including an attempt to murder, said: \"I didn't want that. It was an accident.\"
John Clark, who has been previously tried 23 times, said he was only involved to help a brother who, according to him, was attacked by Bradden.
Man sentenced to prison for shaking and killing his infant's son
David Sinkler admitted to murdering his child at his home in 2012 in Realkill Broadcast.
The man who searched and killed his baby's children in an outbreak because he did not want to eat was sentenced to seven years and three months in prison.
David Sinkler shook four-month-old Joshua when he lost control of his home in Real Kingdom, South Lancashire, on December 6, 2012.
The cause of death was found only after forensic medical examination.
Sinkler (34) was initially charged with murder, but was found guilty of murder without prior intent.
In the Glasgow High Court, ordering him to be sentenced to prison, Judge Lord Breiseidl Sinkler said: \"You attacked your infant's son by shaking him, causing injuries from which he died.\"
When you searched for him, you had to know it, but you did not discover it.
Only after a thorough medical examination do you recognize what has been done.
Your wife believed you.
Now she feels transferred and can no longer support you.
Lord Breiseidl described the consequences of Joshua’s death as “catastrophic” to everyone and added: “Nothing will return Joshua back again.”
The court had previously found that on the day the child died, Sinkler and his wife, Kirsty, had gone to swim with Joshua and shop in Realkiller.
17.30 Kirsty Sinklere went to meet her mother and sister.
Only 11 minutes later, she was called by Sinkler, who sounded “shocked.”
He said to her, \"Joshua doesn't breathe like he's coming, come home immediately.\"
Then he finished the conversation and called 999.
The baby was immediately taken to the Hermair Hospital, where he died.
At first, Joshua’s cause of death was not clear, but he was looked at by a team of forensic experts who found the consequences of injuries in the eyes and brain shortly before death, and such injuries were not possible by chance.
One of the experts, Dr. Peter Richard, a child neurosurgeon at John Redcliffe Hospital in Oxford, said: “This has happened because the child has been shaken and thus suffered injuries, and has been hit with greater strength than it is on a daily basis.”
The defense spokesman, Jan Djugid, told the court that Sinkler had “extremely regretted” what had been done.
Rio Olympics 2016: Hloy Tatone threatens position of Julia Jefimova

“I would have liked them to be perfectly clean games,” said a 20-year-old Welsh swimmer.
I didn't know who was there.
I'm not happy with it, but that's what it is.
This is the first time I’ve been in the United States since the beginning of the 20th century.
I don't want to see people get out of sports, but I don't think it's really right.

It’s a great way to make sure that you’re getting the best results.
China representative Jinling This was at the bronze, just about six hundredths of a second ahead of the fourth single remaining Tatoni.
She was a member of her British team, 20-year-old Molly Renshaw, who finished sixth.
“The fourth place is a bit of disappointment, no matter what’s ahead of you,” Tatone added.
This is a great experience, and I am a little disappointed about the fourth place.
I'm so close to the medal, and it would have been a dream.
However, the meeting itself in the final is a great experience, which I will take with me for the next few years.
It was a little disappointment, but in the long run it will make me strong, and it makes me increasingly strive for a medal, so hopefully next time I will be closer to it.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
“Everyone should be given a second chance,” Jefimova.
Jefimova, who said she was already tired of answering questions about her doping past, defended her right to start Rio.
In 2013, she was banned for 16 months after finding an anabolic steroid in her body.
The Sports Arbitration Court (CAS) ruled that athletes cannot be denied participation in Rio games because they have been subject to sanctions in advance.
CAS dealt with my complaint and I won.
If someone does not like it and someone has a different opinion, they can turn to CAS, she explained.
I do not support doping, and I have never used it.
In the second case, it was certainly not my fault.
Each person should be given a second chance.
When you drive and give you a receipt of punishment, no one puts you in prison.

Your delegation is shameless and rude
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
However, he and his large company apparently have provoked anger from the organizers of the Olympic Games due to their uncontrollable behavior, retrying to break up to the competition zones without proper accreditation and rude response, being tested, according to the Indian news agency Press Trust of India.
Vijay Goel, photographed in July, justifies his behavior.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
“We have received several reports that your sports minister has tried to enter accredited competition zones with non-accredited individuals,” said Sarah Peterson, the continental manager of Rio 2016’s Organizing Committee.
When the staff tried to explain that this was not allowed, the people with ministers became aggressive and rude, and sometimes they missed our staff.
“If our protocol team becomes aware of any other cases of such behavior, your sports minister’s accreditation will be cancelled and his privileges in the Olympic Games will be cancelled,” the letter said.
The leader of the Indian delegation called the case “a blue elephant blown out of the flies,” and Goel himself said he had done nothing wrong with writing it all out as “a misunderstanding.”
He tweeted: “As far as I know, we have complied with all the rules.
We maintain the spirit of the Olympic Games and support our Indian athletes.
It’s not that I don’t know what I’m going to do.
This is the first time I’ve ever been in the United States since I was a kid.
A number of successful candidates have already been excluded, including shooter Abhinav Bindra, who won a gold medal in Beijing in 2008.
This time he remained fourth.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
However, there are still some bright expectations, because there will still be competitions in boxing, golf, tennis, athletics and, yes, badminton.
The only Indian gymnast, Dips Karmakara, will compete in the jump finals on Sunday, showing his terrible double-speed “Death Jump – Produnov’s jump, which has been tried by just a few other gymnasts.
The low number of medals won by India has always been the cause of indignation in a country with 1.25 billion people.
Analysts say that there are many reasons for this.
The National Passion is a cricket, which is not an Olympic sport.
India has not invested heavily in infrastructure and Olympic training - Carmacar's first exercise tool was made from spare parts for an old scooter.
Parents have always stressed the superiority of academic knowledge in sport.
And the authorities responsible for sport have been taken over by corruption.
The International Olympic Committee has suspended the Indian Olympic Association for violation of its statutes in 2012 as it elected the leaders against whom criminal cases were initiated.
In Sochi, three Indian Winter Olympics participants were even denied to represent their country, carry a flag or wear anything with national symbols.
They competed as independent athletes.
When people are injured, the jets on the Boston-Sacramento route are forced to land in South Dakota.

The flight from Boston to Sacramento landed in Rapid City, South Dakota, shortly before 19:30 a.m. at local time.
The airline said the injured were taken to the hospital for inspection.
JetBlue claims that it has sent personnel to help the wounded, a spare plane has flew to Rapidstia to deliver the rest of the passengers to Sacramento.
The drug control agency (DEA) misses the opportunity for medical marijuana
The answer is, unfortunately, unlikely.
This is a lost opportunity, which may further delay the provision of treatment to countless people.
To date, there is only one federally approved source of medical marijuana for scientific purposes at the University of Mississippi.
In the most seemingly positive news today, DEA also announced that it will now allow other places to apply for permission to do the same.
There is hope that the volumes and diversity of marijuana available for scientific purposes could expand.
Although it will attract attention as an emphasis on research, it will be largely symbolic, because no matter how much marijuana is available, if access to it is still difficult, it does not matter much.
Imagine a product that is very in demand, but is stored behind closed doors.
In response to the demand for goods, someone makes a difficult-to-understand decision to produce it more, but to be and never turn the door off.
This product is a marijuana and its location on list 1 is this locked door.
In such an unpleasant situation, there is a medical marijuana.
As marijuana is a substance on List 1 (i.e. by definition it does not currently have an approved medical application and has a high potential for its use for unforeseen purposes), there are significant barriers to door shutdown.
Potential researchers usually first turn to DEA because it grants authorisation to launch scientific research.
Even if a permit for the study of substances on List 1 is issued, institutions must comply with very strict safety rules and install high-level safety systems, which may be costly.
There is also the most subjective consideration of obtaining authorisation from its academic institution to carry out first and foremost research on substances included in List 1.
Even if individual faculty representatives wish to conduct this study, university management may not want problems or potential side-by-side results due to negative press reports.
This was the case at the University of Arizona when Dr. Sushi Sisley was released from office after an effort to advance medical marijuana trials.
In the end, Sisley had to look for private funding for her project, and only in April, seven years after the initial project was initiated, her project became the first DEA-approved medical marijuana trial for the prevention of posttraumatic stress for veterans.
It’s been a long time since I’ve been here for a while now.
It is currently the largest federal financer of marijuana research and is the sole supplier of marijuana itself.
Even if more medical research goes into free circulation, the Institute will still have to approve all of its funded studies.
However, the problem lies in its name, \"abuse\",
Dr. Donald Eibram, a representative of the University of San Francisco, interviewed for his documentary Marijuana, says that the main task of the institute is to study substances in the context of their potential dependence rather than as medicines.
Eibram draws attention to an important fact.
Even if the study overcomes all of the barriers listed above, the door may still be closed if the intention is to study the benefits of medical marijuana rather than the damage it causes.
In a quick (and, admittedly, non-scientific) search for medical marijuana in the U.S. National Library of Medicine, 1,434 works were found on medical marijuana during the last five years.
In the same search, only 57 works were for the benefits of medical marijuana.
Most of the studies involved marijuana-related harm, e.g. “Bad trip due to the anticholinergic effects of marijuana” “Marijuana-induced pancreatitis” and “Marijuana use and risk of lung cancer”
Such a disproportionality creates a completely distorted picture.
The road to the use of medical marijuana is paved with surprises and hypocrisy wherever the view opens.
As long as DEA goes on list 1, despite its medical effect, the U.S. Department of Health and Social Affairs keeps a cannabionide patent for large-scale medical purposes at the same time.
The DEA continues to identify marijuana alongside heroin and LSD as a drug with a potential for high dependence, even though DEA’s chief administrative judge, Francis Yang, opposed it.
Strictly medically, marijuana is safer than many commonly consumed foods.
For example, bypassing 10 fresh potatoes can cause toxic reactions.
In comparison, it is physically impossible to eat as much marijuana as possible to die.
Marijuana in its natural form is one of the safest therapeutic active substances known to mankind.
In a rational analysis, marijuana can be safely used in medical treatment under appropriate supervision.
It should be said once again that this was proposed by the DEA judge himself.
And yet, almost 30 years later, little has changed.
Whether we are aware of it or not, we all take some dosage of hypocrisy in our daily lives.
Maybe we don't always have the energy to express it loudly, or we're so dumb or stunned that nobody seems to have noticed it.
As far as hypocrisy is concerned in the context of federal medical marijuana policy, there must be strength to present the facts in a persistent manner.
Patients’ lives, such as Charlotte Fiji, whose attacks are reduced by using medical marijuana, depend on the lives of many others.
On the fact that the plant can bring so much benefit and still stay behind closed doors, it is worth talking to a higher level.
Bloody Beetroots: Donalds Tramps-Blondais Berlusconi
Bloody Beetroots is known in the context of electronic dance music
Musicians say that Trump dominates media like Berlusconi
You know, we're used to Berlusconi in Italy, and I think Trump looks like a blonde Berlusconi,\" said CNN, founder of the electronic music punk association The Bloody Beetroots.
The candidate of the Republican President and the Italian media tycoon, both known for their exaggerated personalities, their ability to attract the attention of the press and the media of transformed stories.
“Bloody Beetroots – Rifo is known for its electronic dance music and has collaborated with a variety of artists, from legendary Sir Paul McCartney to electropope singer Greta Svabo Beču in the 2013 song Chronicles of a Fallen Love.
Rifo was born in the Italian city of Basano del Grapa, near Venice, in 1977, which coincides with the time of the punk, and the numbers 1977 are tattooed on the chest of a musician.
“English is not my mother tongue, so I don’t understand everything about your world,” Rifo said, hiding behind the black fee he’s known for.
I'm trying to explore and I'm trying to improve my understanding of your culture.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
The documentary is about how “Berlusconi made Italy crazy,” Rifo said, adding that Trump had a similar impact on America.
“You see how a person can completely turn around the system and fold everything... by himself,” he said.
In my opinion, Trump is not good for this country.
Two Turkish sailors in prison for more than £500 million in drugs
Two Turkish men have been convicted of smuggling cocaine worth more than £500 million on a ship in the North Sea, each sentenced to at least 20 years in prison.
Mamin Sahin and Emin Ozman were found guilty of a trial in the High Court in Glasgow after about 100 miles from the coast of Aberdeen had been found on MV Hamal’s deck three tons of A-grade drugs.
Detention in 2015 is the largest cocaine cargo that has ever been detained at sea in Europe.
Mamin Sahin and Emin Ozmen sentenced to prison for his role in large-scale drug trafficking
The drug cargo found on board is one of the largest in British history.
The drugs were found hidden in a specially equipped hiding place on a tug that was registered in Tanzania, which sailed from Istanbul to Tenerife and then to the North Sea.
It was stopped by the British Navy's frigate-HMS Somerset- and border force cutter-HMC Valiant-
Sahin (47) was sentenced to 22 years, but Ozmen (51) is sentenced to 20 years in Glasgow Supreme Court.
Judge Lord Kinkleiven said to the men that the amount of drugs was \"not only significant, but large - and drug trafficking has a \"destructive effect\" on people and the surrounding society.
He said: \"You were involved in the most commercially ambitious operation, including the ship-to-ship transportation of cocaine, in an operation that crossed international and truly intercontinental borders.
He said Captain Sahin was not “a drug at the top of the tree,” but he played an important role in the crime, while Captain Ozmen’s role was “somehow smaller.”
The inspectors climbed the Hamal board, following the conductive information from the French customs office, DNAED, and when it got into Aberdeen, they drilled through a steel plate, accessing a secret compartment where 128 ligaments with a weight of 3.2 tons were found, with an approximate value of 512 million pounds of arrows on the black market.
“MV Hamal – last year was checked by the Royal Navy.
There were three tons of cocaine on board.
Checking the vessel found that its ballast tanks contain tons of Class A drugs
The ship was on its way from the Bosphorus Strait to South America before it was stopped in the North Sea.
Access to this place was opened under the closet in one of the crew rooms, and the gap was cemented.
Sahin and Ozmen were found guilty of carrying and hiding cocaine on board between 20 February and 23 April last year and of supplying cocaine between 21 April and 23 April.
Both previously unpunished men who have worked in the shipping industry since leaving school continue to argue that they are not guilty, but take the oath.
Complaints against four other men lack evidence.
Sahina’s lawyer Jonathan Krov said the father of two children was a “glorified mule.”
He said, \"Someone who was involved in drug trafficking\"
Someone who was able to drive the ship.
Looking after the drug hierarchy, Sahin is certainly not a drug at the top of the tree, but somewhere below.
The huge amount of cocaine on board means that it had to be moved by a road crane.
Police went through the entire ship for days before the drugs were divided into these boxes.
Sahina asked questions about the work of his master to Hamal in February 2015, the court heard.
Mr. Krav said it was \"shocked\" about missing important events of his daughter (9) and son (13) and \"just want to go back to Turkey\"
Both men have not seen their families since the arrest in April 2015, because families are still struggling to obtain a visa confirmation.
Ozmen's lawyer Di Mūrs said he \"unfortunately\" wants to see his family, but knows that in a transparent future it \"will not be possible\"
Speaking after today's judgments, Scotland's prosecutor David Harvey said: \"International drug trafficking has no borders, and we, whose task is to destroy it, are working increasingly closely together to make us one step ahead.
“Scotland’s success in the prosecution of criminals is indeed at global level, and in this case we have caused significant economic damage to the representatives of organised crime.”
The drugs were stacked in all gaps on the board, including under the floors.
This smuggled parcel inspectors found a hidden ship in the laundry room
Mr Harvey added: \"Hamal was identified by intelligence from the French authorities, and after rapid cooperation with the Prosecutor General of Tanzania, where the ship was registered, who also allowed to board the ship.
“Our investigation then came from Guiana, which provided access to essential data on shipments, to Spain, which provided us with very valuable information about the ship’s stops in the Canary Islands.
We also worked together with our colleagues in Denmark, Norway and the USA to bring together specific elements of evidence.
Despite the thorough intelligence that Hamal is carrying a large amount of drugs, British authorities could not climb into international waters without the approval of the Tanzanian government - something they had never given before.
Sju Peiten, Head of the International Court of Justice and the Fight against Organized Crime of the Royal Prosecutor’s Office of Criminal Cases (CPS), said: “By acting quickly and accurately, the CPS Criminal Law Advisor managed to obtain permission from the Tanzanian authorities to board the ship within 24 hours of receiving intelligence.
According to international maritime law, British officials are not entitled to board a ship under the flag of another State in international waters unless that State grants special legal permission to do so.
Without the swift action of our criminal counsel, there would be a high risk that the ship could escape and that we would never be able to bring these people to justice.

Photographer Brian Romeijn took photos of this abandoned train from Rotterdam in Belgium
The images show the rusting inside of the train, the broken seats, the dust-covered windows and the narrow driver’s cab
It has already been named as the Eastern Expresent wagon, but it belonged to the Belgian national railway company
The city explorer has taken these remarkable photographs of the demise of the remnants of a passenger train that has once been one of the best forms of movement.
Its flower times have long since passed,and the train wagon and locomotives have been left in a rotten train deposit in Belgium, where they have become a popular object of sight for photographers and adventurers.
Photographer Brian Romeijn, 40, has taken these terrible photos showing the rusting inside of the train, broken seats, dust-covered windows and the compressed driver’s cab
The train wagon and the locomotives have been left to blow the train's deposit in Belgium, where they have become a popular sightseeing destination for photographers and adventurers.
These trains were a symbol of luxury when they operated under the legendary name from 1883 to 2009.
The Belgian national railway company used locomotives some 50 years ago.
After 126 years on the rails, the last train, which operated under the name of the Eastern Express, went from Strasbourg to Vienna in December 2009, ending the famous stage of history.
The Eastern expression was famous for the route Paris - Istanbul.
When it was launched in 1883, La Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits was known as “Express d’Orient”
It became the expression of the East in 1891 and until the 1930s it already had regular routes throughout Europe.
It should not be confused with private Venice Simpson-Orient-Express
There are very few “Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits” luxury wagons left.
In the narrow driver's cab in which the equipment is rusted, which is shown in this photo, measuring instruments and open wires are still installed
He said the driver’s cab was “in its own way claustrophobic, and the noise of the locomotives was probably unbearable.”
The abandoned locomotives and the wagon have become a popular object of sight for photographers and adventurers.
After visiting the forgotten train in Belgium, Romeindzh MailOnlineTravel said: “I could really feel how it was used in its flower times.”
It is important to note that this is not the case.
Makeup artist Katrina Gelvoy turned into a series “Arrested Development” in Baster Blut
Thanks to her impressive makeup skills, sights and transformations, Texasian and YouTube censone Ketlina Gelvoy have met with the fan army.
However, her recent transformations into Blūta from Arrested Development are quite incredible by any standards.
In a three-minute video uploaded to her Kiki G YouTube channel, Gelova slowly and continuously turns herself into a failed image with a hook in the hand.
She even at the end of the clip uses some audio from the show in a terrible, but at the same time excellent performance.
A talented makeup artist starts her video in her image of a blond woman.
Then, with slowed-down photographs, she slowly turns into a eye-catching-memmed, who is already back on his hair, and who is Tony Heil Blout.
Gelovey does this with colored contact lenses, shading and pulling contours around the nose and eyes, as well as drawing the Baster's face on his head.
Intelligent techniques: with the smart use of the slowed-down photo, she slowly turns into Tony Heil Blūta.
In the course of her video, she also takes over the personality and manners of the cult TV image, drawing the chin accordingly.
The video posted on YouTube has been viewed more than 45,000 times, and very quickly the famous comments of the makeup artist's skills appeared:
\"You're extremely talented,\" someone wrote the video under Gelovay.
In her video, she also takes over the personality and manners of the cult TV image
“I like how you stay in the image when you do it,” added someone else.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
She told her YouTube followers that she hoped in the future to create makeup transformations every week.

In Lancashire, the father is expelled from the children's school for wearing a T-shirt with a lamas name
The father of two children was expelled from the children's school for the arrival on their sports day in the T-shirt with an offensive inscription.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
However, despite the fact that when he noticed his mycelium and wore a T-shirt on the contrary, the next day he found that he was forbidden to enter the school territory.
The only father who has been working for four years as the manager of the Park primary school in Kolne, Babel, could not come after children because of the ban, and the staff even called social services and police.
This is the first time I’ve ever been in the United States since the beginning of the 20th century.
Mr. Bernley accuses school director Sarah Migley of being too sharp to react.
He says that he is unreasonably punished for the fact that before going to watch his two children's race, he made mistakes in haste to wear a T-shirt.
The father, who no longer works as a schoolmaster, said: \"It was a mistake and inattention from my side -
I don't think about sports day and rush when I wear it.
At the close of the event, we had a father's competition, and the director noticed my T-shirt and said it was not appropriate.
I apologized and cut it out on the other side, and with that too, the thing ended.
However, a 36-year-old man said he had received a letter from the head of school that night, where he was invited to a meeting with the director the next day, but he did not see the need to do so because he had already apologized.
“Then the school director called me and said I was banned from entering school,” Mr. Bernley added.
I learned that after the sports day, some parents on Facebook had rebelled over it and that many people were interested in it.
Any contemporaneous person would say that it is exaggerated.
Mr Macbeth, who is editor of the online magazine Love Mini, said that, in his opinion, he could not even come after children on the last day of the semester because of the ban.
However, this was the reason for the call from the school and social services.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
He said, \"I told them that I was not there because I was forbidden to go to school.
Then I was called from the social services and asked why I was not behind my daughter.
The school also called the police, because I had not come after my daughter for about 40 minutes.
Mr Makbet claims that he was told that he could no longer come to school and that the ban would remain in force until further statements.
He also said that he was warned that he could be fined £500 if caught in violation of this rule.
Sarah Migley, director of the Park Primary School, said that this case is now over.
Sarah Migley, Director of the Park Primary School, said: \"I can confirm that Mr. Macbeth has resigned and is no longer the head of our school.
This is now over, and I hope to return to normal school life in September.
It is also important to note that this is not the case in the United States, but in the United States.
“We all have to bear in mind that when taking on positions such as an advisor or manager, you are subject to higher standards, and unfortunately, this time he did not meet these standards,” he said.
It’s not easy to find a way out of this situation.
Mr. Nixon added: “Such a T-shirt was silly, and he apologized for it too.”
The Lancashire police confirmed that they had been called from school, but they did not come.
In the past, the premises of the former factory VEF, located on Brīvības street, have been renovated - several IT companies are located there, the industry has already started to call this area the local Silicon Valley.
The rest of the VEF area, including Berzaune, is also developing.

The procurement shall take the form of a negotiated procedure without prior publication of a contract notice.
The contract will be concluded with the joint venture LNK Industries group, which has committed to perform these works for 21 186 560 euros.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
The building of the Science Centre is similar, according to the type of main activity to be carried out in it, to the building of the Academic Centre for Natural Sciences, designed and built on the 1st stage, and to the activity to be carried out therein, which, in terms of the most important technical and technological parameters, as well as the number of scientific and academic staff and students in the building, is similar.
The Sketch Project developed by SIA Sixth Style was attached to the competition regulation, with which all potential suppliers were provided with information about the development vision of the Academic Centre of the University of Latvia in Torņkalns, including the planned list of objects of the Academic Centre of the University of Latvia, which indicates the name of each particular object, the estimated area of the object, the planned year of commissioning of the object and other information.
At the end of 2015 SIA Sixth style performed meta-correction of the territory of the previously developed building complex of the Academic Centre of the University of Latvia in Torņakalns, which resulted in clarification of the location of the Academic Centre buildings and their interlinking, as well as transport organization in the territory of the meta and its surroundings.
The competition for mowing grass in the lanes of the road partitions shall be excluded.
It’s a great way to make sure that you don’t have to worry about your health.
The subject of procurement is divided into 9 lots: Aluksne, Daugavpils, Jēkabpils, Jelgava, Rezekne, Valmiera, Talsi and Riga road districts.
Applicants may submit an offer for one or more lots.
Cutting the grass into the lanes of the road compartments is necessary to improve the transparency of the roads and their adjoining areas for drivers, to promote water separation from the road, as well as to limit the movement of the drug and the formation of a melt.
The most important grass mowing works for farmers are planned in the Talsi road district for a total of 28 roads of 637 hiking kilometres, in the Valmiera road area for 20 roads of 432 hiking kilometres, and in Alūksne for 17 roads of 384 hiking kilometres.
In June, the company completed the lawn mower work on the main and most important regional paved roads of the country, but on the smaller regional roads and on the local roads, the Latvian road operator planned to entrust some of the mowing work to farmers.
“It is an opportunity for us to make more effective use of the funds allocated to road maintenance activities, while at the same time enabling farmers to load the machinery in full and earn it,” said Vladimir Kononov, Chairman of the Board of the Latvian Road Carrier of the SJSC.
The deadline for the submission of tenders is 22 August.

He noted, however, that in this case, additional funding for health care should be discussed, because this is currently insufficient.
Janson also stressed that any demagogue on compulsory health insurance, which would impose a direct and high payment burden on the population, did not pass any criticism, especially when calling the Dutch model.
This is the first time I’ve been in the United States since the beginning of the 20th century.

This is why the Ministry of Health has developed a plan and submitted a request for an additional EUR 41 million in healthcare to reduce the lines to specialists and to examinations.
“The question of priorities is whether it will have the means or not,” said Čakša.
This amount, however, does not include an increase in wages for medical practitioners.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
It is also important to note that when driving all three models, it is possible to clearly show that Latvia is not ready to impose an additional burden on the population.
It is also important to note that this is not the case in the United States, but in the United States.
In addition, the Ministry has indicated that the best option of the health care financing model will be chosen as a result of discussions until the end of September.
Local watermelons are ready.

Watermelons are already available on the Liepaja market.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
“This year watermelon grows better than last year,” says the grower of large berries in Rucava district Artis Kūsis.
In terms of weather conditions, this is also a much more favorable summer than the previous one, when it was cold and windy.

The director's composition was designed as a peculiar portrait gallery, giving equal importance to every image of the play, so each of them is both a center and a background.
The show consists of several mini-shows, which end up joining together in a single whole.
It is an observation of human nature, where the main conflict is between true emotions and cold calculation, brightly revealing how a person changes in different situations - each of the heroes is sometimes a wolf who, because of greed and his own benefit, crashes surrounding, sometimes a sheep, which is broken by someone else.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
This is not a sad story, but a humorous story about how an elevator becomes the only friend of a person.
Despite the stylist of the cemetery, which dominates the visual image of the performance, the dominant intonation of the scene is nevertheless bright and even optimistic.
“The man who escapes from the elevator is not the decision of loneliness and old age, but the fact that life is worth loving.

Detective Olga: my work is not serial, but real life.
I have been waiting halfway for Olga Zelika - owner and investigator of the Riga Detective Agency.
She laughs loudly and leaves a very positive impression on a person.
Wearing white trousers and a white jacket - a very elegant woman that overtakes all my ideas about what a woman-detective should be.
She is expecting me with a champagne, from whom I will kindly refuse.
I tell you that I am speaking to her because it seemed interesting to me that a woman is doing such an unusual thing.
It has always been the work of men.
Olga has higher legal education - master's degree.
He worked at the criminal police.
You know that you want something for yourself and you set up your own company.
I've got enough knowledge of it.
“I didn’t really want to go back to politics,” Olga says.
It's routine.
There, in the criminal police, we investigated the cases, collected information.
We work with suspects.
\"This year we celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Riga Detective Agency \"
She invites to the anniversary celebration: \"There will be no drinking\"
All are promised people.
Asked about her business, Olga says: “Business is very specific –
For the first five years, I had a team.
After that, I realized that working in a team is sometimes dangerous.
It is such a business that if someone does not work professionally, they can get into a very bad situation.
If journalists are the fifth power, then we are the second.
The sphere is, of course, not simple.
Many try to get us in because of the cheating of our mates.
People think so already!
Many come and ask whether hearing equipment can be put, attract dogs.
Many have seen movies.
The business of detectives is serious.
“It’s the collection of information, Olga tells.
If a crime is committed by law, I must warn about it.
We cook green tea and laugh - so that there is at least a cup to stick to and make conversations.
I've had a client whose husband has been in constant trouble.
She was looking for protection, of course.
We also have a security guard.
Her husband was a maniac.
At first everything is always beautiful and good, but then begins.
“This is the most terrible thing,” Olga says.
Psihe is broken, and it happens that you can be treated like a animal.
This can end badly.
Do not give God, with suicide.
It's very dangerous.
People become victims at some point.
“Many women are trying to get away from their families and then come back again,” she says.
I refused from the last order.
“It happened for the first time in my life,” says Olga.
There was such a strange situation.
The woman was married, and she had a son.
“His husband beat his son and made him a disabled person, Olga remembers.
I believe that a woman has a motherly instinct and, first of all, should protect her children.
When all this happened, she came to me with a request to be free from that man.
There are people who are obsessed with revenge.
The most terrible thing is that the mother turned her eyes on it.
I can't understand that.
Her child is now disabled.
We once could not find the body, and the dog helped very much.
The drug department at all without dogs can not do.
\"I understand that there are adequate people and there are those who do not have a healthy psyche - she says.
Of course, the facts of fraud are up to date.
Or in the family there is a divorce, and information must be collected.
It is clear who the guilty party is.
The last thing I have had was a topic when my girlfriends have deceived other girlfriends.
It's interesting, because once men smash, now - women.
Even the best friends are fighting!
Women's girlfriends for 100 or more thousand euros.
Women need to be careful when going abroad, because they can be sold in slavery.
“Latvian women are intelligent and trusted too much,” Olga believes.
There have been times when couples go abroad to get married a second time.
It is not legal.
Olga tells us that she had a husband who was like Jesus Christ.
Long, long hair.
When I was 22 years old, there was a tragedy.
He had a severe head injury.
He returned as a completely different person.
\"I pulled him out, Olga remembers.
It can be compared to hell, it was terrible.
Asked what is the most unusual thing you have encountered, Olga says: “Everything is special, but the worst thing is where trust is used.”
When a friend throws up, a friend.
Borrows and does not return the money.
If you have a lawyer’s education and experience in the police, you can work as a detective.
“One thing is to feel like a detective, the other is to be,” Olga says.
The situation in which we deal with things of distrust is quite crazy, because women are often not ready to solve the situation.
They are not ready to accept the result.
This is an unpredictable situation, because a person is not ready to lose his family.
Not every woman is ready to accept reality.
Often young girls who feel the taste of money use rich married men.
One man who tracked his wife said that she could not have a favorite, because all the wives cheated on him.
“He was married three times, Olga remembers.
This is a man’s problem if all his wives cheat on him.
Olga tells of a woman who left her husband with all her children, and she asked him if he had ever raised his hand against him.
In general, I constantly beat him, he replied.
In such cases, I refuse to work.
It seems interesting to me how things are resolved - whether photographs are taken and shown to the spouse if there is evidence of fraud.
How's it going?
\"In parallel to detective work, there is protection of personal data of individuals - Olga tells.
This is a provocative issue.
One law allows you to do everything, the other - does not allow anything.
For personal interests, we may take such photos and videos, but not for public viewing.
If the court provides material that does not comply with the law, then there may be major problems.
In order to become a detective, education and experience are not enough, it is also necessary to be mentally healthy and to meet the criteria.
We don't take fingerprints, the police are doing it.
I say to clients - disconnect from the series, here is real life!
In fact, when I was working in the (police) system, I had to use dogs too, they helped a lot.
“The drug department can’t do without dogs at all,” Olga says.
Some clients turn to me in connection with the investigation of murders, but I do not like to take on such things.
These are very difficult things.
Now there are more and more male clients, because women tend to groan about men.
Once upon a time it was different.
Now women are entertaining, but men are sitting at home with children.
“Of course, good people suffer the most, that’s Olga.
I like Dale Carnegie.
He says, stop worrying and start real life.
We all know that if you hit one face, you have to turn the other, but you can't!
It must be said that you do not like it.
It must not act.
Do not be afraid to lose what prevents life!
You can't become a mazeist, and we're going to do what we're allowed to do with ourselves.
Yes, my first thing was directly related to my husband's mistrust, when a woman was not ready to accept the fact that her husband cheated on her.
She called all the time and asked her what to do.
“I asked all my clients now if they were ready to accept the situation when they found out that the man was really cheating on him,” Olga says.
It's not entertainment, it's life.
If you come and hire a detective, you have to take responsibility.
It is not theater, show, but real life.
I'm also a reiki specialist.
It is a matter of heart and related to Japanese medicine - treatment with hands.
This is a very interesting thing.
Why did I start doing this?
This is due to a large amount of adrenaline, and you need to calm yourself somehow.
The needs not only calm down, but restore energy, illuminate.
“People get out of my office positively and satisfied,” Olga says.
She has signs in her office at the wall, and Olga tells her that they are written not with a brush, but with fingers.
I don't just get there, the book about tools literally fell into my hands.
I felt it as a sign.
However, it is very personal.
You can find out more about the tools here.
Olga also sings.
It's her hobbies.
We all have creativity.
From 11 years of age I played guitar.
I have recorded songs and clips.
I am positive and smiling, but I have to rest in order to recover.
Others are saved by alcohol, by me, by reiki.
Alcohol is digested.
In the police, it is used a lot because the work is stressful.
“This causes aggression, and moves can be unpredictable,” she says.
I am interested in sports and equipment.
I have been playing tennis for 15 years.
I also liked riding with horses.
I’d like to write a book, write articles, and write a book.
In detective work there is a fine limit when work comes into your life.
“It’s a job that shouldn’t be allowed in life,” she says.
Asked how to combine work with private life, Olga says: “My loved one is in Italy
We have very strong feelings.
That is the truest love in my life.
I need to think about him, and I feel better.
Detectives usually do not trust, but he has accepted my work.
In fact, I separate work from private life.
I've never been to this business.
The Reikis have directed me.
When I was a child, I saw more than others.
Thanks to the tools, intuition opens.
There are a lot of detectives, but few actually working.
In any case, it is work with the brain, and it is difficult to unlock.
You also need rest.
\"Otherwise, you can't recover, Olga admits.
The most difficult case I've worked with is the story of Constance.
I worked on that thing for a year.
The man literally groaned about that woman.
I did so that my mother's child left for England - far from danger.
There were no other options.
We must not regret ourselves.
We're looking for compassion.
This should not be done.
We have to be happy about every day we have.
Thank God.
Three good things to say to someone else every day.
We need to do a good job or take a day for ourselves.
We must not be so naided by men.
That's a big mistake.
It should be understood that there is a man next to us, not a child, and it is necessary that he takes care of us.
If not good, turn and leave.
You can go to church, it has helped me a lot.
Do not be a fan, but do what you like and help.
Nothing will change if it has not changed, it is necessary to go away and change your life.
In no case should they be put at risk by themselves and their children.
You don’t have to sit down and wait for something.
People are created to do good and support each other.
If God created us, we are already in need of someone, and we are not in vain in this world.
Never sit on the spot!
How to prepare for the family photo session.
The summer is still in full swing, and the current school year is about to come, which families tend to capture in their photos.
In order for all to look happy and beautiful in the pictures, it is worth thinking about how to prepare for the photo session in advance.
Ihappymama is provided by many children’s mom Alexander Nesterenko and professional photographer Marina Levickaja.
It is necessary to take pictures in nature, because it is much more natural and harmonious.
In the study, it is much more difficult for children to feel and relax.
It is recommended to choose a uniform style of dress for the whole family, preferably in one color gamut.
For example, Alexander tells her that she chooses clothes for all six members of the family so that the clothes are no more than three colors in shades and as few inscriptions as possible on clothes.
Do not forget about good mood.
Have fun, laugh, play, but in no case do not scream and nepsiho, if in case the children are not immediately as obedient as they would like.
And here's the next tips already sounded from a professional photographer's boutique!
It is important to understand what exactly you want to capture during the photo session and tell the photographer about it.
For some, they will be beautiful, well-groomed children and an ideal family picture, for others - \"life is what it is like to see real, true emotions in the wishes of the photos, or, as the photographer himself says in love, \"refuge the backs\" - \"eyes open\" - \"pull the dungeon\" -
Of course, there are times when someone wants two in one, but it rarely happens.
In any case, when you go to the photo session, it is necessary to understand that they are just a couple of hours from your life, and the less you will be stuck, the better.
You are yourself - there is neither a strict mom who works, prepares to eat, cultivates and continues to do so, and not a never-ending dad who is constantly talking on the phone.
And not the person who lives in you behind an unknown shell.
Be a family, remember how great it is to envy each other, smile at your own and laugh at each other.
And then the task of the photographer will be to capture the right moments of emotions that reign among you.
If you have chosen a photographer, trust him.
Stop asking for 250 times to show what has come together, listen to his advice in choosing clothes, places for better shots.
It’s a great way to make sure that you don’t have to worry about it.
Plan your route and think about how much time you will need to get to the place of the photo session (especially if the shooting takes place in the studio and the time is limited).
If you have small children, then choose a time for the photo session that corresponds to the date regime of the offspring, so that it does not happen at the time when the baby usually sleeps a diaper.
And, of course, do not forget to take with you children food, biscuits, water and a favorite toy (to use in extreme situations only).
It’s a great way to make sure that you’re on the right track.
Do not drink plenty of water before the photo session and lie down well before that.
And it would still be advisable to arrange some entertainment for everyone after the photo session.
Go to the amusement park, eat some ice cream, get acquainted with roller skates - which family prefers more.
This way you will get great pictures and pleasant memories of the day you spend together.
Krasnopjorov and Fadeev: Raising the minimum wage - a miracle or a brake on the economy?
The question of raising the minimum wage in the public debate has almost the status of a holy cow: either it is necessary to support the raising, or it is necessary to mention some unspeakable, general phrases.
In our opinion, it is important to emphasize that raising the minimum wage is not a miracle that will reduce income inequality, bring Latvia’s wages closer to the Western European level and fill the state budget.
On the contrary, if the minimum wage is raised too much, it is more harmful than the benefits, because its raising reduces the competitiveness and employment of enterprises, especially in low-income sectors and regions.
In the first moment, it seems that despite several increases in the minimum wage during the post-crisis period, the minimum wage in Latvia is not so high that raising to the usual few dozens of euros a year would significantly weaken the competitiveness of enterprises - only 370 euros, while in some European Union (EU) countries the minimum wage is around one and a half thousand euros.
However, a different picture arises if we compare it with the average salary in the country (%) - the minimum wage in Latvia (44%) exceeds the EU average.
As the share of the minimum wage in Latvia is significantly higher than in the neighbouring countries (17% in Latvia, 11% in Lithuania, 6% in Estonia[1]), a similar increase in the minimum wage by volume is binding on most companies.
According to the results of the survey of Latvijas Banka companies, each fifth Latvian company replied that as the minimum wage increased in early 2014, it was important or very important for it to increase product prices.
This means that firstly, the increase in the minimum wage was partly financed by consumers (i.e. Latvians); secondly, the increase in prices for several companies meant loss of competitiveness both in the domestic market and abroad (i.e. increased imports and limited exports).
Due to weaker competitiveness and smoking production, it was important for almost every 15th company in Latvia to lay off employees (which means more unemployment and emigration).
In addition, almost every eleven companies replied that it was important for him to limit the recruitment of young workers as a result of raising the minimum wage.
It should be remembered that in 2011-2013 the minimum wage in Latvia did not change.
Therefore, even if, when assessing the 2014 minimum wage increase, each fifth company noted as an important improvement in productivity, this does not yet mean that a similar result could be expected in 2017 (the fourth consecutive increase in the minimum wage could reduce the possibilities for productivity improvement).
Another important result is that due to the increase in the minimum wage, it was important for several companies to increase the remuneration of employees who earn more than the minimum wage.
Thus, the impact of the minimum wage was significant even for those companies where none of the employees received the minimum wage.
In recent years, the increase in the minimum wage in all three Baltic States exceeded the nominal increase in productivity (real productivity + inflation).
Thus, further increases in the minimum wage, not justified by productivity gains (even despite the overall rather low level of the euro), will have a negative impact on the competitiveness and employment of enterprises.
When assessing the justification for raising the minimum wage, analysis of economic averages is not enough.
It should also be considered whether raising the minimum wage is -tolerable - in sectors and regions where the minimum wage is most frequently used.
The results of the Bank of Latvia survey show that the concentration of employees with minimum wages is highest in small enterprises (the number of employees is from 10 to 19 employees; 25%).
At the end of 2013, the share of employees in industry and services was higher with minimum wages (16% and 19%, respectively) than in trade (15%), construction (11%) and financial and insurance (2%).
On the other hand, Latgale, where the minimum wage is 64% of the average salary (and more than two thirds of the average wage in the private sector), its further increase may be more harmful by reducing labour demand (i.e. maintaining already high unemployment) and promoting the sustainability of the shadow economy.
There are some signs that the rise in the minimum wage (a total of 27%) in 2014-2015 has been halted by Latgale development.
For example, Latgale is the only region in Latvia where unemployment in 2015 was higher than in 2013.
It should be noted that in Estonia and Lithuania there is no region that would be so far behind average wages in terms of the rest of the country.
For example, in Estonia, the average wage in all regions is at least twice the national minimum wage.
The lowest wages in Lithuania are in Tauraghe region, but also there the minimum wage in 2015 was 54% of the average salary (after two rapid increases in the minimum wage in 2016 this figure could reach 58%).
In the public debate from time to time, the call to raise the minimum wage to 68% of the average wage in the country (see, for example, here) lacks an economic justification, which is not feasible either in the short or long term.
First of all, such a high figure from the average salary, or even so close to it, is not present in any EU country.
Second, it would mean raising the minimum wage above the average wage in several sectors of the economy (meaning bankruptcy and mass redundancies of these sectors), such as clothing, leather products, fish processing, catering services, as well as veterinary services; moreover, it is more than the current average wage in the private sector of Latgale.
This is the first time I’ve been in the United States since the beginning of the 20th century.
If nominal productivity increases by 4% and the minimum wage is at least twice as fast, this has a clear negative impact on companies' competitiveness and employment.
Such negative consequences will be most common in those sectors and regions where the current minimum wage is often used, for example, in Latgale.
The fact that a substantial increase in the minimum wage cannot be tolerated at this time means that other mechanisms must be put in place to support low-wage earners.
The immediate effect can be achieved by travelling with a non-taxable minimum of personal income tax (within the limits of the budget).
Insufficient levels of education, inadequate education and poor quality of education acquired, as well as poor health (often due to the expensiveness of medical services and long lines) are mentioned among the real causes of income inequality.
The survey received 521 responses from the Latvian company regarding the response to the increase in the minimum wage in January 2014.
The survey was carried out within the framework of the Wage Dynamics Network (WDN) project.
These figures represent enterprises with a number of employees of not less than 10.
This also explains the low proportion of employees with minimum wages in construction.

Legendary Editor Hafington quits The Huffington Post
Arianna Hafingtone, co-founder and chief editor of the powerful US media holding The Huffington Post, announced her departure from the company after 11 years of work.
The Huffington Post, created in 2005 and awarded with the Pulitzer Prize, which offers both serious political and economic journalism every day and provides coverage of internet sensations in entertainment news, is seen as a milestone in the development of media at a time when digital technology solutions have developed rapidly.
It’s a great way to make sure that you’re getting the best results.
Not long after the re-election of the Republican Party representative George Bush as President of the United States, Hafington did not hide that media journalists represent liberal values, and with such a world view will also prepare news materials.
Now Hafington has revealed on Twitter that she is going to start a new business after leaving - she is planning to create a startup called \"Thrive Global\" that will address employee health and congestion issues.
It is not yet known who could stand under the leadership of The Huffington Post.
During her activities, the portal refused anonymous comments, stressing that freedom of expression is granted to people who stand up for what they say and who do not hide behind anonymity.
In the summer of 2015, she also decided to publish news about US presidential candidate Donald Trump in the entertainment news section.
In the end of 2015, when Trump’s rhetoric is dangerous to the U.S. public, news about the odiotic candidate was again published in the policy section.
In 2011, the U.S. Internet Media Group AOL decided to buy the fast-growing news website The Huffington Post, which was visited by nearly 25 million readers every month at the time of the transaction.
The transaction amount reached 315 million dollars.
In 2015, the telecommunications giant Verizon purchased AOL $4.4 billion.
Also, in 2016, Yahoo bought parts of the Internet business.
With these deals, The Huffington Post, an influential and independent media, became a small part of the giant corporation.
At present, the content of the famous brand media is available in nine international versions, their total monthly unique number of visits is estimated at 81 million.

There was a child seat in the front passenger seat where the baby was located.
The child was brightened directly by the sun's rays.
The baby screamed loudly, breathed intensely, and his face was red and spilled.
In view of the fact that the owner of the vehicle was not present on the spot, a decision was taken immediately to remove the rear glass of the car, so as not to endanger the health and life of the baby.
The child with the entire seat is highlighted from the heated vehicle, and medical personnel are called.
The child breathed shallow, the skin was red and hot, so until the arrival of the doctors, the guards of order put a cool compress on the forehead.
In the event of an accident, medical doctors and parents of the child almost simultaneously arrived.
The father of the baby, looking at the dissipated window for his vehicle, remained aggressive and did not let the medical staff come to the child.
It is also important to note that this is not the case in the United States, but in the United States.
In addition, the child was left in health and life-threatening conditions.
It’s a great way to make sure that you’re on the right track.
In turn, the parents of the child categorically refused to provide any explanations about the event and threatened with court works about the dissipated glass of the car.
During the conversations with their parents, there was no indication that they would be under the influence of alcohol or otherwise could harm the child, so a minor infant under four months of age was placed under both care.
The case materials have been sent to the Child Violations Prevention Department, whose employees will assess parental responsibility.
It is also important to note that if you are not very hot outside, the car that is left in the sun heats up very quickly.

The former vice-president of the Federation stated that Mr. Mr. was greatly weakened during the period of his activities by the board of coaches and judges.
In order to ensure a faster process and decision-making in the Federation, the members of the LPF decided at a general meeting to authorise the management of the Federation by a board composed of Mr. and two vice presidents.
However, as Grennis acknowledged, Mr. defied the members of the federation.
The members of the Federation trusted the Lord, believing that this would enable him to make decisions more quickly in the Federation.
“He deceived the confidence of the members, because he practically took power in his own hands, taking an unethical step,” said Dzenis.
“This attitude cannot be taken from a person who should serve as an example to other sports representatives,” said Dzenis.
In his view, Mr. President has tried to satisfy his ambitions, which in turn also does not honor him as President of the LPF.

“On the contrary, we have received recognition that the quality of the Federation’s work has improved,” said the President of the LPF.
It is also important to note that this is not the case in the United States, but in the United States.
It is not clear to most people in Latvia and they do not understand what the functions of the presidents of federations are.
People do not understand that we are voluntaires in these positions, and, for example, unlike the heads of the Latvian Olympic Committee (LOC), we do not receive wages.
In the meantime, we need to ensure that the sports federation has sufficient funding, because only 10% of the required amount is received from the state LPF.
During the Olympic Games, I have had formal and informal meetings with representatives of the international federation and various international programs, including international sponsors.

Travellers who are in the resorts of Thailand or are planning to travel there are invited by the Ministry to contact tour operators or airlines, specifying whether the course of the trip will be carried out in accordance with the planned.
The Ministry also invites travellers to regularly follow the information on the development of the political and security situation in the country, as well as to ensure the security of the place of residence.
There is a high threat of terrorism in the country.
In view of the fragile security situation in the country, we do not recommend going to the border between Thailand and Cambodia, as well as to the provinces in the border between Thailand and Malaysia - Patan, Jala, Narathiva and Sonkhla.
In the event of an emergency, the Ministry invites you to immediately contact the consular department’s 24-hour dean by phone +371 26 33 77 11 or by e-mail palidziba@mfa.gov.lv.

The weight category up to 100 kilograms was already busy, so Arthur used the European quota in the heavy weight category.
It’s a great way to make sure that you don’t have to worry about it.
There are very few random moments in the heavy weight category at all.
If there are all kinds of turns in light weight categories, then in heavy weight - very rare.
To the question whether Nikiforenko in the future would be better to fight one degree in the lighter weight category, Baskin answered in support.
I think yes - Arthur would better fight in a category of up to 100 kilograms.
This is his real weight category.
He's not the real heavyweight.
65% of Venezuelans want to stop Maduro, the question is whether they are ready to fight for it.
Two out of three Venezuelans want to abandon President Nicolas Maduro, but the question is whether they are ready to fight for it.
The day after the National Electoral Board announced that “there is no time for the withdrawal of this year’s vote, with which Chavismo will be at the beauty of power until 2019, people on the streets of Karakas continued their usual day as if nothing had happened.
“I didn’t hear the news because I watched the Olympics and how Michael Felps got two more medals,” said Rafael Dean, a 36-year-old office worker who rested on Altamira Square on Wednesday.
Altamira Square, located in the east of Caracas, was an epicenter of sharp unrest in early 2014, in which it protested against the Maduro regime.
However, now that the opposition has to exert greater pressure than ever to reach a referendum this year, people across the country are no longer showing such energy.
“I want a referendum, but for security reasons I won’t take part in the protests,” Dean said.
Others, more informed, want to mobilize in the future, but admit that Venezuelans are not so motivated.
The President of the Election Board Tibisei Lusen comments on the claim that the government impedes the withdrawal process.
I will protest whenever the opposition calls for a protest, but I know that some of my friends are afraid, Roberto Reijess (60), said Fox News Latino.
So, in addition to all the barriers that the government has put in place to hold back the referendum, the opposition is now facing a new challenge: to motivate people to go out and protest.
It is also important to note that this is not the case in the United States, but in the United States.
However, when it comes to blocking efforts to protest against government moves, the number of those who come to raids is significantly lower.
“Some people focus on food lines, while others are afraid of arrests and deaths after 2014,” said Cipriano Eredia, the opposition legislature.
After Lusena announced that until the next step in the referendum process - an even greater number of signatures across the country - they will have to wait until October, those who are against the socialist government say that President Maduro and his followers are simply trying to take away the courage of the Venezuelans, making them believe that voting this year is practically impossible.
According to the Constitution, if the referendum were held in 2017, Maduro could be suspended from office, but he would be allowed to name the next president.
If he were suspended today, he was obliged to declare general elections.
The U.S. Department of State addressed this issue in a Thursday afternoon statement, calling on the Venezuelan authorities to guarantee respect for Venezuelan constitutional rights.
“The other steps to implement the President’s withdrawal referendum must be clear, concrete and immediate, thus contributing to a quick and effective resolution of the current political, economic and social difficulties of the country,” it said.
Louis Salamanca, a political analyst who was a member of the electoral board between 2006 and 2009, is not expected to change as soon as possible.
“I think there will be no referendum this year unless social unrest and protests become even stronger,” he said.
He said that Lussen and the government violated the law, but as a result, they will achieve their goal if people do not protest loudly.
In September, the opposition called for a broad manifesto. First of all, in Caracas, to demand an accelerated process so that the withdrawal can take place this year.
We want people from all over the country to mobilize this day in the capital.
“The government will feel pressure,” Eredia said.
Salamanca, on the other hand, believes that it is not possible to wait so long in this situation.
“They should respond to Lusen’s announcement faster and more strongly, as it practically kills the referendum,” FNL said.
The Congressman Eredia admitted that some opposition parties want to make the manifesto faster, while others want more time to organize the group.
The opposition must now be cautious.
If people feel insecure in this situation, there is a risk that the activity of the second signature collection campaign will be low,” Salamanca said.
The referendum process should receive support from twenty percent of national voters, which is close to 4 million people, to activate it.
Salamanca and other analysts are convinced that even if the withdrawal takes place in 2017, Chavismo will be saddened.
However, some people are not so optimistic.
Our party wants political change today.
“If the government closes its way to the elections, we will have to explore other legal options,” Eredia told the FNL.

“We meet twice a week in the premises of the Family Support Centre where we can play novus, table tennis, use gymnastics,” says Jānis Stauds, Chairman of the Ogres Pensioners’ Society.
In the end of the sports festival, all participants received thanks for their participation at the Ogre Sports Centre, but the greatest benefit is the movement in the fresh air, good mood and time spent together.
In 2016/2017, the premiere of the No. 19 West Bromwich Albion
Guardian journalists predict position 14 (Warning: it’s not just Alan Smith’s prediction, but our journalistic council as a whole)
Last season's heading 14
Opportunity to win the league (with Oddschecker) 1000-1
It was a new season before last week, like the old Bromwich Albion: The 2016/2017 season will be once again a struggle for satisfaction or stagnation, depending on how “empty a glass is – even more pragmatic under the leadership of Tony Pullis.
However, then Jeremy Piss sold 88% of his club shares to Guochuan Lai and Pullis, in archetyped safe hands, which the bookmakers immediately made a favorite in the unpleasant role of the first dismissed manager.
The situation has undoubtedly changed in the Balack Country - and not only Hawthorns, but also a few miles northwest of the Volverhampton, where young Chinese owners, without wasting time, abandoned the services of Kenya Jacques.
It’s a great way to make sure that you don’t have to worry about it.
“I don’t want to change the club’s virtues or start an unsustainable fun,” he said, taking over.
I want to be a good owner and invest in this club in the long term.
First of all, our goal is to ensure stay in the Premier League and then to go even further, I would like to see the club strengthened at the top of the division.
I think it is the best league in the world and I want to take this club as far as possible.
These are the achievements of Pullis, the first aspect should not be difficult.
The next goal is to break up to the top of the table, but for the new owner and the increasingly fragmented fan base it will be important to hope for a quick breakthrough in the table up to realize that this is an extremely difficult task, given the thorough work recently invested by other adjacent teams in the middle of the table.
In order to go beyond the 14th place of last season, more will definitely have to be done.
Only Aston Villa, located at the bottom of the table, had fewer gates, and it is worth recalling that on average, at Christmas, Albion made less than one hit at the gate in 90 minutes, almost the worst indicator of the division.
They failed to score 13 out of 38 games and hit more than one goal in only nine games.
This is the first time I’ve ever been in the United States since the beginning of the 20th century.
As already expected, a dozen of the 34 gates were drawn from the standard position.
It is no surprise that Hawthorns’ team was dominated by discontent, perhaps the most noticeable after the shocking 0-0 undistinguished by Villa at the end of January, when the guestboard looked better.
On the other hand, only the six best teams had better performance in defense - although no club has managed to list four center semi-guards.
These guards are often undervalued, especially Johnny Evans, to whom Arsenal wants to be, given their recent crisis in terms of the injured players.
The Northern Ireland International team experienced a great start in the European Championship, and Albion will have to spend a lot of time to sell.
Ben Fosters' gates are reliable, and they are well-completed in the middle line.
Daren Flecher, largely like Evans, demonstrated that he was still able to play on a high level at the age of 32, and Claudio Jacob was undervalued.
The fact that the long and curved future story of Saido Berahino is still unclear is disturbing for all parties.
As owner, bets from Stoke and Crystal Palace were refused, but they still remain in peace and Mark Hughes is ready to wait.
After the last season, being close to liquidation, it is worth taking action from all parties involved.
The attacker is, of course, talented, but, as Pulis has said several times, he has been screaming here on the other side, it has been seen for a long time that such a relationship does not work.
It’s important to know that you’re not alone, but you’re a part of yourself.
This creates great pressure on the Venezuelan Solomon Rondon, who looked very hopeful last season for a while, but he must improve the performance of his nine gates, especially if Ricky Lambert continues to be so ineffective.
The decision to release Viktor Aničeb and Stefan Sesegnon also looks strange in the retrospective.
Pulis throughout his career is sadly famous for his slow move of young players up and three teens - Jonathan Leko, Sam Field and Tyler Roberts in the last game of the previous season with the undistinguished 1-1 with Liverpool, hardly become the norm.
He will return to the already tried and tested, but Leko is worth keeping in sight.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
Met Phillips, with 5.5 million contracts with Queens Park Rangers, will be quick, but he is the only young player to take part in the first race on the weekend.
It would not have been bold to say if the end could be quite hastily.
“Everything,” Pulis told Express and Star last month about what could be improved.
Every position you see.
We need to strengthen the back players, the midfield players and front-run players.
The goals are, we know what we want.
It turns out that obtaining them is much more difficult than expected, mainly because of the uncertainty about the acquisition processes.
The season could be determined by how they have started, with seven largely winning games before the challenging race with Tottenham, Liverpool, Manchester City and Leicester from mid-October.
For the time being, pressure on Pulis will have become smaller or irresistible.
And who knows, maybe even Berahino will have found a new club.
Tata Steel UK closer to the rescue transaction after authorised pension aid changes
Pension trustees behind Tata Steel UK said that the scheme could be restructured without participating in the Pension Protection Fund (PFF), increasing the company’s chances of entering into a rescue transaction.
The British steel pension scheme has an obligation of GBP 15 billion and is estimated to have a deficit of at least GBP 700 million, creating serious obstacles to the conclusion of a rescue transaction between Tata Steel UK and Port Talbot Steelworks in Wales.
Tata Steel is increasingly convinced of the future of Britain’s 11,000-strong business after negotiations with the Minister of Economy and the Pension Regulator.
The company plans to combine its European activities, including the British business with ThyssenKrupp, a German conglomerate.
However, the conclusion of the transaction depends on whether the British steel pension scheme will be restructured and the government will provide financial support.
Allan Johnson, the chairman of the pension mandate, said that the scheme could avoid PPF if the benefits received by employees were modified.
Although it is well-funded compared to other schemes, with a deficit of up to £300 million for individual measures, Tata Steel and ThyssenKrupp want to control their commitments.
Johnston said that the trustees acknowledged that it was “not realistic” for the joint venture or any buyer of Tata Steel Uk to take responsibility for financing the current and future deficits.
The modification of the benefits of the scheme was a much more binding option than the accession of the PPF, he added, where workers would have to accept less favourable conditions.
Tata Steel sources warn that it could still sell Port Talbot.
The company has consistently refused to guarantee the future of steel products since negotiations on the future of its British business were launched in March, and this has been used as a short talk with the British government.
Cushik Chattery, CEO of Tata Steel Europe, said that the Indian conglomerate wants to make its steel business more sustainable.
When speaking at the Tata Steel annual meeting in India, Chattery said that negotiations on the restructuring of pension schemes were moving forward, but he insisted that the scheme was well funded.
“We are talking to various stakeholders, including the British government and other stakeholders, such as the Welsh government, etc.,” said Chattery, reports the Times of India.
There is a belief that pensions have a certain impact on the business of goods such as steel, so we need to find a structural solution that does not prevent the business from moving forward.
The willingness of pension trustees to cooperate in negotiations on the restructuring of the scheme will be supported by Tata Steel.
The potential changes in the scheme include shifting the measurement of annual inflation-based benefits from the retail price index to the lowest consumer price index and limiting future pension payments to the statutory minimum.
Johnston added: “The full member and his advisers have provided Tata Steel, the government and the pension regulator with evidence of the scheme’s ability to pay the modified benefits indefinitely and with a low risk profile outside the Pension Protection Fund.
Our investment strategy has meant that the financing position of the scheme has not been affected by the fall in the recent securities market in the same way as in other UK pension schemes. We are still convinced of the scheme’s ability to provide benefits at a self-sufficient level.
It is also important to note that this is not the case in the United States.

When Felps crossed the line, Friedman held him as Lohti, the Felps’ compatriot and the top of an ancient rival world swimmer’s top.
Friedman said, \"At last he'll do it.\"
Ryan Lohte will beat Michael Felps in this race!
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
However, Felps won, but Lohte finished fourth.
As soon as Phalps was at the gold, there was silence in CBS transmission.

“No excuse,” he wrote.
In the meantime, Felps beat a record of 2,68 years as the winner of the most successful Olympic wins ever.
The previous record belonged to Leonid of Rhodes, who had won more Olympic titles in the anti-Olympic Games than anyone else.
Russian hackers attacked the computer of the former NATO force commander.
The hackers made public the lists of General Philip Bridlow and data on the work of one of the Soros funds.
The same hackers who could have carried out an attack on the emails of the US Democratic Party some time ago and published its lists could also be blamed for a new series of attacks, Bloomberg said.
According to her, these cyberattacks attacked the correspondence of former NATO European Force Commander General Filip Bridlov and the Open Society Institute's services, which are part of the projects supported by millionaire George Soros.
The attackers published the resulting information on DCLeaks.com.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
It is reported that hackers have had access to the fund’s computers for about a year.
The news agency claims that it is about the same hackers who carried out an attack on the computers of the US Democratic Party and led by the Russian special service.

Parking in the happiest place on Earth will be even easier in the future.
Disneyland has presented information on its long-planned parking structure, consisting of a transport hub and a new pedestrian bridge on the east side of the theme park.
The project, located in the east of the 5 Freeway theme park, includes a 6 800-seat parking structure and a transport hub where buses, shuttles, taxis and other vehicles can skip park visitors.
The pedestrian bridge over the port boulevard connects the recreation park with the structure of the parking lot and the transport hub.
This structure, together with the planned expansion project for the 14-acre area of the Star Wars land, is part of a $1 billion investment promised to Anaheim city in exchange for a 30-year entertainment tax exemption.
The construction of the project, synchronizing with the Eastern Gate, will be launched next year.
The structure of the parking lot will be created above the Disney Hero of the Public parking lot, which has about 1,300 seats.
The transport hub will replace the commercial property acquired by the theme park in 2014.
The project is planned to be opened in 2018.
“The East Gate is part of our major investment in the city of Anaheim, which will provide additional parking spaces for visitors and help reduce congestion near the rest park as we continue to expand Disneyland Holiday Park,” said Disney spokeswoman Susan Brown.

In Liepaja, two thirds of its population will have to agree to the insulation of the house.
If the owners of apartments are very harsh and specifically talked about the technical condition of the building, if there is such an opportunity to receive support and arrange the building in all possible ways, then it is quite easy not to use it.
One of the most important changes is that EU co-financing from this year will be available to any apartment house, only the condition is that the facade of the building must be heated.
In the past, it could only be used in serial multi-apartment buildings.
It’s a great way to make sure that you’re getting the best results.
A significant problem, where at present this process is delayed, is that 67% of apartment owners are in need of consent.
“In the previous program, 51% was required,” says Toms Cīrulis, Project Manager at Liepājas house manager (LNA).
“It is very difficult, of course, to ensure this because, in most general meetings, such a number of apartment owners do not come – says Gints Ločmelis, Project Manager of the company “Home Service APSE”.
The largest house managers in Liepaja – “Home service APSE” and LNA, which serve about 900 buildings, plan to renovate at least 50 apartment buildings in the new planning period by 2020.
They do not rule out the possibility that at the beginning of the work it will be difficult to convince people to vote for renovation works, but with each project implemented, the attitude of the population should improve.
I also had to get a bank loan, 76% of the residents of the house needed it.

It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
In his youth, Aaron was long-suffering on the world for the death of his mother.
The potential suicide bomber's arrest operation in Canada was worthy of pressure films.
It all started when the Canadian police received a video intercepted by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Very early in the morning, the Royal Canadian Police received reliable information from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
It contained, among other things, a so-called “vehicle” video recorded by an unknown person who was clearly at the stage of the preparation of the last attack.
“And he was going to do it with a homemade bomb,” said Canadian police deputy chief Mike Kaban.
In a black mask video, a man in English and Arabic voiced a threat to Canadians and vowed to take revenge for everything they had done for Muslims.
In about three hours, using face and voice recognition computer programs, the Canadian police managed to recognize this man.
It was 24-year-old Aaron Driver.
He was already under the supervision of the probation service for the celebration of terrorism and radical Islamic ideas on the Internet.
In a court judgment, Drivers were prohibited from doing so in the future and also from engaging in any radical organizations.
However, until then, the authorities did not believe that Drivers could pose some physical danger to others.
When the police arrived at his home in Stratroy, Ontario, the young man came out and sat in a taxi.
At that point, the guards tried to arrest him, but the driver, sitting on the back seat, had triggered the bomb.
In order to prevent the detonation of the second explosive, police officers shot a young man.
He's dead from the injuries he's suffered.
The taxi driver has not suffered.
In an interview with Canadian television, Vein Driver, the father of a neutralized terrorist, said that his son had turned to Islam in his teenage years.
It was originally helped him cope with drugs and alcohol.
However, Aaron was a problematic teenager who was long-term angry at the world for the death of his mother, his father added.
Only when I saw that video in the news today, did I see how far he had gone.
I had no idea he was so radicalized.
“And I didn’t know he was so good at speaking Arabic,” says Aaron’s father.
The Canadian police admit that if they had arrived a few hours later, the development of the events could have been much different.

Ineta learned about Laura’s injury recently and expressed her support to the athlete, stating that the athlete did not start to build his own airbags, but showed the character and spirit of the fighter.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
She remembered that herself driving to the first Olympics, where she won 13th place, was called a tourist, and this creates negative emotions.
Ineta sometimes remembers his startups, not only Olympics.
“I like to remember my emotions, not my results – remembering my experience in sport, Radēviča revealed.
She told me that it was always important that there was someone in the stands who would give me the energy of co-operation.
This year, however, Radēvičs will be a tourist – she will go to Rio de Janeiro next week to support Latvian athletes.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
In 2010, Ineta Radēvičs won the title of European Champion.
In 2004 she took 13th place in the Olympic Games in Athens and 20th position in the three-solve, but in 2008 the athlete did not start at the Olympics because he was in the expectation of his son.
In London, as already mentioned, Radēviča had 4th place in a distance jump.

In Thailand, four people died in bomb explosions in tourist attractions
After the Thai people voted for the adoption of the military-backed Constitution, on Thursday and Friday, a series of bomb explosions took place in the five southern provinces of Thailand - the popular tourist destinations - where four people were killed and many injured.
The first two explosions landed in the seaside resort of Huachin on Thursday evening, the next - on Friday morning.
The city is located about 200 kilometers south of Bangkok.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
The authorities confirmed that other explosions landed in the southern cities of Phuket, Trana and Suratthani.
Two bombs exploded in the Phuket suburb of Patong and two more in Phanna province, a tourist region north of Phuket.
In the last 24 hours, 11 bombs have crashed in Thailand.
On Friday, King of Thailand police officer Colonel Krisana Patanacharoen said the explosions were not linked to Islamic extremists and considered to be local sabotage acts.
“It’s too early to draw conclusions,” he said.
\"However, we certainly know that these incidents are not directly related to any type of terrorism, in fact it is a local sabotage, and we are trying to find guilty persons.\"
After a small-scale bomb explosion in Huahin on August 12, 2016, investigators collected evidence from the site of the crime.
On 12 August, officials announced that four people had been killed in a series of bomb explosions in important areas of the tourism industry in Thailand. The competent authorities are working to identify the cause and find the perpetrators.
There are no conflicts in the country that could lead to terrorists being in the country.
“Therefore, we can say that these incidents are not terrorist attacks,” he continued.
No group has yet taken responsibility for the attack, and no special group has been charged by the competent authorities, but the explosions took place in the same week when the Thai voters approved the new constitution.
All three southern provinces - Huahin, Phuket and Phanna - have rejected a military-backed referendum, and more than 6,500 people have been killed in unrest since 2004 in the southeastern provinces of Thailand, where the majority of the Muslim population is.
The explosions took place on the birthday of Queen Sirikita of Thailand, which is a public holiday in Thailand.
In Huachin there is Klai Kangwon, a castle far from concerns, where the royal family of Thailand often lives.
King Bumibol Aduliad was the longest-running monarch in the world.

Porgy and Bess - what we have long deserved!
There are countless operas that have never been performed in Latvia.
There is something that sounds very rare.
However, it seems strange if since the 1970s George Gēršvin’s opus Porgijs and Bessa have neither been staged nor played, if they do not count such a chrestomatic solo number as Summertime periodic tutoring on stage (including title performance at Inese Galante’s summer festival), individual student projects, guest performances and the like.
It has its own reasons - since Latvia is a country of the civilized Western world, it is bound by the Gurtswin family heirs regulations and copyright licenses, which are valid for Porgia and Bess until 2030.
The conciliation procedures are not simple.
In addition, when creating a full presentation, the author desired that all fourteen soloists should be black.
In Latvia, of course, the discussions and contexts that exist around this opera in the USA in relation to race are little known and the desire of the composer to perform would be difficult.
On 6 August, the concert performed with the help of four artistic black American soloists and their Latvian brothers and sisters performed brightly at the 10th anniversary of the Cesis Art Festival, recalling Gēršvin’s charming soundwriting, in which the traditions of European classical music with the rhythms of American jazz, gossip, fashion dances and memories of the early 20th century were intertwined, telling the enticing ukbag Porgy of Ketfišrov and the love story of the gentle Taurine Bess in such a musical quality that would deserve to be documented in the historical annals of music life.
First of all, thanks to the LNSO and conductor Andris Button.
In spite of the complex spatial location of the concert performance in the open-air park of Cesis Palace, the orchestra was located next to the stage, on which soloists were acting and singing (and danced perfectly!) choir While the overall sound was stylistically nuanced, rich in contrasts and accurate in both string and metal blowing instruments and piano party (Mārtiņš Zilberts).
Second, because of the excellent team of soloists.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
It’s a great way to make sure that you’re getting the best results.
Lettonia Masonry in its second Porgy and Bessa concert performance (the first took place in 2012 no less than with the Berlin Philharmonics and Sir Simon Retla) revealed itself as a vitally plastic combination of various vocal styles with a dramaticly tinted timbre and a fantastic piano in the upper register.
Not for nothing, she is one of the brightest in modern Aidas.
The attractive tenor of Jamaican origin, Jermein Smith, who was seen by Andris Poga in a Boston presentation at the time, has a corporate role in the image of the drug addict Sportinlaiff.
In it, he demonstrates his synchronous dancing and singing skills as a well-trained musical actor.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
It is incredible that even from row 24 and relative darkness, the expressive gesture language of Germein Smith makes it possible to see in his hands the dust bag of happiness even if it is not there.
How can poor Bess not follow such a mephistophleic temptation, which in an empty place leads to the illusion of a wonderful life in New York?
The role of the crane was represented by the generously endowed Rodney Clark.
The biggest vocal surprise in the Latvian soloist team in Cesis presentation was Sirina, represented by Sonora Vaice - a luxurious upper register, skillful balancing between the spoken and sung text, correspondingly changing the voice position, vocal acrobatics and dramatic performance, both in the Mercy of Sirina My Man is Gone Now, and in the stylized imploration of the predecessor Oh, Doctor Jesus.
It’s not just a matter of time, but also a matter of time.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
In the spatial concept of the concert performed by Viesturs Kairiss, the choir worked on steps, soloists - mainly in the prosthenic, rarely coming or going up the stairs.
In a sufficiently dynamic operation, a slightly comical situation was made by note folders in the hands of Latvian soloists.
The presence of them is quite a prosaic explanation.
First, some soloists sang several episodic roles (which sometimes caused difficulties in tracking their stage identity).
Second, there are a lot of dialogues, conversational phrases, repetitions, which are easier to track in front of notes.
This is the first time I’ve been in the United States since the beginning of the 20th century.
The weather did not beat and the first part of the concert did not last long enough.
However, this did not prevent most of the listeners from staying until the end to lure the artists.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.

It was found that a man born in 1962 had previously frightened children so that they did not make noise.

The man was arrested.

The presidents of the Federation usually use guest accreditation in the Olympic Games.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
It later became known that Mr. Brasil arrived with coach accreditation, which the president himself expressed a surprise, because \"now nowhere is inside\"
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
In the Olympic village, athletes live, as well as official persons, including, for example, coaches, doctors, delegation administration.
It is also important to note that this is not the case in the United States, but in the United States.
“The other presidents of the federations come as guests, and their accreditation is variable – they arrive for a few days and then someone else uses it,” said Vilciņa, explaining that the presidents of these federations do not live in the Olympic village either.
Mr. Rio de Janeiro arrived in late July and Brazil will leave on August 13, so he is likely to be the longest presidents of all national federations.
It is important to note that Latvian athletes started swimming only one day - on August 10.

In the meantime, the President of the Latvian Volleyball Federation Atis Sausnītis and the Head of the Latvian Tennis Union Juris Savickis decided not to come to Rio de Janeiro.
It is also important to note that this is not the case in the United States, but in the United States.
The world-famous Russian fashion historian, interior decorator, screenwriter, bookwriter, lecturer and collector Alexander Vasilyev visits Latvia very often over the last few years.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
In a conversation with “Night News – Alexander Vasilyev said that for many years he has been the president of the jury in the popular “Mis Russia” beauty competition.
This is why he was very interested in evaluating the participants of Miss and Misters Latvija 2016.
Asking what different Latvian beauty competition standards from similar competitions in Russia, Vasilyev stressed that Latvians and Russians have quite different figures: “Russian beauty contestants have more breasts than Latvian competitors –
However, Latvian youth are beautifully dressed and saffronized, and can boast of natural beauty, not the wonders of plastic surgery.
Therefore, I especially congratulate the participants of the Latvian beauty competition on their natural beauty.
In connection with his professional activities in Latvia, Vasilyev has big plans.
At present, the fashion historian’s collection exhibition “The tamed nature” can be seen at the Museum of Decorative Art and Design.
In Ventspils, in the castle of the Order of Livonian, the exhibition of Vasilyev “Kāzu costumes 1860-2010” is shown.
It is also important to note that this is not the case in the United States, but in the United States.
I love Latvia very much.
Especially now that there is a terrorist threat across Europe, here is a real corner of paradise.
“To spend time and relax in Latvia is a pure pleasure – recognized fashion guru.
In addition, on November 23, Alexander Vasilyev will open a private fashion museum in Old Riga.
Please help!
Please donate to the treatment of our son, brother, grandson.
We, the Rinalda family, are grateful to fantastic people around and to God for the opportunity to save Rinalda, but unfortunately, at the moment there is no possibility to fully cover the cost of medicine by their own means.
Rinalds Grinbergs is an 11-year-old tukumsman who was diagnosed with brain tumors at the end of July.
This year he graduated 4th grade in the Milzkalne primary school with excellence, a strong athlete and a very talented artist.
Everything seems to have been given to him.
Healthy, cheerful, persistent, determined and active boy.
Always smiling and kind.
July 26 will be remembered forever in our family.
The last couple of weeks suffered from nausea, headache, but doctors delayed it to the abdominal virus.
And at first it seemed like it was.
For one could imagine that such “innocent” symptoms are much more serious than inconceivable.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
It’s a great way to make sure that you don’t have to worry about your health.
It is also not possible to determine whether the tumor is benign or malignant.
The next state-paid plan: start radiation and watch what is happening.
It seemed like such an evil nightmare - we're going to experiment here, we're going to explore the results.
It was a good opportunity to show the results of the Rinalda examinations to a doctor in Spain.
He is the vice president of the World Neurosurgical Association, one of the world's leading neurosurgeons.
He took on an operation, and it turned out that he had to operate immediately.
The tumor causes huge pressure on the brain, and the risk of complications is too high.
It is also urgent to understand whether the tumor is benign or malignant in order to develop a plan for further treatment.
Without thinking for a moment, parents chose to go to Spain to save their son.
It’s a great way to make sure that you’re on the right track and that you’re on the right track.
A very complex, more than 6 hours long operation was performed.
The operation took place at the Santa Elena clinic.
It was possible to remove most of the tumor, relieve the pressure, obtain samples of analysis.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
The results of oncological analyses should now be expected alone.
Thank you to Dr. Araez and the clinical management, who understood the situation and was in an emergency without receiving a full payment for pre-operative treatment.
They trusted that the remaining amount would be paid, demanded only a first deposit of €10,000 to operate and save Rinalda's life.
It’s a great way to make sure that you’re getting the best results.
But at least €24,000 is needed to pay for the first stage of treatment in Spain and give back the money we have borrowed for the first deposit.
Please help us to repay this operation that is so important to Rinalda's health.
Each euro is important to help cover the costs of an existing operation and to be able to successfully continue the treatment of Rinalda.
The signs of unrest in Ukraine ask the question: What does Vladimir Putin think?
It has been concluded that these claims are true.
Ukraine denies them, while the US and the European Union claim that Russia has not provided any evidence.
The Open Analysis Group, Digital Forensic Research Lab, has identified some signs of Saturday’s shooting, but very little to be able to hinder Moscow’s big plans.
Russia is known for distorting or misinterpreting events for political purposes, especially in the context of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.
This does not mean that all Russian claims are unfounded.
Ukraine's resistance forces damaged electrical pilons supplying current to the Crimea last year, some of which are also involved in criminal activities and human rights violations.
The attempt to attack in Crimea is still a matter of concern, although there is little reason to suspect that the Ukrainian government would sponsor such a scenario.
What is the best way to get rid of it?
They show how heavy weapons convoys are moving across the peninsula, including coast guard missile systems.
Incredible Russian Escalation
Some reports show that Russian forces in Crimea had already planned a rotation around this time that could help explain the activity, although it would be a very big coincidence that it simply happened in one of the most stressful times since its annexation in 2014.
Whatever has become known over the weekend, Mr Putin has undoubtedly addressed Ukraine even more in his statements, choosing to use this episode, no matter how real it may be, for some greater purpose.
Analysts point to alarming parallels with how Russia behaved just before previous military actions against Ukraine.
In February 2014, with similar speeches and military maneuvers, it was provided with a cover for Crimean volunteers to occupy the peninsula, which was still under Ukrainian control at that time, only to discover that they were in fact Russian special units that initiated the military occupation.
In August, when Russian-backed separatists failed in eastern Ukraine, Putin deployed forces along the border warning that they might be needed for the protection of the ethnic Russian civilian population in Ukraine, which he said was being attacked.
He organized an aid convoy to the region, which, according to NATO information, was only a cover of Russian invasion forces.
What does Mr Putin intend to do in Crimea?
Some have said that Moscow is not planning another military intervention.
The fighting in eastern Ukraine has intensified, as it was before the invasion in August 2014.
But this supposed parallel could be the point of introducing fear of military activities rather than actual activities - this will give Putin a brief message in relations with Ukraine and with Western countries.
Mark Galeoti, professor at the University of Nu York, who studies Russia, pointed out that Crimea would be of little importance as a point from which to start military action against East Ukraine, which borders the land part of Russia and not Crimea, and that the rest of the country is better protected.
“There is little chance if the Russians really plan a large-scale offensive,” said Mr Galeoti.
Rather, we can observe the classic Russian strategies of creating a pressure-making system.
The international peace talks on Ukraine, once a mechanism by which Putin forced contacts with Western leaders who ignored him because of the annexation of Crimea, are seen by more and more people as unsuccessful and insignificant.
It’s not just a matter of time, but also of time.
\"It's a standard Putin tactic - he wants to try to start from the position of power,\" Galeoti said about the next peace talks scheduled for early September.
\"And the only strength is to say, \"If I wanted to, I could make everything much, much worse.\"
Acquiring an agreement with the West
This week Putin also said that during the Crimean tensions it was not important to continue the negotiations, forcing other parties to convince him to return to the negotiating table and get to the center of the process.
What does it actually give him?
First of all, it allows Russia to continue to strengthen itself as a world power, although its economy is smaller than Australia.
Secondly, it positions Moscow as the one who owns the right of veto with regard to Ukraine's sovereignty, to some extent keeping the country under Russian control.
This can also benefit Putin's long-loved hopes for a wide-ranging agreement with the United States, which would resolve their disputes on the issue of Ukraine and Syria, with favourable conditions for Moscow, naturally - also ending Western sanctions against Russia.
Putin has pointed out this objective since the deterioration of the country’s economy in 2014, on several occasions, mainly due to the decline in the value of its oil and gas exports.
Since the invasion of Syria last autumn, he has repeatedly called on the Western powers to join him in the Great Coalition for the fight against extremists.
However, Russian leaders may believe that they would need to secure such an agreement before January, when President Obama's term of office expires.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
Donald J. Trump, although apparently friendly to Russia, is still considered unpredictable.
Obama, on the other hand, is seen as “a search for solutions rather than conflicts,” Galeoti said.
So it makes sense to close the option window to get something done quickly.
In the meantime, if a large-scale agreement is not reached, Putin seems to be satisfied with the preservation of Russia's weak neighbor, which will be further.
In the previous version of this article, the year Russia anected Crimea from Ukraine was incorrectly indicated.
This happened in 2014, not in 2013.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
The Obama administration said Thursday that it would divert $81 million from biomedical research and anti-abuse and health care programmes to pay for vaccines against the development of the Zika virus by resorting to emergency measures, as Congress did not approve new funding for the fight against the virus.
In a letter to the Congressionals, Silvia Matthews Barvels, Secretary of Health and Human Services, said that without the funds transferred, the National Institute of Health and the Biomedical In-depth Research and Development Authority will remain without money to fight against the disease transmitted by the mosquito until the end of the month.
Therefore, it would be necessary to stop the development of the vaccine at an important time, as Miami increases the number of cases of Zika disease acquired in the country.
Last week, 7 350 cases of Zika virus were recorded in the United States, mostly in Puerto Rico (according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).
It is important to note that this is not the case.
The virus can cause abnormalities in the development of the brain and other serious defects in children born to infected mothers.
The prevalence of the disease in the continental part of the United States, when the first cases were recorded at the end of last month, has increased political rates for the reaction of the federal government.
In the course of Tuesday's campaign, Hillary Clinton stopped in Wrightwood, in Miami, where an outbreak of locally transmitted Zika virus cases occurred, and put pressure on Congress to get it back from it for a five-week break to confirm emergency funding for the fight against the virus.
President Obama and Republicans of Congress have been controversial about Zika virus issues for most of the year.
In February, Obama demanded $1.9 billion for extraordinary funding.
The Republicans stopped this by asking for a more detailed report on what money would be spent on.
For months, legislators have been arguing about how much money should be allocated and how it should be spent.
This is the first time I’ve ever been in the United States.
As a result of this impasse, the White House was forced in April to divert $589 million to fight against the Ebola virus, to fight the Zikas virus. About two thirds of the funding is intended to be used internally.
On Thursday, Mrs. Barwell said that her department had spent most of the money and that it would be spent in full by the end of August.
“The failure to take a decision on emergency funding for the fight against the Zika virus has led the administration to choose between postponing the work of developing an important vaccine and resorting to other valuable national programmes in order to temporarily avoid this delay,” Barvela wrote.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
In the news conference, Nancy Pelosi from California, the leader of a minority, invited Paul D. Rien, the spokeswoman of the House of Representatives, to remind Congress of the progress of this event.
“All opportunities are exhausted and we are now addressing the National Institute of Health,” said Mrs Pelosi.
The advice of Mr. Ryan says that diverting funds is a step that had to be taken a long time ago and which the Obama administration has delayed in order to force the maximum political benefit out of the Zika virus problem.
Last week, the National Institute for Health announced that it had launched vaccinations against the Zika virus in 80 people, and hopes to launch a second phase, the Zika virus epidemic countries, in early 2017.
However, as officials said on Thursday, without immediate additional funding, the study will stop.
Barvela said she would divert $34 million from the National Health Service to the fight against other diseases, including cancer and diabetes.
A further 47 million will be transferred to the Biomedical In-depth Research and Development Authority, which supports the development of medicines and vaccines in response to public health emergencies.
This money will come from several accounts, including $19 million from a programme that grants heating fuel subsidies to disadvantaged families, and $4 million from substance addiction programmes such as opioid addictions.
Even as Barwell said, the extra money will only be enough for the next month, when agencies will have to \"grably narrow down their activities - in the fight against the Zika virus if Congress fails.
In the last four months, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention has spent $60 million to help states protect pregnant women, $25 million to strengthen their preparedness for and plans to fight the Zika virus, as well as $16 million to help it develop data collection systems to quickly detect microcephaly and other Zika virus-related symptoms.
Thailand's leader links attacks on tourist favorites with constitutional changes
The head of the Thai junta on Friday called on the country's population to be patient until the investigators found out what was behind this week's series of deadly bomb explosions in Thailand.
General Prayut Chan-och, junta chief and prime minister, said criminals were “bad people” protesting against the new Constitution, which was confirmed by the voters in a referendum on Sunday.
“There are still bad people, and they worked before the referendum,” he said.
The bomb explosions in five provinces on Thursday and Friday, including in Phuket and Huahin, among tourists in popular places, killed four and injured dozens of people.
The authorities claim that incinerators' attacks elsewhere in the country are linked.
Analysts say that the purpose of bomb explosions was not to kill many people, but to harm the tourism industry, one of the bright points of the Thai economy.
At least nine foreign tourists were injured in Huanhin.
“Whatever motives, explosions, and incendiary attacks overturn the junta’s claim that the post-referendum situation will be stable,” said Sunai Fasuk, senior researcher at Human Rights Watch.
These attacks have discrediting consequences for public authorities, terrorising society and harming the tourism-based economy.
Photo Thai rescue workers take care of Friday bombs in the explosion in Huahin injured.
Police claim that in their view these explosions are not linked to international terrorism or the prolonged Islamic unrest in southern Thailand.
They see attacks as \"local sabotage, not terrorism.
The timing and location of the selected attacks have a strong political symbolism.
The explosions took place on Friday, when people were ready to celebrate Queen Sirikita's birthday, which is considered Mother's Day in Thailand.
Four explosions drowned in the royal residence in Huaqin, about 125 miles from Bangkok, where most of the injured were also found.
The constitution prepared by the military will weaken the influence of political parties and give military powers even if the government is again under civilian control.
Hunta helped to secure its victory by preventing opponents from campaigning against it.
Murray Hibert, an expert in Southeast Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, pointed out that military officials suspected that the attacks were carried out by dissatisfied people.
The explosions were “exactly coordinated, but apparently focused on creating fear and anxiety rather than mass damage and loss and injury,” he said.
Last year, 20 people, mostly tourists from China, were killed in an explosion at the popular Yerevan temple in Bangkok.
Thai officials tied explosions with Uyghur fighters who were dissatisfied with the return of more than 100 Uyghurs to China.
General Preyut, who has been leading the junta since 2014, when the civilian government was actively suspended, said that this week's explosions \"paint the hearts of the Thais\"
Why, now that the country is better off, when the economy is better off, and when the tourism industry is better off, he said.
We need to ask why and who did it.
Gold reaction: what Simone Manuela's historic moment looked like
When I started the fight tonight, I tried to remove from my shoulders the blackness of the community, which is something I just put with myself in this position.
However, I hope that it will all go away.
I am more than happy for the fact that I can serve others as inspiration and hopefully diversify this sport.
However, at the same time, I would like to have a day when we have more, and it's not Simone, a black swimmer, because the term black swimmer makes it look like I shouldn't be able to win a gold medal or that I shouldn't be able to beat the record.
This is not because I work as hard as everyone else, and I love sports and want to win like everyone else.
Fight for student - Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (L.G.B.T.) - Defense of Colombia
Two years ago, 16-year-old Sergio Urrego fell off the shopping center in Bogota, leaving a message about his suicide on Facebook, citing Pink Floyd's song \"Goodbye Cruel World\"
His death was the beginning of the contradiction that erupted this week in Colombia, where efforts to expand L.G.B.T.'s rights were seen in the broader political struggles that have divided the country into two camps.
After his death, Urrego’s mother Alba Reijesa filed a court complaint against school officials, blaming them for the exclusion of her only son when she was found to have had an intimate relationship with him and his classmate.
A year later, Colombia’s Supreme Court issued a favourable judgment calling on schools across the country to develop a clearer policy to prevent discrimination.
The decision was part of a series of legal victories of the Colombian gay rights movement. A while ago, the said movement celebrated the adoption of a decision on the legalisation of same-sex marriages.
However, in their struggle for equality this week, they faced an obstacle, as Gina Perody, the minister of education who is openly gay, came to a scandal over the application of this rule in the scandal.
The scandal began when sexually exposed content from the pornography magazine began to circulate in social media, spreading the talk to people that it was part of a manual issued by the Ministry of Education.
Perody actively exposed it.
Although the Ministry offered schools assistance on issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity with the idea of helping them pay attention to the rule, it has not tried to impose standardized rules.
“What we want for schools is tools to resolve conflicts,” Mrs Perdodia said in an interview on Thursday.
The debate began ahead of the national debate on the future of the country, where peace talks will take place between the government and the revolutionary Colombian armed forces, or the FARC, partisan group.
The coalition of politicians in the opposition of the government and the leaders of the Catholic Church have mobilized extremely quickly, accusing the government of president Huana Manuel Santos of promoting one-sex union and gender change.
To make it even more complex, a government delegation that is negotiating with the FARC in Havana recently reached an agreement on gender and equality between L.G.B.T., which calls on the government to adopt a more inclusive policy.
The government's criticism and peace talks, which have been set aside for 42-year-old Perodia, the rising star of Colombia's policy.
They showed parups of posters, and some have also threatened to target violence against him and her partner, Cecilia Alvares-Korrea Glena, former trade ministers.
Perody kept an amazing peace throughout the week, trying to correct the mistake and resume the debate on constructive terms.
“What makes me stand and keep my head clear is the awareness that there are children who are still to be revealed,” she said.
This is a very stressful field of work and a very stressful time.
She also pointed to the link between the peace process and the debate on L.G.B.T. students.
While Colombians continue to assess the benefits of a deal with the FARC, which would be like an earthquake in the country, they need to think about the origin of the conflict, she said.
\"Is a peaceful state one that promotes inclusion or exclusion; or is one where everyone has the same opportunity - she asked the question.
Although she was not pleased to be the target of insults and accusations this week, she is pleased that in modern Colombia gay students can take an example from her and think that they can one day try to become ministers.
“It is very important to me that they are calm and aware that they can fully realise their potential,” Perodia said.
We cannot wait for a new suicide to begin to change something.
Save the vote in cybersecurity - The New York Times
“The U.S. is looking for ways to hold hackers around a piece of election urns.” (message article, August 4)
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
These changes may be necessary and should be considered immediately.
Cyber threats in various manifestations and the recent discovery that external forces, perhaps national states, are increasingly interested in the influence of our elections, demand that the federal government pay more attention to ensuring our electoral system and possibly consider it as part of our country's vital infrastructure.
Johnson should immediately communicate with thousands of national jurisdictions that help to conduct elections and offer assistance, advice and guidance to the Department of Homeland Security.
While the diverse and diverse nature of our voting infrastructure hinders efforts to ensure it, it tells us that the process should start as soon as possible.

On Thursday, falling from the carousel, a boy was injured and taken to Pittsburgh Hospital. The emergency service and park officials say this is already the third accident in the U.S. theme parks where children have suffered.
The child, whose name is not disclosed, is only taken to a children's hospital in Pittsburgh about 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of Aidlvailda and Soukzona theme park in Laijonyer, Pennsylvania, a spokesman for the Westmurland District Ambulance Services said.
The three-year-old boy, who visited with his brother while he was being helped on the spot, was unconscious, the park’s spokesman Jeff Kruhr told an e-mail.
The cruiser said that the Rollo Coaster attraction will be closed for the time of investigation.
Children must be at least 3 feet (91 cm) long in order to be able to go to the carousel, and those who are shorter than 4 feet (122 cm) must be accompanied by adults.
The attraction, according to the information published on its website, was built in 1938, and the State Department of Agriculture indicated that it had been tested in August.
The hospital spokesman refused to comment on the boy’s health condition.
On Sunday, a 10-year-old boy died from a neck injury from the world’s tallest water mountain in Kansas City, Kansas.

Japan's Prime Minister Abe on World War II will not visit a temple in which a memory of war is honored: Jiji
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
It’s a great way to make sure that you’re getting the best results.
The temple also honors the memory of 14 Japanese military leaders who are convicted as war criminals, and China and South Korea regard it as a symbol of Japanese militaryism.
Abe has not visited the temple since December 2013, when he announced that he has visited it to show respect to those who died for his homeland.
The new Japanese Minister of Defence, Tomomi Inada, has not answered the question of whether she will visit the temple, explaining that it is a question of conscience.
In the past, Inada, a close ally of Abe and a supporter of amendments to the Japanese pacifist constitution, has visited Jasukuni regularly.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
The relationship between China and Japan, Asia's two largest economies, has become more tense after the increasing presence of China's coastguards and other state ships near the disputed islands in the South China Sea, which is called Sentkaku in Japan, and Diaoudja in China.

Although there have been no conflicts with well-known militant groups in Brazil’s history, the government reports that the Olympic Games have made the country a more topical target, especially because of the participation of countries fighting against the Islamic State.
Its fighters control certain territories of Iraq and Syria, and the US-led coalition has carried out air attacks on them.
The group has supporters all over the world who have carried out civilian shootings and bombings.

The man contacted Adela Kermiča and Abdeus Malik Petitjana by telephone, who interrupted church service in Saint-Tierre du Ruve, West France, on July 26, and turned to the 85-year-old Roman Catholic pastor, Father Jacques Amel.
Both officers were shot.
The suspect had arrived from his home near Toulouse to the Senegal du Ruve and spent the night there in the days before the attack, the source said.
It’s a great way to make sure that you’re getting the best possible results.
Investigators are trying to find out whether Kermitch and Petitjan had associates in France and whether they were associated with the Islamic State that took responsibility for the attack.

Doruss de Vriess before switching to Celtic undergo medical examinations
Nottingham Forest Club goalkeeper Dorus de Vries arrived in Glasgow because he hopes to conclude an agreement on the transition to Celtic.
De Vries was photographed, entering Roshola Hospital before medical examination, after Hoops agreed on the conditions with Sky Bet Champions Club.
Brendan Rogers, the head of the Parkhead club, is looking for an experienced centre guard to have competition for the current first number, Kreig Gordon.
However, Rogers trusts the 35-year-old de Vries because he has worked with the Dutch at Swansea Club.
He played 51 games in Swansea under the leadership of Rogers in 2011 to win the right to move to Premier League.
He changed the Welsh form that summer to join the Williams and has been City Ground since 2013.
He also played in Scotland during his career after the season of Dunfermline, after moving back in 2006.
His stay in Realtendpark ended with a disappointment, however, as Pars experienced a double agony, being sent out in exile from the highest level before losing to the Celtic Scottish Cup.
The goal of the project is to create a sustainable environment for all of us.
Macy's will close 100 stores.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
Macy's regularly reduces its store's portfolio, often closing several dozens of insufficiently profitable stores immediately after annual holiday fever.
However, by presenting its summer statement that it will close 15 percent of its 728 trading venues, the shopping chains seem to have taken a much more aggressive stance than many similar retailers in terms of reducing the number of its stores, adapting to the highly changing shopping environment.
Pedestrians and buyers go past the Macy's store in New York City.
The retail giant announces that it plans to close 100 stores.
Macy's has many reasons to try to change things: many of its shops are located in small regional shopping centres, as the number of buyers has been particularly affected by e-commerce boom.
More difficult times have generally come to the category of supermarkets, as buyers increasingly choose lower price retailers such as T.J.Maxx and fast fashion players like H&M to buy clothing.
These factors, along with short-term difficulties such as the increasing international tourist spending and the weather conditions that have put Macy's in an unstable situation that has been stretching for more than a year, are not appropriate for the season.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
The retailer's revenue was $5.87 billion ($7.64 billion in Canada) by 3.9 percent less than last year.
Macy's said it would cost it about $1 billion in annual turnover.
And the closure of such a large number of stores at the same time could be considered to be the recognition of the failure of the retailer.
However, the value of the shares of the company fell by 17 percent on Thursday, which indicates that investors perceive this move as a proactive event, which tells about the stronger future of Macy's.
In a sense, the fact that Macy's reduces the number of stores should not be a surprise.
The Director General of the Retailer Terry Lundgren has said earlier that there are quite simply too many shops in the chain.
For some time, senior managers said they have adopted a new strategy, with a special focus on 150 of its most profitable stores, seeking to achieve higher sales at already advantageous points of sale.
Jeff Janet, Macy's director, who has been appointed to Lundgren since 2017, said in a statement almost all of the stores that the company plans to close are those where sales and profitability slip down.
“We are aware that we are not yet getting adequate return on investment on these trading venues and often do not have a level of customer shopping experience that reflects our efforts in relation to the Macy’s brand,” Jenette said.
The company announced that it will come up with a list of stores that will be closed later.
Macy's said that he was still deciding on closing shops and that it was not yet known exactly how many employees would be made redundant.
The retailer will not completely leave the main markets where it currently has shops, but it will think about closing down the shops located in less active places.
This move is unlikely to please shopping center managers who count on big tenants like Macy's to attract and hold other smaller shops in their shopping centers.
Is your bottle of water containing dangerous bacteria?
According to a new study, drinking from a re-filled bottle can be – a little worse than lowering your dog’s toy – given how many bacteria you will have to face.
Treadmill Reviews asked EmLab P&K to check 12 bottles of four different types of water - with a screw stopper, with a retractable cork, with a repressable cork, and with a straw.
Each bottle was taken by the athlete for a week without washing.
Your rechargeable bottle of water can be as dirty as your dog’s toy.
“Based on the 12 bottles we have tested, we found that reusable drinking water can have an alarmingly high number of viable bacterial cells: more than 300,000 colony-forming units per square centimeter (KVV/cm),” says Treadmill Reviews.
The largest amount of microbes, more than 900,000 colony-forming units per square centimeter (KVV/cm) were found in bottles with release caps.
Bottles included microbes that may cause skin infections, pneumonia or blood poisoning.
The bottle with pushable stoppers was the next worst with 162,000 kV/cm, while the containers with screw stoppers contained only a little less than 160,000 kV/cm.
“Drinking water from such bottles can be worse than eating from your pet’s container – is listed on the website.
A well-preserved picture is observed for straw bottles where only part of the bacteria in other bottles were found - only 25 KVV/sqm.cm.
This could be because the water is poured down to the bottom of the straw, rather than sticking to its edges, thus attracting moisture-loving microbes.
In straw bottles, microbes are described as “mostly harmless”
“Based on the results of our test, we recommend choosing a bottle with straw, both because of the low number of bacteria and the absence of harmful microbes,” said the website.
We also know that when it comes to bottles and bacteria, stainless steel is a better choice than plastic.
In addition, water bottles without cracks and difficult to clean places will have fewer microbes.
On the website, readers are advised to wash bottles after each use, ideally with a weak whitening solution.
Religion must become modern or be forgotten
In the United States, the Democratic Party recently nominated Hillary Clinton as its presidential candidate.
If the results of the last polls prove true in the elections themselves, in January, America will inaugurate its first president, a woman.
Last week, across the ocean, British Prime Minister Teresa Maya discussed Britain’s withdrawal from Europe with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Women raised in Western society are raised in such a way that they can be competent and successful in any field of professional activity, thanks to education, ambition and hard work.
And today, young girls can target on several existing role models, working in the top leadership field.
So, has the really long and hard struggle for equality between women finally ended?
Hilary Clinton is ready to become President of the United States at any time, but in the field of religion, women's leadership is still a controversial issue.
Okay, not completely.
In the religious field, women's leadership remains a controversial issue.
Last week Pope Francis announced the creation of a new commission to assess whether women should be consecrated as deacons in the Catholic Church.
The Church of England consecrated Libya Leinas as the first woman-bishop in January 2015, but it was only after an unsuccessful attempt in 2012.
While the reform of the Judaism movement has been given to women by rabbi since the early 1970s and by conservative movement since the early 1980s, the concept of female rabbi remains very strong in Orthodox Judaism.
In November 2015, the American Council of Orthodox Rabbits published a harsh message in its third attempt to stop an ever-increasing wave of support for the appointment of Orthodox women in the rabbi round that the concept of female rabbi is contrary to the law.
Not without irony, when Hillary Clinton was nominated as the presidential candidate, a group of America's leading Orthodox rabbis who oppose women's order launched a series of discussions on this controversial issue.
Why is there such a difference between secular and sacral?
Orthodox Judaism, like most other religions, seeks stability in what it considers to be long-standing traditional values.
This is manifested in the ability to resist pressure to adapt to changing society.
Those against the order of women do so on the grounds that it is not \"traditionally\"
However, taking over with the preservation of traditions in this way has its own price.
And the price of such unilateral thinking can paradoxically undermine the tradition in itself, subtracting from the traditional community the oxygen it needs to maintain vitality.
In the book “Aug Firearms – In the Military History of the First World War, Barbara Tačmena emphasizes the danger of giving priority to tradition in what has become known as “the tragedy of red trousers.”
Until the beginning of the First World War, when war went from war in nearby distances to a heavier artillery, which is transmitted from a further distance, it became beneficial to hide the soldiers for as long as possible.
The British and German armies responded to these changes by replacing their bright uniforms against boring gray and brown.
However, French soldiers still wore the same red hats and trousers that made them easy to use.
The French Minister of War Ādolf Messi's proposal that armies under his authority should act in a similar way was perceived with laughter and resistance.
Red trousers reflected the pride and prestige of the army, and military traditionalists were not ready to give up.
The former Minister of Military Affairs, Eugen Etienne, spoke on behalf of France.
“Rejecting the red pants, he called.
Never!
“This unexpressive and idiotic attachment to the most visible of all colors,” he wrote in the Messiah, “there had to be evil consequences.
The leaders of faith who fight for the inclusion of women in leading religious roles could fall into the same trap.
Focusing only on “traditional” religion, rather than asking an important question: “What change is needed to thrive in religion, they risk losing about 50 percent of their followers.
They also deprive the whole community of talent, skills and enthusiasm that women would otherwise provide.
It is important to note that this is not the case in the United States.
Dina Breivere is founder of JOFA (Women's Orthodox Feminist Association) in the UK and a student of orthodox rabbiism at Jeshivat Maharata in New York City.
It is also important to note that this is not the case in the United States, but in the United States.
It’s a great way to make sure that you’re getting the best results.
We arrived at the camp on the final day when children were very enthusiastic about glass jars.
It’s a great way to make sure that you’re on the right track.
The visit to the Einars Kalniņš joinery “Mazbebriņi” was also a great pleasure.
The most children liked laser engraver, because it was possible to see how the drawing, which is on the computer, is gradually applied to the board.

He also stressed the need to work with the brain rather than the muscles in this profession.
In a small shop there are individual orders, and it is important to plan everything first.
In order to get to know each other better when the camp started, participants participated in various games, as well as together formed camps – coat of arms –
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
There are also sports games that are of particular importance to participants.
We went to apartment houses, where we have a sports and recreation area, played football and a network ball.
Children love sports activities, we have a lot of boys playing football, basketball, and every time they demand something sporty.
Girls love more peaceful activities.
The next day, with the help of a self-hardening mass, we decorated jars, which can later be used as pencil holders.
There was also a talent evening, the children chose what they would perform with themselves, and one evening was devoted to performances.
It’s a great way to make sure that you’re getting the best results.
The task was to stand up differently in each picture.
We also painted mandalas - some like it more, some less.
There will never be one lesson that everyone will like - sport is closer to each other and creative classes.
“Now it seems that everyone is passionate about glass painting,” explained M. Folkmane.
At the end of the camp diplomas on creativity, sport, as well as help were issued - several children helped directly in economic works.
The name of the camp “Varaviksne Bridges” has been formed because children from three associations participate in it - Rojupes and Melnsils Children and Youth Initiative Centre, as well as the Roja Municipality Multifunctional Centre “Strops”
They are such unifying bridges.
If the sorcerers come up with something faster, we borrow ideas; if vice versa, they borrow from us.
We share experience.
This year 30 participants participated in the camp - children who were active during the year.
“I was expecting to have 30, and it happened,” says M. Folkmane.
The camp has been held for the fifth year.
It started in 2010 when the social service of Roja region decided that many children's families and children of poor families need to organize camps in summer.
It’s been a long time since I’ve been here.
The goal is to spend free time in a meaningful and comprehensive manner.
There were two camps in the past, and 20 children took part in each, while only one camp is held because of the decrease in the number of children in the country as a whole.
Similar activities are taking place over the next year.
It’s a great way to make sure that you’re getting the best results.
There is also a new technique - anchors, it is coloring with hot wax chalk.
It’s a great way to make sure that you’re able to get the best possible results.
We make paintings from natural materials, interesting mandalas from beans, peas, linseeds, we collect leaves in the autumn.
We are trying to use what is around us.
The youth center works from 15.00 to 20.00 in winter, while in summer - from 14.00 to 20.00.
“On average, 15 children attend the youth center per day,” says M. Folkmane.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
Charlton Athletic fans – can get a seasonal ticket only if they sign a behavioral contract – and will agree not to criticize the club on social media.
It is also important to note that this is not the case in the United States, but in the United States.
It’s a great way to make sure that you’re getting the best results.
The letter follows: “I must inform you that the award of the season ticket will be renewed on condition that you sign the ‘Harmonised Behavioral Agreement’ (ABC), which will stipulate that you will refrain from publishing disgusting or embarrassing comments on the club’s or club’s representative people on all types of social media websites or any other type of behaviour that could be considered antisocial.
When talking with Daily Telegraph, the fan described how he called the club after the payment of the season ticket, which it was not received, and two days later a letter was received by post.
Yesterday he went to a meeting at the club and said, \"They told me that I was too much -- tweeting -- making others tweet, too, that's funny.\"
Cycling holidays on Dalmatian coasts
What do you think with the word “scorpion”?
I was driving here from all the power,” said Collin, a former US Navy commander who had just traveled 25 miles along the central part of an uneven Croatian island without leaving anything there, except a bucket of sweat and a juicy sailors, anointed in the hostile mountains.
Some cyclists sing anthem or number of kindergarten poems to make it easier to get to the mountain.
I’m not sure if I’m going to be able to do that.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
Colin Lamamies are more poisonous than diverse.
It’s like you’re driving a few yards ahead of her, as if you’re going to have Hugh Grānts, as at the beginning of the movie “Four Wedding and One Funeral.”
Her mission and my mission is a week-long \"luxury\" yacht and cycling trip along the coast of the North Dalmatian Republic of Croatia and the islands organized by Freedom Treks.
Cycling in the summer heat along a steep hilly place like Croatia may not match everyone's understanding of luxury, but it is said that the Northern Dalmatian is easier to go than the Southern Dalmatian, our blankets are soft, and when we filled the booking forms, freely and confidently before all those months, there was a box that we did not mark that could have provided us with a battery-charged e-bike.
The luxury part of the deal is our floating house for a week, the brand-new Melody
At the end of the trip, we can throw our bikes into our guides to jump at the back of Ivana and Ivana and the ship to hear the blue water without facing sea hedgehogs, sharp stones and other people on the narrow rock lanes that the Croatians call the beach.
In June, the water temperature in the sea is perfect, everyone agrees: cool enough to cool, but not cold.
“Melody” has masks and breathing rubbing and some kayaks, if you feel energetic after a heavy morning on your blankets.
Instead, most of us are returning to our air-conditioned cabins where Helena, a ship masseur - I'm not joking - will have already covered our beds, added our minibar stock and left a new box with chocolates on the table.
Ivan says that biking is very important, and we learn to go to our beds or pillow-based resting chairs on the top deck together with Bartender Antonio, who is always ready to make one of his cocktails.
“Melody – 42 m long with 15 cabins and half a dozen crews, not multiplied super yacht, but a stylish small cruise ship.
It turns against a small island port between fishing boats and fleet holiday yachts, and we are proud to belong to it.
Colin and Petty belong to a group of meetup.com friends from Washington (the Columbus region): to sports and public activists after 45, as they themselves call themselves.
Last year’s boat and cycling holidays in the Netherlands were so successful that they decided to try something even richer, and so they are now in Croatia.
The competing chapel of their church is a boating and cycling holiday in Provence, and every afternoon the air is thickened by a competing Facebook publication pingpong rally.
The holiday adventure element can be overstated because our schedule is nothing if a specific mode is not set.
“Brokastis and dinner are eight,” Ivan told new participants at the opening meeting when we started the road from the beautiful old port of Trogir near Split.
One bell signal indicates that the buffet is open, while the other at the end of the meal calls for silence and careful listening to further information.
“Good morning, there is a cultural context that is probably lost everywhere, but not in the British contingent.
What's the difference - fun has already taken a turn, jokes are blowing like out of an abundance of horns, while Ivana releases day-trip maps, but we all pretend to be frightened by swings, contours, and profiles with ups and downs, although anything else would be a surprise on a Croatian cycling trip that starts and ends at sea level.
“It’s like a heart monitor,” says Ivan.
Completely flat is not recommended.
Ivan conducts an information meeting in parallel, freely switching from English to German.
There are weeks when he has to deal with dozens of different nationalities, but we are a simple group - Swiss, German, American and British - who easily sit at tables during meals, where two speak English and one German.
We are all friends on our way.
Cycling promotes co-operation, and the only competition is inside, i.e. with itself.
I don’t remember when the group dynamics would have been more harmonious and relaxed.
Soon we will feel like Ivan's wave.
A small climb is a slope that should not be confused with roughness, which is a good thing.
Matadatas are serpentines and straight forward means straight: simple, but not always easy.
The instructions for cycling are always the same: “Run one by one, hold a distance, and they’re not a race.
We meet at the beach in nine.
All right, five couples - I forgot you're on holiday.
Take a lot of water with you.
We will go from Trogir to the north on a two-day cruise through the Kornati Archipelago, where we will leave Dugi Otok, the Croatian language of the long island, almost all the way, and after a little bit of fun we will go on a walk through Telašcica Nature Park to admire its steep rocks and salt lake, where sea water flows through the underground canal.
It is said that those who swim in it, thanks to its strength, become younger.
If we run through it, will our feet feel younger and stronger?
On the small island of Molata, we turn south again, jumping from the continent to the nearby islands seemingly by chance.
Most of our trips are on empty small roads along the country's externals with wide sea views and a diverse plant country: olive bourgeois, vineyards, sharp plant brims, Mediterranean smells in the air and countless butterflies on the flight.
When we go forward, there is always a breeze, but when Ivan stops, there is always a big shadow, and small puddles are like a prize for those who come faster.
Sports and social activists go on a lot on weekends and they know the norms of behavior by sending warnings along the line and leaving free space so that moto riders can make overtaking maneuvers much safer.
“You’re almost hit,” one bike driver says to the other after the driver of a heavy car decided to take over the maneuver in an opaque curve and quickly crashed.
Luckily, the brakes worked.
Ivan divides us into three groups, each piece of short-stage driving along the main roads, with Ivan on his own back, in order to encourage and “give pace,” as Ivan says.
If we have to cross the main road, we all come together, get off bicycles and safety after the transition with our bikes on the other side as we have been instructed, not before.
“Do you think Ivan is aware that he doesn’t talk to a group of children – asks a Swiss biker when we stand on the road and wait for a signal when we can cross it?
Not all afternoons can be spent on relaxing.
The city is visited by the Roman Forum and a marine organ playing music that sounds like the sound of a prisoner sea monster, through stone-enclosed pipes in the promenade and open water.
The famous sunset of Zadar perfectly falls in the time between the main meal and the pudding, and after the arrival of darkness we return to the sea organ and observe the wave-operated lamp games in the glass trotute, which is actually a dance floor.
When Melody begins his journey to the lively Biograda resort early in the morning, the organ song is nothing more than a whisper.
On the fifth day we are completely free from cycling.
A trip up the estuary of the Krk River to view its waterfalls; then an afternoon sightseeing tour in Sibenika, where we look at the cathedral of thought, the masterpiece of the Dalmatian Renaissance, as well as a chair-time walk on the peaceful island of Zlarina, looking for its local treasure coral, make this day interesting.
Lurda is going to pick up pilgrims in the shade of the attack
It’s a great way to make sure that you’re on the right track.
The French security forces are in high alertness as thousands of Catholics gather at Lourdes’ annual pilgrimage in the shadow of several terrorist acts.
Every year on August 15, tens of thousands of people gather at the temple at the foot of the Pyrenees Mountains to celebrate the celebration of the Ascension to celebrate the reception of the virgin Mary in heaven.
This year, the pilgrimage takes place at a time when the Catholics were shocked by the killing of the old French priest on July 26 by two Islamic extremists who invaded the church in the north of France during the Mass and cut his throat.
Jacques Amel's murder took place two weeks after a Tunisian -- investigators say he was radicalized by jihadist online videos -- struck by a truck in the Bastille Day celebration in the city of Riviera in Nice, killing 85 people.
After three large-scale attacks over 18 months, many French people are cautious about attending public events.
The number of tourists fell sharply, and the authorities were concerned that this year’s number of pilgrims could fall rapidly.
However, fear of mass withdrawals did not materialize -- and some organisers say there has been even an influx of visitors' applications lately.
Some 25 000 believers are expected to arrive, including large groups from Italy and Belgium and about 200 East Christian branches - a delegation of Orthodox representatives.
Many pilgrims have declared that they will not be afraid.
“We do not intend to stop living,” a 66-year-old visitor, Christian, told AFP, describing prayer as “the only weapon” in the fight against violence.
“It’s important to show that life continues,” said Matier Guinar, one of the coordinators.
We will not give up our faith, our beliefs and our way of life just because some fanatics try to sow fear.
Due to security concerns in France, a number of large-scale measures have been lifted since the Nice attack, including a huge stock market in the northern city of Lille and the European Cycling Championship, which was due to take place in Nice in September.
“Last week I lived in fear that my phone would call in one call to withdraw applications,” Fabien Lezzene, the priest responsible for the official pilgrimage, said last weekend.
“On the contrary, the attacks seem to have mobilised believers,” he said and announced the influx of last-minute applications.
Christian Jell, head of local hotel workers’ union, confirmed his interest in the post-attack pilgrimage.
There was an extremely strict security measure around the holy place where Virgin Mary appeared in 1858 to a poor shepherd Bernadette Subiro.
Some 250 police officers and two dozen soldiers have been assigned to protect the site, including ball neutralization experts and experts with explosives in search of dogs.
As the pilgrims clashed through security barriers, bags were checked at the entrance, and the number of access points was reduced from twelve to three.
It is not easy to say that there is no such thing as a “nothing” or “no” in the world.
“By Thursday morning, there were armed guards in the temples, and then only one by one through the gate (with metal barriers), and bags were searched,” she said.
“All this frightened my three children who are accustomed to Lourdes, and it was hard not to scare them when they asked why this is happening,” she said.
It did not spoil my impressions, but I became sad that it was necessary, and I realized that many people were calmed down by these measures.
The route of Friday opening procession is also shortened - instead of starting in Lourdes and moving further to the temple, it will begin and end in the temple.
Other measures include closing the airspace for flights above Lourdes, closing streets near the traffic shrine and replacing waste urns with transparent plastic bags.
It’s a great way to make sure that you’re getting the best results.
About six million people travel to Lourdes per year, making it one of the largest Catholic pilgrimage destinations in the world.
Many visitors lead relatives who are sick or disabled and who come to swim in a source in which Bernadette has seen Mary, believing in the healing properties of water.
Trier Castio, one of the organizers, described this year's gathering as \"a little unusual\" given the threat that the roots seem to be looking for in France.\"
However, he argued that this would not affect the quality and depth of his experience.
François, a 58-year-old volunteer who helped sick pilgrims, admitted that she felt that the presence of soldiers dressed in civilian clothing was \"a little depressing\"
However, if it all calms down, it's good.
I’m not sure if I’m going to be able to do that.
Two people were seriously injured after a man discovered fire in a shopping center in Zaragoza in northeast Spain.
The incident took place at 11 a.m. on Friday morning at the full Aragonia Shopping Center in Zaragoza.
The initial reports show that the shooter could be a shot woman who could be his former partner.
After the shooting, the armed criminal fled and is currently looking for him by the police.

The opening of the hunting season of waterbirds is approaching.
Every year, on the second Saturday of August, a hunting season for waterbirds is opened.
This year it will start at 16:00 on August 13, so the State Police invites both hunters and residents to be especially careful and to comply with safety regulations.
It is not only in hunting areas, but also in public water bodies, and although weather conditions do not promise to swell as other years, it is permissible that holidaymakers will also use these bodies with hunters.
We invite both hunters and holidaymakers and those who live near water bodies to be especially careful in the vicinity of lakes and rivers and to observe safety regulations, thus not endangering either themselves or others.
This year, the State Police, in cooperation with the State Forest Service, will perform enhanced hunting control, since it has been observed in previous years that a large number of hunters are involved in hunting during the first days of the opening of the season.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
The police remind that it is prohibited to use semi-automatic firearms in the hunting of waterfowl, whose overall capacity is greater than three patrons, including the amendments to the Law on the Movement of Weapons and Special Means, in particular Article 22 (91), which states that persons with high-power firearms or high-energy pneumatic weapons registered for hunting or sport, and during a short stop to two hours when these weapons are transported to or from the hunt, have the right to store weapons and ammunition in the vehicle during hunting, but must be placed in the safest place possible, so that a case or other package containing ammunition or weapon would not be visible from the outside of the vehicle, located in a closed door and equipped with an alarm device, thus ensuring that they do not accidentally enter the hands of independent persons.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
In case of any danger, law enforcement officials are ready to respond to information provided by citizens.
New Caledonia’s coast is hit by a 7.2-magnitude earthquake
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
The Pacific Tsunami Alert Centre indicated that there were currently no warnings or recommendations regarding possible tsunami threats to the region.
“The earthquakes in this region are not uncommon, and activities are not uncommon in recent times,” said senior seismologist Phil Kabins, a research center in Geoscience Australia.
It could be felt in Vanuatu or in the New Caledonian islands, but I doubt whether it is strong enough to cause damage.
New Caledonia is located in the \"Fire Circle\" - Pacific Tectonic Activity Area, where earthquakes and volcanoes are frequent.
Colombia and Venezuela agree to open the border.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
Initially, the border points will only be open for pedestrians.
From Saturday, every day from 8 a.m. to 20 p.m., five border points will be opened.
The opening of the border for transport will be possible after the conclusion of separate international agreements on security, trade and energy, the Presidents said.
In August last year Maduro ordered the closure of the border in response to the Colombian militant attack on the Venezuelan border patrol.
Three Venezuelan soldiers were injured.
In July this year Venezuela opened the border unilaterally twice because of the sharp economic crisis - the poor Venezuelans tried to break through the border to buy first-time goods in border stores.
This opportunity was used by 200,000 Venezuelan citizens.

“Facebook – applies to blockers of ads.
The world's most used social network, Facebook, has sent such a warning shot, making it clear that blocking banner ads using special tools is unacceptable and users will also have to watch ads.
The popularity of ad blockers is increasing, but this means that companies whose main source of income is advertising are falling.
Facebook has now announced that it understands the annoying nature of advertising banners, but users will also have to live with them.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
“As we give people more and more control, we’ll also start to show ads to those who use ad blocking software – said Facebook’s Vice President of Advertising Business Andrew Bosvort.
In other words, users will be able to choose what types of ads they see when selecting brands and industries that they find interesting.
“People don’t like to see ads that don’t apply to them or interfere with the enjoyment of content,” Bosworth added.
Advertising blocking tools on mobile devices usually do not work, from which Facebook receives the largest number of visits, but their reduction in banner exposure is also estimated at billions in monetary terms.
According to the BBC, around 200 million people use blockers.
In the past quarter, Facebook’s advertising revenue has already been reported to be $6.2 billion or €5.55 billion.
It should be said that this is not the first time Facebook is actively involved in determining what network users see in their news feeds.
As one of the last steps, Facebook has just started to remove or at least limit news feeds from news feeds, headlines that actually hide empty messages.

In view of the fact that the company’s officials had not carefully followed the cash flow and trusted their employee, they only learned about the on-going machinations several years later.
This year, VP ENAP police arrested the woman who was born in 1963 and searched the company.
In relation to the event, criminal proceedings for seizure have been initiated, if it is done to a large extent.
The law on such crimes provides for deprivation of liberty for a period of up to ten years, confiscating property or without confiscation of property.
A security measure, which is not related to deprivation of liberty, is currently applied to the detained person.
In Estonia, Zika virus antibodies were detected in nine people.
In Estonia, nine people have been diagnosed with Zika virus antibodies, which means that they may have come into contact with the infection, according to the Estonian public broadcaster ERR.
The information provided by the laboratory shows that this year, the Zika virus tests were carried out on 121 samples and nine of them were positive.
The first cases of Zika have been reported in Finland and Sweden from countries nearby Estonia.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
We have detected IgG (immunoglobulin G-class) antibodies that show that the person being tested is infected with Zika or similar virus at some point.
“This does not mean that the patient is ill with the Zika virus,” explained Paul Naber, Head of Infectious Diseases at the Synlab Laboratory.
The Zika virus is transmitted by mosquitoes of the genus Aedes.
In Latvia, there is a problem with the development of high-quality car purchases, Ingus Rūtiņš, Vice President of Auto Association, told BNS in an interview.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
Of course.
It is also important to note that this is not the case in the United States, but in the United States.
As a result of the end of the car, in any case, a certain amount must be paid, because it must be purchased from the manufacturer.
However, the problem is and can be classified into two groups.
It is neither competent nor capable of producing high-quality procurement, which often leads to a lack of self-awareness, \"buying\"
“Is it very consciously that the purchase is built to get something concrete, and then there are all kinds of miracles,” said the vice president of the Auto Association.
He pointed out that it is now popular to talk about moving away from the lowest price offer to the most economically advantageous tender as the winner of the procurement, but in part of the society there is still a misconception about these things.
Now it is very popular - let's go from the lowest price to the most economically advantageous offer!
However, the criteria must be defined in both cases and, when taken into account and assessed, the decision is nevertheless taken on the basis of the lowest price principle.
In qualitative procurement, the technical criteria should be very precise and relevant to the market.
It is not necessary to judge by points anything that can be expressed in monetary terms.
It is not necessary to evaluate fuel consumption, emissions, service services and similar things with points.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
“The question is only about which scenarios the client is interested in – explained Rūtiņš.
In turn, the project manager of the Auto Association Pēteris Rubulis noted that problems are related to the fact that often the same person makes purchases for cars, work gloves and food, and these purchases are derived from a single sample.
We have also brought a purchase sample for spare parts to the consultation, otherwise it was difficult to name as a detailed absurdity.
“The problem is that the purchaser very often lacks any understanding of the subject matter of the purchase and the requirements are simply copied from somewhere,” Rubulis said.
It’s a great way to make sure that you’re on the right track.

Turkey seeks missing diplomats after coup attempt
Turkey is looking for at least 32 diplomats who, after the coup attempt of 15 July, did not return with the withdrawn personnel.
Foreign Minister Mevits Chavusoglas said on Friday that 208 Turkish ministry employees were withdrawn from the world-wide job search for the coup attempt to Ankara, and 32 disappeared without permission.
Some 18,000 civilians, military leaders and academics have been arrested or withdrawn from their positions in Turkey, according to the government as loyal to US official Fetul Gulen, who is accused of drawing up a government exit plan.
Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania, is on the list of the most sought-after people in Turkey.
It’s a great way to make sure that you’re on the right track.
This issue has become a problem for the United States in its relations with Turkey, a NATO member state.
The U.S. opposed the tactics of strong arming by President Redžeps Tajjips Erdogan after the coup, and Turkey responded by trying to establish closer ties with Russia.
Kavosoglu said that the Turkish military attachés in Greece had fled to Italy, the attache in Kuwait tried to escape to Saudi Arabia, but was sent back, and two generals from Afghanistan were caught in Dubai and sent to Turkey.
He also said that two officials fled to New York in Bangladesh, and one of Russia went to Japan.
The Daily Hurryiet newspaper of Ankara, citing military sources, reported that Turkey’s military attaché in Jordan was also missing.
The Wall Street Journal, citing a US official who is aware of the situation, reported that a Turkish military officer based in Virginia, at the NATO command centre, had applied for asylum in the United States.
There are those who have managed to escape.
There have also been refugees among our diplomats,” NTV said in an interview with Kavosoglu.
Since yesterday, the time for those who were initially withdrawn has expired.
We will take legal action against those who have not returned.
This is the first time I’ve been in the United States since the beginning of the 20th century.
The Olympic divers for whom training was planned on Friday came to the closed pool, because the organizers needed more time to clean the water of greenish shades before the first individual competitions in the Rio Olympics.
Water suddenly changed color on Tuesday, in the middle of the synchronised diving race.
The organizers claimed that water competitions are safe even after the larger adjacent pool for water polo and synchronised swimming, also painted lightly green.
It was not yet possible to dive when athletes came to the warm-up in the morning, although finally the pool was opened at 13:00 local time - only 2 1/2 hours before the women's 3 meter race.
The water color looked closer to its usual color, but still with a greenish shade.
The American dive, Ebby Johnstone, who competes on a trampoline, told her that she came to warm up just to find out that the pool is closed without warning.
She tweeted that #FixTheSwamp should be in fashion.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
Hopefully, this means that we haven’t been dive inside in the last few days like very bad!
Mario Andrada, the main speaker of the local organizer's committee, stressed that the pool for competitions is safe, giving green light to 3 meters ahead of the race.
He agreed that some athletes were disturbed by the water, but said it was the result of the pool cleaning efforts.
“We repeatedly repeat what we have said all the time – water in no way endangers the health of athletes,” he said.
On the first day of such a water situation, one or two athletes complained that they should have their eyes opened.
It was the result that the first reaction when we saw water getting green was to use one of the chemicals - chlorine - it is used very often in swimming pools.
We immediately reduced the quantity.
We checked the water again, and it fully met the parameters.
Simon Lengford, the main speaker of the Mary Polish Watersport Center, said that the pool was closed to carry out additional cleaning work.
He said that the decision was supported by the world’s leading organisation FINA (International Swimming Federation).
“The reason is that water must be calm so that the pool can return to its blue color as soon as possible,” Langford said in a statement.
Andrada said that the deterioration in the state of the pool has surprised the organizers unprepared.
“Chemics is not accurate science,” he said.
Some things, as you can see, last long.
In the last few days, obtaining rainwater paint in normal condition made it even more difficult.
“The rain is not working,” Andrada said.
He added that dry trainings were available to athletes in the morning, but admitted that it was “not ideal”
He explained that the change in the color of the pool was due to increased levels of alkalin, similar to the water of the aquarium can become green if not properly monitored.
When we started doing something to prevent green paint, there were discussions about the best chemicals.
We cannot use too much chemicals in water because athletes train in it,” Andrad said.
We would certainly have been able to take better action in the beginning to prevent water from becoming green.
When it became green, we made a mistake again.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
Shanghai, Taipei, despite stopping cross-border communication, however, will host a forum
It’s a great way to make sure that you’re getting the best possible results.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
The Forum has been organised by the two cities in rotation since 2010.
The 2016 Forum will focus on exchange of experience in areas such as health, electronic administrative services, culture and transport, in an effort to deepen the exchange of experience and cooperation in various aspects, between the two cities, as reported by the Shanghai Government.
The Taiwan side has not recognised the agreement reached in 1992 to strengthen the principle of one China since Tsai Ing-ven took office in May, which has led to the suspension of communication and consultation mechanisms.
On Friday, Ma Xiaoguang, a spokesman for the State Council of the Taiwan Office of Affairs on the land, said that a peaceful cross-border relationship could exist while the Taiwan side stands on the political foundations of the 1992 agreement.
“We have an active and open attitude towards the exchange of experiences between cities on both sides,” the MA said, stressing that the essence of cross-border relations and exchange of experiences between cities should be interpreted correctly.
The President of Uganda meets with Chinese Foreign Minister, hopes for closer cooperation
On Thursday, meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Vang Ji, Ugandan President Jover Museveni thanked China for its sustained development support and expressed hope for closer cooperation.
The Museveni said that China was an ancient friend of Uganda and Africa who supported the liberation of the African continent from colonialism and later supported Africa's economic and social development.
The President mentioned the construction of the Tanzania - Zambia railway in the 1970s as evidence of generous support from China, which was provided even when China itself was not particularly prosperous.
Museveni said that China has implemented multilateral cooperation with Uganda through both infrastructure and entrepreneurship investments and cultural exchanges, and added that this type of cooperation contributes to the long-term development of Uganda more than simply providing financial assistance.
He hopes that China will be able to engage in various ways in the development of Uganda's infrastructure and the construction of industrial parks.
He also calls on the Chinese to invest more in Uganda and to travel around it.
Vang She praised Uganda's efforts in the fields of industrialisation and modernization of agriculture and added that China will continue to be the most reliable and ideal partner for Uganda.
Wang stated that China was ready to do its utmost to help implement Uganda's economic and social development and added that Chinese-Uganda cooperation is genuine and without any political considerations, as it is based on a high level of political credibility and over time tested friendship.
He said that China could strengthen cooperation with Uganda in the construction of infrastructure and industrial parks, as well as support the development of the energy and agricultural sectors of this East African nation.
