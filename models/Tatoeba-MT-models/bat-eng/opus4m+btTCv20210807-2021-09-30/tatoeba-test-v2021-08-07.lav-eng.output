When an English-speaking person notices that the foreigner with whom he speaks does not understand anything from what he says, he repeats exactly the same, but louder, as if this person were deaf. At no point does he come to mind that the choice of his words could be complicated, or that his expression could be easily inconceivable to the foreigner, and that he could say it simpler with other words. As a result, a person not only does not understand what he says, but also becomes irritated with the fact that he is considered deaf.
