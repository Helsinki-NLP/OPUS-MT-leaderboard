MG Baltic case: Gustainio’s new lawyer says he has not yet been able to get acquainted with the file
All the defendants took part in the 11th sitting of the Mag Baltic Court on Monday: Šarūnas Gustavis, Gintaras Steponavičius, Vytautas Gabšys, Eligijus Masiulis and Raimondas Kurlianskis.
The hearing began with testimony from the accused.
At the last court hearing, the new lawyer of the state, Mr Gustavi, Alexander Doroshev, told the panel not yet able to get acquainted with the file.
Linas Belevicius, a lawyer at MG Baltic, then stated that in order to ensure full protection of the person, the Judicial College must allow the new lawyer to get acquainted with the file and request that a court hearing be postponed.
In order to ensure the protection of a person, he must have access to the materials of the criminal case.
This is not just a formal sit-down, said L. Belevicius.
The new lawyer, A. Doroshev, noted that he had not been able to get acquainted with either the accused act or the entire case file.
In a previous court hearing, the suspect, Mr Gustavis, said he would refuse his lawyer because he could no longer pay him.
Sounds were also heard at the meeting.
Lawyers of the accused have been outraged that the audio recorded by the court is of poor quality.
Law enforcement suspects that politicians, by taking bribes from MG Baltic, supported or initiated decisions favourable to the concern in the Seimas and other state institutions, as well as had an impact on determining the winners of public procurement, reminds ELTA.
During the pre-trial investigation, more than 150 persons were interviewed, more than 50 of whom were members of the previous and current Seimas, several former ministers, and members of the European Parliament.
More than 200 surveys and more than 30 surveys have been carried out.
Gustainis is suspected to have received a bribe for more than 8 thousand euros, Steponavičius for 15 thousand euros and V. Gapsys for more than 27 thousand euros. Masiulis is suspected to have taken a bribe for more than 106 thousand euros.
The Labour Party is suspected of bribery and trade in influence, the Liberal Movement - bribery, trade in influence and abuse, and the MG Baltic is suspected of bribery and trade in these parties.
Politicians are suspected to have negotiated bribery with MG Baltic Vice President R. Kurlianskis and subsequently proposed or supported initiatives favourable to the Group in the Seimas or other institutions.
Ethical Guardians: The Board of the Liberal Movement on the Law of Action of the Vilnius Division
“The decisions taken by the board are in accordance with the articles of association – after the meeting of the commission, its head Vytautas Tamošiūnas informed BNS.
“Our decision was not something new.
We had already made an explanation of how the commission had done in July, when the question of the Pagans and Utena was raised.
Then we said that, according to the statute, this is a question of competence of the board.
And if the board decides that any department can act as it wants - go with the committee and the board agrees, then the board can go, but if the board decides that there will be party lists everywhere, what the board and adopted, then it is the decision that all divisions will form party lists.
And if you don't agree with the board, then there's an opportunity to stop membership and go with the committee.\"
According to Tamošiūnas, the party board will decide on further actions.
On 17 October, the Liberal Movement Board of the Party annulled the decision of the Vilnius City Division to participate in municipal elections not with the list of the party but with a new electoral committee.
According to the Board of the Party, the decision of the liberals of the capital to participate in elections in the form of a public election committee violated the articles of association of the party and decisions of the board.
By October 31, Vilnius Department had to cancel its attempts to participate in municipal elections with the committee list.
But the department did not do that.
The former head of the division, Aušrinė Armonaitė, has already left the Liberal Movement.
The mayor of Vilnius, the former Chairman of the Liberal Movement Remigijus Šimašius, who promised to seek another head of the capital, has already presented the team and ideas of the public election committee “For Vilnius, which we are proud of.
He left the party too.
Elections of municipal councils and mayors will take place next year.
The villagers in northern India were driving a tractor that had previously crashed a man, officials said Monday.
Forest care officer Mahavir Kaujagi said that the Tigres had broken the field after the man who was working in the fields was crushed late Sunday, the villagers surrounded the animal and, as the woman tried to escape, drove it with a tractor.
Residents say that the tiger also attacked and insinuated one young man about 10 days ago.
The village is located in the Dudhva Tiger Reserve in the Lakhympur Kheri district, about 250 km southeast of the capital Laknau, Uttar Pradesh.
The closure of tigers in protected areas shall be prohibited.
Drought Director Ramesh Pandey said the Wildlife Conservation Act would inform the police of the case.
In April, in the Nighasan district of Uttar Pradesh, the villagers beat another tiger, who suffered serious injuries.
Tiger is India’s national animal; according to the Wildlife Conservation Act, tigers are considered a endangered species.
Last year’s government figures show that at least one person died every day during the previous three years’ clashes with wild tigers or elephants.
The number of human conflicts with tigers has gradually increased since the 1970s, when India launched a tiger protection program that created reserves in national parks and saw the galibianization of large cats as a crime.
Although tiger calculation methods changed, censuses would indicate that the then population of approximately 1,800 tigers grew to 2,226 individuals in 2014.
It is proposed that cats and dogs should be marked with microchips.
Kęstutis Mažeika, Chairman of the Committee on Environmental Protection of the Seimas, together with other members of the Seimas, registered amendments to the Law on Animal Welfare and Protection, which propose mandatory labelling of cats and dogs with subcutaneous microchips.
“We propose that cats and dogs should be marked with subcutaneous microchips and that their registration and labelling should be organised by local municipalities, the Ministry of Agriculture and the State Food and Veterinary Service.
In 2019, all dogs will be marked free of charge with state funds, and in 2020, cats will also be marked free of charge, so the residents will not be concerned and the costs will be covered by special state funding,\" said Kęstutis Mazeika, Chairman of the Seimas Committee on Environmental Protection.
The amendments aim to address the systemic need for pet labelling.
This is expected to help avoid problems caused by irresponsible animal breeders, illegal breeders or sellers.
It is provisionally assessed that, on the basis of the expected average cost of providing the microchip and the service, which will amount to around EUR 5 during the transitional period, all animal owners will be compensated.
The total cost of all pet labelling can be up to €6 million.
The need for these funds is expected to be distributed over three years and will be 2 million euros a year.
It is expected that the funds for labelling programmes will be allocated through the special programme for the support of the environment of municipalities, whose income this year will increase significantly due to increased taxes on natural resources and the redistribution of funds.
Municipalities will be able to use these funds not only for cat and dog labelling, but also for castration and other programs.
According to Mažeika, the practice of mandatory labelling is widespread in almost all countries of the European Union, which also allows to protect the animals themselves (because the lost can easily be returned to the owners), and saves the time of the animal breeders themselves, when the search for the escaped and lost pet has to take a lot of time and money.
In addition, EU legislation provides that travel is only possible with marked pets.
At the same time, labelling requires responsible care of the animal throughout his life.
The previous mandatory proposals were opposed because the programmes concerned were offered to finance the population.
“The model that is now being presented should avoid these criticisms, as it is proposed to fund animal protection through increased income in the environmental support programme and the right to label it not only to veterinarians, but also to society, i.e. to persons of animal care institutions who have received special courses at the Veterinary Academy,” the project’s authors said.
The draft law was registered by a group of Seimas members representing different Seimas factions - Kęstutis Mažeika, Algimantas Dumbrava, Eugenijus Gentvilas, Edmundas Pupinis, Rimas Andrikis, Antanas Vinkus and others.
13 members of government forces killed in Taliban attack in eastern Afghanistan
The provincial governor's spokesman, Arif Noori, said seven soldiers and six police officers were killed.
He added that four other soldiers were wounded during an attack on a joint army and police control post in the Chogyan district.
Noori said six fighters were killed in a three-hour battle with Afghan forces and ten other Taliban soldiers wounded.
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid issued a statement to media in which the movement assumed responsibility for Monday's attack in Ghazni province.
Noori said the post was set up two days ago in a strategically important area to cut off the Taliban supply route.
In the attack, the post was completely destroyed.
“Tomorrow is a helping hand for the Ukrainian club.
On Wednesday, the Vilnius-Ryto arena will host the fourth round of the FIBA European Cup, where the clubs of Kosovo and Ukraine will meet.
A duel will be held in the capital for political reasons.
The Vilnius-East team of Cherkaski Mavpy and Pristina KB Prishtina will already accept warm ties with Ukrainian basketball on the 7th of November under their roof at the Ryto Arena.
“For political reasons between Kosovo and Ukraine, we were not able to organize this match at home, so we are very pleased that our friends from Vilnius agreed to accept us,” said coach Maxim Michelson, head of Ukraine team.
We have a lot of friends in Vilnius, and our countries always agree well with each other.
Lithuania is one of the best basketball traditions in the world, so it will be a real honor for us to play here.
We hope that we will get support from the people of Vilnius.
The Kosovo team could not come to Ukraine because these countries do not have any diplomatic relations.
Currently, the Ukrainian team takes third place after the first round with one victory in three meetings, while the Kosovo team is in second position and has more victory.
This will be a very important challenge for Group E, since only two teams will enter the next stage.
In the past, in Vilnius, there was also a selection of Ukrainian and Kosovo teams for the 2017 European Basketball Championship.
Then the victory of 100:61 was celebrated by the Ukrainian team.
Basketball fans will be able to access the match for free on Wednesday, and the start of the duel will be 7 pm.
\"Women Lie Better - star actress B. Arsobaitė is persecuted by liars
It’s probably just a coincidence, but the charming brown-headed actress Brigita Arsobaitė has been playing roles related to liars for a number of years.
Originally, the series \"Women Lie Better - then the performance \"Melgae\" and finally the comedy \"Melgae\"
In this film, Brigita plays the wild wife of Dainius Kazlauskas.
“I loved filming in Melaghi, because I’m more a theatre actress and I rarely appear in cinema.
A wonderful team of colleagues from the beginning promised a great result.
This experience is very important and valuable to me.
But the most interesting thing that happened on the ground was the puppy Sunny!
Throughout my life, I thought if I had a dog, it would be big and serious.
I never admired those little, decorative-fifties-four-legged ones.
But during the filming, Sunny so attached to me that the sympathy became mutual and eventually I even wanted to buy it from the hostess, but unsuccessfully – smiled at the actress.
The comic and intriguing peripetia of family members has been brought up since the first minutes by a new Lithuanian comedy “Melgai” produced by Lithuanian film hits “Inexperienced” and “Among our boys...” producer Paulius Virbickas and producers Stasys Baltakis and Vladimiras Razarionovs.
Your lover has just said - she's waiting.
It would be great news, just... your beloved is your brother's wife!
But that's not all.
Without being able to publish to everyone – the good news – parents suddenly declare – they are different!
After 50 years together...
And all this happens just before the most beautiful holidays of the year - St. Christmas!
But the end will surprise even more, because no one expected such atomics.
All the heroes are not as they seem at first glance...
In addition to B. Arsobaitė’s comedy “Melgai“, four-time film stars will present to the audience: Giedrius Savickas, Dainius Kazlauskas, Edita Užaitė, Giedrė Giedraitytė, Lubomir Laucevičius, Larisa Kalpokaitė and Gediminas Girdvainis.
The comedy \"Melgai\" has been in China since 9 November.
Deciding whether to write off 100 million euros of unpaid taxes
On Tuesday, the Seimas adopted an amendment to the law on the declaration of the place of residence, drawn up by “Farmers” leader Ramūnas Karbauskis.
56 members of the Seimas voted in favour, 9 against, and 25 abstained.
The Seimas will continue to consider amendments on December 6 or later, subject to the Government's conclusion.
According to R. Karbauskis, these contributions are calculated for people who have not declared their departure from Lithuania.
According to the MP, one person does not pay about 1,000 euros in three years, and now there are about 100,000 people.
Social-Democratic Algirdas Sysas regretted that the Seimas would \"promote some people not to abide by their obligations\" to declare departure and then no taxes would be charged.
Antanas Matulas, a member of the Health Committee, noted that Lithuanians living abroad use the fact that by paying a small health insurance tax, they come to Lithuania for treatment – they are provided with the same services as those who pay this tax to residents.
The amendments provide that those who leave Lithuania will be considered to be those who will pay social insurance contributions in the states of the European Union, the European Economic Area or the Swiss Confederation, and Sodra will be exempted from paying health insurance contributions in Lithuania.
“The head of Sodras Mindaugas Sinkevičius has previously said that such a step will make life easier for people who have emigrated, as well as for the activities of Sodras.
Video about a slippery bear on the Internet reveals a serious problem
Filmed as the mother bear climbs on a steep snowy slope, and the baby keeps sticking, slips down and climbs up again.
The video received a lot of comments and comments.
People admired the perseverance of the little bear - repeatedly slipping down, he climbed to his mother again.
He does not succeed at the first time, but the little one does not even try to give up and finally achieves his goal.
The video really belongs to the attention, but it also reveals the threat that humans pose to animals.
Scientists argue that it is also necessary to talk about the fact that people’s desire to know the wild can sometimes be harmful.
“It is clear to me that the bear drone was terrified.
From their movements, it is seen that they panic.
If the drones weren’t flying around, they would probably have chosen a safer route, or if they had overcome it more slowly or more carefully.
This is a great example of how drones shouldn’t be used,” Mark Ditmer, an ecologist, told The Verge.
A while ago, Ditmer and his colleagues studied how drones affect bears.
The animals were equipped with heart work gauges.
When the drones approached, some of the bears let themselves run, others didn’t run anywhere, but all of their hearts began to beat more often from fear.
Scientists advise animals to use drones responsibly, not to fly too close, not to make noise and not to fly where it is forbidden.
The runaway president was addressed in a newspaper.
Kiev court on Tuesday called on ousted President Viktor Yanukovych, who resigned to Russia, to attend an unusual meeting on his alleged betrayal, a call announced in the official official publication of the state.
In a court summons, published in the government news newspaper Uriadovoj Kurjer, the former leader is invited to attend the November 19 criminal proceedings meeting to hear his final arguments.
The document states that Yanukovych has the right to attend the meeting by video communication.
On 30 October, the Kiev court closed the debate in Yanukovych's case.
Yanukovych’s lawyer in Russia, Alexander Goroshinsky, was given the opportunity to register in the register of foreign lawyers by November 19 so that he could attend a meeting where Yanukovych is expected to say his last word on video.
Yanukovych, backed by the Kremlin, was ousted and fled to Russia during the Maidan uprising in February 2014, sparked by the president's refusal to sign an association agreement with the European Union.
Russian President Vladimir Putin later revealed that the former Ukrainian leader was taken to Russia during a special operation organized by Moscow.
In March of that year, Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula to Ukraine, and later a war broke out in the east between Kiev and Russian-backed separatists.
Since then, the fighting has killed about 10,000 people despite many attempts by the international community to secure a lasting ceasefire.
Valdas Benkunskas will lead the list of conservatives to Vilnius City Council
The former Minister of Economy, MP Dainius Kreivys, has already been approved as a conservative candidate for a year.
On the weekend during the first election of conservatives, party members ranked the list of candidates for the Vilnius City Municipality Council.
According to the party, V. Benkunskas, Chairman of Vilnius Divisions Meeting of the TS-LKD, became the leader of the list of conservatives.
Paulė Kuzmickienė, Adamas Bužinskas, Gediminas Švilpa, Audrius Skaistys, Rasa Bashkienė, former Seimas member Liutauras Kazlavickas, Young Conservative League chairman Mantas Benkauskas, Arūnas Valinskas and Goda Karazijaite were among the first ten candidates.
Direct elections of mayors and municipal councils in Lithuania will take place on 3 March next year.
Limits on cogeneration plants appealed to the Constitutional Court
The opposition of the Seimas, as promised, appealed to the Constitutional Court (KT) against the decision of the ruling authorities to adopt a law on the possibility of stopping the construction of waste incineration plants.
On Tuesday, the opposition group of the Seimas’s Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) announced that a group of Seimas members had applied to the CC for an investigation into the compliance of the ruling amendments to the Waste Management Law with the Constitution.
“The Parliaments emphasize that the provisions of the law aim to question projects of waste incineration plants that are already in operation, by instructing the Government to impose new restrictions (20 km from the residential area) until the entry into force of the law on the construction of waste incineration plants started in Vilnius and Kaunas,” the statement said.
“The Parliaments note that, in view of the way in which the Law formulated the prohibition on the construction of objects of state importance for waste management (i.e. the definition of distance and the definition of “residential territory”), it is necessary to conclude that this prohibition is disproportionately restricted or even negated the essence of the right to carry out economic activities related to the incineration of waste for the production of energy, because the established criteria are formulated in such a way that, after assessing the density and distribution of the population of Lithuania in the country, it would be practically impossible to build such objects throughout the territory of the country,” it is added.
It is stated that the law passed is contrary to the constitutional principle of the rule of law.
“The KT has repeatedly indicated that the legislation does not apply to those legal facts and consequences that occurred prior to the entry into force of the new legislation.
In this case, the Government is given the power to apply the law back, in accordance with an uncertain criterion.
The establishment of such a legal regulation violates the constitutional principles of legal certainty, legal security, protection of legitimate expectations, and therefore the constitutional principle of the rule of law - is indicated in the referrals.
It also notes that significant financial investments have already been made in the projects of Vilnius and Kaunas cogeneration plants.
With the suspension of the current projects, the state would suffer not only 100 million financial losses, but also huge losses to the Lithuanians - heating prices would increase, as a result of the increase in the amount of waste disposal in landfills would increase environmental pollution.
Address to the CC was signed by members from the Seimas TS-LKD, Liberal Movement, Social Democratic factions and senior vice-president of the ruling Social Democratic Labour Group Algirdas Butkevičius.
A couple of weeks ago, the Seimas managed to collect 71 votes to reject the amendments to the Waste Management Act adopted by President Dalia Grybauskaitė’s veto, which provide for the right of the Government to suspend the construction of cogeneration power plants, and also established a 20 km zone from the settlements for the construction of such power plants.
Amendments to the Law adopted repeatedly by the Seimas will come into force from 1 January 2019.
This proposal is planned to be discussed in the autumn session of the Seimas.
However, the government's right to suspend the already started projects is not planned.
The CC will deal with this case in order - no earlier than a year later.
Publicizes LeBron James Statistics at Lakers Club
The beginning of LeBron James’ career at the Los Angeles Lakers Club is not the same as he expected, the organization and basketball fans.
“Lakers” started the season with four victories and six defeats, and such a weak start helped rumors over the alleged dismissal of coach Luke Walton.
However, such speeches were calmed by the president of basketball operations, Magic Johnson, who said he would not forgive the coach, but that he needed to play better.
The biggest star in the team, James, should also turn to himself.
Although the statistics of the attacker are usually impressive - 26.8 point, 7.6 rebound ball and 7.7 effective transmission.
However, it does not tell the whole truth.
In the first ten games of the season, other figures showed that Lakers played better when there was no James in the field.
+/- statistics showing how many points the team throws or spends when there are certain players on the field.
That's when James is in the square, Lakers spent 30 points more this season than their rivals.
When he was sitting on the bench, he won 19 points more than his rivals.
The Lakers Conference is just 13th in the West, but a few victories can turn it all upside down.
Spain will continue to contribute to Lithuania’s airspace protection
The meeting noted that Spain will contribute to the protection of airspace in Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia in 2019 and 2020.
“Lithuania appreciates Spain’s cooperation with NATO and its significant contribution to ensuring the security of our country and the region,” Minister Linkevičius said.
The Spanish Air Force has already carried out five NATO Air Policing and Air Policing strengthening missions in the Baltic States, three times in Lithuania.
The last time the Spanish Eurofighter was deployed in Šiauliai in May-August this year.
In addition, Spain will contribute to the protection of airspace in Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia in 2019 and 2020.
The Minister also noted that regular consultations were held between Lithuania and Spain on the issues of security, political, economic and strategic communication in the fight against propaganda.
Linkevičius expressed hope that Lithuania and Spain will continue to work closely on European, transatlantic and other multilateral issues.
Since 2004 when Spain opened its embassy in Vilnius, Ambassador Jose Maria Robles Fraga is the fifth representative of Spain in Lithuania.
On 29 October, Jose Maria Robles Fraga presented letters of credence to President Dalia Grybauskaite.
V. Ačienė about the detention of R. Ačas: I believe in the innocence and law enforcement of a man
“It was the most unexpected thing I could ever think of.
On the other hand, the services are likely to do the work that they need to do.
We all do our job.
I believe in law enforcement, I believe in my husband that everything is right and fair, that no unfair action by him should be done,\" Mr Ačienė told BNS.
The Special Investigation Service (STT) detained Ač on Monday - law enforcement suspects he took a high-value bribe while in exchange he could create exclusive conditions for a private company that signed a contract with the municipal-run Raseiniai Bus Park.
Representatives of private companies are suspected of buying Ača directly or participating in masking bribes for various financial transactions.
Raseiniai District Municipality Council dismissed R. Ača in April of this year as head of the administration on a third test after his distrust.
He became a member of the newly established Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party, led by Gediminas Kirkyl, and on Monday he suspended his membership of the party.
Achas, a few years ago, failed in the mayor’s election as a representative of the election committee “Your Raseiniai”.
V. Ačienė says that the man did not intend to raise his candidacy in the elections of the mayor of Raseiniai next year, but had not yet decided whether he would not participate in the elections of municipal councils.
V. Ačienė was elected to the Seimas with the list of Lithuanian peasants and greens, she is a member of the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission.
The politician says she will look forward to further law enforcement action – it will depend on whether she leaves her job in the commission.
“I’m not going to make a decision today, I think I’m going to make a decision this week.
I will see if there is a need for what charges have been made, of course, I will make one or another decision.
Perhaps I need to stay away from all the things that are being investigated in the Anti-Corruption Commission, but again - the time will come for everything in its place,\" she said.
Radvilė Morkūnaitė-Mikulėnienė, a spokeswoman for the opposition conservatives, called on the Speaker of the Seimas Viktoras Pranckietis and the head of the peasants Ramūnas Karbauskis to distance themselves from the statements of the political colleague Vida Ačienė and to withdraw her from the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission by moving her work to another Seimas Committee or Commission.
She claims that the continued work of V. Ačienė at the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission would create a public-based mistrust and discredit the work of the important parliamentary supervisory commission.
Sensual “Coldplay” music attracted well-known Lithuanian couples

The band changed its name to Coldplay, and just twenty years ago, it released its first record, Safety, containing three pieces.
Of the 500 copies, most were distributed to radio stations, producers, and friends, with only 50 copies of Safety.
Coldplay is now a world-renowned, respected and beloved band that has released seven albums that have sold over 100 million copies.
Over the past two decades, the group has won 107 various awards, including nine Brit Awards and seven Grammys.

Grybauskaite calls on China to create a more favourable investment environment for EU businesses
President Dalia Grybauskaitė calls on China to create a more favourable investment environment for investments by the European Union (EU) countries and to facilitate the conditions for foreign imports.
With the opening of the Trade and Investment Forum in Shanghai, Grybauskaite stressed that seeing signs of economic slowdown, the common goal of Europe and China should be \"to unite efforts to halt the spread of protectionism in the world, addressing the fundamental causes of tensions caused by trade wars, \"excess production and unfair competition\".
\"The European Union has a very important commitment from China to create a more attractive, open environment for investment, which is important in negotiating a trade agreement with China.
It is important to conclude this trade agreement as soon as possible, ensuring that foreign businesses feel welcome and safe here, as well as strengthening the protection of intellectual property,\" Grybauskaite said.
China's opening up is important not only for Europe, but also for this country, as well as for global economic growth.
The President stressed that transparency of investments should be “more than interests of any business group”
“The transparency, the rule of law, strict compliance with international treaties – this must be an essential element for the environment of new investment relations,” Grybauskaite said.
“Corrupted capital flows should not be expected in any country in the world – not just here or in our countries.”
China’s import exhibition is trying to alleviate criticism of avoiding opening up its market and protecting only its own companies.
The exhibition is attended by several heads of state, more than 2800 companies from 130 countries and regions of the world, including Lithuania.
According to the Lithuanian Statistics Department, China currently ranks 25th among its export partners.
Last year, Lithuania’s exports to China grew by 50 percent, reaching 180 million euros.
At the same time, the volume of imports from China exceeded EUR 820 million.
Some officials worry that Chinese investments in Lithuania could have an undesirable political impact, while Beijing’s exclusive focus on Eastern Europe divides the unity of the EU.

Lion Air's plane crash causes death: family anger
The data from the black box of the crashed Indonesian Lion Air airline show that at least four of its last flights have experienced a speed meter malfunction, researchers said Monday.
The chairman of the National Transport Security Committee, Soerianto Tjahjono, said a similar incident occurred during the last four flights, including the fateful one when the plane crashed into the Java Sea on October 29 shortly after its take-off from Jakarta.
All 189 people on board were killed.
Many media reported problems during the previous Boeing 737 MAX 8 flight from Denpasar to the capital of Indonesia.
“When we opened the black box, yes, the actual technical problem was the speed in the air, in other words, the speed of the plane,” Tjahjon said at a news conference.
\"The black box data showed that during the two flights before the flight Denpasar-Jakarta was also the same problem,\" he added.
“There are a lot of rumors on social networks.
Now we want to explain that in the black box (data remained) about four flights, during which there were problems with the speed of the air gauge,\" the head of NTSK said.
During a meeting with family members of the dead, Tjahjono said the information from the flight recorder was consistent with reports that the plane had changed its speed and altitude when its last flight was up.
Search teams have not yet found the second black box to record conversations in the cockpit.
Lion Air said it had been repaired according to the manufacturer’s recommendations in case of technical failure during the Bali-Jakart flight.
One of the founders of the company, Rusdi Kirana, was not invited to speak to Minister of Transport and Communications Budi Karyos Sumadi, who moderated the meeting of family members with officials overseeing the search for the remains of the plane and the victims and the investigation of the disaster.
But he stood up and bowed his head when angry and sad family members demanded Kirana, who founded Lion Air with her brother Kusnan in 1999.
“Lion Air did not act properly,” said a man who presented himself as the father of a passenger, Shandy Johan Ramadhan, who worked as a prosecutor on the island on which the plane flew.
\"I want Mr. Rusdi Kirana and his team to pay attention,\" he said.
Since the beginning of the crisis, Lion Air has never contacted me.
We lost our child, but Lion Air didn’t show us any compassion.
After the meeting, Kirana left quickly, avoiding questions from journalists.
Many families are waiting for the results of a long process of recognition of the dead.
Nearly 140 corpse-bags loaded with human remains were handed over to police medical experts.
So far, only 14 victims have been identified.
The relatives asked why a plane launched two months ago was allowed to fly, although a crash occurred on a October 28 flight from Bali to Jakarta, which led to a sudden downfall that frightened passengers immediately after taking off.
\"Lion Air\" said that the crash had been eliminated.
Is it true that the problem has been solved? asked the son of one of the dead.
- If not, the appropriate technicians must be held accountable.
The law is very clear, not they said the plane was allowed to take off again.
These bad technicians must respond in accordance with the law so that the plane crashes in Indonesia do not happen again.
Tjahjono said a large amount of fine debris and the fact that the debris spread to a relatively small area showed that the liner was likely to hit the water at a very high speed.
“The plane was solid when it crashed into the sea.
He did not explode in the air, and the engines of the plane, when he touched the water, operated with large turns, as shown by all the broken turbine blades,” the official said.
The Lion Air crash has been the biggest aviation disaster in Indonesia since 1997, when 234 people were killed by Garuda aircraft near Medan.
Rescue workers led after the accident: minor injured
On Monday evening on the road of Cancer - Plungė, cars BMW and Mercedes-Benz collided at the Tilwicks
The car was hit by a cactus, three people reportedly suffered.
The BMW driver, who was born in 1999, was on the opposite side of the road, and the forehead hit the Mercedes-Benz car, a father born in 1967, and his daughter, who was born in 2005.
“The BMW driver was rescued from the debris by firefighters.
For a girl from Mercedes-Benz, teeth are knocked out in an accident.
All the victims were taken to the hospital.
Presidential office: there is no need for artificial relief for referendum
After the Seimas has approved the ruling proposal to reduce the referendum cartel to the first section of the Constitution that currently has greater protection, the president will veto the amendments, its adviser Mindaugas Lingė said.
\"More than half of the population voted for the Constitution - that is the requirement.
This and its replacement, in particular of the articles contained in its first section, should certainly be at least a majority .
It’s easy to predict that the president would really veto,” Dalija Grybauskaite’s internal policy adviser told Knowledge Radio on Tuesday.
He stressed that the first section of the Constitution defines the basic state subjects - language, flag, territory, capital, sovereignty of the state, thus reducing the number of votes needed to replace these articles, according to Lingė, would create a \"negative precedent\" and \"reverse the unmanageable risk\"
“The president believes that there is no need for artificial facilitation, more preparation for the referendum itself, more dialogue with the people,” he said.
On Tuesday, the Seimas will vote on the adoption of an amendment to the Law on the Referendum.
It provides that a decision on amendments to Sections 1 and 14 of the Constitution with higher protection shall be taken if at least two-fifths of the citizens with the right to vote are in favour of it during a referendum.
At present, more than half of all citizens with the right to vote can replace the articles in Sections 1 and 14 of the Constitution by a referendum.
Some 2.5 million citizens have the right to vote in Lithuania: half of the 1.25 million voters, two fifths of the 1 million voters.
This proposal was born after the Seimas approved the presidential veto in September due to amendments previously adopted in parliament, which reduced the requirements for the number of votes by amending Article 12 of Section 1 of the Constitution defining citizenship.
The referendum is scheduled to be reduced in the run-up to the dual citizenship referendum on May 12 and May 26 next year, when the first and second round of presidential elections is scheduled.
After the restoration of independence on March 11, 1990, immigrants cannot have dual citizenship at the moment, with some exceptions.
The Lithuanian community of the world is seeking dual citizenship, but is afraid that under the current conditions a referendum would not take place - a sufficient number of people would not come to vote.
R. Masiulis: Lithuanian airports – straw – therefore they need to be updated
The infrastructure of Lithuanian airports and roads begins to crumble, therefore it needs to be renewed, says Minister of Transport and Communications Rokas Masiulis.
According to him, the renovation of Vilnius Airport is a minimum task that the state must perform.
\"Air transport infrastructure is already crumbling because it was planned for smaller passenger flows.
We must renew Vilnius Airport - this is not even included in the long-distance planning, this is the minimum we must do - Mr Masiulis said at the communication conference organised by the Democracy Development Fund and the State magazine.
According to the Minister, the next decade will be particularly important, because important projects will have to be implemented – Klaipėda’s external port built by Via Baltica – Rail Baltica – will be completed, Vilnius and Kaunas airports will be renovated, and possibly a new airport will be built.
“The next decade will be very important – we have to complete the road, railway integration, construction of the external port in Klaipėda, arrange the airports, maybe decide on the construction of the new airport.
We must not sleep, we must start projects already now that will exploit our potential in 10, 20 or 30 years,\" the Minister of Transport and Communications said.
Mr. Masiulis said there has been too little funding for road maintenance in recent years.
“The situation of the roads is not improving yet, because there is not enough funding available.
We are able to build new roads, but even for basic maintenance, for example on highway roads, funds are lacking.
We must set the amount to be allocated to road maintenance if we want them to improve,\" Masiulis said.
He stressed that exports of Lithuanian transport services grew by 18.6% this year, while the largest export market was Germany, which overtakes Russia.
Mr Masiulis once again criticised the European Commission's proposal that EU carriers will have to return their trucks periodically to the country of registration.
“We need to make our exporters feel at home in Western Europe.
In my opinion, the proposal for tugs to return to their homes is absurd because empty trucks, fuel combustion, and emissions would increase in Europe.
Railways will win the most, as the costs will increase so much that some of the transport will pass through the railways.
We are looking for ways to defend our positions,” Masiulis said.
According to the Ministry of Transport and Communications, the transport sector accounts for 12.2%.
Lithuanian Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
It employs more than 118,000 employees and has more than 7.500 companies.
Dispute with Heritage Protectors
Last week, Masiulis told the Seimas Economic Committee that he had started negotiations on changing the cultural purpose of the Vilnius Airport building, which would allow to destroy the old terminal and build a new one.
However, Algimantas Degutis, interim head of the Department of Cultural Heritage (CRD), called the deliberations of Masiulis political pressure.
According to him, the building built in the 1950s is a valuable property that was entered in the register in 1993 and not by politicians, but by specialists to decide on its deletion.
Mr Masiulis then commented that a modern arrival terminal would contribute to improving the image of Lithuania.
“The removal of this old terminal from the heritage would be a politically important step to demolish it and build a new modern arrival terminal to make it feel in a modern country when it comes to Vilnius, rather than in such an interesting country that does not really represent our country as an innovative one,” Masiulis said in the Seimas last week.
Mr Masiulis then also announced that it was planned to build a completely new passenger terminal in Kaunas and connect the airport with Rail Baltica by building an underground station.
This transport unit is expected to be operational in 2026 after the completion of the construction of Rail Baltica
Vilnius Airport last year served about 3.7 million people, this year it expects 4.8 million passengers and next year it expects 5 million passengers.
Kaunas Airport last year served 1.2 million passengers.

Start flights to Madagascar from Vilnius next year
In the spring of next year, the largest passenger plane flying on regular flights from Vilnius Airport, Boeing 767, will land, which will fly its passengers from Lithuania directly to the island of Be Island in Madagascar, based on the information of the tour operator Itaka Lithuania, writes on the portal “madeinvilnius.lt”
“Blue Panorama” airline passengers will be able to choose from 259 economic class and 8 business class seats.
The new holiday destination will be reached directly from Lithuania from April 2019.
Dominikas Milowski, CEO of Itaka Lithuania, says that Lithuanian tourists are trying to offer new destinations.
Madagascar is an island in the Indian Ocean, close to the east coast of Africa.
For the summer 2019 season, other tour operators have also prepared new destinations.
For example, “Novaturas – and “Itaka” – will begin to fly directly from Vilnius to Tirana (Albania).
Minister of Finance on possible crisis: it is important not to talk about illness
“We always have to prepare for tougher times.
For the third year in a row, for the first time in the history of Lithuania, we are collecting reserves.
But it is also a very important thing - not to talk about illness,\" Šapoka said during his visit to Brussels on Monday.
ELTA recalls that on Monday and Tuesday, Minister of Finance and Vice Minister Miglė Tuskienė attends meetings of the Eurogroup and the EU Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN) in Brussels.
The Ecofin meeting discusses issues related to the taxation of digital services.
This new tax is intended to avoid fragmentation of the EU single market as some Member States have already introduced or intend to introduce a certain tax at national level.
In the short term, it is proposed to agree on how revenues generated for the provision of certain digital services in the EU Member States should be taxed until a global consensus is reached.
The Eurogroup will review the draft budgets of the euro area countries submitted to the European Commission (EC).
On 23 October, the European Commission rejected Italy's draft budget as non-compliant with the Stability and Growth Pact.
This is the first time that the EC has taken advantage of this opportunity.
Further information was requested from Belgium, France, Portugal, Slovenia and Spain.
The Eurogroup will also discuss the deepening of Economic and Monetary Union: options for implementing the European Deposit Insurance Scheme and reforms of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).
Lithuania supports a stronger role of the ESM in financial support programmes, but it is believed that the functions of the ESM must be clearly defined in order to avoid duplication of functions of the ESM and other EU institutions.
Balys Burač.
Lithuanian Labor Traditions and Traditions
Recently it has been 120 years since the birth of the famous Lithuanian photographer and cultural chronicle, ethnographer and local explorer Balis Burač (1897-1972) in Sidarai, Šiauliai, and the then Siauliai Governorate.
Celebrating the 100th anniversary of the State of Lithuania, we have a great opportunity to remember how the life-suffering national rebirth has called many people of Lithuania, including the brothers Burach - Bali, Jonas, Bronius - from the very depths of the village, we can engage in the fostering, meaning and preservation of our cultural traditions.
Balys Buračas has traveled through his native country with a camera in his hands for more than 50 years, providing a wide and realistic picture of our country’s customs, traditions, folk art and material culture.
He sought to preserve the rapidly disappearing decks of national culture and had a rare ability to perceive the permanent value of his work.
In the photographs of Balys Buračas, the landscape of Lithuania, mounds, pages of Lithuanian newspapers and magazines have been decorated with national costumes by our people in their everyday and festive environment.
This publication contains a significant part of Bali Burač's legacy for the description of national working practices and associated traditions and, most importantly, for their attractive iconography.
The published material shows not only the distinctiveness and beauty of these traditions, but also the progress of our civilization over the last century, despite two world wars and a difficult occupation.
The manuscript of the book is very rich in the works of the interwar Samogitia, especially the kupiškėnai, the Nordics, the Telšiškės, as well as the works of the inhabitants of Aukštaitija and Dzūkija, their holidays and other traditions and customs written by Balys Buračas.
Of the 10,000 negatives preserved in museums and archives, more than 400 rare, mostly unpublished, photos were selected for this publication, which were grouped according to the selected texts.
They reflect the unique aspects of ethnic culture, which are characteristic of kupiškės, dzūkai, other districts of Aukštaitija and Žemaitija.

The Tragic Fate of Couples: Killed After A Few Hours of Marriage
In the southwest of the state of Texas, a couple of newlyweds were killed in a helicopter crash just hours before their marriage.
William Troy, 24, and his wife Bailee Raye Ackerman Byler, died Sunday shortly after midnight when a helicopter hit the hill 16 kilometres northwest of Juvald and 129 kilometers west of San Antonio, local peace judge Steven Kennedy said.
Surprisingly, the accident happened after the arrival of about 24 kilometers, just as old as the newlyweds.
The 76-year-old helicopter pilot, Gerald Douglas Lawrence, was also killed.
The newlyweds studied at Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, Texas.
They got married on Saturday evening in the Caseers family ranch near Juvaldis and flew out of the family helicopter after the wedding.
The accident occurred when the helicopter flew about 24 kilometres.
The newlyweds flew to Sant Antonio International Airport, where they intended to take a flight to the plane and fly for the honeymoon, Kennedy said, without specifying the final destination of the couple's trip.
“This is a very rocky, uneven terrain, and the hill is about 120-150 metres high,” Kennedy said.
Lawrence has been piloting the aircraft for many years.
Kennedy said he piloted helicopters and served in Vietnam.
After the autopsy, it should be clear what the pilot's physical condition was and whether it could not be the cause of the crash.
The helicopter crashed about 5-10 minutes after takeoff.
His debris spread across a wide range on the rocky slope of the hill, and the body remained “dangerously hung,” air safety researcher Craig Hatch of the National Transport Safety Board said at a news conference on Monday.
Investigators are going to take the debris away and then look closely at it, but it will not be easy for the truck and truck to reach that place, he said.
The cause of the disaster has not yet been established, and the preliminary report of the NTSB should be published after two weeks.
Israel's Prime Minister calls the entry into force of new sanctions on Iran \"historic day\"
\"Today is a historic day,\" Netanyahu told MPs of his Likud party, his office said.
“Today is the day when under President Donald Trump, the US imposes particularly severe sanctions on Iran, the toughest sanctions against Iran throughout the period when efforts to curb its aggression began,” he said.
Earlier on Monday, Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman said the new sanctions would \"decided\" an attack on Israel's actions in the region.
The measures that Washington calls “the strongest sanctions of all time” have been imposed since Trump’s decision in May to withdraw from a global power deal with Tehran over its nuclear program.
The sanctions aim to significantly reduce Iran's oil exports, which have already fallen by about one million barrels a day since May, and cut Tehran off international funding.
Israel has long opposed the agreement with Iran, saying its scope and terms are too limited.
The Jewish state also said the lifting of sanctions allowed Iran to finance militant groups and its own military activities.
Israel is particularly concerned about Iran's actions in neighbouring Syria and vowed not to allow it to establish itself militaryly.
Other participants in the deal with Iran - Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia - do not agree with the U.S. decision and say the agreement, as it was intended, has so far prevented Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.
The court is rejoining the circumstances of the death of a young motorcyclist
After the death of a young motorcyclist in Vilnius, Northern town, the court will hear the witness’s testimony in the case of the end of the accident.
Vilnius Regional Court ruled on Tuesday that, in order to clarify all the relevant circumstances of the case, one witness of the case will be questioned at the next hearing on 26 November.
In this case, an acquittal sentence has already been issued, but the prosecutor's office disagrees with it.
On 22 August, Vilnius City District Court acquitted the driver of the car due to the death of the motorcyclist, after declaring 79-year-old Eduard Osipov that the motorcyclist was driving at high speed in the city and committed a gross violation.
The Vilnius Regional Prosecutor’s Office asks the district court to annul the district court’s sentence and claims that the main fault of the accident lies with E. Osipov, and the district court’s findings are unfounded.
An acquittal sentence is also requested by the family lawyer of the deceased motorcyclist.
The accident took place on August 11, 2015, when Osipov’s driving car Škoda Fabia entered Žirmūnai Street from Lakūnai Street and faced a motorcycle on the main road.
The prosecutor’s office accused the man of violating the rules of road traffic and causing a traffic accident, killing a man on the main road on the Piggo motorcycle.
Initial police reports indicate that the scooter driver was killed, but later on, after studies, the vehicle was found to be equivalent in power to a motorcycle.
The judge of Vilnius City District Court Rolandas Bužinskas told BNS that experts found that the motorbike driver was driving at a speed of 89.2 km/h, although the speed allowed in that place was 50 km/h.
“The car driver could not predict that the motorcycle would be driving at such a high speed,” the judge said.
At that time, the driver of the car of an old age claimed to have driven at a speed of only 5-6 kilometers per hour.
The motorcycle driver who saw the obstacle tried to stop and fell off the vehicle before faced with Skoda Fabia.
The prosecutor’s office said Osipov, who had travelled from the side to the main road, had to give way to a motorcyclist.
Novaya Gazeta: Six Vagner mercenaries killed in Syria
Among the dead were five Syrian military soldiers and six persons belonging to Vagner.
It is reported by the source of Novaya Gazeta in Syria.
According to the source, one of the 5th units of the Syrian military corps was deployed in the area, with a number of Syrian volunteers and \"military mercenaries\" joining it.
“Novaja Gazeta has sent a request to the Russian Foreign Ministry for information on Russian fate.
The former King of Belgium will have to take a paternity test
This decision is a victory for the artist Delphine Commission.
She has been seeking recognition as a former monarch child since 2013.
A 50-year-old woman claims that her mother, Baroness Sybille de Sallys Longchamps and Albert II had an inexplicable love novel decades ago.
The 84-year-old former king denies fatherhood.
According to the data of the station RTBF, he may refer the DNA test to the Supreme Court.
According to the Court of Appeal, Jacques Commissioner - the ex-husband of Delphine's mother - is neither biologically nor legally the father of the artist.
Delphine applied for recognition of “the real-father Albert’s daughter.”
Social workers will be given money, but social workers won’t get it.
The Central Electoral Commission plans to allocate a budget grant of almost EUR 3 million to the largest political parties this week.
This spring, the ruling Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party (LSDP), led by Vice-President of the Parliament Gediminas Kirkilos, is not yet expected to allocate funds from the budget.
But they can be allocated in the near future by a separate decision of the CEC if there is a change in the legal environment governing the distribution of grants to the parties.
Laura Matošaityte, Chairwoman of the CEC, informed the SJ that “this Thursday a commission meeting is scheduled to take a decision on the allocation of a six-year budget grant to the parties”
According to her, it is up to the CEC to decide on this by 15 November.
Seven parties, six of which are parliamentary, are expected to allocate EUR 2.751 million.
The opposition Homeland Union - Lithuanian Christian Democrats should receive more than EUR 0.66 million, the ruling State and Green Union - about EUR 0.55 million, the opposition Social Democratic Party - about EUR 0.5 million, the opposition Liberal Movement - almost EUR 0.4 million, the non-voting Labour Party - about EUR 0.23 million, the recently joining the ruling Order and Justice Party - almost EUR 0.22 million, represented in the parliament, but neither the ruling nor opposition-proclaimed Polish election-Christian Union - about EUR 0.18 million.
In accordance with the current law, which the CEC will follow when allocating budget money, grants are allocated to parties that meet the requirements of the law and have received at least 3% of the votes in the last elections to the Seimas, municipal councils and the European Parliament.
Therefore, the current legal framework does not allow only the LSDDP established this spring to expect to receive money from the budget.
This party has not participated in any elections yet.
It is true that the ruling coalition is trying to change the law so that social workers will receive at least a couple of hundred thousand euros in advance of the three elections next year - the self-government, the president and the European Parliament.
The relevant amendments to the laws of the political parties adopted by the Seimas and this year's budget were vetoed by President Dalia Grybauskaitė.
The Seimas has not yet decided on the veto, but the ruling representatives Mr. Kirkilas and the peasant-green leader Ramūnas Karbauskis have argued that MPs will seek to reject the president's objections.
However, it will not be possible to do so until this Thursday's meeting, therefore, according to Mr. Matošošaitytė, \"grants will be divided according to the legal order that has existed so far.\"
True, the head of the CEC did not rule out that if the Seimas rejected the president’s veto this week or next week and a new amendment on the allocation of budget funds to the parties would come into effect, the decision on the allocation of an additional grant to individual political forces, including the LSDDP, could be discussed in the commission.
“We will take into account the entire legal environment in the decision-making process because we are an executive body to implement the laws we have adopted,” she said.
If the Seimas were able to reject the veto and new laws would come into force, the government would allocate additional money to the parties by borrowing the corresponding amounts.
The grants already allocated to the seven parties would not be harmed by such a decision.

Poroshenko: assassination of activist Handziuk must be punished
\"I want to say that no version - and more than 20 of them today - will be rejected.
Each will be checked very carefully in accordance with the procedures of the investigation.
I, as president, have no opportunity and do not have to get information that could harm the course of the investigation.
However, the authorities must ensure transparency and the law enforcement authorities must work effectively.
This is the only way to find out the truth and punish evil,” Poroshenko said at a meeting with young people in Kiev on Tuesday.
He stressed that he was most interested in the clarification of the murder of Mr Handziuk and that the killers, the perpetrators and the perpetrators of the crime, would take the necessary responsibility.
“After the case has been retrained to the murder, they are at a completely fair and reasonable risk of being sentenced to life imprisonment,” he said.
He rightly called the public's demand to investigate the case openly and impartially.
Poroshenko stressed that the statements made by law enforcement representatives in parliament should show that \"the authorities are determined to bring criminals and murderers to justice, whatever they are.\"
He also said that political speculation on this subject would not help to clarify the situation, but would confuse everything even more.
\"I call on all forces supporting power and opposition, not to waste unfounded arguments and, defend God, not to use this murder for public relations,\" he said.
- On the contrary, we now need to unite and ensure that the investigation is effective, fair and transparent, fast - so as to build public confidence.
There is simply no other way for us –
“No one will be allowed to take advantage of this situation to destabilize the situation in the country,” he said.
Handziuk, who fought against corruption, was attacked in July and flooded with acid in the city of Cherson.
She was an advisor to the southern mayor of Ukraine.
The woman was hospitalized after the attack, but died at the hospital on Sunday.
If police and prosecutors did not explain the perpetrators of the attack, Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yuri Lucenka issued a resignation statement on Tuesday.
After her death, authorities were accused by public activists of failing to carry out a proper investigation.
Activists also demanded the resignation of the Prosecutor General and the Minister of the Interior.
\"I am today submitting my resignation statement,\" Lucenka told MPs by reading his investigation report.
Parliament has yet to approve the resignation of the prosecutor.
Lucenka accused activists of exerting pressure on the investigation and leaking important information, making it difficult to identify the perpetrators of Handziuk's murder.
Bill Gates presents a toilet without water
Presenting a futuristic toilet, Bill Gates compared the shift from traditional facilities to water-free facilities to the computer revolution of the 1970s.
Microsoft founder Bill Gates unveiled a high-tech toilet in Beijing that does not require water supply in pipes, Reuters said.
The toilet without water works according to the principle of separation of solid and liquid waste.
Both types of sewage are recycled into chemical fertilizers.
“The technologies you see here are the greatest in the field of sanitation in the last 200 years,” Bloomberg quoted Bill Gates as saying.
A technological toilet was created at the expense of a charity foundation founded by Bill Gates and his wife Melinda.
Over the past seven years, the company has been working on a facility that could turn human waste into fertilizers or water, and the fund has spent $200 million on it.
In total, Bill Gates has created about 20 toilet models.
Now the device is finished and can be sold.
However, in order for such toilets to be produced massively, the Gates Foundation is ready to spend another 200 million.
According to the Gates Foundation, 500,000 children under the age of five die every year due to poor sanitation conditions in the world.
Fighting the problems of poor sanitation, such as cholesterol and others, increases health spending, which is already around 233 billion.
To better illustrate the sanitary situation that needs to be improved, Bill Gates in a toilet presentation jar with fecals.
According to him, this is a good reminder of the fact that, in a small example, there may be 200 trillions of rotavirus cells, 200,000 bacteria that cause infections, 100,000 eggs of worm parasites.
S. Slūva was elected president of the Association of Mass Football
On 5 November, an extraordinary meeting of the Lithuanian Mass Football Association was held in Kaunas, where Sergei Slūva was elected as the new president of the organization.
An extraordinary general meeting of members of the association was convened because of the request received by Anatoly Stecenko to resign from the office of president of the association.
There were 13 members out of 15.
The main issue on the agenda was the election of the new president.
Two candidates took part in the election: Sergey Slūva and Vaidotas Rastenis.
11 members of the association voted in favour of Slūpa, and two members voted in favour of Rasten.
Slūva will complete Stecenko’s term of office, which will run until January 2021.
Worrying in France: Human Deaths Are Concerned
French health officials on Monday said they had permanently banned a widely used pesticide in the face of concerns over dozens of people in the west of the country.
The health agency ANSES announced that the decision to ban all pesticide-casting products had been made after a new safety test launched earlier this year, which began at least three September in the Department of Art and Loire.
These cases have already led to the suspension of the use of pesticides by the government.
This soil disinfection chemical should not come into contact with plants or farm workers.
To be effective, the product must be used in large quantities.
In France, it was used every year at around 700 tonnes.
At least 70 people, including many farm workers, in the Ange region, where there are many salad broths, complain about eye and throat congestion, and breathing problems.
\"These episodes confirm the correctness of our decision, but they did not rush it,\" ANSES Deputy Director Francoise Weber told the Ouest France newspaper on Monday.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) considers metam – one of the most commonly used pesticides in the United States and Europe – to be a “probable human carcinogen.”
This pesticide, sold under names such as “Vapam” and “Sectagon”, is authorised in Europe until 2022 when a new safety test is to be carried out.
\"There was no choice but to remove it from the market, whether there are alternatives to it,\" Weber told the newspaper.
\"We understand the difficulties that shall arise for the growers of salad broths, for the general farmers, but public health is more important,\" she said.
Farmers have already expressed discontent with the government's decision last month to halt the use of the metam in a region whose economy is heavily dependent on intensive agriculture.
In the region, more than half of the 35,000 tonnes of salad juice consumed annually in Europe is grown near Nantes.
Next season, there will be “many fewer salad broths, radishes and couples” last month, after the government stopped using the metam, Philippe Retiere, head of the Nantes Farming Federation, told AFP.

President Paul Biya sworn in for 7th term in Cameroon after controversial elections
Biya, 85, promised to protect the unity and unity of the West African state at a ceremony under the supervision of Parliament’s President Cavaye Yeguie Djibril.
Africa’s oldest president, who has ruled his country for 35 years, was declared a winner in October’s 7th election, with 71 percent of the vote.
However, the elections were eclipsed by low turnout, violence and suspected fraud.
On the eve of Biya’s inauguration, 79 students and three school staff, including the director, were kidnapped in a presbyterian school in the northwestern region, where English-speaking separatists conducted an armed campaign for independence.
Most of Cameroon's 22 million people are French-speaking, while one fifth are English-speaking.
In 2016, in the northwestern and neighbouring southwestern province, dissatisfied with alleged discrimination in education, the judiciary and the economy began to demand autonomy.
In 2017, Biya declared an independent state, “the Republic of Amazon” and raised weapons.
According to NGOs, at least 400 civilians and more than 175 security forces were killed in separatist attacks and government response operations this year.
More than 300,000 people have fled from violence, some across the border to Nigeria, but many are forced to live in semi-circumcised forests.
Only 5% of voters in the northwestern region voted in October and 15% in the southwestern province.
In both parts of the country, Biya received two-thirds of the vote.
Conservatives' First Elections: Mistakes Lead to Inexperience
\"Something was missing - understand that the party had organized everything with its own resources.
Some municipalities allowed to use their premises, but not everywhere there were voting booths, because we can not buy them ourselves.
“Thank you to those who have borrowed,” he said.
According to him, complaints were received, but their content does not change significantly, and the violations themselves are not of a malignant nature.
“There were complaints.
Not all of the people who participated in the elections were experienced - this was also news for them.
Thus, not all of our actions corresponded to our order.
Therefore, the CRC had to warn us that the principles we described were to be respected.
These complaints, however, do not give rise to doubts about the results,” Anušauskas said.
According to the President of the CEC, there have been cases where ballot papers have not been stamped - once they have become aware of this, the ballot papers found in the ballot boxes have been cancelled.
Some towns lacked space, but according to Anušauskas, complaints and violations relate to dozens of ballot papers.
“Well, because the difference is several thousand, it really doesn’t make a fundamental difference in the election results,” Anušauskas explained.
The party's turnout in the elections was 55 percent, while the number of non-party voters was 69 percent.
Both candidates had 400 observers and 600 people worked in commissions.
The results announced on Sunday also remain unchanged, with 79% of voters voting in favour of Ingrid Šimonyte (16418 votes) and 21% in favour of Vygaudas Usackas (4441 votes).
On November 17, the TS-LKD Council will officially support Šimonytė’s candidacy in next May’s presidential elections.
Trump will probably not meet Putin in Paris
White House National Security Advisor John Bolton earlier said Trump would meet with Putin in Paris this week to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I.
But as he left for the last rallies ahead of the US midterm election, Trump told reporters he was not sure if this would be a suitable opportunity to meet with the Russian president.
“I’m not sure we’ll meet in Paris.
Probably not,” the US president said.
However, the head of the White House added that they would meet at the G-20 summit and “probably meet many times later.”
Trump is still trying to \"reset\" relations with Moscow, despite allegations that Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
Kęstutis Strupas asks for annulment of VTEK decision
Kęstutis Strupas, the former Director General of Santara Clinics at Vilnius University, asks that the decision of the Chief Official Ethics Commission (VTEK) be revoked – it is acknowledged that undeclared transactions in time and thus violated the law.
Strupas’ complaint was examined by Vilnius Regional Administrative Court on Tuesday.
The decision will be published on November 26.
The applicant requests the annulment of the decision of 23 May of the VTEK, the court spokeswoman Sigita Jacinevičienė Baltaduonė informed BNS.
Strup believes that gifts given to relatives should not be declared, he says he has understood the exception.
In May VTEK announced that Silvija Strupienė, the Director General of Santara Clinics, who was then removed, and the Head of the Ambulatory Rehabilitation Division of the Vilnius University Hospital of Republic of Lithuania, had violated the provisions of the law regulating the declaration of private interests.
The investigation found that four transactions were declared in breach of the prescribed time limits: a loan taken from the bank by the spouse in 2010, a purchase of securities from the bank in 2017, an apartment provided to the daughter in 2017 and a loan granted and not returned to the natural person together with the spouse in 1996.
S. Strupienė also declared these transactions by skipping the deadlines.
Persons who have violated the Law on the Coordination of Public and Private Interests in the Civil Service may not be encouraged for a year.
The law obliges you to declare not only your own data, but also your spouse’s data.
The study was conducted by VTEK on the basis of information from Info TV.
It was clarified whether Mr Strupas and his spouse, head of the Ambulatory Rehabilitation Department of the Vilnius University Hospital, S. Strupienė properly and in a timely manner declared their transactions.
As announced on Info TV last year, Strup presented his daughter with a property worth 125,000 euros.
However, the former head of the Santara clinics and his wife did not state their interests in the declarations.
Law enforcement, along with at least ten others, has made allegations in corruption investigations, according to law enforcement, for winning public purchases of computers, software in clinics demanded illegal financial compensation from companies, it is masked as support.
In this way, Strup is suspected of having negotiated at least five times in Santara clinics for public procurement in the field of information technology.
Mr. Strup denies his guilt.
In September, Professor Strup, suspected of corruption, was fired from the position of head of Santara clinics.
By decision of Santara Clinic stakeholders Health Ministry and Vilnius University, employment relations with K. Strupas terminated at his own request.
He has been in hospital since November 10, 2013.
Santara Clinics continue to be temporarily headed by Professor Juozas Raistenskis until a competition for the new Director General is held, and it is expected to be announced this year.

Schools already want to teach differently: less tests, more practice
Such changes in the content of education are planned by the Ministry of Education and Science, which presented them on Monday at the forum “Change in the content of education: foreign experience in Lithuania”
The Minister of Education and Science, Jurgita Petrauskienė, who has spoken in the discussion, said that over 30 million euros have been invested in the renovation of educational content in the last ten years, but no results can be seen.
“According to the results of the international student achievement study PISA, students’ achievements are below the OECD average,” said Minister of Education and Science Jurgita Petrauskienė.
In a statement from the Ministry of Education and Science, the OECD expert Phil Lambert said that Lithuania was too focused on providing knowledge and not on practical application of knowledge.
According to him, in the general education programmes in Lithuania a lot of attention is paid to student literacy, critical thinking, respect and responsibility development, but it is also necessary to develop children's creativity, entrepreneurship, financial literacy and empathy.
Deputy Minister of Education and Science Gražvydas Kazakevicius, presenting changes in the content of general education, said that the scope of the programmes started this academic year will decrease, they will be more specific and the disciplines will be more closely linked to each other.
According to the vice minister, the education of pupils will be more individualized, schools will become more independent – they will be allowed to prepare for 10 to 30 percent of their unique educational content, the current system of assessment of pupils will change to a cumulative score, gain more weight and informally acquired competences of the student.
Standardized tests will be reduced.
By promising that the general education programmes will be digital, user-friendly and connected to e-sources, the Bank of Tasks.
The aim of updating the educational content is to improve students’ achievement in the international PISA study by at least 10%, to reduce the gap between students’ achievement, to improve their school’s contemporary competences, and to be literate in a variety of areas.
Since May 2018, Lithuania plans to allocate a sum of EUR 7.8 million to renew educational content from the European Union and the State budget.
The project of renewed general education programmes during the academic year 2019-2020 is expected to be tested in part of schools and will be launched in all schools from September 2021.
At the beginning of October, the Ministry received criticism over the nearly EUR 8 million project being carried out by the Centre for the Development of Education for the renewal of the general programmes of primary, primary and secondary education.
A total of €7.8 million has been earmarked for this for four years, with the first €1.3 million purchase being launched at the beginning of October to search for educational programme developers.
After the experts criticised the purchase, he was suspended, education and science minister J. Petrauskienė dismissed Giedrius Vaidelelis, Director of the Centre for Development of Education.

He described the investigation as effective in his speech, but voiced outrage at Gandziuk's use of his death to public relations.
Gandziuk was a Ukrainian activist and anti-corruption fighter who spoke publicly about police corruption in her southern Ukrainian home town of Cherson.
On July 31, an unknown attacker, K. Gandziuk, shook the acid in his face.
She died in hospital on November 4 due to her injuries.
Protesters at the Ministry of the Interior of Ukraine are demanding an answer about who killed Gandziuk, AFP/Scanpix.

According to the Prosecutor General, due to the leak of information, the suspects acquired essential knowledge for them.
Lucenko added that he knew Gandziuk personally and was outraged that some politicians were using her blood for public relations.
So that no one can say that someone is holding on to power, I want to say that I am making a statement to resign.
Today I will present it to the President of Ukraine, and you will have to discuss this issue in Parliament - Mr Lucenko's statement to the Rada is quoted as saying in the Obozrevatel publication.

Lucenko is considered to be a close companion of President Petro Poroshenko.
He was appointed as Prosecutor General on 12 May 2016 following a lengthy attempt to remove his predecessor, Viktor Shokina, suspected of cover up corruption by top officials and politicians.
Minister of Energy Ž. Vaičiūnas meets with representatives of Orlen Lietuva
As Elta was informed by Aurelija Vernickaitė, Minister of Energy, the meeting will discuss the achievement of the renewable energy targets in the transport sector by 2020 and beyond.
According to the European Commission's (EC's) data, transport is the only sector that is currently below the cumulative trajectory set out in the National Renewable Energy Action Plans at EU level, with a 6% share of renewable energy in 2015.
The EC estimates that progress towards the mandatory 10% target in the transport sector is rather slow due to various difficulties, including the relatively high cost of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and unclear regulation.
Renewable energy is mainly derived from biofuels (88%) in this sector, while electricity plays a smaller role at this stage.

Maassen, 55, has also sparked the controversy by saying he was guilty of his troubles, a radical left-wing force in Merkel's coalition.
As a result, he was not transferred to another post, as promised, but forced to leave the reserve.
Among other things, last weekend it turned out that at a meeting of representatives of European internal intelligence organisations in Warsaw a few weeks ago, Maassen criticized Merkel's \"illegal\" immigration policy.
German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, who defended the head of intelligence for a long time, said at a press conference on Monday that Mr Maassen's recent comments were unacceptable and \"disappointed personally.\"
Seehofer, who was under pressure both for the dispute and for the poor performance of his party in Bavarian local elections, asked President Frank-Walter Steinmeier to release Maassen into reserve.

Chubby girls ruin stereotypes about wedding dresses
Chubby girl with white bloated bride dress - mission (no) possible?
Can a white swan flying towards the altar be larger than S or M size and still look attractive?
Plus the size of the reality show, the evolution of the (r) size, the participants will prove today that the beauty and elegance of the bride does not depend on the kgs of the woman.
But that's not all - one of the project's girls will touch tears of happiness tonight - her boyfriend will appear on the scene.
“There’s still some who think bigger girls don’t get the attention or the look of the guys.
It's just a myth - my boyfriend is an athlete himself, but he likes me, he doesn't need a figure that meets some standards from me -- Aurika will talk before a wedding dress show.
Wedding dress is not easy, in all meanings, clothing - it is a complex structure, in it a lot of materials, dress heavy, uncomfortable for movement.
Also, some women think that a larger girl in a white dress will look even bigger and therefore less confident.
I can calm down that a properly selected dress model solves this “problem” – one of the members of the show commission, fashion designer Robertas Kalinkinas, explained.
The fates of the girls in the project R. Kalinkinas are decided together with the whole commission - Erika Vitulskiene, a fashion house open in size, photographer and star of social networks Nagliu Bieranca and TV producer Laura Birde.
\"When deciding which girl has to say goodbye to the show, a lot of ticks arise between the members of the commission, after all, we all represent different spheres and differently imagine the winner of the show.
The task of showing wedding dresses was even more complicated, and this - now I can already reveal - was that two newcomers appeared, who were certainly not inferior to the old-fashioned ones.
It was a special evening in every sense,” Kalinkin said.
In the scandalous behavior of 23-year-old Ieva, famous for her summer reality show, and in the beauty of 31-year-old mother of two children, Dovilė - like other girls, she took part in the selection of “Size (r) evolution,” and went to the top 20.
Unfortunately, after the first extremely open photo session of girls on the streets of Vilnius, they had to say goodbye to the project.
In the show, the girls were returned to the LNK by the viewers, for their favorites voted on the TV portal.
The second week of the reality show in Lithuania, which has received international recognition, is already taking place - here plus the size of the girls compete for the name of the first star in the country plus the size of the country.
So far, only eight are left - and they all fully understand that the winner can only be one.
The intriguing and unpredictable evolution of reality show “Size (r) evolution” begins this Monday evening at 8.30 p.m. on the LNK.
Elba is named the world's sexiest man
People magazine has declared the world’s sexiest man this year.
He was the 46-year-old British actor Idris Elba.
Although the man claims that this message was unexpected when he told about the new title, he did not wit.
I thought, \"Don't be!
Seriously.
Then I looked in the mirror and thought – yes, I look sexy today – laughing at the actor.
Frankly speaking, Idris pointed out that this title is a very pleasant feeling that has moved his ego.
The British star believes that he has often received abusive words and bullyings that have made his childhood difficult because, as he says, he was “very tall and inexpensive.”
The young actor did not please his peers and became the object of bullying and because of his rare and unusual name and his African origin.
“I just grew my mustaches and my muscles became the toughest guy in my city district,” Idris smiled.
When a man loses his pride on the screens of Ose, Elba works as a disco at parties held in Spain, especially in a bustling Ibiza.
In his free time, the man enjoys Thai boxing and has a core for fashion, which he realizes by creating his own clothing line.
The British actor says that his family is the most important thing in the world, so he plans a wedding with his fiancé Sabrina Dhowre.
Elba became the 33rd sexiest man in the world elected by People magazine.
In 2017, the title was awarded to Blake Shelton.
A man who has been put to death in the Širvintai district during drinking
On Monday evening a man was killed in the village of Šalkiškiai in Šarvintai district during the drinking.
According to Vilnius County Police, at 21.16 a.m., a man was reported to have beat a neighbor during a drink.
Doctors arrived and found the death of a man born in 1943.
A 1994 suspect was arrested, who was found to have 2.53 drunkenness.
Police are investigating the circumstances of the incident.
Managers no longer demand a distance of 20 km in the construction of waste incineration plants
Vilnius cogeneration plant is being built, near Gariūnai market.
The governors no longer seek to maintain a distance of 20 kilometres from the settlements in the construction of waste incineration plants.
On Monday, Kęstutis Mažeika registered an amendment to the Waste Management Act in the Seimas, which refuses such a requirement.
According to Mr. Mažeika, the \"Farmers\" faction, which previously supported the provision on the distance of 20 km, promises to support the amendment on its refusal.
Mr. Mažeika’s amendment provides that from January 2019, waste incineration plants could be built in accordance with statutory environmental and public health requirements.
He admitted that the amendments were prompted by the president's doubts about such a ban.
\"Given the definition of the living area, it is clear that places where the above-mentioned objects could be built would be almost impossible to discover,\" said the chairman of the committee.
The ruling majority in October opposed the president's veto amendments that tightened the construction of waste incineration plants.
In addition to the ban on the construction of waste incineration plants closer than 20 km from settlements, the amendments provided for permission for the Government to make decisions on the future of the two existing plants, taking into account public health interests.
The latter is not intended to be corrected by Mr. Mažeika.
In Vilnius, the waste and biofuel power plant is being built by the Lithuanian Energy Group and in Kaunas - together with the Finnish Energy Group Fortum – the company Fortum Heat Lietuva.
The last one is already incinerating waste in Klaipeda.
This is a possible compromise in the Brexit negotiations.
British and Irish leaders on Monday discussed a possible compromise on the complex Northern Ireland issue that is impacting Brexit talks, Dublin said.
Speaking by telephone, British Prime Minister Theresa May proposed a revision of the so-called 'insurance deal' mechanism that would leave an open border between the UK province of Northern Ireland and the European Union.
Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar promised to consider the proposal, but rejected any possibility for Britain to withdraw unilaterally from the agreement, the Irish government said in a statement.
In the interview, May made it possible to review the arrangements for insurance measures, it said.
\"Waradwar has made it clear that it is open to reviewing new proposals, provided that the outcome of such a review is not linked to a unilateral decision to terminate the use of the restrictive measures,\" the government said in a statement.
\"Brexit negotiators cannot find a satisfactory solution to avoid checks at the UK-Ireland land border when Britain leaves the single market and the customs union next year.
Both sides agree on \"insurance measures\" to keep the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland open until a larger trade agreement is signed to ensure that additional customs checks at the border are not carried out.
The EU wants Northern Ireland to continue to comply with EU customs rules, but London wants them to be applied on a temporary basis to the UK as a whole.
The Daily Telegraph reported on Monday that Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab wanted Britain to withdraw from the deal unilaterally after three months.
But Varadkar told reporters in Dublin that his government “can’t support it.”
\"Insurance measures for three months or a limited period are not worth the paper on which they will be written,\" he said.
In the past, London and Brussels have not confirmed the breakthrough in Brexit negotiations after a weekend announcement in Britain that the deal is being reached.
“I would say we are continuing to make progress in the negotiations, but there is still work,” May’s London spokesman said.
European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schin told reporters: “We are not there yet.”

They argue that “a global area of information and communication is a common good which must be protected in order to strengthen freedom of expression and of opinion.”
“People have a fundamental right to receive information that is freely collected, processed and disseminated on the basis of commitment to truth, principles of pluralism of approaches, and rational methods of determining facts.”
The document asks for help from world leaders, including US President Donald Trump, who often criticizes “fake news” but is regularly accused of distorting facts.
World leaders should take a stand on this issue when they gather at the \"Peace Forum\" in Paris on November 11-13.
The declaration was drafted within two months under the leadership of Mr Ebadi and Christophe Deloire, the head of the Paris-based media freedom and journalists’ rights organisation Reporters Without Borders (RSF).
Other signatories include former Senegalese President Abdou Diouf, Chinese lawyer and human rights activist Teng Biao and political scientist Francis Fukuyama.
Sejm approves higher fines for harmful products
The Seimas approved amendments to the Product Safety Law, which provide that fines for product safety violations must be increased.
Amendments were accepted unanimously in the Chamber.
As Mr. Antanas Vinkus, a member of the Seimas Committee on Health Affairs, said, in relation to the new project, it is to be welcomed that the objectives set relate to better consumer protection of products.
In addition, its provisions shall be adapted to the requirements of the Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
“My head, in the proposed draft law, is better and more concretely distributed to all operators involved in the supply and distribution process: manufacturers, service providers, importers, distributors and others.
As practice shows, the current system of fines does not always prevent further violations, because the entities who have paid the fines continue to commit repeated violations,” said Vinkus.
The project was prepared by the Ministry of Economy and, after the approval of the Government, the Economic Committee of the Seimas supplemented it with its proposals.
The amendments aim to increase penalties for infringements, strengthen consumer rights protection, empower market surveillance authorities and create a clear system of supervision of product safety requirements and compliance with them.
According to the Ministry of Economy, there is currently no obligation for manufacturers to properly label the product and thus ensure its traceability.
In addition, according to the Ministry, market surveillance authorities did not grant access to the territory, buildings, premises, and inspections of producers and suppliers during the state control of product safety, which complicates the work of the institutions.
According to the Ministry, the set period of six months for imposing fines and warnings is too short to identify a violation, conduct an investigation and impose a fine.
Also, according to the Ministry, the fines imposed are not effective enough.
Companies often repeatedly violate the requirements of the law – 14 companies did so in 2017, alone.
The Ministry of Economy proposed to impose an obligation on manufacturers to properly label the product and thus ensure its traceability in order to facilitate the clarification of suppliers of non-compliant products by market surveillance authorities.
It is also proposed to give the market surveillance authorities the right to enter the market, the territory, buildings, premises and inspections of operators that manufacture, make available products.
The aim is to increase the amount of fines for violations of the law.
A manufacturer, an importer or an authorised representative who has placed on the market dangerous products and a distributor who has made them available on the market, would be fined a service provider who has provided or provided dangerous services from 150 to 2 500 (now from 144 to 1 448).
If the State Consumer Rights Protection Authority (VVTAT) or another market surveillance authority decides to prohibit the placing on the market and making available on the market of dangerous products or the provision of dangerous services, a fine of between 1 000 and 5 000 euros (now between 868 and 4 344) would be imposed.
Failure to comply with the requirement to remove dangerous products from the market, to recover them from consumers and to destroy them would result in a fine of between 2500 and 6 500 (now between 1 448 and 5 792).
If dangerous products have caused harm to the health of the consumer, a fine of EUR 2 500 to 15 000 (now 1 448 to 11584) would be imposed.
If dangerous products caused the death of the consumer, a fine of between 6 500 and 25 000 euros (now between 5 792 and 23 169) would be imposed.
According to the Ministry, in Poland and Austria, a fine of up to EUR 25 thousand is imposed for violations of the legislation regulating product safety (the minimum amount of the fine is not established), in Belgium - from EUR 26 to EUR 600,000, in Romania - from EUR 155 to EUR 6666, in Bulgaria - from EUR 125 to EUR 7 500.

Norway's armed battalion took part in NATO exercises in the outermost and harshest areas
Troops from the Norwegian armed forces took part in a series of complex exercises in the mountains north of the country's capital Oslo.
This is part of NATO’s three-way connection 2018 – the biggest NATO exercise since the end of the Cold War.
Most of the troops from the second battalion of the Norwegian military spent a lot of time away from home after the September 11 terrorist attacks, in places like Afghanistan, that is, in warm countries.
But they are most skilled in war in the Arctic, and these skills are very useful now that NATO is changing its direction of attention.
In recent days, in the mountains east of Tinsett, often in the outermost and harshest areas, soldiers took part in scenic battles against real British soldiers.
Soldiers have the skills to survive in this cold in the wild, but in a harsh climate they have to stretch a much larger weight on their shoulders - one backpack weighs about 50 kg.
Soldiers staying in the area say they share their skills to survive and fight under such conditions with other NATO troops.
Soldiers say this exercise, which, like no other, resembles real warfare, will teach them to be prepared if there is a serious threat.

Vice-President of Kaunas does not plan to return to politics
Former Deputy Mayor of Kaunas Povilas Mačiulis, who has left work in the municipality and the “United Kaunas” organization in the presidential elections for support of Vygaudas Usackas, does not plan to return to politics and promises to focus on business.
“I’m going to focus on business.
I am a shareholder of several companies, and I also have ideas for new projects.
And most importantly, I will be able to enjoy the opportunity to spend more time with the family,\" Mačiulis told BNS.
He also said he did not intend to participate in the next elections.
Mr. Mačiulis had no chance to talk to V. Usackas after this Sunday he lost the initial elections of the Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democratic Union to Ingrid Šimonyte.
“If openly, we have not yet been able to discuss the results in detail with him and the team and talk about the future plans.
It is clear that after Vygaudas left the next election fight, this stage of my life is over,\" Mačiulis said.
He said he did not regret the decision to leave Kaunas policy for support to Usack, but regretted that “Lithuania has lost a unique opportunity to have a real leader in the context of international relations.”
P. Mačiulis worked as Deputy Mayor of Kaunas briefly in 2011 and later returned to this position after the successful election of “Universal Kaunas” in 2015.
He is a shareholder of the private school “Erudit Lyceum” and several other companies.
The workers are working in the castle: what are they doing here?
The Kaunas residents, who noticed the workers in Kaunas Castle, hoped that the reconstruction works of the remaining tower were finally taking place.
The director of Kaunas City Museum Gabrielius Suziedėlis said that the work of changing the roof covering of the southwestern tower with a fragment of the defensive wall is taking place here.
According to the interviewer, the roofs will be cans.
“The tin cover worn out in an emergency was a threat to the people around them -- people could fall in and get hurt -- and it was necessary to replace it.
The roofs were no longer resistant to moisture, so it was also harmful to the heritage,” explained the museum’s director.
Will these roofs be similar to those that were a few centuries ago?
“All the works are combined with heritage and other institutions,” Sužidėlis added, seeking to make the result as authentic as possible, but at the same time an important and practical side – rooftops must protect their values from moisture.
A universal solution was chosen when working with the heritage.
Before that, the elements of Kaunas Castle were covered with a tin even in the Soviet era, so they no longer had historical value – - detailed by the director of Kaunas City Museum.
The contract of employment was signed on October 2.
It is planned that the work will not take longer than three months after the signing of the contract.
“It is expected that it will be completed by the end of November,” said the museum’s director.
According to him, the value of the work carried out is almost 24 thousand euros.
This amount, according to the interviewer, was provided for this year's budget.
Works in Kaunas Castle are carried out by the company “Statija”
As a result of the research, Kaunas Castle may have appeared earlier.
U.S. and South Korea resume military exercises
Now, for two weeks in the southern city of Pohang, military exercises with about 500 troops will take place, the Defense Ministry said in Seoul.
There are 28,500 troops stationed in South Korea.
For many years, the two countries have been preparing joint military maneuvers, which Pyongyang calls “provocation” and “preparing for invasion.”
On Friday, North Korea threatened to resume its nuclear program if Washington does not lift economic sanctions against Pyongyang.
Such a change in course could be \"seriously considered,\" North Korea's foreign ministry said.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in an interview with television that criminal measures would remain until Pyongyang gave up its nuclear weapons.
At the same time, he announced that he would meet with North Korean envoy Kim Yong Cholu this week in New York.

The Centre for Eastern European Studies will work with two prominent U.S.-brain centres.
According to the head of the EESC Linas Kojala, who has been based in Vilnius for 13 years and is counting for 13 years, the U.S. integration will allow to implement the projects and make the voice of Lithuania more heard on the other side of the Atlantic.
“We have been working in this direction for several months.
I am pleased that two large institutions see us as partners and look for opportunities for joint activities.
I have no doubt that niche activities will arise because our topics of NATO, security, disinformation, development of the Eastern Partnership countries are also a priority for them,” Kojala said.
The agreements note that the EESC and the US institutions will work together on international project applications, exchange expertise and knowledge, and prepare expert visits.
This should be particularly useful for Lithuanian analysts, since both partners have an excellent international reputation.
FPRI has been in operation since 1955 and brings together nearly a hundred top-level analysts.
In the latest global ranking of analytical centres, FPRI ranked seventh in its category by the University of Pennsylvania.
At the time, CEPA, whose analysts have been repeatedly invited to consult and work on top of the US political institutions, is ranked ten in the same category.
“This will provide more opportunities for Lithuanian analysts working in various institutions to enter the U.S. information space and will encourage us to raise the quality cartel up,” Kojala added.
One of the first practical steps should be to help partners in the distribution of the upcoming EESC analytical publication “Lithuanian Foreign Policy Review” by US decision-makers and public space.
The Centre for Eastern European Studies operates on the basis of projects implemented and is not maintained by targeted grants.
The EESC partners with whom joint initiatives are implemented include the European Commission, NATO, USAID, various international funds, etc.
Two buildings were destroyed in Marseille.
The collapse of two buildings in the southern French city of Marseille on Monday caused two minor injuries, the fire service said.
When the buildings fell into the street, the debris went up, and the clouds of dust rose.
There were dozens of firefighters at the scene near Marseille's famous old port, some with trained dogs.

Afghan Special Forces member shot American instructor in training
North Ogden's 39-year-old mayor Brent Taylor, north of Salt Lake City, has taken a year's vacation to carry out a mission in Afghanistan.
He was a military intelligence officer at the Joint Force Staff, but had to return to work as mayor in January.
Another U.S. military member, whose name has not yet been made public, was injured in Saturday's attack, which killed Taylor's life.
Officials said Taylor died of the infantry fire.
Utah National Guard Commander Major General Jefferson S. Burton told reporters Taylor had helped train and strengthen Afghan national military capabilities.
Utah media quoted NATO as saying Taylor was shot by one of the trained special forces and that the attacker was killed by Afghan forces.
Taylor had a wife and seven children.
His remains should be flown to the Dover Air Force base in Delaware on Monday night.
He previously carried out two missions in Iraq, and this mission was also the second one in Afghanistan.
In January, before he left for Afghanistan, Taylor told local media he had been assigned to a team of advisors and instructors for a special forces battalion in Afghanistan.
Hundreds of North Ogden residents gathered in the streets of a city of about 17,000 people to burn a court of their mayor, accompanied by a family-run policeman.
Taylor became mayor of the city in 2013.
