Thousands of crowds panic in Central Park after barrier collapse
Thousands of people panicked over possible shots at a political event have fled the Central Park after the police barrier collapsed.
Known figures include New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, Republican Senator Jeff Flake, Janet Jackson, John Legend, and the Democratic Party.
When the barrier fell on Saturday night, authorities quickly assured the viewers that they were safe.
The event that began in the afternoon focused mainly on social justice.
About 60,000 observers gathered at the General Citizens' Festival in the Great Meadow, where Cardi B, The Weeknd and other pop stars were expected to appear.
Some of the speakers asked the audience to call the members of Congress representing them and to express their views on the Senate meetings this week on Brett Kavanaugh's candidate for Supreme Court.
Alastair Seeley’s Uninterruptible Series of Wins “British Supersport” in Assen
Alastair Seeley wins British Supersports race
Alastair Seeley won the third victory in five British Supersports races on Saturday in the 12-wheel sprint in Asen, the Netherlands.
The racer from Carikfergus, in 0.05 seconds, defeated Yamaha, the driver of Jack Kennedy.
The 38-year-old also triumphed at Silverstone and Oulton Park this month.
Seeley represents Northern Ireland’s EHA Racing team, with whom he has already won an international North West 200 race in May.
The former British champion competed with Kennedy throughout the race and, despite his efforts, failed to outperform his rival from Northern Ireland.
Seeley's teammate David Allingham was seventh in the Supersport race on Saturday.
Scott Swann-British Talent Cup finished eighth.
In addition to Wiser Ducati, the driving Glenn Irwin, who was trying to rise above the current fourth-place championship ranking, was fourth on two Sundays in the British Superbike.
This week, Irwin announced that he will move to JG Speedfit Kawasaki this season.
Michael Laverty of Toome, driving Tyco BMW, ranked 13th and Andrew Irwin and his PBM Ducati ranked 14th.
Why Do Hong Kong Home Workers Learn Dance Movements?
In Hong Kong, there are about 300,000 foreigners working as domestic workers.
They are required by law to live in an employer’s home.
These employees work six days a week for a small salary, up to 18 hours a day.
The story is about Mhelanie, who spends one day alone on community events helping to get rid of the isolation routine.
Lina Ognissanti will be honored by Mayor of Bedford
On the photo: Lina Ognissanti sells ice cream during the warm season, and in winter – donuts.
For more than 40 years, a woman who has been selling cones and ice cream in the city centre will be honored by private reception of the mayor.
Lina Ognissanti, who trades ice creams and cones in the kiosk Dinky Donuts on Bedford Midland Road, was invited to join the family for afternoon tea.
Nearly 3 000 people signed a petition online in order to be awarded or accepted.
Ognissanti said she was honored to receive such praise.
Bedford Mayor Dave Hodgson said Ognissanti and his children were invited to visit his office to visit the city's regals and historical artifacts and drink afternoon tea.
“Lina Bedforfe occupies a special place and her kiosk is part of the city centre,” he said.
I am glad that she accepted my invitation and I look forward to our meeting in my office so that I can thank Lina for her work in our city.
Mr. Ognissanti thanked her, saying, “To the kind people of Bedford who thought about her,” and said, “It’s a great honor and a beautiful act.”
Sarkab Mahmood, who filed the petition, said he did not expect to receive so many signatures.
After hearing about the reception, which is planned to be held before the end of the year, he said: “I am very happy for Lina, because she deserves it because of her excellent character.”
On the road with the Alster’s Lambretta Club
Scooters at Lambretta were indispensable cultural satellites of the 1960s.
A group of Italian scooter fans try to preserve the spirit of that time.
70 years after the establishment of the first Alster-Lambretta club, around 100 motorcyclists from the United Kingdom and Ireland gathered in Fermana County this weekend.
One of the two members of the first club, Chris Wilson, bought the first Lambretta in 1966 for around £40.
“For me, the scooter was just a vehicle, but I found out that I could use it differently.
It was a kind of sport.
I didn’t get involved in mod culture, and now I’m probably too old for it,” he said.
\"He was quite cheap and quite reliable, you could buy it at an affordable price, and when you bought it, you could do something more than just drive from point A to point B.
He took part in Lambretta's separate start race at the Isle of Man TT ring.
The first Alster-Lambratta club was founded in the early 1970s and was reorganized 12 years ago.
\"In 1971, scooters and other forms of transport became less and less interested in people, and the clubs were generally affected by unrest, so I thought, \"It's the end,\" Chris said.
“Then, at some point, interest reappeared, and it seems to have grown more and more.”
Philip Steele is the secretary of the Alsterio Lambretta Club, which currently has 97 members, and is responsible for membership.
“Everyone’s motives are different.
Some members were influenced by the culture of mods, since almost everything started from it.
Others are race enthusiasts or rockers – here you will find all sorts of people.
There are also those who just have an interesting vintage.
Many scooters are modified, so there are no two identical ones.
It is possible not to change the scooter and to ride quietly at a speed of 35 or 40 miles per hour, adapted to the narrow streets of Italy, but some members have improved this.
Some significantly modified scooters could probably reach speeds of up to 100 miles per hour.
Over the weekend, some of the scooters had to be driven.
And although Northern Ireland’s weather isn’t always as pleasant as Lambretta’s Italian homeland, this time scooters in Fermana’s county were shone by the sun.
Ruth Davidson asks her to remain silent on Brexit
Ruth Davidson asked her fellow Conservatives for a quiet period to allow the prime minister to agree on Brexit
Scotland's head of state said that two years after the EU referendum it was enough to hold a debate.
She expressed her opinion after Boris Johnson's words about the prime minister's plan, which he called \"insane and completely absurd\"
She told the BBC that it was time to support the Prime Minister.
At a party conference in Birmingham, Tori activists said: \"We have had time for debate over the past two years.
The former foreign secretary served in one of the best offices in the country’s history, and during that period most of the current plan was prepared, which was already recognized last November.
Conservatives now have to support the prime minister, let her close the deal and help implement the plans in the country.
I think that a period of silence would be very useful –
Her comments followed a sharp criticism of the Brexit debate, which was not first expressed by former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.
In an interview with BBC journalist Andrew Marro, Theresa May later assured her that she believed in Brexit and that her cabinet plan could secure a favourable free trade deal with the European Union.
Davidson also said he would take part in another election to prevent the second Scottish independence referendum because in 2014 \"the Scottishs were promised that such an event would be the only one in their generation.\"
Asked about a possible repeat referendum on Brexit, she said: “If we are talking about the history of Scotland, I have repeatedly stated that it is not possible to repeat the referendum if you are a nationalist and the result does not satisfy you.
I would be hypocritical if I said I could hold another Brexit referendum because I expected a different result.
Road M8 reopened after police incident
The M8 highway was reopened after a police incident at Glasgow.
Police said the road was closed in both directions just before 7 p.m. at the 15th Townhead intersection in case of pedestrian anxiety.
Traffic on the closed road did not take place for three hours and was disrupted in the city where marathon “Great Scottish Run” takes place.
A 20-year-old man was taken to the Glasgow Royal Hospital for research.
Christine Blasey Ford's friend confirms statement of sexual abuse suspected of Brett Kavanaugh
Lelanda Keyser, who was in high school with Dr. Christine Blasey ford, accused the Supreme Court candidate of sexual abuse by Brett Kavanaugh when they were both teenagers, wrote a letter to the Senate Court Committee, explaining that, although she herself did not remember the party's home, she believed in Ford's story.
Keyser previously issued a statement through his lawyer that he did not remember the party and did not even know if he had met Kavanaugh.
In a witness against the Courts Committee on Thursday, Kavanaugh often referred to Keyser’s statement as proof of his innocence, but did not mention Keyser’s claim that she believed in Ford’s words.
President Trump on Friday ordered the FBI to conduct an investigation in a week when Republican Senator Jeff Flake and other moderate senators asked him to give time to the investigation and postpone the entire Senate vote on Kavanaugh for a week.
On Saturday, Keyser sent a letter to the committee via his lawyer saying he wanted to “as much as possible contribute to an additional FBI investigation into Kavanaugh.”
“But, as my client has already explained, she doesn’t know Judge Kavanaugh and doesn’t remember the party or gathering where he would have been with or without Dr. Ford,” Keyser’s lawyer Howard Walsh said in a letter.
The letter further explains that Keyser “does not reject the story of Dr. Ford and has already said he believes in Dr. Ford’s testimony.”
“But the simplest and indispensable truth is that it cannot confirm it because it does not remember the said event,” the letter continues.
Kavanaugh's friend Mark Judge, who was supposed to be next to him during the attack, said he would also contribute to the FBI investigation.
Chicago's illegally convicted people tell the story of life with a corrupt policeman and his gang
The Illinois chief prosecutor is trying to change the history of Chicago police after a dark period.
An unscrupulous policeman is believed to have exploited the innocent population of social housing and unreasonably arrested many people.
So far, 42 people have been acquitted.
The social housing project of Ida B. Wells currently has only an empty site, and earlier its residents have been taken advantage of by corrupt Chicago police for almost a decade.
They were led by Sergeant Ronald Watts.
Residents accused him and his tactical team of extortion, forgery and coercion of police reports and evidence.
Willie Martin and Cleon Glover are two of those convicted by Cook County Attorney General Kim Foxx.
“If you didn’t work with him, you ended up bad.
You were his enemy.
You prevented him from acting and earning – Cleon Glover told us about Watts.
“I was very afraid.
I wanted to get out of that area,
“I didn’t have a place to go,” said Willie Martin.
Lawyers from the Foxx Ethics Division are reviewing 30 to 40 additional Wattsu cases.
Landon Allen, a social housing resident of Ida B. Wells, said many people had decided not to be silent about Watts.
\"Many have not been silent,\" he said.
“But it wasn’t important.”
Another former resident, Clarissos Baker, said no one believed the people's words about the official sergeant.
“He has his own gang.
Who will believe in us
said Baker.
Joshua Tepfer, who works at the University of Chicago’s acquittal project, says that so far no one has ever believed them.
“Everything went on because these people didn’t seem important to them and didn’t care, because they were black people living in social housing, so they thought they had committed something wrong,” Tepfer said.
Sergeant Watts was in prison for 22 months in 2013 for trying to steal the FBI informant.
Martez Wise is also jailed thanks to Watts.
I just had a son.
I couldn’t be with him for four years.
He almost didn’t know me because he was just born, so I had to reconnect with him,” Wise said.
“I’ve lost four years,” he said.
Fidelity believes in the success of blockchain, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence.
Fidelity saw the potential of blockchain chains even before 2018, when all corporations began talking about this technology.
Abby Johnson has led cryptocurrencies, the most risky and volatile asset class in recent years.
“About two years ago, I and other senior managers were just curious about what was going on, especially in the bitcoin market,” Johnson said.
We started talking and realized that we had to figure it out.
Curiosity prompted me to start digging bitcoins at the New Hampshire branch when the price of this cryptocurrency was about $180.
Last December, the price was almost $20,000 and, according to Johnson, “we were surprised: when the price went up, we started earning money, even though we never expected it.”
It did not specify how much bitcoin is mined or how much it earned Fidelity.
“Fidelity employees are clearly interested in these technologies.
The Blockchain Club, named “Bits and Blocks,” now has around 2,600 members to organise seminars and meetings with professionals.
The company agreed with Coinbase, which gave Fidelity customers the opportunity to check the balance of cryptocurrencies using the Fidelity mobile app.
In 2015, it was possible to donate Bitcoin.
Johnson said the company had rejected most of the other possible uses of bitcoin or declined them for at least a short period of time.
We are trying to monitor the market.
And so far, Katie Chase, Chief Strategic Officer at Fidelity Technology Center and Head of Blockchain Incubator (which is part of FCAT), is looking for ways to use public and business-used blockchains.
Chase could not comment on specific projects, but revealed that it received great interest from customers, partners and employees.
“It’s all very new.
If you go into the information, you will understand that there is still an attempt to find evidence of the concept,” Chase said.
We have tried to adapt blockchains to different situations and learned a lot, but the technology is not yet advanced to solve such problems.
So far, it has said that the group is focusing more on trying to understand the nature of these obstacles.
They try to understand how to calculate the value of physical objects, such as works of art, with tokens or use block chains in the supply chain.
“To date, this is not at the centre of attention, but I think it will eventually get an interest,” Chase said.
“Fidelity will be ready for this.”
As an example, she pointed out to Pebble, which was a complete failure in marketing standards, but eventually paid off Fidelity.
Her group created an app for smartwatch, which she stopped producing three years later, collecting millions through the Kickstarter crowdfunding project.
Apple Watch “Fidelity” was ready.
It quickly customized the Pebble app for the new Apple product.
“We were not blind to the popularity of Pebble, but we wanted to be ready if people liked smart watches,” she said.
“We have accumulated knowledge and we were ready when smart watches were released into the mass market.”
The island of Sulawesi was destroyed by an earthquake and tsunami.
The Indonesian island of Sulawesi was hit by a powerful 7.5-point earthquake on Friday 29 September, causing a tsunami that killed nearly 400 people.
There are many injured and the number of dead is expected to increase.
According to a representative of Indonesia’s disaster management agency, electricity and communications are not working, making it difficult to assess damage in the city of Palu and the adjacent Dongala fishing community.
California students wear t-shirts with racist inscriptions
According to CNN’s KGTV branch, the Escondido Schools Union confirmed this week that about 10 students made a poorly thought out decision to show racism at a high-class event.
“We are proud to welcome everyone in our school and not afraid of diversity,” Adriana Lepe-Ramirez, director of the school, said in a statement.
“We will not tolerate racism and the promotion of exclusion,”
The report also said the incident was being investigated by Escondido secondary school, union officials and local police.
“School administrators have contacted the parents and guardians of the offenders and disciplinary penalties will be imposed,” the statement said.
According to a police station report, students from the school north of San Diego wore a t-shirt with letters containing a racist inscription and were photographed while wearing them.
As a rule, the school confirms the notes in advance, but after taking a photo of the official photo, some students choose their words.
The EU report states that such behaviour is “incoherent with the culture, values or history of Escondido high school.”
\"We need to understand the impact of our words and actions and take responsibility for the decisions we make every day,\" Lepe-Ramirez said.
“Escondido secondary school will continue to foster a family-based culture based on values and unity throughout the community.”
The former student, Cade Pannell, told KGTV that an offensive photo seen on social media had angered him.
“This personally offended me,” he said.
“It may have seemed funny to them, but it’s not.
Only the rascals can laugh at such things.
Shaquille O'Neal's son, Shareef, will spend the 1st season of UCLA
Shaquille O'Neal's son, Shareef, will have to spend his first UCLA season due to heart problems.
According to TMZ Sports, O’Neal will undergo a heart operation to eliminate the disorder that UCLA doctors noticed during the routine examination.
\"Thank God, UCLA doctors noticed the problem early,\" O'Neal said.
“As long as I am in rehabilitation, I will attend lectures and be a normal student.
I'll be back very soon --
O'Neal signed the official protocol of intent in August, promising to play in the UCLA team, which has already attracted many famous names and is one of the best first-year teams in the 2018-2019 season.
\"Shareef has improved significantly in high school,\" Bruins, chief coach Steve Alford, told reporters last month.
“He’s high, he has the skills, he’s athletic and he’s going to be a great member of a new team.
We are happy with the composition of this year's team, and Shareef will perfectly complement it.
He has a good foundation and will be able to improve at both ends of the field.
\"247Sports - According to the data, at the age of 18, O'Neal is a 4-star candidate, ranked 8th in 2018 as a hard-runner and 41th as a player.
Before joining UCLA, O'Neal helped Crossroads to achieve a record 25:9.
Sarah Palin’s eldest son is accused of violence against his father
Track Palin, 28, was arrested for three offences, including an attack.
On Sunday, he was not arrested for domestic violence for the first time.
According to the court, the incident occurred at the Palin House in Vasilia, Alaska, where Track Palin injured his father Todd in a dispute over the truck.
The 28-year-old was arrested after Saturday for three offences, including an attack.
The court documents state that the dispute began when the man called to pick up the truck, but the father refused to give it.
As explained in a court statement, Track Palin was arrested for charges of first-degree hacking and fourth-degree attack and fourth-degree criminal offense, and his father was injured in the face and head.
According to the documents, Palin called the police who were talking to him “funny” and ordered him not to use weapons.
The court's statement also states that the man was on the roof of the garage before being arrested.
The court documents contain Sarah Palin’s words that her son was “worried” and “used some medications”
It was also reported that Track Palin had told police he had taken several bottles of beer before.
He was arrested in early 2016 and charged with domestic violence against a woman, hindering the reporting of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of a woman.
“When I see my son feel what he is experiencing when he comes back, I understand other families experiencing the consequences of post-traumatic stress disorder, and I know how wounded soldiers come back,” the former Republican candidate for vice president and governor of Alaska said.
“Now I understand better than ever that the best of America needs a chief commander who will respect and value them.”
Elizabeth Warren says she will consider presidential candidate after mid-term election
“It’s time for women to march to Washington and repair a broken government to be led by a woman,” she said in a speech at the Massachusetts City Hall.
“So I promise you this: after November 6th, it’s good to think about whether you should stand for president.”
Warren, who is trying to defend his position in a competition with Republican spokesman Geoff Diehl, said earlier that he would not stand up for presidents because he wants to focus on Senate work.
\"It is very important to focus on the midterm elections and stop acting as if the only important thing was 2020,\" she told reporters in August.
“The closest major fight is midterm elections, and they are important not only in Massachusetts, but also in the whole country.”
Warren has long been considered a potential Democratic candidate for 2020, who can compete with President Donald Trump.
However, they would expect a difficult primary election fight, perhaps involving other well-known Democrats, former vice president Joe Biden, California Senator Kamala Harris and New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand.
Celebrities mental health clinic linked third mysterious death in less than a year
\"The Mail\" says third man has committed suicide in a luxury psychiatric clinic in less than a year.
The daughter of a television comedian Shaquelle Vidal (23 years old) died on April 7, almost a month later, voluntarily spending a month in West London, Marylebone, at the Nightingale Hospital.
Her boyfriend James Lyle (57), a hedge fund manager, millionaire, and former Conservative party supporter, paid for her maintenance expenses for five years.
The future chief chef died almost six months after the death of his high-society celebrity Daisy Boyd (28 years old), the grandson of one of River Cafe’s founders, Rose Gray.
After the separation with his successor Dan Macmillan, 43, Boyd died on October 5, under the influence of cocaine, which was illegally brought into the clinic by a visitor.
Two months ago, the filming site artist Alan MacDonald left his life, after he had been released from hospital for four days.
In May, the Monitoring Quality Commission criticized the Nightingale Clinic for not working enough to prevent the introduction of illegal substances.
The daughter of Ava Vidal, a comedian at the BBC’s Mock The Week, was registered at the Shaquelle Clinic on March 11.
At Westminster Coroner’s court last week, Royal Attorney Katie Gollop said Shaquelle had disappeared from AWOL on 29 March and returned to her state of mind a week later.
Gollop, acting on behalf of Avo Vidal, said: “My client wants to find out what happened to Shaquelle, who she was communicating with and what she was doing.”
Mr. Lyle called her Shaquelle “boyfriend.”
Informally, Shaquelle’s stepfather, comedian John Gordillo (52), said: “I know Shaquelle continued to communicate with James Lyle and he was in New York at the time.”
At the meeting, Gordill revealed that Shaquelle called him on April 4 and told him he wanted to buy and drink cyanide, and he called the clinic 20 minutes after the call, more than a dozen times, but no one responded.
“It seems to me that further events could have been avoided if someone had responded,” he added.
On April 5, a clinician found Shaquelle’s mental condition to be extremely poor.
Less than 48 hours later, she went on a notebook.
A spokesman for Nightingale expressed his condolences to family and friends and said: “Our clinic’s goal is to provide high-quality care in a safe, therapeutic-friendly environment.”

“Led Zeppelin is taken back to court for allegedly stolen ‘Stairway To Heaven’ guitar reef
\"Led Zeppelin is again sued for a guitar reef used in the 1971 song \"Stairway To Heaven\", which the band allegedly stole.
Part of the British group's 1971 hit is said to have been plagiarised.
The Court of Appeal rejected the 2016 ruling that the group did not copy the name of the other group.
The lawsuit was filed in 2015 by Michael Skidmore, the guitarist’s trustee.
The Led Zeppelin song, Stairway To Heaven, is likely to last a long time, just like the song itself.
The group will again go to court for charges of stealing the 1971 ballad guitar reef.
The U.S. Court of Appeal rejected the 2016 ruling that the band did not copy the beginning of the hit from the group's Spirit music.
It is claimed that the court judge made mistakes, for example, by falsely informing the jury about copyright laws.
The case was returned to the court.
“Spirit, Randy Wolfe’s trustee Michael Skidmore filed his first lawsuit in 2015.
Police arrests in Michigan ended when a police officer crossed a suspected murderer who shot them
A Michigan resident suspected of murdering a girl was arrested after police gangs ended when he was crossed by a police car.
Adam Nolin, 33, was suspected to have shot his girlfriend, Tia Mae Randall, in Wyoming on Thursday, Michigan.
He was taken to court on Friday in a hospital where he was taken by a police officer by a SUV after Nolin shot police in an attempt to escape the highway where traffic was intense.
Nolin has been charged with five serious crimes, including an attack to kill and escape the police.
\"Inclusion in hospital is not a normal case, but that's not the first case,\" Wyoming police captain James Maguffee said.
\"He needs to be treated, but the justice process must continue.
The judges often adapt so that it can be implemented -
Noline's body found on Thursday in a mobile house in Creekside Estates
The mother of two was shot by a single shot and police immediately identified Nolin as a suspect.
Police then issued a public warning on Noline and gave a brief description of the man and his 1996 black Dodge pickup.
The man was seen on his pickup and went to the US 131 highway when police tried to stop him.
Noline hit the concrete wall with a pickup, then got out of the car and ran off the highway.
He was shooting at the policemen.
One policeman sat in a police car in the SUV and passed through Nolin from behind.
The observer filmed the event.
Nolin was taken to hospital in a difficult but stable condition and will remain there until he is expelled and transferred to Kent County Prison.
“This event has shown that Western Michigan police risk their health to protect the community,” Maguffee said.
\"They arrested a man quite quickly and by appropriate means, and we are very proud of them.\"
Nolin has been charged with two charges of murder, and has been charged with fleeing police, carrying a hidden weapon, and a serious crime committed using a firearm.
He has not yet been charged with murdering his girlfriend, because an investigation is still ongoing.
\"Of course we are still in the process of investigating the murder, which we are about to close so that we can provide Kent to the district prosecutor in a timely manner,\" Maguffee said.
The judge praised a brave man who broke his teeth into his house for an invading thief.
The judge did not regret the greatest praise for the courage of a man who stood up against two criminals who tried to break into his house.
While one hacker tried to valve him with a wooden board, David Oldham was not afraid of it in 63.
The man who worked as a supervisor of the university territory defended, struck both criminals and knocked off one of their teeth.
The intruders fled, but after the fighting, Mr. Oldham left blood, according to which Craig Ford was found and arrested four months later.
In his sentence to Ford, who lost his teeth in an attempt to get into Mr. Oldham’s 400,000-pound individual house in Ormskerk, Lancashire, the royal judge Clement Goldstone said: “You probably didn’t expect such a reaction from Mr. Oldham – when wearing a mask to see only the eyes and nose, you encountered him at home, he hit you.
He also hit your accomplice who tried to break into the second floor and jumped off the roof.
Having sentenced Ford to three years and four months in prison on Friday, the judge said: “I hope you have learned two lessons.
First, you don’t have to worry about David Oldham, and second, you don’t have to start with the police.
Because of your crimes, you now have one tooth less than before and you are bitten by a dog.
It's still a small punishment --
He added: “I want to praise Mr. Oldham for how he responded to your actions.
Prosecutor Derek Jones said Ford, who committed the crime, had already been convicted of another hacking in 2016 and had been in prison for three years, but was released on parole.
Oldham told the Royal Court of Liverpool he danced when he heard a noise at home around 7 p.m. on April 5.
Jones said: \"Oldham, who is a wealthy man, bravely left home and resisted the accused.
Fearing for his safety, he struck him in the face, hitting him and knocking out his tooth.
Then another intruder jumped off the roof in front of Mr. Oldham, who instinctively hit him face-
According to Jones, the accomplice took a wooden board and tried to valve Mr. Oldham, and Ford said, \"Stop him, he knocked my teeth out.\"
The associate told Oldham, “If you let us go, we’ll leave,” and he fled the crime scene with Ford.
Police caught Ford on August 2 in a raid in a house in the Wavertree district.
Ford kicked a police dog, then this bited him into his shoulder.
It is believed that the second intruder is still free.
Ford, 25, has admitted guilty of hacking, beating and dangerous driving, although he is banned from driving.
Tori activists face criticism from Johnson
Tori activists humiliated Boris Johnson today when he was named “a small and aggressive man.”
Mr. Johnson, who was trying to please ordinary people in his uncompromising talk about Brexit, received a strong appreciation from former trade minister Digby Jones, who was supported by the participants of the Birmingham Conference this afternoon.
David Davis also attacked Johnson because he cares about newspaper headlines rather than strong politics.
Speaking to MailOnline, May's ally in the Cabinet added that he simply \"noised\" because he was unable to be a full-fledged leader.
The counter-reaction came after the former Foreign Secretary again attacked the plan of Prime Minister Chequers and called it \"insane\" and \"absolutely absurd.\"
Johnson also said he sincerely believed in the project, and she opposed the withdrawal in a two-year referendum.
He also called on the government to support ambitious projects such as the construction of a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland.
But May retreated that her critics were playing political games, saying they were not bluffing and ready for tough talks with the EU.
In an interview with Andrew Marro on the BBC's opening conference, May said: \"I believe in Brexit.
Former Labour Trade Minister Lord Jones, who is now acting independently, has received crowd approval for the prospects of Brexit.
People were cheered when he expressed an opinion about Mr. Johnson, who allegedly answered the questions of the concerned businessmen “devil business.”
Without particular reference to Mr. Johnson, Lord Jones made it clear that he was a “mind and aggressive man.”
“Business is very important, so saying ‘devil business,’ the former foreign secretary has shown that he’s actually a tiny and aggressive man,” he said.
“I completely disagree with him,”
Lord Jones also praised May's reaction to the Salzburg summit to hear EU leaders - trailers - on her cabinet plan.
Scotland’s chief executive, Ruth Davidson, has also criticised Johnson for being a senior government official in the Brexit negotiations.
May's ally told the MailOnline newspaper in the cabinet that the intervention was not very serious and Johnson did not have enough supporters among the bureaus in parliament to drive out the prime minister.
They said, \"Now this news is not very dangerous.
He is a noise, but he does not have enough supporters in the parliamentary party, and he knows it himself.
We see a strong contrast between David Davis, who respected his views, and Boris, who satisfies his personal ambitions.
Business secretary Greg Clark criticized Mr. Johnson, who attacked businessmen who were skeptical about Brexit.
Speaking at a conference in Birmingham, Clark said Johnson was \"absolutely wrong.\"
He said: “It’s amazing that someone can think like that.
There is no successful economy in the world that does not have successful booming businesses.
In an interview with Sky News, Ridge on Sunday, Davis admitted that the months to come would be difficult because the EU will try to force the UK to grant a lot of relief.
However, he believes that the government must not give up and seek a deal similar to that proposed by the Cabinet of Ministers.
Asked how Mr Johnson managed to lead the Tori, he did not miss the opportunity to delve into the former foreign secretary.
Following Johnson’s proposal to build a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland, he said: “One of the weaknesses of British politics is that of politicians with fantastic ideas.”
He added: “Our communication is chaotic and many of his ideas fit for headlines, but not for firm politicians.”
Bulgaria spends £80 million on poor restoration of European taxpayers' money
Bulgaria has spent £80 million on European taxpayers’ funds for poor restoration of ancient castles, which now looks like built from “sour and cardboard”
The Balkan country spent £80 million from the European Regional Development Fund.
Instead of returning the previous greatness, the restoration received bullying.
Local authorities near Krakra Fortress vowed to remake unbelieving works.
The Bulgarian government has spent tens of millions of EU dollars on the restoration of medieval castles.
The Balkan country spent £80 million on the European Regional Development Fund for the restoration of ancient castles and fortresses, but instead of returning their former grandeur, it received bullying for construction work.
Relics after an expensive reconstruction seem like they are made of “sour and cardboard” so they are no longer attractive to tourists.
For example, monument guards were furious that the medieval fort Krakra and Roman Fort Trayanovi Vrata, near Ihtiman in the western Bulgarian city of Pernik, were reconstructed using polymer concrete commonly used for paving construction.
According to The Telegraph, the EU and the Bulgarian government have privately agreed that this failure must be learned from it.
“The fortress is in a victorious state,” said architect and monumental guard Stella Duleva about Trayanovi Vrata.
It has lasted for 16 centuries and is now damaged.
Such a reaction came after the restoration of the Krakra Fort in Pernik, and the local government promised to remove the parts delivered in 2019.
The Pernician Fortress is called “drip from cardboard” because of unbelieving modifications.
The Byzantine Yailata Fort was named the “Sour Fort” because it was rebuilt from smooth white blocks that were not compatible with the facade affected by the weather.
This failed effort coincides with the newly raised doubts about the European Union's use of enlargement funds.
A crowd of stylish bikers on their way to this year’s “Distinguished Gentleman’s Ride” event
Hundreds of stylish costumed motorcyclists from all over the United Kingdom took to the streets on vintage motorcycles to raise money for the Movember fund
The event is called the “Kiln’s Gentleman’s Journey” and is organized annually to raise money and raise public awareness about prostate cancer.
This year, bikers were in London and 40 other parts of the UK, including Manchester, Cardiff and Edinburgh.
This year's Distinguished Gentleman's Ride events take place in the UK and 650 other cities around the world and have so far managed to raise more than $5.5 million (£4.2 million).
According to the official website of the event, 120,000 people “groomed their necks, tie their ties, smoothed their tweets, sat on their classic and vintage-style motorcycles and allowed them to raise funds and raise awareness about men’s health, namely prostate cancer and men’s mental well-being.”
The Distinguished Gentleman's Ride was first organized by Mark Hawkes in Sydney, Australia.
The idea was inspired by the picture of Mad Men's character, Don Draper, where he sits on a classic motorcycle dressed in his best line.
This year, hundreds of bikers were driving the Tower Bridge in London, including the dressed dachshund dog, Sergeant Pepper.
Tennis Ass Boris Becker Reveals Treatment for Skin Cancer
Boris Becker thanked doctors who successfully eliminated skin cancer.
Becker's photos barely show a small patch of sunglasses.
“It was a routine check and it seems worse than it really is,” he told the German newspaper.
After revealing that he has been treated for skin cancer, tennis legend Boris Becker has been photographed with a patch on his nose.
He tweeted in German on Wednesday: \"I would like to thank Martin Mayr-Brune and Dr Kati Maier from Munich who managed to cure me.\"
The photos of the 50-year-old on Sunday saw a small patch of sunglasses.
“On Monday I visited a dermatologist who removed basal cell carcinoma from me,” Becker told German magazine Image.
“It was a routine checkup and it looks worse than it really is.”
Basic cell carcinoma is the most common form of skin cancer, occurring in 75% of cases.
In time, there is a high chance of recovery.
Becker is currently different with his wife Lilly Becker (42), and they reported divorce in May.
The tennis star has won six major awards in unit competitions, 13 Masters Series titles, and an Olympic gold medal in a double game.
He was recently seen entertaining with his friends at the 185th Oktoberfest in Munich.
The 24-year-old who was attacked on the train platform due to body volumes was not silent.
A British athlete attacked on a train platform because of body volumes decided not to be silent.
Jessica Mayho, who won a silver medal at the British Athletics Championship this year, said he was attacked Friday afternoon at Leeds Station.
Mayho, aged 24, and five feet tall, said she was driven by a man who had been insulted by words while waiting for the train.
At around 5 p.m., the man who attacked the athlete named it “Stora”
But the rising sports star, who is looking for a place in the British team at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, has repulsed her husband.
Mayho, who came from the city of Kitty in West Yorkshire, said: “I protected myself until other people turned their eyes on the full platform.
Such people can scare and force themselves to no longer trust themselves, but this is MY Body, MY Mechanism.
After announcing her adventure on Twitter, the young athlete received great support from social media.
Andy Lewis, a cavalry of the Order of MBE, wrote: “Stora!!!
Is he drunk or blind?
It's a fool, Jesse, it's okay with you.
Don't let the idiot of the head ruin your mood.
Gavin Gray added: \"I'm disgusting.
Not only because of him, but also because of those around him who ignored him.
I'm glad you're okay.
You are an example for the younger generation.
You have shown that you need to be proud of yourself, and that you can’t be dissatisfied with yourself.
Mr Mayh, who worked at the University of Leeds, had an interest in adolescence, encouraged one of her older sisters’ coaches.
Since then, she has been able to win second place at the Muller British Seniors Championship, which took place in Birmingham in July this year.
She won the British Championships just a month after her victory at the North England Games.
Athlete refused to comment more on the event.
If at least 50 million users break up their accounts, Facebook will have to pay £1.25 billion fine
Using the security gap, criminals could reach at least 50 million Facebook accounts.
However, a large-scale hack was reported only three days later, Friday.
Facebook is now facing a huge penalty under new European data laws
With at least 50 million accounts broken, Facebook may have to pay a £1.25 billion fine.
Criminals were able to access accounts due to security gaps, and a lot of sensitive personal information could be disclosed.
But Facebook reported the hacking only on Friday, three days later, and couldn’t say how many British accounts had been compromised until yesterday night.
As long as the search for hackers continues, Ireland’s Data Protection Commissioner, who checks the compliance of the web giant with European data compliance requirements as its headquarters are located in Dublin, criticised the company saying: “The report is incomplete.”
Facebook is facing a huge fine under new EU data laws, as businesses can be required to pay up to four percent of global turnover.
Facebook earned £31.2 billion last year.
Criminals have reached their accounts using Facebook’s View As feature, enabling users to see how their profiles look to others.

In the MG Baltic case, the following entries are heard: the accused discussed Gabrielius Landsbergis
The hearing was opened by listening to the record of the hearing between former MG Baltic Vice President Raimondas Kurlianskis and former employee Vytautas Gapšis.
Listening to the recording makes it difficult to understand exactly what people are talking about at the moment.
True, the record shows that Kurlianskis and Gapšys talk about Christmas, the name of current Conservative leader Gabrielius Landsbergis sounds several times, but what exactly is being said is difficult to understand.
Indictments brought against both natural and legal persons
In the case of political corruption, three legal and five natural persons were charged: the Labour and Liberal Movement parties, former leaders of the Liberals and the “Workers” group E. Masiulis, Vytautas Gapšas, former MP Š. Gustavius, Seimas member G. Steponavičius and former vice-president of the “MG Baltic”.
The Labour Party is suspected of bribery and trade, the Liberal Movement is suspected of bribery, trade and abuse, and the MG Baltic is suspected of bribery and trade.
Officials suspect that politicians have taken or negotiated bribes with the then-MG Baltic Vice President, R. Kurlianskis, and subsequently proposed or supported initiatives favourable to the group in the Seimas and other institutions.
Former Chairman of the Liberal Movement E. Masiulis is suspected of trade effects, bribery and illegal enrichment, and former vice-president of this party, G. Steponavičius, has reported allegations of abuse, former member of Vilnius City Council Š. Gustavius - bribery.
V. Gapsys is suspected of bribery and trade effects, R. Kurlianskis - of bribery and trade effects.
Who has the best chance to win the second round of presidential elections?
Four candidates were included in the poll for the second election round - economist Gitanas Nausėda, non-candidate Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis and two candidates who participated in the initial elections of the Homeland Union - Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) party - Seimas member Ingrida Šimonytė and diplomat Vygaudas Usackas.
True, it turned out on Sunday that TS-LKD received support in the elections by I. Šimonytė, and Ušackas withdrew from the election fight.
According to the data, if the elections were to take place in the near future, Nausėda would win in the second round of the presidential election, but Vilmorus, the head of Vilmorus, sociologist Vladas Gaidys, says it is too early to draw conclusions.
“It’s different (from DELFI) Nausėda, but it’s very important to see whether the parties are talking about the people or what the dynamics are.
This was the doubling of Šimonytė from one study to another, and Nausėda had stopped growing, and Ušacko even had a decrease.
This is very important to you,” says a sociologist.
In addition, looking at the results of the poll, it is clear that a significant percentage of people have not yet decided on what they will vote for or think about not going to elections at all.
If I. Šimonytė and S. Skvernelis competed in the second presidential election round, the fight would be tense - 32.7% for Šimonytis, 30.9% for S. Skvernelis.
As many as 36.4% of people said they would not vote for either candidate, or they did not know which candidate they would vote for, or they would not vote for.
Sociologist V. Gaidys once again stressed that we are not seeing a complete picture yet, because all the candidates who would apply for the less successful Lithuanian Electorate have not yet been announced.
“If we look at last year’s elections, there are many parties in Lithuania, where are their candidates?
For example, where was the Social Democratic candidate? 30 years was a candidate, will it not be?
Once announced, then you will see how you set up your chances with other candidates.
So the side of Lithuania, which is less successful, is so far less reflected,” said V. Gaidys.
Mažvydas Jastramskis, a political scientist at Vilnius University Institute of International Relations and Political Science (VU TSPMI), says that it is still very early to draw conclusions, and all three candidates who have rejected V. Usackas who has left the fight seem to be round.
“I can say from my research experience that these differences mean nothing.
The difference of 5 percentage points is certainly not an advantage for any candidate.
The only thing I could see is that Nausėda would look good against Ušacka again, given that there would be a real vote for those people.
Nausėda v. Skvernelis also looks good, but we compare now apples and potatoes, because, for example, Nausėda has already announced that he will participate, Skvernelis has not announced.
In addition, the poll was conducted before the initial Conservative elections, as it would appear after them,” says a political scientist.
He said Nausėda has a small plus, but once all the candidates have been announced, he can melt.
“The situation is quite equal.
Nausėda, Skvernelis, Šimonytė - results roughly.
I would like to remind you that half a year before the 2003 presidential election, Roland Paks had 5% support to vote for it and then won the election.
\"No predictions can be made,\" Jastramski said.
DELFI recalls that the candidate in the presidential elections has already announced Economist G. Nausėda, Seimas Member I. Šimonytė, philosopher Arvydas Juozaitis, economist, Seimas Member Aušra Maldeikiene, Liberal Movement Member Petras Auštrevicius, Seimas Member Naglis Puteikis and European Parliament Member Valentinas Mazuronis.
Iran accuses Israel of attempting cyber attack
“The regime, whose history of using cyber weapons is clear in cases such as Stuxnet, has tried to violate Iran’s communications infrastructure this time,” the information minister Mohammad Javad Azari Jachromi said on Twitter.
He was referring to the Stuxnet virus attack in 2010, which caused damage to Iranian nuclear facilities.
It is believed that this malware was created by Israel and the United States.
“They are empty hands because of our technical teams.
We will continue to talk about this hostile action in international fora,\" Mr Jachrome said.
Deputy Minister Hamid Fattahi said that technical teams had recorded many attempts to penetrate their systems in the early hours of Monday, but the attackers had \"a strong response\".

On the way to the hospital, he died in an ambulance.
This disaster was commented upon by the head of the Impuls Network of Health Clubs, Antanas Sakalauskas.
According to our data, a 73-year-old man visited our health club, Fabijoniškės Street on Monday morning with his wife.
In the pool, the client was swimming for about 30 minutes, then he came to the pool tracks to rest and suddenly fell after a few minutes.
Near the former people - the client who sailed on the common trail and the pool supervisor - immediately responded, pulled him out of the water and began to revive.
The man was constantly resuscitated until the ambulance arrived.
The club’s staff immediately called for emergency medical assistance, which arrived within 5 minutes.
The doctors arrived to restore the pulse and breathing of the man and moved him to a medical car.
When going to the hospital, doctors tried to stabilize the health of the man, unfortunately, after 20 minutes we received information that the man would not survive.

All health club swimming pool facilities have a watchdog, whose main task is to monitor the pool, its access and ensure the safety of its customers, and it is distinguished by bright clothing from other employees.
Such pool guards shall have radio stations capable of contacting the administration and reception immediately, responding to their requests or calling for assistance.
Staff training is carried out four times a year in relation to the security programme – much more often than required by law.
During them, employees expand theoretical and practical knowledge, are taught how to behave in the event of an accident, monitor whether employees properly follow the procedures and internal rules of procedure.

According to the LNK press release, the Lithuanian woman lost her right to care for her son four years ago and she was seen with him by the decision of the Norwegian Children’s Rights Service Barnevernet and courts.
A woman’s story sparked an international scandal that was followed by all the media.

Publicity, however, did not help the Gražina and her family to regain a son who had Lithuanian citizenship.

At the time when Gražina lost her right to care for her son, the boy was 8 years old, today at the age of 12, the beginning of adolescence.
For the first two years, Gražina never saw her son, it was forbidden.
Later, she was given the right to see her son twice a year for an hour.
During the last court hearing, which took place a few months ago, the number of dates for the Lithuanians increased to three times a year and extended to two hours.
Meetings with the son remind you every time you meet in a strict regime prison - monitored by officials, and going to them - a secret operation.
“The son has changed even four families and no longer speaks Lithuanian” - this Tuesday evening the heart will be opened by Gražina, her story - on the LNK show
Eligijus Masiulis will not be returned personal money taken in search of
The court of appeal said Tuesday that it rejects the defendant’s complaint.
The ruling is final and not subject to appeal.
In a case of political corruption, E. Masiulis, the former leader of the Liberal Movement, was tried to appeal to the Court of Appeal, asking him to return any personal money he had taken in the search for money from him and his spouse’s wallet.
In total, more than 242,000 euros were taken out of the searches.
These funds are subject to a temporary restriction of ownership and are continuously extended.
It was last extended by Vilnius Regional Court on October 15th.
Masiulis did not ask the Court of Appeal for a refund of all the money he sought to recover from his spouse’s wallet 800 euros and his wallet 690 euros, 130 UK pounds, 1600 US dollars.
The former politician said the money was spent on a planned trip to the United States.
Massiulis’ lawyer Mindaugas Bluvas asked for the money back at an appeal court hearing on Monday because the spouses were doing well-paid jobs and had the opportunity to have such sums.
Prosecutor Justas Laucius asked the court to reject the complaint.
“The ruling of the Vilnius Regional Court is lawful and justified, and there is no restriction on the property specified in the charges.
The court correctly found that it lays the foundations for confiscation of assets, as well as for confiscation of extended assets,\" Laucius said at the hearing.
On October 15, Vilnius Regional Court decided not to return more than 242 thousand euros to the accused in political corruption case E. Masiulis.
The money was found in a search for corruption charges in a former politician’s home and car.
The panel of three judges found that it was apparent from the case that the property rights were limited only to the funds that constituted the subject matter of criminal offences that Masiulis was prosecuted.
“In view of the extent of the restriction, it is concluded that the right of ownership of the accused person is not restricted disproportionately or the restriction is applied for too long,” judges Nijolė Žimkienė, Jurgita Kolyčienė and Fire Trump said in the ruling.
The judges pointed out that in Masiulis case he was accused of committing serious crimes, the criminal case is large-scale and complex, and therefore, in order to ensure the possible confiscation of property and the extended confiscation of property, it is necessary to extend the period of temporary restriction of the property of the accused.
Prosecutors say that former vice president of the MG Baltic group Raimondas Kurlianskis gave a bribe of EUR 106,000 to Masiulis for taking decisions useful to the group in the Seimas.
Both defendants say that the money found in Masiulis - 90,000 euros - was Kurlianski's loan.
According to the case, Masiulis was searched for 242,400 euros, 130 UK pounds and 1,600 US dollars.
Masiulis and his lawyer have repeatedly tried to recover the money, but the courts have rejected their requests.
The former politician has said that some of these funds belong to other persons and were intended to invest in real estate or are his family money.
He also said that there was no evidence that the funds would be received in a criminal way.
A court of appeal has previously declared that Masiulis' charges show that the funds could have been received by accepting a bribe for more than 100,000 euros.
Law enforcement said the remaining cash collected during the search could have come from unidentified sources of income, undeclared, undocumented, and possibly not legal income.
In the case of political corruption, the allegations were brought against three legal entities - the Labour Party, the Liberal Movement, the MG Baltic Group
In addition to E. Masiulis, in the case the charges were brought against the former employee – Vytautas Gapšys, former MP liberal Šarūnas Gustavius, Seimas member Gintaras Steponavičius and former vice president R. Kurlianskis of MG Baltic.
Kurlianski is accused of giving bribes to former MPs E. Masiulis, Š. Gustavius and V. Gapšis.
Americans Capture Dangerous Maneuvers of the Russian Fighter
During the 25-minute intercept, the U.S. Navy said the Russian SU-27 had rushed straight ahead of the plane.
The Russian plane flew through it for the second time, using the acceleration of traction, and made a turn with a shift.
Passengers said they felt a Turbulence during the first approach and a quake during the second approach.
The Russian military has the right to conduct exercises in the international airspace, but this interaction was irresponsible.
We look forward to international standards that ensure security and prevent incidents that are consistent with behaviour, including the 1972 Agreement on the Prevention of Incidents at Sea (INCSEA), the U.S. Navy said in a statement.
“Insecure actions increase the risk of incorrect calculation and possible collisions,” the report notes.
Russia’s defence ministry acknowledged the incident, but said it maintained “a safe distance from the American plane.”
Parental costs continue to grow: out-of-class activities are allocated only up to 50 euros per month
According to a survey conducted at the end of August by the market and public opinion research company “Baltic Studies”, a survey revealed that one third (32%) of parents spent less than EUR 100 before school, one fifth (21%) spent between EUR 101 and 150, three out of ten (29%) spent between EUR 151 and 200, and a little less than one fifth (18%) spent more than EUR 200 on the preparation of one of their children for school at the end of summer.
Parents whose children started to go to first grade this school year spent on average about 220 euros on their child’s school bag, while other parents whose children have already graduated from the first class allocated a lower amount to prepare their child – on average, about 160 euros.
However, the school year is also running up, as parents often have to spend money on children’s groups and correspondents.
Depending on the nature of the activity, the price of one group in the country can vary from 20 to 100 euros.
Parents who have school-age children were asked to tell what average amount per month they plan to allocate to extracurricular employment of their own child.
A quarter (23%) of the children surveyed planned to spend up to 20 euros per month for their post-school activities, another quarter (26%) said they had paid up to 50 euros, three out of ten (31%) allocated between 50 and 100 euros per month for their extra-curricular employment, and a sixth (17%) indicated that they planned to allocate 100 euros or more.
It is true that in Lithuania, children of school age are assigned a basket of non-formal education for children, which consists of 15 euros per month.
However, this money can be used only for one group, and if the cost of the occupation is higher, the difference must be borne by the parents.
In the case of a child attending several groups or growing up in a family with several children of school age, the cost of post-school activities may double.
Justina Ambrasienė, the marketing manager of consumer loan company Vivus.lt, says that saving children to low- or middle-income families, especially when several children grow up in a family, can be a significant challenge.
At the beginning of the school year, parents turned their heads, where to get money for exercises, stationery or new sportswear.
Now the main concern is how to take children after school without spending a lot of money on it.
We note that parental spending is particularly high in August, when it is necessary to prepare properly for the new school year, but still remains higher than in summer, as parents tend to invest in the employment of their children.
Often, if they lack the funds and assess their capabilities responsibly, they are determined to borrow,” says J.Ambrasienė.

Kaunas is pleased with the fourth trolleybus
Today, the fourth exhibition of the mobile street exhibition “Atja antiquities, good news – exhibit – drawing and inscription “Sienographer’s notes – the relaxed old trolleybus” took place on Kaunas streets.
A new fun trolleybus has been announced by Kaunas City Municipality.
“This old lady, Škoda, has also changed her slightly dull green color into a much more colorful and brighter dress.
She is also a participant in the exhibition “Atia antiquities, good news” - the representatives of the municipality write next to the uploaded photo.
Mobile street art exhibition “Ati antiquities, good news” is dedicated to farewell to the old trolleybuses, which will be replaced by new ones next year.
Already next year, the old Skoda trolleybuses will travel for a deserved rest and will be replaced by 85 newcomers and modern Solaris trolleybuses.
The portal reminds us that the first trolleybus that was left out with street drawings had dropped to Kaunas streets a month ago.
On the trolleybus there are several well-known accents of Kaunas street art - Grandpa's pipe and elephant.
Not a week after the first performance, the second piece of street artist Timomtieju Norvila - Morfai came to Kaunas streets.
On the trolleybus depicts a cheerful yellow car, which is often referred to simply as a \"vabal\"
“I wanted to put the trolleybus in.
This drawing looks very fun, especially because it meets the trolleybus wheels.
When the wheels turn around, it seems that this is part of the car.
When we painted the wheels white, we made them like a retro style, it sounded like a whole combination.
Until the trolleybus tires were painted, it certainly did not look so charming - - earlier the street artist spoke to the portal kauno.diena.lt.
And on October 27, a wonderful drawing lay down on the third trolleybus.
It is loosened in white, yellow, orange, brown, but mainly - blue paint.
This color is dominant.
On the left side of the trolleybus body, one of the houses of K.Donelaitis Street is displayed, and on the right is the central post office.
\"Wallet is my favorite for now,\" Morphs told the third trolleybus, with the artist Morph.

This agreement will allow all of us to replace the old Trolleybuses of Skoda brand that have served us for many years and offer passengers the most comfortable service.
The new low-based state-of-the-art trolleybuses will have more seats, efficient interior conditioning and heating, high-quality information systems, video surveillance cameras, ergonomic driver's workplace.
New equipment and parallel work of the contact network renovation and street repair will allow trolleybuses to drive more reliably, much faster.
And, of course, the trolleybuses of modern design will decorate the city very much – said Mindaugas Grigelis, CEO of the company Kaunas Buses.
The first new trolleybuses will reach Kaunas next August, and all old trolleybuses will be replaced until December.
Queen Elizabeth II invited Markle's mother to celebrate
Duchess Meghan enchanted the British Royal Palace.
Queen Elizabeth II's special gesture proves this: the British monarch invited Dory Ragland, the mother of the Duchess of Sussex, to her Sandringham Palace for Christmas, according to British media.
There is no such honor even among Kate's parents.
Kate’s parents, Carole and Michael Middleton, as well as other members of her family, have been invited only to traditional Christmas prayers with the royal family.
The unnamed source for the Sunday Express newspaper revealed that the invitation to Doria Raglabd is “the sign of the Queen’s respect for Meghan.”
Doria enchanted the queen during the royal wedding in May – in her calmness

The exhibition “Women’s World” will take place on the arena and again
With the fall routine and brighter weather, the 16th exhibition “Women’s World” has been held for the first time, which makes us impatient – women announce the long weekend, because even four days of hottest fashion, style and beauty news are already here – on November 8-11, Kaunas Zalgiris Arena.
Over the years, to see how the face of the event changes, the exhibition means not ordinary shopping, but the tradition of giving time to yourself.
Often it becomes a place for meeting friends and a reason to spend a day with a sister or a mother.
Four days of the exhibition have special power - every woman here can learn the secrets of charm, learn tricks, how to look glowing every day, find irreplaceable products, hear or try various procedures that stop the process of skin aging.
All this and more, promises even 415 exhibitors who will wait for visitors on all three floors of the arena.
Three days of seminars on beauty and health topics will be held, and on Sunday, representatives of the fair sex will be able to hear tips for creating an exclusive image from the lips of the stylist and blogger Victoria Šaulytė.
A large proportion of women in business are faced with marginal situations where stress is beginning to interfere with a stable emotional and physical state.
For this reason, the Kaunas Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Crafts and the Business Women’s Network operating there, the idea was born to organize a conference “Business and Happy. In addition to stress” in which discussions and practical examples will encourage to help yourself in stressful situations and encourage you to look at your life more creatively.
As every year, the exhibition is full of events dedicated to beauty masters.
The long-term partners of the exhibition, the Association of Hairdressers and Beauty Specialists, will provide an opportunity to study for two days the subtleties of hair coloring and modeling from the charismatic duo of the international Academy of Vinokurov & friends - S. Maslov and R. Sakalauskas.
Those who want to improve even further will be waiting for the competition for the creation of the bride's protagonist and for the mastery battle Art Battle, which will not leave anyone indifferent.
As if a cherry on the cake will become a festive fiesta for representatives of the beauty world “With birthday, Lithuania” in which, for the occasion of the centenary, you will be able to see a show that has not been seen yet - from body painting to dance.
Another tradition of “Women’s World” will not be forgotten – presentations of designers’ latest collections on Friday’s fashion and beauty show, where you will choose the most stylish ones.
And handicraft supporters will be welcome to “Dekostudijas” creative workshops, where they will be able to create original crafts for the interior of the house or to decorate the gifts more interestingly.
The last day of the exhibition is especially welcome for all long-casers, as traditionally visitors will be delighted by the competition “World Long-HAIRED WORLD 2018” where new records of the longest cash register are recorded each year.
Prime Minister: Teacher’s salary increased by 117 euros after the introduction of the annual payment
Since September, the average salary of full-time teachers has increased by 117 euros, Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis said.
“It’s too early to say how much it has advantages or disadvantages.
The fact is that those people who have a full-time job -- their wages have grown more than 117 euros on average,\" Skvernelis told reporters in the government on Monday.
He called the plans of the Lithuanian Trade Union of Educational Workers (LŠDPS) to carry out the strike on the ethical payment “democratic right” but stressed that the strike should not interfere with the educational process.
\"In a democratic country, all forms of protest are permissible, possible.
If you think you need to strike, it’s their right to decide.
Again, we would not want children, students, to suffer in this place.
If there is a strike, it must be done in accordance with the laws in force,\" Skvernelis said.
In June, the Seimas approved the model of annual pay for teachers, which has been introduced in stages since September.
The teacher’s payment was replaced by an hourly payment – the teacher’s staff is 1512 hours a year.
The teacher’s working time is divided into three parts: contact hours, i.e. lessons, preparation for them and work for the community.
This reform is called absurd by Andrius Navickas, a trade union that is outraged that it has been adopted on the principle of \"buldozer\" and announced that it will start an indefinite strike on November 12.
The CSDD requires the immediate withdrawal of this “minute” wage system and the introduction of an ethos model with a maximum of 18 contact hours per post.
It is also possible to increase the fixed part of the basic salary by 20% and reduce the number of children in the classroom.
Among other innovations, the introduction of a new methodology for the distribution of training funds is criticised, since, according to the trade unions, there are insufficient funds for home training, for the division of classes into groups, for qualifications, for education aid, and for the overcrowding of classes in large cities, as has been the case.
The Ministry of Education and Science said that the annual pay of teachers’ work will allow to regulate the workload of teachers and to reward the school community for all the work.
It is estimated that the teacher’s work will be able to cover up to half of the total number of hours per year, and up to 40% of the total number of hours per year for the first two years of work.
It is estimated that teachers’ working time per week is 36 hours, of which no more than 24 contact points per week are required to teach compulsory subjects.
In May, about half a hundred general education schools, kindergartens and non-formal education institutions, about 1,000 teachers, contributed to the two-hour strike initiated by LŠDPS.
There are about 53,000 teachers in Lithuania.
Call for preparedness: Crisis can be expected in 2-3 years
The slowdown in economic growth and even the crisis can be expected in the next 2-3 years, however, both the Bank of Lithuania and the Government of the country are much more prepared for these processes than a decade ago, in an interview “Knowledge Radio – Shows “Business Position”, said Vitas Vasiliauskas, Chairman of the Board of the Bank of Lithuania.
“To say that the crisis is already around the corner, I certainly couldn’t, but there are signs of economic slowdown.
This year our economy has grown by more than 3 percent, and next year we are planning 2.8 percent growth.
The main message I would like to make to the public and to business - let's be ready for everything - said V. Vasiliauskas.
He believes that there are no uniform crises, and therefore they need to be prepared differently.
The difference from the crisis of a decade ago is that at that time the government thought that the income generated by the growing economy would be permanent, and that was the planned cost.
As a result, the crisis in 2008 led to a very drastic reduction in costs.
Now, according to V. Vasiliauskas, the situation is different, and the crisis is better prepared.
“In fact, we see that the assessment of the situation of the Bank of Lithuania and the Ministry of Finance is different.
We believe that we are already beyond the potential and need to press the brakes.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Finance does not think so – said the Chairman of the Board of the Bank of Lithuania.
The preparation of the country's institutions for the upcoming crisis, V. Vasiliauskas estimates 7 out of 10 points.
According to him, such a small and open economy as Lithuania is very affected by external factors.
The current movement of the big elephants - the United States, China, the European Union - will undoubtedly touch each other too.
We must therefore be very careful.
With a small economy to say that we are dealing with everything, it is possible, but I do not believe in it,\" V. Vasiliauskas said.
What to expect in the future for those who have taken large loans?
According to V. Vasiliauskas, the European Central Bank has clearly set up a short-term strategy, and decisions on the evolution of interest rates can be expected no earlier than next summer: “At present, the main goal is to try to manage expectations –
The trend, which is most worrying to the head of the Bank of Lithuania, is the decrease of working hands in our country.
“The decline in labour force also leads to a significant reduction in economic competitiveness.
In addition, it is also the decline of bread eaters.
Migration this year has allowed for a little balance in this process, but it is not known if this is a long-term trend - my V. Vasiliauskas.
ELTA recalls that the Bank of Lithuania and the Ministry of Finance predict that the economy will grow 3.4 per cent this year, and 2.8 per cent next year.
Sweden's Conservative Leader Will Re-Employ a Government
A conservative moderate party leader who has been in a political impasse for two months since the election will receive a second chance to form a government, the parliament's president said Monday.
Ulf Kristersson's moderate party belongs to the Alliance of four centre-right parties, which received slightly less votes in the September 9 election than the previous ruling centre-left coalition.
Both blocs found it difficult to unite the majority by refusing to negotiate with the anti-immigratic Swedish Democratic Party, the origin of which is in the neo-Nazi movement.
Christerson’s first attempt to form a government on October 14 was unsuccessful.
On October 29, Prime Minister Stefan Lofven announced his failed attempt.
In an attempt to force parties to come to an agreement, parliament chairman Andreas Norlen said he would propose Kristersson to parliament next week as a candidate for prime minister, pushing for the first vote since the start of government-building efforts.
\"It is not clear in advance whether various parties will accept Ulf Kristersson as prime minister,\" Norlen told reporters.
But he stressed that \"the process must move forward, and the dynamics between the parties must change.\"
“The negotiations must end without delay,” he added.
The date of Parliament's vote is not yet clear, but Norlen said that the possible dates include November 14.
In Sweden, the president of the parliament can instruct a candidate to form a government with which the parliament would agree four times.
If all four attempts are unsuccessful, the country must hold a new election.
The current appointment of Mr. Kristersson is the third attempt by Mr. Norlen.
Some groups of moderate parties and Christian Democrats of Alliance partners are pushing for Kristersson to accept the support of the far-right Swedish Democratic Party, but he has so far rejected the possibility.
Sweden's Democratic Party, which received 17.6% of the vote and is the third-largest party in the election, has long been ignored by all major current parties.
The far-right party, which successfully took advantage of voters' anger over immigration since nearly 400,000 asylum seekers arrived in the country since 2012, is demanding an influence on decisions in exchange for support.
However, the Alliance’s liberals and centrists are categorically opposed to this idea.
Since 2014, Lofven's Swedish Social Democratic Labour Party (SAP) has been in power with the greens and informal leftist support, while allowing cooperation between the blocs, but only if he holds the post of prime minister.
The Alliance and the Swedish Democratic Party have rejected this opportunity.
Afghan government delegation to engage in peace talks in Russia
A Kabul government delegation will take part in the international talks in Russia this month on peace war-torn Afghanistan, officials said Monday.
The Taliban, in turn, are still considering whether to participate.
Russia announced on Saturday that it will hold such a conference in Moscow on November 9, despite the US currently trying to enter into bilateral talks with the Taliban to end the 17-year conflict.
The Afghan government's High Peace Council, responsible for reconciliation efforts, will send four representatives to a meeting in Moscow, spokesman Sayed Ihsan Taheri told AFP.
But the Afghan foreign ministry has avoided answering whether it will send its delegation to the conference, which will focus on initiating peace talks between Kabul and the Taliban.
We are still in talks with Russian officials,” spokesman Sebaghtullah Ahmadi said.
Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said the movement was still considering going on.
Moscow also invited representatives from the United States, India, Iran, China, Pakistan and five former Central Asian republics.
Pakistan, which has long been accused of supporting the Taliban in Afghanistan, \"will have to participate,\" Foreign Ministry spokesman Muhammad Faisal told AFP.
The U.S. Embassy in Kabul has not yet responded to the request for comment.
The meeting was initially scheduled for September in Moscow, but was postponed after Kabul requested that the process be led by the Afghans.
Negotiations will take place during this period.
The newly appointed U.S. peace envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, is trying to convince the Taliban to agree to end the war and fears that a multilateral meeting in Russia could ruin this effort.
A U.S. government supervisory authority last week said the government of Kabul in Afghanistan had weakened in recent months.
Cuban President meets with North Korean leader in Pyongyang
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel, who both hope for the lifting of U.S. economic sanctions, have agreed to expand and strengthen their strategic relations, North Korean state media said Monday.
Diaz-Canel, who arrived in Asia on his first international trip after coming to power in April, flew to Pyongyang with his wife on Sunday.
Kim Jong-un met him at the airport, and the leaders came together to visit the city through the crowds welcoming them.
North Korea’s state media said the leaders had held talks at the state guest house Paekhwawon highlighted the common socialist history of their countries and promised further solidarity.
The official media did not provide much details, but said the atmosphere of the negotiations was friendly.
The meeting with Kim could be seen as a warning to Washington, whose efforts to secure significant progress on North Korea’s denuclearization are increasingly in need.
Pyongyang, which has recently sought Moscow's favor with confidence, has tightened its rhetoric ahead of the meeting between US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and North Korea's chief negotiator Kim Yong Cholo this week in New York.
On the weekend, Pyongyang criticised the U.S. on its official media for its irrevocable sanctions, a political tool that Washington has also widely used against Cuba and Russia.
North Korea has indicated it could further develop its nuclear weapons program if Washington does not change course.
Sanctions are an important issue on the Diaz-Canel agenda.
During his visit to Moscow last week, Diaz-Canel discussed a nearly $50 million ($43.8 million) arms deal with Russia and received a similar promise from Vladimir Putin to expand political, economic and military ties.
The two presidents then issued a joint statement condemning the US-interference in the internal affairs of sovereign states.
The U.S. economic embargo for Cuba, originally introduced in 1958 and subsequently extended, remains in force.
Russian sanctions against the United States and the European Union were imposed because of the annexation of Crimea and support for separatists in eastern Ukraine.
Diaz-Canel is due to leave Pyongyang on Tuesday.
He will also visit China, Vietnam and Laos.
On-site storage - cars are unsafe?
On Saturday, the woman asked police to investigate the fraud.
According to the Klaipėda woman, Hyundai Santa Fe’s car park manufactured in 2006 was left at the end of September.
The announcement was posted on the website on November 3.
It turns out that fraudsters tried to sell her vehicle for 3800 euros.
The owner said the car could have been stolen.
The vehicle was sold by a man born in 1989.
According to the police, the person is not the owner of the area.
An investigation will be carried out to investigate the circumstances of the crime.
According to firefighters, on Sunday night, at about 22:00, the fire erupted on Banduži Street, on the seventh floor of a multi-apartment building.
It was burned in a one-room apartment stacked with garbage and a sofa standing in the room.
The owner of the apartment was taken out of the apartment and examined by doctors, police said.
Remove burnt and sunbathing objects from the apartment window.
During the fire, the walls of the 7th floor staircase were covered.
Record: Athletes sailed to Britain in 157 days
The British athlete got out of the sea to the coast in England on Sunday, becoming the first person to sail along the coast to Britain.
Ross Edgley, 33, spent 157 days in water and overtook 2,883 kilometres.
He would swim six hours later and sleep on his accompanying support team's board.
In the last mile, the athlete defeated with hundreds of fellow swimmers.
He got off the coast in Margate, southeast England, where Edgley began his journey on June 1.
The sportsman, who planned to keep up in 100 days, said to his trusted relatives on the shore: \"I'm sorry, I'm late.\"
He said he first felt relief when he got off the shore.
“I was very worried that my legs would not withstand,” said the athlete.
The World Association for Open Water Swimming said Edgley had had to face extreme weather conditions several times during the endurance test, sponsored by the Red Bull energy drink manufacturer, and had been stabbed 37 times by jellyfish.
The organizers said Edgley had doubled the record for the longest sea-breaking voyage, which has been 73 days.
He also achieved a new record, probably overcoming the distance between the southern and northernmost points of Britain: Lands End Cape and John O'Grouts.
The athlete overcame this distance in 62 days.
The secret of Kleboniskis forest: one suspect has already been arrested
It was a terrible discovery of a passerby, because the murderer was badly buried.
Only in such circumstances was it found out about this crime, because the victim of the murderers had no relatives and was not notified of its disappearance.
According to preliminary data, he was not the oldest in adulthood.
Like the suspects of his murder.
One of them was allowed to be arrested last week by the Kaunas District Court for three months.
The second, which is suspected of fleeing abroad, where he is hiding his sentence for another crime, is still being sought.
Until it is found, law enforcement officials no longer comment on the circumstances of this crime.
I think I would be able to get along with a lot of my children.
The new rock opera “Love and Death in Verona” is expanding.
Inga Valinskienė joins the team of artists, entrusted with one of the most important roles of the work - a known woman will play Juliet's babysitter.
Povilas Meškėla, who will take care of the singing of artists, was also an important part of the team.
“I think there have been many and very beautiful love stories created since Shakespeare, but Romeo and Juliet are likely to remain a symbol of these stories and be built on various scenes for a long time.
It will be interesting to become part of one of such constructions - I. Valinskienė says about the new test that fell on the shoulders.
Although a well-known woman is well-known on stage, she has played several roles in various performances or musicals, the nanny has not yet played for her.
“It’s time to play Juliet,” she smiled.
I would probably have liked to have accepted such a proposal in my own time, too.”
True, the character of the nanny in Shakespeare's drama is no less important, some critics are even considered to be the most important.
The babysitter is not only a mediator, a helper - its way and tone of speaking, the feminine attitude to feelings and the resulting solidarity with lovers gives the plot more and different colors.
Also important is the fact that she is one of only two women in the drama Romeo and Juliet.
“The golden character is not very close to my way and style, but sometimes it’s just more interesting.
Creating a different character than you have yourself - a fun part of the creative process.
I do not yet know what the final result will be, because it will depend not only on me, but also on the director’s interpretation,” says Valinskienė, and reveals that as Juliet’s babysitter, she would probably do the same.
I think the girl asked her heart.
This is what most women do.
I would probably do that, too,
The legendary Kęstutis Antanilis rock opera “Love and Death in Verona” is based on Shakespeare’s famous drama “Romeo and Juliet”
A fact-based work tells the tragic end of the love story of two young people, Romeo and Juliet.
The sad outcome of the story is determined by the uncertainty about the conflict between the families of young people - Montecs and Kapuleti.
“Everything is possible at all times.
Parents who are against the choice of children have always been and will always be.
Only today are solutions to such problems - more diverse - asked if Romeo and Juliet's story could be repeated today, says future nanny I. Valinskienė.
For the sake of my children, I would be able to reconcile many things, including those of the girls.
In the rock opera directed by actor and director Ramūnas Cicėnas, the main roles – Romeo and Juliet – will be performed by Ieva Zasimauskas and Justinas Jarutis, the stage will also feature Vidas Bareikis, Kęstutis Cicėnas, Mindaugas Interest, Marius Jampolskis, Paulius Šinkūnas and Aidas Barkauskas.
The latest creation of rock opera “Love and Death in Verona” will be presented to the audience at the end of December.
The first legendary work of the new colours will be seen by the viewers of the Vilnius-Siemens Arena on 28 December.
The day later, on December 29th, the rock opera will be shown in the Klaipėda-Švyturys Arena.
E. Jankauskas announces with whom footballers will finish the League of Nations tournament
Lithuanian football coach Edgaras Jankauskas announced the membership of the national team for the UEFA Nations League matches with Romania and Serbia on November 17 and 20.
23 players are invited to the team, which will begin on November 13.
13 of them are playing in foreign clubs, 10 are playing in the Lithuanian A league.

After a three-year break, 23-year-old Gratas Sirdėdas returns to the team.
Sirgėdas made his debut in the national team at the age of 18 after the successful 2013 European U-19 Championship.
At the European Youth Championship in Lithuania, Sirgėdas scored 3 goals and became the most successful priority player and was elected to the symbolic team of the championship.
However, later on, the career of a promising footballer was stopped by trauma.
After a two-year break, another spokesman for Kaunas Žalgiris, Marcus Beneta, received the invitation.
In October, Egidijus Vaitkūnas and Edvinas Girdvainis, who missed the League of Nations games with Romania and Montenegro, returned to the ranks.
“We will seek to win the first points in the League of Nations, although we are waiting for a very heavy duel in rival squares.
At home, we lost a minimal difference for both Serbians and Romanians.
There was also a lack of success.
We hope that the guests will be able to come back.
While for opponents it is crucial to fight for the first place in the group and the opportunity to continue the fight for the trip to the European Championship,” said E. Jankauskas, coach of the Lithuanian team.
Two rounds before the end of the League of Nations, the C division 4 group has a very persistent fight.
After four rounds, the Serbian team has 8 points.
As soon as the leaders are left behind Montenegro, two points - third-placed Romania.

“Skamp” presents a song whose video has already refused to show one TV
This year and again, the group “Skamp” started to create music.
Having announced the only concert “Skamp20” that will take place on December 26 at the Vilnius-Siemens Arena, a known trio presents new works one by one.
This time it's \"Love Me Like There's No Tomorrow\" and it's a bold video of the song.
“This piece is about love, so I thought it would be worth remembering all kinds of relationships, regardless of age or sexual orientation,” says Erica Jennings, who is convinced that any homophobia in 2018 isn’t normal.
“We’ve always supported LGBTQIA communities and believe that one day we won’t have to discuss it anymore,” says Viktor Diawara, who created the music at the beginning of the year during his family holiday in Israel.
True, because of this video, Skamp has already managed to get negative reactions - he did not want to show one of the country's most popular shows.
This tells us a lot about our society.
Television won’t show up because people are kissing and it’s probably inappropriate content for children.
And the fact that at any time of the day, the TV can be put on the screen for fighting and other examples of violence is the right content – rhetorically, Jennings asks.
Willius Alesius: “I would like to see more people with hands and kisses around, regardless of their social status, gender or age.
We raise children and want them to grow up in an environment where tolerance and bullying are as low as possible.
The new song and video we want to shed some light on our listeners’ day and give them a smile.
Since 1998, Skamp has been known for its bold texts on unpopular or sensitive topics.
All of the band’s best songs – old and new – will sound loudly and widely at Skamp20 concert on the 26th of December in the Vilnius-Siemens Arena.
Everyone with their families is welcome, and children under the age of 10 are free of charge.
Next to the clinic viaduct - traffic accident: injured person riding a bicycle

Presidential office: LRT is not owned by politicians
As the Seimas intends to return to the discussion of the conclusions of the commission that investigated the activities of the LRT, the Presidency fears that the ruling authorities are simply seeking to gain more political control over the public broadcaster.
“The public broadcaster is not the property of politicians, and the fundamental principle is to maintain that independence from politicians,” Mindaugas Lingė, the president’s adviser, told news radio.
However, the counselor pointed out, at the moment one can see the opposite process.
“It can be seen that this (political) influence is expected to have more.
That is what we are looking at quite critically,” said Lingė.
According to him, the proposals of the LRT commission operating in the Seimas are questionable and questionable legality, because they target the independence of the broadcaster.
While Mr Lingė stressed the need to improve LRT governance, this should be done with the help of experts and in the search for concrete aspects that hinder the smooth functioning of LRT.
He stressed that international institutions were already stressing that LRT should be supervised not by political but by competent authorities.
On Tuesday, the Seimas will take a decision on the conclusions of the commission that examined the activities of LRT.
These conclusions have received a lot of criticism.
The proposals to change the governance of LRTs are highly skeptical: to reduce the powers of the Council and to link the terms of office of its members with the terms of office of the appointing authorities.
In view of the concerns expressed by the European Broadcasting Union.
In January, the opposition group of Seimas members appealed to the Constitutional Court on whether the Special Parliamentary Commission investigating the activities and finances of the LRT is in conflict with the Constitution.
For working abroad - good news from R. Karbauskis
The Seimas began to consider the amendment to the Law on Declaration of Residence submitted by the Senior Ramūnas Karbauskis of the Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union Group, according to which citizens working and paying taxes outside Lithuania would be exempt from mandatory payment of health insurance contributions.
The draft was supported by 56 MPs on Tuesday, before there were 9, and 25 MPs abstained.
After discussion in committees, the draft is planned to be discussed at the Seimas plenary session on 6 December. The Seimas also decided to ask for the Government’s conclusion.
According to the proposed project, persons who pay social insurance contributions in the Member States of the European Union, states of the European Economic Area or in the Swiss Confederation shall, by decision of the Administration Agency of the State Social Insurance Fund, be exempted from the mandatory payment of health insurance contributions in the Republic of Lithuania.
Those residing and working outside Lithuania, in accordance with the procedures submitted and approved by the Board of the State Social Insurance Fund “Sodra” and the State Tax Inspectorate, would be considered to have left Lithuania.
It’s about services that people don’t use.
There is an additional opportunity to capture the fact that a person is absent – R. Karbauskis explained from the Seimas Tribune.
Such proposed legal regulation would, in the opinion of the Conservative of the Seimas, be unfair to citizens living in Lithuania and paying taxes.
“The part of Lithuanians living abroad is being abused,” Matulas noted.
Social Democrat Algirdas Sys believes that this is how we call on citizens not to comply with their obligations.
In his opinion, it would be possible for smart people to have access to the healthcare system free of charge.
After the adoption of the proposed amendments to the law, persons who have left for residence in other countries pay social insurance contributions there, do not accumulate debts, the burden of debt administration will be reduced.
Currently, Lithuanian citizens who have actually left Lithuania, but have not declared in accordance with the procedure laid down by legal acts in the Population Register of departure, monthly mandatory health insurance (PSD) contributions are calculated, and if they are not paid, the debt accumulates.
Duonela is convicted of fraud, but acquitted of fraud
Vilnius Regional Court retained the sentence for attempted fraud against the former famous athlete Alvydas Duonela, but he was acquitted for document counterfeiting.
The court’s verdict on Monday came into effect immediately.
Duonela was sentenced to six and a half years in prison and suspended execution.
The multiple Lithuanian kayak rowing champion was convicted by Vilnius City District Court in March this year.
He was sentenced to four and a half years in prison.
The Vilnius Regional Court, which examined the case on the basis of a criminal complaint, removed one charge, but the sentence remained the same.
The former athlete will also have to pay almost 760 euros to the Crime Victims Fund.
The prosecutor’s office accused him of counterfeiting a bill in 2013 by which he lent LTL 200,000 (about EUR 58) to his already ex-wife’s dental cabinet, Dalecija, which was run by his former wife Dalia Burokate.
The spouse learned about this only in December 2016, when he received calls to cover the debt.
The former spouse said he had never borrowed money from the husband for the purposes of the money clinic and had not signed a bill of exchange.
According to the judges of the Vilnius Regional Court, the case does not have objective data proving that it is Mr. Duonela who would have recorded data that do not correspond to reality that it is UAB Dalecija who owes A. Duonelai LTL 200,000.
Agrees with the arguments set out in the complaint of the convicted person and his defenceer, the case does not contain objective data confirming this.
Having thus found that A. Duonela had only used a false true document for fraud and having recognized that this feature - the use of a counterfeit document - is an integral part of fraud (in the case under consideration - an attempt to fraud), A. Duonela is acquitted under Article 300(1) of the Criminal Code without proving that he was involved in committing a criminal offence - reads the judgment of Vilnius Regional Court.
Firefighters lead the cats buried in the ground - screaming for three days
According to the Kaunas County Fire Rescue Board, there was a report that the cat was buried after changing heat pipelines for three days.
Firefighters also heard the cat scream.
It was discovered that a few days ago the thermal track repair work was carried out here.
It is believed that when the trail was buried under the overlay, two cats could have been shut down by the ground.
Firefighters dug over the heat route at a depth of one and a half meters, and in it they knocked out the cavity for the cats to get out.
Antonino Scalia's son says his father's unsurpassed liberal protests over Kavanaugh
The son of Veil’s Supreme Court judge Antonin Scalia told Fox News on Sunday that his father’s unsurprising protests against the nominated judge Brett Kavanaugh, who believed the Supreme Court was too involved in the affairs of the modern world.
“In general, he would not be surprised by the noise of his nomination for the Supreme Court, because many refer to Roe v Wade case – at least the left – as the case says,” said Christopher Scalia, referring to the 1973 case, which resulted in women’s constitutional right to abortion in certain trimesters.
Roe’s case in particular abolished the rights of all states to regulate abortion themselves, and some states, in response to the decision, immediately tried to restrict the right to abortion.
“My father often said that Roe vs. Wade and other cases were actually trying to solve cultural problems, even though they had to be resolved in elections and legislative proceedings,” he added on Fox & Friends’ show.
“In an attempt to speed up the process, the Supreme Court has done even more harm, so nominations to the Supreme Court and approval disputes cause a more serious reaction because judges take on the role of legislators.
Nebraska Senator Ben Sasse expressed a similar view at this month's meeting on Kavanaugh's approval, repeating that Congress often gives too much power to executive authorities, which are largely not accountable to anyone and leave the red tape to the Supreme Court, and judges have to take up work that the senators refuse.
Capitol Hill police arrested and accused hundreds of protesters of illegal interference in the candidate's approval process.
Asked whether Kavanaugh could avoid an hostile reaction to the uncontested accusations of sexual misconduct he had committed decades ago, Scalia said it would probably not be possible to avoid noise.
In response to claims that Kavanaugh should not hold office in the Supreme Court because on Thursday, during a poll of senators, he responded ferociously and sometimes insidiously, Scalia questioned whether all judges were of a calm character.
\"The judges often get angry,\" said Scalia, referring to the angry disagreements that sometimes arise in controversial cases.
Judge Kavanaugh may have responded more aggressively, but that was different.
He tried to protect his name from uncontested accusations.
On Thursday, the Senate Courts Committee allowed Kavanaugh to take part in the vote of the Senate as a whole.
Arizona Republican Senator Jeff Flake said in a dramatic moment that he would give his decisive vote to Kavanaugh only if the FBI had been given a week to investigate the alleged crimes against Kavanaugh.
The investigation is ongoing and President Trump has said that the agency has a wide range of powers and is able to interrogate \"on request.\"
“Schiaparelli” in the collection of ready-made clothes – fantastic decorations
Is it possible to embody surrealism?
“Schiaparelli has tried to answer this question.
Paris Fashion House, founded almost a century ago by Elsa Schiaparelli, presented its first collection of ready-made clothing and handbags.
This collection is almost as incredible as the famous Elsa Schiaparelli inverted shoe hat for a brand that likes to wear ready-made clothes.
The eccentric image of a long-carried fashion house this time also appeared to be very modern.
In aesthetic solutions, you will find senses, lobsters, hearts and eyes.
Schiaparelli created his first overall in 1930, and was the first designer to perform with podium by music.
She and her friend Salvador Dali have come up with a combination of art and fashion, and now Calvin Klein and Raf Simons, working with American artist Sterling Ruby, have taken over the idea.
It was a legend that Dali, along with Schiaparelli's motif, wanted to put on a real mayonnaise before the demonstration, but did not receive any support.

“We wanted to go back to a collaborative idea that is inseparable from the history of Schiaparelli,” said Bertrand Guyon, the creative director who has been working for the last three years at a fashion salon in Vandom Square.
When creating a collection of ready-made clothes, he relied on Schiaparelli for his friendship with Man Ray and, in collaboration with My Ray Foundation, created clothes based on well-known works of art.
The famous image of the artist’s close-eyed eyes, “Glass tears,” is depicted on a shirt slammed with “Perspex,” and the red lips from the “Observatory time: lovers,” printed on a true silhouette dress with a collage by silkscreen.
My Ray's \"Glass Tears\" on a T-shirt
One of Elsa’s strangeties was the superstitious attraction to the letter S. Her branded colour – “The Shocking Pink” inspired her perfume “The Shocking”
Guyon's first Kurta, Schiaparelli, is a handbag with a key hole on the buckle called \"mystery\"
Its retail price will also be fantastic – £5,000.
Yesterday, a temporary store was opened in the warehouse on the left bank of the Old Town, showing the surreal side of Paris Fashion Week, and for €100, it was possible to buy Virgil Abloh’s carpets from the soon-appearing Ikea collection.
Half an hour before the opening, more than 500 young Abloh fans lined up in a row on the pier, eagerly buying one of his pieces at a more affordable price than Louis Vuitton’s male clothes.
This project helps Ablohu to reach a wider audience than the one with luxury fashion or designer-designed furniture.
“No one has any property, but knowledge of a particular chair can help you make a conversation at the dinner table.
This is what millennials think,” he said recently.
The viewers gathered in the Marais district realized that this event in the garage would not be usual when models began to ride through them on skateboards.
Vivienne Westwood’s designer Andreas Kronthaler’s free collection of colorful men’s and women’s coats was based on portraits of Jessica Fulford-Dobson Kabul skateboarders.
Some women (and several men) who had high heeled sandals were riding skateboards, but the shoes themselves went on their own.
Westwood, after watching the show in the first row and wearing a collection dress with horse motifs and an orange cardigan woven through her waist, joined her husband in giving her a bouquet of flowers.
Strong twin bond in photos
Peter Zelewski, who was born in Detroit and lives in London, was already established as a street photographer when he began shooting twins four years ago.
“I, as a portrait photographer and man, have always been fascinated by twins and their extraordinary relationship, which everyone is talking about,” he says.
The photographer did not plan to create the entire project, but he said, “I took a picture of the portrait of the first twins and it was no longer an addiction.”
The book “Twins” by Zelewski will soon be published photos and stories of 44 identical twins.
This project is more visual, he says: “It’s not a documentary or scientific project – I wanted to take pictures of affected and sensual portraits of people.”
Nurses have expressed distrust over the trade union that has negotiated wages.
Members of the Royal College of Nursing, dissatisfied with the trade union's transaction with the National Health Service over salaries, voiced their distrust of the union after the vote and accused it of perverting claims for wage increases that were expected.
This unprecedented decision follows a lengthy debate at the Royal College of Nursing, when his former secretary-general Janeta Davies acknowledged that he had falsely promised members that their salaries would increase by 3% this year, when the 1% limit on pay was lifted.
The members were angry and forced Davies to leave office, petitioned and held an urgent meeting in Birmingham on Friday, followed by a distrust from the college council.
“A fair and open debate in Birmingham has helped clarify relations, so the college will only strengthen,” said Maria Trawern, director of the Royal College of Nursing.
\"The vote is clear and the Royal College of Nursing and Management understood the message sent to her.
In recent weeks, the Council has already sought changes in the organisation and has sought to listen to and involve the words of its members; we will continue our efforts to implement this \"
The meeting will take place next week and it is expected that the members of the Royal College of Nursing will leave.
\"The basis of care is trust,\" the nurse at the National Health Service told the Guardian newspaper.
\"The actions of the Royal College of Nursing have undermined its credibility, and the Council must withdraw.
I hope that she will act in good faith and listen to the request.
I wonder if the members of other trade unions will also seek reform
Rachel Harrison, a state official of the General Trade Union, said in August: “As she received salaries, National Health Service workers from across the country realized she had not received the expected raise.
It made them angry.
Prior to the extraordinary meeting, the Royal College of Nursing acknowledged that it made mistakes in the 2018 salary negotiations and was poorly informed about them.
However, it is also said that the Royal College of Nursing's campaign to abolish the wage restriction forced the government to abandon this restriction and to pledge to gradually increase wages by 6.5% over three years.
The vote follows an independent investigation into the college’s tendency to land in negotiations, and Davies was accused of under-estimating the deal.
It is claimed that the Royal College of Nursing provided factual information, so members could not make a reasonable decision on the transaction and did not consider alternatives.
The College has published controversial information on whether all employees will receive a 3% increase in wages.
In a brief statement before the college meeting, representatives were mistakenly said that a \"3 % increase and increase in the implementation of the reform\" was planned.
In fact, wages had to be gradually raised to 3% and only some of the highest wage earners would have been immediately on the rise.
\"Almost all of the information provided to members after the meeting on the implementation of the deal was incorrect (probably because it was tried to simplify it),\" a spokesman for the Election Reform Service, which conducted the investigation, said.
In the opinion of the ERs, the differences between the existing system and the proposed transaction were not clearly explained and the main advantages, including the calculations of 6.5 and 29%, mentioned during the campaign, were not clearly identified, and therefore it was not possible to take a reasoned decision.
The decision to express confidence was supported by 78% of the votes and 3.74% of the members of the Royal College of Nursing took part in the vote.
Lindsay Lohan shocked Instagram by trying to steal children from the family
Lindsay Lohan was critical of Instagram, a live broadcast that followed a homeless family on the street and tried to separate her sons from her parents.
The live streaming, most likely filmed in Moscow (according to Lohan’s previously updated Instagram history), was initially offered by the actress to provide her family with a hostel, but the situation was quickly complicated.
“Hello to everyone! I want to show you what kind of family I met,” she told the audience, “the Syrian refugees are very concerned about them.
They really need help.
Do you want to go with me?
Let's go, I'll take care of you,\" she told the family before turning to one of the children: \"Would you like to stay in the hotel?
Looking at the movies?
It would be nice to watch a movie on a TV or computer.
After the parents refused, Lohan responded hostilely.
“Your children shouldn’t be on the street, you should work hard and do everything for them to improve their lives.
“If someone offers them a home and a place to stay, like I am now, you should agree.
They'll come back to you.
I'm not going anywhere without you.
Now I know who you are.
Don't laugh at me --
When the family tried to leave Lohan while walking on the street, the actress followed her on live streaming on Instagram
“Look at what’s going on, it’s child trafficking. So you’re ruining Arab culture.
You marry kids, although they don’t want to go with you.
Boys, don't worry, I'm with you and now we're seen by the whole world.
The broadcast ended with a physical confrontation – it seems that the mother hit Lohan.
Video clips spread to social media and some users were interested in whether this could not be equated with an attempt to kidnap.
“The Independent contacted Lohan for comments.
One-third of British people believe they will never pay off all their debts.
Almost a third of the British believe that they will not be able to cover their debts during their lifetime, and one in 10 people believe they will not even be able to reduce their debts.
A study conducted by Equifax and Gorkana, the results of which are only revealed by The Independent, showed that the British, especially members of the 18-24 age group, believe they will have a lifetime debt, and only half of them expect to get out of it.
A report published by the Institute for Fiscal Research last year found that students who left school have a debt of around £46,000, while the poorest students remain in debt for more than £57,000.
Most graduates (81 percent) will never pay their full debt, so they will work under pressure for the first 30 years.
Public debt is growing: According to the Department of National Statistics, UK family debt is record-high and the British spends an average of £900 a year more than they earn.
But is it worth worrying about these scary statistics?
Are all-embracing debt simply a new way of life for young adults (and society as a whole)?
One example is cars, which are the next major purchase that is made when you buy a home (if you smile at such success).
“Auto Trader” this week predicted that in a decade, all new cars will be purchased on a pay-out basis, which will be the usual way to buy vehicles.
“EQ Investors – Director and Certified Financial Planner Jeannie Boyle believes expectations have really changed.
“It’s really normal today to have debt: credit cards, interest-free refinancing, student loans and fast credit have become popular,” she said.
“The generation of our grandparents was ashamed to have debt.”
Nowadays, student debt and housing debt have become a normal phenomenon.
Meira O'Neill, head of personal finance at Interactive Investor, also supports this statement, who believes the results may be alarming.
\"If you borrow a huge amount that is four or five times your income, it may seem that additional debt will not mean anything,\" she said.
And so people are in trouble.
Interest rates have been low for many years, so people with high loans or other debts need to think about what would happen if the rates rose.
Perhaps it should not be surprising that the commentators of the financial industry have no doubts.
Brian Brodie, Managing Director of Freedom Finance, said: “The debt is not taboo.
A loan for home repair or purchase of a new car is no longer considered the last option.
Low interest rates have helped many people to save on fixed-term deposits, which generate higher returns, but are not so easy to achieve savings.
The middle class is borrowing more and more.
Over the past six months, about half of new loans have been taken by customers with excellent credit rating
“Equifax, Head of Financial Resolution at TDX Group, Richard Haymes, believes that such expectations – not to get out of debt for a lifetime – are a cause for concern.
He says: “In August, inflation was the highest in six months (2.7 percent), interest rates rose, and earnings grew little, so many people’s decision to borrow without a realistic plan to repay their debts is worrying.
Our analysis has shown that this year, the number of bankruptcys of individuals will increase by 17%, and the main factor in this is the record lending of consumers.
Debt may not be a cause for concern as long as a person is working and earning, but it is not clear how life-long indebtedness will affect his well-being in old age.
A study by the Economic and Business Research Centre, carried out together with specialists in loan lending for pledged assets from More 2 Life, showed that unwarranted debts of people aged 55-74 increased by more than a third in the past four years, more than twice as fast as the national average.
This age group usually borrows through credit cards and spends 30 percent more on a monthly basis than it earns.
Boyle added: \"A growing number of people aged 55 choose to pay off their debts from pension funds and this will affect their retirement lives.
These are usually the only savings they should have saved.
In addition, people think that using the assets will pay off later, but when you exchange the existing assets for a cheaper one, you don’t get as much money as expected.
If asset prices fall, this situation will only get worse.
Poisoned to half Serena Williams sang \"I Touch Myself\" to pay attention to breast cancer
Serena Williams released a video in which she sang the classic song \"Divinyls\" with the hands of I Touch Myself, covered with a naked chest.
The tennis axis shared a clip on its Instagram page and explained that the video was designed to encourage women to check their breasts themselves.
“This month I’ve recorded The Divinyls, a version of the global hit I Touch Myself, to remind women to check themselves regularly,” Williams wrote.
“So I left my comfort zone, but I wanted to do so because this problem affects women of all races around the world.
The most important thing to determine as early as possible is that it helps to save a lot of lives.
I hope I will be able to remind women of this.”
Williams continued: “This music video is part of I Touch Myself Project, which is implemented in honor of the famous Chrissy Amphlett – she died of breast cancer and gave us her hit to remind women first of her health.”
The underwear brand Berlei for Breast Cancer Network Australia (BCNA)-backed project was launched in 2014 after the death of Amphlett in 53.
The video, released by a tennis star on her Instagram account, received more than 1.5 million views and many fans praised for singing the song.
“I would like to say hello for this video and your courage to do so.
\"Thank you, Serena,\" wrote one fan.
He added: “Serena, it’s amazing.
20 years ago, I had breast cancer, and I found the node myself, even when mammograms showed nothing.
It just needs to be checked.
Thank you for not being afraid to leave the comfort zone, you are a true goddess.
The Berlei I Touch Myself Project also released a new snake leather bra, The Chrissy, inspired by a rock star.
100 percent of the profit from the sale of the bra will be donated to BCNA.
When checking for yourself, it is important to know what signs and symptoms you need to look for.
Signs of breast cancer include not only the nodes, but also changes in the size or shape of the breast, rashes or wounds, discharge from the nipples, recesses of the skin surface, persistent pain or changes in the texture of the skin.
In addition, swelling at the armpit or keybone, swollen veins and pelvis may be a warning for cancer.
Women are advised to check their breasts every month.
If you notice any signs of breast cancer, NHS recommends that you contact your family doctor immediately.
If your family doctor decides that your symptoms need additional evaluation, he or she will send you to a breast cancer clinic.
Adam Driver forced the entire SNL filming group to quattro
Adam Driver was this week’s Saturday Night Live guest star and really tried to make everyone laugh.
The best jokes don’t usually relate to a particular event – just like a new parody called Career Day.
The U.S. high school day, as students bring their parents together, and teenager Mortdecai (Pete Davidson) reluctantly agrees that his father, an old oil tycoon Abraham H. Parnassus, would speak.
Lazdele’s reassuring Parnassus, whose megaloman character could have been inspired by Daniel Plainview, Daniel Day-Lewis’ character, from the film “Bus Blood,” shows how he controlled the oil industry.
“I was born seven months early,” says Parnassus.
“The incubator technology was just invented, so I was put in a cast iron pot and heated in a pizza oven until I learned how to walk.
My bones did not harden, but not my spirit.
Be strong and crush your enemies
Davidson and his colleague, SNL actress Aidy Bryant, who plays the teacher, are barely laughing and unable to look Driver in the eye.
But Star Wars – the actor’s jokes are just accelerating and he begins to talk about a personal war with another oil tycoon, H. R. Pickins.
“I married your granddaughter,” he screamed.
\"I filled her belly with my rotten seeds and ruined your boy - this is my final revenge, H. R.
Parnassus in less than five minutes became the most memorable character of Adam Driver as Kylo Ren of the two films.
“Be cursed, H. R.
Kendrick Lamaro's songs leaked: eight unheard of works appeared on the Internet
It seems that many unreleased songs by Kendrick Lamar have been leaked.
On Saturday, eight unheard of pieces have been released online, including SZA, Busta Rhymes, Jay Rock, Isaiah Rashad and Abu Soul.
It’s not clear where the song came from, and the title of the set “Bad Kid Chill City EP” and cover illustration (which was probably created by a fan) are not official.
It is possible that only demo and unfinished versions of songs are leaked, sounding as if they were recorded at different stages of Lamarr's career.
“Gang Member” could belong to the “Good Kid Maad City” era, and “Heroin” would be sung together with SZA, more like the soundtrack “DAMN./Black Panther”
The following songs are distributed:
“Gang Member”
\"The Only Nigga \"
\"Want In Life \"
‘Loved Ones’ (with SZA);
“Own This City”
‘Heroin (with SZA, Jay'umi Rocku, Isaiah Rashadu and Ab Soul)’
Look Over Your Shoulders (with Busta Rhymes and Michael Jackson)
\"Swimming Pools Alternative \"
“The Independent contacted Kendrick Lamar about the comment.
Confusion over the musical “Chicago”: There are no tickets left in Klaipėda, invite you to go to Vilnius or Kaunas
The desire of Lithuanians to see the musical of Klaipėda State Musical Theatre “Chikaga” is not lacking.
For this reason, perhaps the most popular Lithuanian musical of all time has set itself into another tour through the country’s largest arenas.
However, about 1.5 months before the show, the halls are stunned.
Organizers announce that all tickets to the musical in Klaipėda-Švyturys are already sold, tickets are rapidly melting and the performances arenas of Kaunas-Žalgiris and Vilnius-Siemens arenas.
Tickets are no longer available for some time in the port city, so anyone who wants to see this indifferent musical, we invite you to go to Kaunas or Vilnius, where tickets are still a little bit.
The shows will take place in December, so when you come from further you will not only see our musical, but also have a great opportunity to look at the trees of the largest cities in the country - the solution is offered to the fans of the musical by the head of Klaipėda State Theatre Laima Vilimienė.
In December, “Chicagos” will meet visitors with some change in the composition of the artists.
One of the main roles of the musical was first entrusted to actor Tom Žaib.
Talented and well-known actor in Chicago from TV screens will embody Billy Flynn, the best and most influential Chicago lawyer to change the fate of people without scrupulously changing their lives.
Since the Klaipėda State Musical Theatre musical “Chikaga” is adapted to larger spaces and arenas, the composition of the artists appearing in it is also larger than that of Broadway.
In the Lithuanian “Chicago” there are almost half a century of artists.
The main roles of women are entrusted to the charming soloist of Klaipėda State Musical Theatre Beata Ignatavičiūtė (killer Velma Kelly) and the charismatic soloist of Kaunas Musical Theatre Gabriele Bielskyte (killer Roxie Hart).
The Chicago musical depicts the Chicago criminal world of the 19th century, which turns prison walls into a star hill.
It is a musical satire of criminal justice, which tells about two murderers seeking attention and recognition.
The musical is pervaded by sexuality and irony.
No matter what the main heroes Roxie Hart and Velma Kelly do, the meaning of life is to shine with a radiant star.
Their life is life on the front page of the message, on the headline, on the glitter, on the alley of glory...
December 13 – Čikaga will be shown in Klaipėda-Švyturys Arena, December 18 – Kaunas-Žalgiris Arena, December 20 – Vilnius-Siemens Arena.

Site furniture in Kaunas
The site can be called a representative home area, where we spend time with friends, welcome guests, etc. Therefore, it should be installed in such a way that it is convenient not only for the owners of the apartment or house, but also for guests.
Depending on the size of the living room, the walls, the decor of the ceiling, the taste of the owners, it is necessary to choose the appropriate furniture.
The site should be not only beautiful, but also comfortable.
It is best to invite an interior designer, who will help to optimally fill the space so that it is not overloaded or vice versa - too much empty.
It is advisable to first determine the main point of the site, i.e., the item to which you will combine the furniture, other details.
It can be a fireplace or another important accent in the interior of the site.
It would also be great to create a chat room where guests can communicate conveniently, so that they can not be disturbed by outside furniture and so on.
Sofas, chairs should be placed close to each other so that your guests can sit down and talk.
Thus, the arrangement of furniture should encourage communication, unite people, and not distance them from each other.
Do not put furniture on the wall.
The size of the room depends on what distance should be from the walls.
While the room is small, still leave at least a little space off the wall, do not push the furniture right next to it.
If the room is large, leave even more room from the walls.
In fact, the greater the distance, the better.
Laying out the furniture to create a balance
Consider the size and location of the various details that will be on your site.
All elements must be compatible with each other.
The furniture of the site must be in harmony with the details of the interior.
A small contrast is possible.
It will brighten the interior of the site, but it should not be too large, because the interior will become tasteless.
We advise you to always consult with interior designers.
When you create the interior of the site yourself, if you do not have the necessary knowledge, you risk going to extremes: either you will create a boring interior, because you will be afraid of experimenting, making mistakes, improperly choosing or over-trying improvising.
Proper lighting
This is a very important thing.
In fact, different light reveals space differently.
Lighting must be arranged at different levels: ceiling lamps, wall lamps, lamps on the floor.
Prosecutor's Office sued for an acquittal sentence against LKF executives
Vilnius Regional Prosecutor’s Office appealed against the acquittal sentence of Vilnius Regional Court against former heads of the Lithuanian Basketball Federation (LKF).
According to the prosecutor’s office on Monday, the complaint said the municipality of Panevėžys had no legal basis to contribute to the reconstruction of the private hotel in Panevėžys with monetary funds.
During the pre-trial investigation, it was established that in order to find the possibility to finance the reconstruction of the hotel, public procurement and sales contracts for services were concluded in 2010 between the Lithuanian Basketball Federation and Panevėžys City Municipality.
Prosecutors argue that part of the services that the Federation had to provide to the Municipality of Panevėžys under the said agreement was not intended and could not, because the services planned were already received or provided for funding by the state and sponsors, some of the planned events had already taken place before the signing of the contract and had already been paid out from other funds, and some of the events took place already after the issue of VAT invoices - the money was transferred by invoices for events not yet occurred.
The Vilnius Regional Prosecutor’s Office states that it disagrees with the judgment of the court of first instance, emphasising the conclusion that the State itself has obliged and entrusted the Municipality of Panevėžys to undertake the reconstruction of a private hotel, since there was no obligation of the State regarding a particular hotel, only the express proposal to the Municipality of Panevėžys to solve the issues of the development of hotels necessary for the championship as soon as possible.
In the opinion of the Public Prosecutor’s Office, the court wrongly found that the heads of the LKF and Panevėžys municipality tried to fulfil the state obligation without having legal roads, because the data in the case showed that there were opportunities to hold competitions of the European Basketball Championship group in other cities, without prejudice to the laws.
By an appeal, the Vilnius Regional Prosecutor’s Office requests the annulment of the acquittal judgment of the court of first instance and, in this case, the adoption of a new – accused – sentence against seven natural persons and one legal person.
On October 15, Vilnius Regional Court fully acquitted Mindaugas Balčiūnas, General Secretary of the LKF for all crimes.
This case concerns preparation for the 2011 European Men's Basketball Championship in Lithuania.
Balčiūnas was charged with abuse, fraud and other crimes.
The Prosecutor’s Office M. Balčiūnas accused that while performing the duties of the General Secretary of the LKF he agreed with the chief financier and the executive director of the Federation, that the acts of performance and transmission of works that do not correspond to reality on behalf of the Federation, as well as other forged financial documents and accounts regarding services provided by the LKF to the local government of Panevėžys, should be written in official accounts.
According to the data of a pre-trial investigation conducted by officials of the Board of the Special Investigation Service (STT), the funds of the Municipality of Panevėžys could be fraudulent and forgery for the benefit of LKF and subsequent reconstruction of the used company Via Unica Hotel Romantic.
The head of this hotel, Dalia Kuklierienė, has been accused of bribery - she is suspected of giving TV as a bribe to Balčiūnas.
All defendants are acquitted.
The charges in this case were filed with eight natural persons and one legal person - the Lithuanian Basketball Federation.
Remote workspace - like the Bermuda Triangle
The number of people injured or killed at work in Lithuania from 1992 to now has already exceeded the total population of Alytus and reaches about 83 thousand.
If the requirements for a specific physical workplace and its security are as clear, then the choice of working remotely from home, public spaces or even from other countries becomes a kind of new Bermuda triangle.
According to insurance specialists, although the Law on Safety and Health at Work provides for workers working in distance work to create safety and health conditions that do not differ from other employees of the company, a variety of modern forms of work can raise a number of questions, the press release said.
In the event of an accident in the household, the employer pays compensation for the first two days of unemployment from 80%, and for the rest of the period - \"Sodra\"
If the accident is found to have occurred during work, Sodra compensates 100% of the salary from the first day of the disability.
In assessing the statistics submitted by the State Labour Inspectorate and the damage administered by the BTA, it is clear that the absolute majority of accidents and various injuries at work occur in the workplace.
Most often it is various physical works, where the risk of injury is higher: careless treatment of devices or equipment, loss of concentration or coordination.
However, offices that now focus on most of the most demanded, best paid professionals face their own challenges, which are posed by the freedom of mobility granted by employers and highly liked by employees,” says Jevgenija Krikščiūnė, Head of Human Resources Management Division of BTA.
The legislation in force in Lithuania recommends clear regulation of the employee’s duties and limits of responsibility, defining the working time, place and functions, which is also applicable to the formation of work remotely.
If this is done, it is easier to determine whether an accident occurred during work or not.
Situations and nuances really exist in different ways, each case is considered individually.
Employees have often also heard about the employer’s responsibility for accidents when going to or from work or travelling to work meetings.
However, there are a lot of nuances and reservations in this case, so I would encourage both employees and employers to initiate conversations, to find out and identify with maximum clarity and on both sides acceptable what situations are really considered accidents at work, and who will already have to have the status of domestic injuries - the specialist advises.
Krikščiūnė says that, at these times, when a computer and mobile phone and a stable internet connection are often enough to perform work functions, the employee will not necessarily work at the place specified in the agreement and at the specified time.
Employees are mobile, they can choose not to work at home, but to drink coffee in a coffee shop or park while enjoying the sun.
Will it be a job or not?
What if the working hours discussed are not in line with the agreement?
There can be really ambiguous situations, the circumstances of which are helped to clarify the investigation carried out, initiated by the “Sodra” or the State Labour Inspectorate” - says the specialist.
According to her, the financial difference between the event at work and at home is the amount of unemployment benefit.
Krikščiūnė admits that she had to informally hear unpleasant experiences when employers try to hide the real circumstances of accidents or injuries and try to persuade employees to turn to doctors outside of work, take responsibility for themselves, thus harming themselves financially.
This is an unfair, disrespectful attitude towards the employee and it should not be tolerated.
On the other hand, the mobility of people already mentioned encourages the search for additional tools that could help companies in similar situations: insurance of employer civil liability due to damage to employees, acquisition of accident insurance against injury, insurance disability or even death, as well as health insurance – says J. Krikščiūnė.
The mobile signature system is running again
After the failure was eliminated on Monday, the mobile signature system in Lithuania is again in operation, and representatives of the Estonian IT company SK ID Solutions have confirmed BNS.
The company reported the disruption on Monday morning, with Bitė Telia’s customers and a share of Tele2’s users experiencing inconvenience.
The disruptions were also recorded in Estonia, but SK ID Solutions could not comment on the situation in that country.
Lithuanian Rugby Team - Polish lessons
The European Rugby team, which is debuting in the Euro-Trophy division, is currently struggling to match up with higher level competitors.
The Trophy Division on the Old Continent is the third in capacity after the Six Nations Tournament and the European Championship.
There are 13-18 rating teams on the continent.
Lithuanians started the race in October with a solid victory in Šiauliai at 30:10 against the Czech team.
And last weekend, the Lithuanian team visited Lodz, where it was not equal to the Polish team - 0:33 (0:12).
Although the Lithuanians were self-sacrificingly defending themselves, the rules were often violated in the struggles and Polish reggablers were ahead of the penalty strikes.
3, 10, 27 and 37 minutes of penalty strikes were realized by Wojciech Piotrowicz, who gave them 12 points.
In the first half, the Lithuanians had to play without a yellow card received by Tautvydas Mažylis.
In the second half, the guests carried out several attacks, but they did not succeed.
At the time, the Poles were able to break our defenses.
The pressure on the ball was carried out by Mateuszas Plichta and later by Krystian Pogorzelskis and Mateuszas Adamskis.
The Lithuanian team coach from PAR Ntando Manyosha, who played in addition to several important reggae, acknowledged the advantage of the rivals and claimed that such a game gave a lot of valuable experience.
\"The Polish played very well and dominated in all the components of the game.
Our goal was to stay as long as possible in this game.
We have just moved to this higher level and we have to get used to it.
We won the first match against the Czechs, but now we met very powerful rivals and had to recognize their advantage.
The Polish team gave us useful lessons - - spoke to a specialist from South Africa who has been standing at the Lithuanian team's wheel for four years.
Another game “Trophy – Lithuanians will play in the division on April 6, 2019 at home with Portuguese or Romanians.
In this division, the teams of the Netherlands and Switzerland are still competing.

Japan’s Coast Guard is looking for an island that is missing
Esanbe Hanakita Kojima was named after the tiny island in the north of Japan in 2014.
A small, meaningless and undervalued island, which was essentially lifeless, was very important to Japan.
So important is that the territory that has gone missing now is intense exploration - maybe there will still be one?
Why does Japan need this island?
It's not.
Ice and underwater landslides are likely to have taken over the island forever, although it has recently spread nearly two meters above the water surface.
It is almost certain that the island simply broke down, but at least its traces are expected to be found.
When the island disappeared no one knows exactly - it was so useless that no one too much of it and did not feed her.
Perhaps the first to learn about the disappearance of Esanbe Hanakita Kojima was found out by Japanese fishermen who sometimes used the island as an aid to visual navigation.
Its extinction, even for these fishermen, is not a tragedy, because there are better ways to catch where you can fish, and where the controversial Russian waters begin.
That was the meaning of Esanbe Hanakita Kojima.
This narrow strip of land was the western edge of the Kuril valley.
This is an island chain, which Russia calls the Kuril Islands, and Japan refers to the Northern Territories.
The conflict with some such breaks continues from the middle of the 19th century, but with full force came the 20th century.
There are natural resources in these areas, but Japan is also historically convinced that the islands should belong to it.
Japan has been exploring these islands since the middle of the 17th century.
They were the first to draw up a map, took more detailed research, registering a large number of small islands.
The agreements signed between Japan and Russia in 1855 indicated that Sakhalin had been taken over and that Japan had all the Kuril Islands.
In this way, the two states settled together until 1905 when the Russian Empire lost Sakhalin to Japan during the war.
In 1945, the Soviet Union took advantage of the situation in Japan and opened up the Kuril Islands.
Japan, by the way, does not mean large claims on the entire island, although it was the first, but would like to have four islands - Iturup, Kunashi, Shikotan Islands and Chabamay.
Japan feels that it has a historical right because the islands were the first to be examined, and they also belonged to Japan under the 1855 agreements.
In 2009, Japan offered to share these four islands equally, but Russia did not even consider accepting such a proposal.
Japan is quite close to the Northern Territories, but now that the island is missing, this geographical connection is as if lost.
This physical marker about Japan’s presence in these waters has disappeared.
This is a great loss, which is why we are looking for the island’s remains.
However, even if they are found, Esanbe Hanakita Kojima will not meet the simple definition of the island - it must be land.
This means a slight decline in Japan’s territory and a sharp decline in the Exclusive Economic Zone, calculated from the shores.
I wonder what the island's search mission expects - after all, it will certainly not be just lost or lost.
Incredible drama in Lithuanian and Polish boxing duel
For more than a week I had to wait for the final verdict of judges who became the winners of the cross-border meeting between Lithuania and Poland boxing teams.
Nine Polish and Lithuanian duels were held in Poland.
Four Lithuanians won the contest, as well as Poles.
On the other hand, the decisive outcome of the duel was the long-term debate of the Chamber of Judges and the final decision of the meeting secretariat.
The meeting began with the victory of the Lithuanian boxers.
Multi-time Lithuanian champion Marius Vyšnauskas (weight category up to 52 kg) assuredly 3:0 defeated Jakub Surma, soon Edgaras Skurdelis (up to 60 kg) defeated Radomir Obrushniak after a hard fight in 2:1.
Two host wins followed: Damian Durkacz (up to 64 kg) 3:0 beat Manta Duzhin, and Philip Wachala (up to 69 kg) 2:1 surpassed Simon Banny.
Vytautas Balsys (up to 75 kg) returned to the Lithuanian team.
Lithuanian 2:1 defeated Bartosz Golebiewski.
In the next fight, Piotras Szczukowski (up to 81 kg) in the third round, a clear majority beat Eigird Kasmočius and the result again became equal to 3:3.
They did not follow the brother Jockeys.
Robertas Jokulys (up to 91 kg) 3:0 defeated Andrzejs Koltonas, while Arvydas Jokulys (up to 91 kg) had already recognized Adam Kulik’s advantage.
The main debate was the fight between Tadas Tamašauskas (up to 91 kg) and Michal Soczynski.
It was because of the final result of her cross-border meeting that it took more than a week to publish.
One judge awarded a victory to the Polish, two judges to the Lithuanian, but due to a technical error, the point of one judge to the Lithuanian was credited to Mr Soczynski.
After a long dispute, the victory was left to the Polish boxer - 2:1.
At the Lithuanian-Polish team meeting, the result was 10:8 (two points awarded for the victory) won by the hosts.
They managed to return to Lithuania for their defeat in the previous mutual match.
In 2015, at a meeting in Marijampolė, Lithuanian boxers won five out of six games and won the result at 10:2.
The Lithuanian team leaders meeting in Poland was a general rehearsal before the Lithuanian boxing championship in Šilutė on 14-17 November.
After the priorities of the country, a new Lithuanian boxing team will be formed, which will defend the honor of the country in the world and European championships next year.
How does the dog determine the direction in which the man went?
You already know that the dog's smell is very sensitive.
They can smell hidden explosives, drugs, blood, other animals, some even recognize diseases by smell.
Well-known and famous footprints in movies are dogs, but their work is much more difficult than you thought.
How do they determine in which direction the owner of the traces went?
In fact, this issue is much more complicated than you think.
Trace tracking consists of three stages - finding, directional setting and tracking.
The second stage is much more difficult than the other two, because it is difficult to decide in which direction the person walked.
After all, there's not been a second between the different steps, so their smell is not very different, right?
Not quite so.
In a 1990 study published at the University of Oslo in Oslo, experiments were conducted in which the dog was placed at an angle of 90 degrees.
Tests are carried out on the grass and on the asphalt.
And in many cases, dogs easily determined the direction of the human walk, even when he tried to deceive them by passing back.
Can you imagine how difficult this task is?
The difference between the smell of adjacent traces is very small, and with time it decreases even more.
But scientists say that it is not so strange - dogs could say and which part of the foot touched the ground first.
This is because their smell is an incredible tool.
The dog's brain is dominated by the areas responsible for the smell (how our brain is dominated by the regions responsible for the vision).
The dog's nose has 125-300 million scent receptors.
In general, the dog's smell is at least 40 times more sensitive than that of humans, but their ability to interpret different smells plays an even greater role.
Scientists then conducted similar experiments and traces left over by bicycles, but it was much more difficult for dogs to trace their direction.
This is due to the fact that bicycle cancer is not segmented as traces of the passing person, so it is more difficult to isolate different places for comparison - it is not natural for dogs, so it takes more time.
Dogs are not the strongest owners of olfactory.
This title is likely to come to bearers.
The white bear males follow the female mates for hundreds of kilometers, and the brown bear smells an animal 30 km away.
In private forests, we will regulate cuttings.
Environment Minister Kęstutis Navickas will discuss deforestation in the Seimas on Tuesday.
At the end of August, the public was dissatisfied with the forests in Labanor Regional Park.
For a month, the deforestation was stopped.
The minister has admitted that the investigations into cuttings in Labanor have shown that no serious violations were committed.
However, the Ministry of Environment has already introduced a part of the restrictions, taking into account the work group’s proposal to strengthen deforestation in state-owned forests.
The Minister promises that other legislation that will adjust deforestation will be drawn up by the end of the year.
The same restrictions are imposed, which will apply to deforestation in state forests, and also to private forest holdings.
Agnė Jagelavičiūtė revealed the strategy of bringing together 170,000 followers
It is necessary to give people what they want and at the same time insert what they want into the LRT TV show “Cultural with Nomeda,” says Agnė Jagelavičiūtė.
According to the stylist, so she gradually formed a huge crowd of fans.
“You initially hit a person’s taste, drag yourself, and over time you improve that taste a little bit,” Jagelavičiūtė says.
A. Jagelavičiūtė has more than 170,000 followers on her Facebook account - she achieved this number using a certain strategy: \"At first, you hit a person's taste, drag yourself, over time you improve that taste.\"
Stylist A. Jagelavičiūtė says she does not tolerate uncertainty, so she shows her face as it is - authenticity and ability to find the best way to present themselves are the most important criteria of popularity in social networks.
She notes that there is also no human culture left on social networks, because many people come to them in order to get angry with someone or read comments from other people who are dissatisfied: “For example, in adolescence, there was a time when I wanted to pry with everyone and curse - now I have no desire to do so.
“A false life is the worst thing.
There is a lot of this in social networks.
In Facebook, even less than on Instagram, she speaks.
A. Jagelavičiūtė, who has an education in interior design and painting, says she sends a specific message on social networks - talking about women's emancipation.
It also promotes the production of magazines, and in its work it also sees creation.
“I can’t say that fashion magazine is an expression of pure art, but I know there’s a lot of it.
I believe that there is a lot of creativity in my work, like vanity.
I balance - this is my key to those huge numbers.
I don’t want to create a false life.
It is much better to give people what they want and quietly insert what they want,” Jagelavičiūtė says.
One of the most difficult events that attract young people is classical music concerts.
To increase their popularity, well-known people offered through life stories: talking about behind the scenes, failures, life events, thus remaining authentic.
It is such a strategy that A. Jagelevičiūtė proposes to apply to the whole culture.
According to her, culture does not have opportunities to enjoy no one, to do no entertainment or to show true values.
Like a boring teacher before students – are there any chances?
If we don’t find a way to present that art, advertise without advertising, nothing will go away.
When we are realistic and catch a reader, maybe something will change.
You've got it once, the second, the third -- and already the addiction -- she's sharing her insights.
Three people disappeared after a helicopter crashed in Lituya Bay north of Juno
On Saturday, after a helicopter crash north of Juno, a search for three people was launched in Alaska.
One man was rescued after Friday's disaster and the other three were unable to find him.
The helicopter crashed near Lituya Bay, northwest of Juno.
It was found to be Airbus H125 on a long-distance trip to Grand Preri in Texas.
The aircraft was found 100 feet from the coast on Friday.
According to the Associated Press, one rescued person was 14 years old.
It was reported that she had a mild hypothermia, but there were no other problems.
Two adults and two adolescents flew on a crashed helicopter.
According to the KTVA, David King (53), Josh Pepperd (42) and Andrew Pepperd (11) disappeared.
Pepperd was found to be the director of Davis Constructors & Engineers, an Alaskan construction company.
It is not clear why the accident occurred.
The National Transport Safety Council said an investigation had been initiated.
“The crashed helicopter, which was completely new – just from the factory, flew two adults and two teenagers,” coast guards said in a statement.
The pilot was found to have 40 years of experience in flying fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters, including flights in Alaska.
\"Anchorage Daily News, a family friend, Jeff Brodsky said that relatives \"have not yet lost hope that a miracle will happen.\"
With the help of a coastguard helicopter, rescuers resumed their search on Mount Nevis in Fort William, Scotland on February 17, 2016.
On Saturday, three people were searched for missing in Alaska after a helicopter crash.
“I have experienced sexual violence.”
President Kellyanne Conway revealed sexual violence on Sunday morning.
Conway commented on fierce disputes between Judge Bretto Kavanaugh, who is a candidate for the Supreme Court, and his accused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
Conway was excited to reveal that she herself had experienced sexual violence and defended Kavanaugh against Chief Justice Jake Tapper, saying the judge had been accused of sexual abuse by ignoring facts that were unfavorable to the charges.
“I am very sorry for the victims of sexual abuse and violence.
I experienced sexual abuse myself,\" Conway told CNN on Sunday's State of the Union.
“I’m a victim of sexual violence and I don’t think Judge Kavanaugh, Take Tapper, Jeff Flake or anyone else is responsible for it.
We must be responsible for our own behavior.
Conway said the news network had to be ashamed of Kavanaugh's comparison with Bill Cosby, who was sentenced to three to ten years in a Pennsylvania state prison last week.
Conway also criticised the Senate Committee for failing to remove former President Bill Clinton, who had had oral sex in his office and lied to the U.S. people.
The survey showed that Kavanaugh and Ford testimonies divided American society
The Americans disagree over Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony and his accused Christian Blasey Ford, the accused said the judge sexually attacked her when they were teenagers.
The number of those who think Ford or Kavanaugh is lying is almost the same: 38 percent say Kavanaugh is likely to have lied or not to have lied about the testimony, and 30 percent said the same about Ford.
The Senate Courts Committee heard both parties when Ford sent a letter to Senator Dianne Feinstein with detailed charges against the judge.
After the letter was made public, both Ford and Kavanaugh said they were ready to speak against the committee.
Ford said she was 100 percent sure that she was being attacked by Kavanaugh at a party in the early 1980s rather than another person.
In an emotional introductory speech, a 51-year-old woman said she felt a civil duty and could not remain silent.
\"I'm very scared,\" she said.
“I’m here because I think it’s my civic duty to tell me what happened when Brett Kavanaugh and I were in high school.”
Kavanaugh, who denied allegations of sexual abuse by Ford and two other women, said: “Never sexually attacked anyone in high school, college, or any later.”
“Everyone tried to find someone who would prevent me from voting for my nomination, no matter how unrealistic or disgusting it is,” he said.
“This is the simplest defamation at the last minute.”
The results of a survey conducted by YouGov on September 27-28, which surveyed 2,607 people, are not surprising: the views of the people who sympathize with different parties differed: Democratic supporters believe more in Ford (73 per cent) and Republicans in Kavanaugh (74 per cent), although Ford believed in more Republicans than Kavanaugh – Democrats (14 per cent versus 11 per cent).
The founder of the Body Worlds exhibition, called Doctor Death, wants to be cut and shown in his own exhibition
A German scientist who invented plasticization wants to become an eternal part of his Body Worlds exhibition.
Gunther von Hagens has come up with an innovative approach to showcasing bodies, skulls, and organs in a world-wide exhibition with both admiration and controversial reviews.
A man with cancer, 73, ordered his wife to plasticize him after his death to become a permanent exhibit at the Body Worlds exhibition, which will open this week in London.
“In that sense, it will be the completion of his life’s work.
Now I understand that I will have to do this because I will express recognition and love in this way,” Angelina Whalley told The Observer.
She said that the man gave strict instructions on what to do with his corpse, and the whole process will take about a year.
Muscles, nerves and arteries should be rolled out, and silicone should be injected into the body and placed in the right position.
\"He said to me, \"Angelina, you can freeze me to 25 degrees Celsius for a year, but then you'll have to add your hands, otherwise I'll freeze.\"
So I'll be able to pity for a year, then I'll have to take it --
He will then, ideally, wear an indistinguishable soft fetish hat from his image, join the exhibition in the London pavilion next to other bodies that are stagnating in time in steep postures, such as riding a horse or playing cards.
Won Hagens made his debut in the UK in a live British television broadcast (the first public show in 170 years).
Body Worlds has visited more than 47 million people around the world since 1995.
Body Worlds London founder Peter Tabernal told The Guardian that 100 percent of the exhibitions, which cover about 28,000 square feet, were donated by people who “had given their consent to help the living, to educate them and to help see potential problems.”
“We see and read so many terrible things that we are afraid of death.
No one will escape it, death is common to all of us, and I think that “Body Worlds” shows you don’t have to be afraid,” Tabernal said.
Ronaldo’s lawyers threaten court action for rape
Portuguese football star Cristiano Ronaldo's lawyers said Friday that a German magazine that published \"probably illegal\" American claims that Ronaldo raped her in 2009 would be sued.
One of Ronaldo’s lawyers, Christian Schertz, said in a statement that the article in Der Spiegel magazine was “an unacceptable statement of private accusations” and that he would seek the magazine’s reward for his client by legal means.
The statement was sent to Reuters by Ronaldo’s Gestifute firm in response to a request to comment on Der Spiegel’s article published on the internet on Friday.
Gestifute did not answer specific questions about the content of the Der Spiegel statement, which Reuters could not independently verify.
Der Spiegel first filed charges in April 2017.
One of the most popular athletes in the world, Ronaldo has five times won the title of the best player in the world.
This summer he moved to the Italian Juventus from Real Madrid, the Italian club refused to comment on the statement by Der Spiegel.
The magazine said the alleged rape occurred in June 2009 in the Las Vegas hotel room, according to Leslie Mark Stovall, a lawyer at Kathryn Mayorga.
Stovall told the magazine that Ronaldo and Mayorga had agreed out of court.
Mayorga agreed to sign a confidentiality agreement for Ronaldo’s $375,000 payment.
Stovall did not respond immediately to Reuters’ comments and Mayorga did not respond to calls by home phone.
However, Stovall told Der Spiegel magazine that he had filed a civil complaint seeking to cancel the confidentiality agreement.
Mayorga told Der Spiegel magazine she thinks the treaty is no longer binding on her because she feels the consequences of her nine-year-old night.
\"I have experienced serious crises,\" she said.
“And then there’s the accusation of rape.
I blame him and blame myself for signing this...
A sustainable business that ensures the independence of the creators
Are you ready to try Self-publishing 3.0?
In a new White Paper published today on #selfpub3.0, the Independent Creators’ Union explains in detail for the first time how to join other business developers, become independent and start a sustainable creative business.
Orna Ross, founder of the Independent Creators’ Union, has been recognized for the first time as one of the 100 most influential people in publishing, at the Digital Book World 2018 conference, will explain why developers should allow Self-publishing 3.0 methods.
“Consumer trends, such as popular personal brands, responsible consumption and mobile phone reading, together with digital publishing technologies, create favourable conditions for creators’ businesses,” Ross said.
However, these opportunities can only be used by independent and creative thinkers who understand the value of intellectual property.
#selfpub3.0 encourages developers to create multiple sources of earnings through websites that create conditions for successful publishing and media.
You can earn from direct sales, subscription models, crowdfunding, widespread dissemination models and other sources of income, such as online training and related activities.
#selfpub3.0 also promotes the distribution of books in a wide range of formats to the widest possible audience through retailers and other services.
The main objective of #selfpub3.0 is to encourage change of mindset and to learn how to manage your creative business so that intellectual property, which is the most important creative asset, is not unthinkably transferred to another company, such as a specialised publishing house or an independent publishing service provider.
According to Ross, this is how creators can increase their income, influence and impact, and these methods must be sought not only by every creator of the digital age, but also by publishers; it also stressed that the true independence of creators (like other people) is guaranteed by commercial and creative freedom.
The future is here.
And its prospects for independent developers are now the best.
The book Self-publishing 1.0 describes computer publishing and on-demand printing.
Self-publishing 2.0 – The theme is selling books for e-book readers and phones in online book stores.
Now begins a new era of Self-publishing 3.0, where self-publishers will be trained to start a viable and sustainable business.
The Union of Independent Creators is the only global non-profit organization that brings together independent writers who publish books.
The Union's objective is to develop the skills of independent publishers, promote ethical activities, help beginners sell books and encourage creators to engage in sustainable digital business that will ensure their independence.
Presidents of the country and central bank warn Italian government of planned deficit
After hearing the populist government’s plans to increase deficit spending significantly next year, the Italian president and central bank chief warned Saturday that the country’s debt should be managed.
The ruling parties (the opposition Five Star Movement and the right-wing North League) put forward a 2019 deficit proposal late Thursday that would reach a deficit of 2.4 percent of GDP and three times that of the previous administration.
The announcement on Friday disrupted the market and led to the sale of bonds and a blow to bank shares.
Moreover, such plans are not compatible with the European Union, which applies EU fiscal rules and supervises their compliance.
Addressing the audience at the Presidential Palace, which commemorates the 70th anniversary of the Constitution, President Sergio Mattarella mentioned that according to the country’s fundamental laws “the budget must be balanced and the debt must be controlled.”
\"We will protect the savings of our citizens,\" he said.
At a conference in central Italy, Ignazio Visco, President of the Bank of Italy, said it was no longer possible to further increase the country's debt, which is the largest of the European Union's major economies, reaching 131 percent of GDP.
\"Italy must give priority to public and private investment and to managing and reducing public debt,\" Visco said, according to the state news agency Ansa.
“School must be reduced consistently.”
The head of the Northern League and deputy prime minister Matteo Salvini responded to Mattarella’s remarks that the debt grew over the years due to the strict demands imposed on Brussels.
“Satisfy, Mr. President,” Salvini said in a statement.
“The debt of the state grew due to the budget imposed by Europe for a year. After all, we change plans and strive for a better future and growth.”
Earlier, before speaking to Mattarella or Visco, five-star movement chief Luigi Di Maio said that the money previously stolen would be returned from the budget, but added that the government was not seeking to oppose the EU or financial markets.
The ruling parties pressed for economic minister Giovanni Tria to approve their planned deficit spending.
Italian media said Mattarella supported Tria’s failed attempt to maintain a budget deficit that would not reach 2 percent of GDP.
The presidents of the country and the central bank have no direct influence on economic policy.
The 77-year-old president can reject the law and return it to parliament, but only once.
Parliament can then re-apply an unamended law and legitimise it.
Official information: Indonesian tsunami sensors missed huge waves
Indonesia’s geophysical agency withdrew its tsunami warning 34 minutes after its release, followed by a severe earthquake that sent huge waves to the northeast coast of the island of Sulawesi, where hundreds of people died and thousands were homeless.
Car mugs after the tsunami in Palu, Indonesia, September 29, 2018
At least 384 people were killed in a 7.5-point earthquake and tsunami in the city of Palu, about 1,500 kilometres (940 miles) away from Jakarta.
Authorities said Sunday that the number of victims is likely to increase.
On Friday, many people gathered for the Palu beach festival, which was hit by many waves of six meters (18 feet) tall.
Geophysics agency BMKG on Saturday received criticism from social media: many people wondered if the tsunami warning had not been lifted too early.
The agency said it had carried out the standard procedure and decided to withdraw the alert based on the data of the nearest flood sensor located about 200 km (125 miles) from Palu.
“We don’t have surveillance data from Palu.
So we had to make a decision based on the data we had,\" said Rahmat Triyono, head of the BMKG Earthquakes and Tsunami Center.
The nearest flood gauge, which measures sea level changes, found only, he said, “not significant, a six-inch (2.5-inch) wave and did not notice huge waves at Palu.
“If we had a flood gauge at Palu or got data from there, of course, the situation would be better.
“We need to think about this in the future,” said Triyon.
Authorities said the tsunami struck Palu and surrounding areas at a high speed of hundreds of kilometers an hour, but it was not clear whether it happened before or after the warning was cancelled.
Residents check bodies on the street in search of their family members after the tsunami in Palu, Indonesia, September 29, 2018.
\"Based on social media videos, we believe the tsunami happened before the alert was officially cancelled,\" Triyon said.
The largest earthquake of 9.5 hit on Christmas 2004 and caused a huge tsunami that killed about 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, including 126,000 victims in Indonesia.
The picturesque city of Palu, home to 380,000 people, is at the mouth of the narrow bay in the northeast of the island of Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia’s National Disaster Reduction Agency (BNPB), the tsunami destroyed the city in 1927 and 1968.
University of Oxford geophysical researcher Baptiste Gombert said the earthquake should not have caused a tsunami.
Friday's earthquake occurred due to a horizontal fracture, with adjacent tectonic plates moving horizontally, not vertically, as usual for tsunamis.
“It is believed that there was a landslide in the sea that pushed a lot of water and caused a tsunami,” he said, adding that the force of waves moving to the shore could have concentrated in a narrow bay.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the disaster relief agency, told the correspondents that his team was \"ready to send easy-to-understand public warnings\" when the tsunami warning was suddenly lifted.
According to the Ministry of Transport, text messages with warnings were repeatedly sent to the residents, but Nugroho said power and communications lines had been cut off due to the earthquake and there were no sirens along the shore.
Indonesians questioned on social media whether the BMKG had to cancel the tsunami warning, and were alarmed that the information had not been provided on time.
“I’m disappointed... The warning has been canceled... And the tsunami still happened...” – Twitter user @zanoguccy sent a live message to BMKG.
Golf duo Mollywood plans to beat ticket sales records
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood became the first European to win all four matches and are likely to be recorded in history, as they already lead Europe at 10:6 ahead of the Ryder Cup final.
After winning Tiger Woods and Bryson Dechambeau at 5:4, they became the first European couple to win all four matches.
Only Americans Larry Nelson and Lanny Wadkins managed to do so in 1979.
The stunning results 3:1, 5:4, 4:3 and 5:4 show not everything.
The couple won 14 major titles, winning twice against Patrick Reed.
They also won over Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, a U.S. team that won the next three games this week.
Molinari and Fleetwood will have the opportunity to become the first European to win five points out of five possible points on Sunday.
Fleetwood has already earned the most points in the Ryder Cup unit competitions as a novice European.
The couple, who was dubbed “Mollywood” by a large number of new fans, did not seem to be able to lead the European team forward.
Ryder Cup newcomers like Fleetwood are not expecting such a performance, and Molinari won none of the previous six matches and landed on four rivals.
But there was hope: Fleetwood was the first in Europe last year to know the Le Golf National Square as its five fingers, and here in 2017 won the French Open tournament and demonstrated a determined temperament during this year’s U.S. Open.
Molinari is the new British Open Champion and is considered by many to be the most consistent player of the European tournament, a useful feature in a tight square where tall grass can lead to destruction, as demonstrated by American failures.
These features of the players and the harmonious game in the field made them insurmountable.
“I feel a little sensual now, but only Saturday,” said the relaxing Fleetwood, who played with a wide smile on his face all weekend.
This afternoon we played well and played well.
If we share history, it will be a special achievement.
I'm just glad we've tried for the team.
Molinari was also happy.
“It was great to play with Tommy,” he said.
“But we have to fulfill our duty, not just to get into record books, so tomorrow we will have to fight hard for the 4.5 point we need to win; it won’t be easy.”
Knight's fever!
The Irish village turned into a medieval battlefield
The Claregalway Castle in the west of Ireland was once the main fortress of the 15th-century English Knight family and was remembered for its origin on Saturday.
Knight's duel with swords during the medieval battles festival at Claregalway Castle in Galway, Ireland, September 29, 2018
The courtyard of a fully restored Anglo-Normanian-era house with a tower turned into a medieval battlefield, where many enthusiasts from all corners of the world restored contact battles and games that were popular centuries ago.
Carl Dornan and Celtic warrior wear Donna Dornan patrols Claregalway Castle in the grand hall during the medieval battles festival in Galway, Ireland, September 29, 2018.
“It’s a great weekend trip and something unusual,” Denise Fitzgerald of Kerry, who became the host of a tavern for the weekend, told the fighters when they bake vegetables in the fat on the fire.
“So we returned to the simplest things.
“I’m trying to do everything I need,” said the theatre worker, who for the first time participated in the armed battles festival.
There were authentic armored fighters in the field, and although their swords were bucki, some of their helmets were folded, while one wounded their lips.
The riders demonstrated their skills by riding and cutting cabbage and eggplant in half.
In helmets, metal castings bitched weapons, seasoning merchants prepared medicine, and craftsmen spinning and painting wool.
Seriously determined and well-dressed participants tried to get involved in roles.
“I think anyone can wear a suit, but getting involved in a role is art,” said Helena Stackpoole, who played Lady Eleanor Fitzgerald and had a unique opportunity to use her fashion design knowledge.
“All costumes are made with your hands.
I’ve been sewing my belt for two years now, and now I’m wearing a dress, and I’ve worn 800 pearls on her sleeves alone.
“It’s important to me,” she said.

According to the National Disaster Reduction Agency, the number of people killed by the earthquake and tsunami on the island of Sulawesi increased to 832 on Sunday and the affected area was larger than originally thought.
A spokesman for the agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, told a news conference that many people were trapped in debris after a 7.5-point earthquake on Friday, causing a six-foot (20-foot)-high tsunami.
FBI refers to second woman accused of Kavanaugh
FBI agents investigating Bretto Kavanaugh's trial in the U.S. Supreme Court have appealed to a second woman who accused him of sexual assault, a woman's lawyer said Sunday.
In a statement, Deborah Ramirez’s lawyer John Clune said the FBI’s investigation into Kavanaugh’s case would go beyond separate charges of attempted rape filed by the Federal Court of Appeal judge Dr Christine Blasey ford this week at a dramatic Senate hearing.
Ramirez accuses Kavanaugh of showing her penis at a party where she was drunk and held at Yale University’s dormitory when they both studied there.
U.S. President Donald Trump has put himself under pressure from moderate Senate Republicans and ordered the FBI to conduct an investigation after Thursday's Senate meeting, in which University of California professor Ford made in-depth allegations that Kavanaugh tried to rape her at a party in 1982 when they were both in school and teenagers.
NBC News said Saturday that the White House had limited the scope of the FBI investigation.
Trump denied it and tweeted: “I really want them to interview all the people they need at their discretion.”
White House spokesman Raja Shah said the Senate had determined the scope and duration of the FBI investigation (the investigation must be completed within a week).
\"The White House allows agents to do what they are taught,\" Shah said.
United Kingdom will not withdraw environmental or animal protection standards after Brexit
Environment Minister Michael Gove said Sunday that the United Kingdom would not abandon environmental or animal protection standards to make trade deals after Brexit.
British Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Michael Gove arrives on Downing Street in London, September 24, 2018.
Speaking at the annual Conservative Party conference, Gove said it would be beneficial for the UK to be known for its quality foods and the government would present a food strategy this year.
Europe regains the Ryder Cup in Unity
Francesco Molinari earned fame on Sunday by returning the Ryder Cup to Europe: Italy defeated Phil Mickelson at the 16th pit, earning a point that helped achieve the required 14.5 score.
Mickelson turned himself to the pit, putting the first ball into the water, and the Molinari was the first European to win all five matches a week, although none of the previous six won.
The victory of Europe was already assured that Italy had launched a strike from the starting point and that the continent’s victory was missing a single point, while Henrik Stanson and Sergio Garcia had taken the lead in the match and had secured at least half a point.
At the beginning of the day they first scored 10:6 and had to score four and a half points of possible 12 in order to regain the trophy and consolidate their dominion at home, which dates back to 1993.
Prior to this, the team only managed to eliminate the four-point difference and win the unit competition: the US team in Brooklyn and Europe in the 2012 “Wonder of the Wood”, but no one expected another stunning return.
Justin Thomas, Webb Simpson and Tony Finau gave Jim Furyk the chance to win the first match, but then European team points spread across the square.
Thorbjorn Olesen defeated Jordan Spieth, and his teammate newcomer Jonas Rahm-Tiger Woods: 14 important titles won four times out of four.
Ryder's best-known player, Ian Poulter, may have received the most ovulations this week, when the world's best player Dustin Johnson landed on his 18th ride and brought Europe closer to victory.
Then we had to wait, which match will end first, and it was Molinari's game, which caused a wave of joy in the crowd, which was the biggest in the history of the event.
RT World News: German police who protect Erdogan used the name of neo-Nazi as a code word
Local media said secret officials in eastern Germany, who protected Turkish President Erdogan this week during his visit to Berlin, used the name of the infamous neo-Nazi extremist.
The regional interior ministry said the criminal police in eastern Germany were investigating two members of the elite anti-terrorist group’s SEK.
The men were assigned to protect Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan during his long-awaited trip to Germany.
The officials had to work secretly, so under the protocol they had to use the codename.
They chose Uwe Boehnhardt, a infamous neo-Nazi belonging to the NSU group of extremists who killed eight Turkish immigrants at the beginning of this century, a Greek national and a German police officer.
Local media reported that a strange codename was discovered when two police officers asked for permission to access internal documents needed to complete the task.
Leaders immediately canceled the police officers.
Saxon's criminal police chief Petric Kleine first responded to the news.
He said that the decision to use the Boehnhardt's name was \"probably the stupidest\" and so \"probably ignored the victims and their loved ones.\"
Saxon Interior Minister Roland Woller supported the statement and called the decision “shrinkful, terrible and totally unacceptable.”
Erdogan’s visit to Berlin on Friday led to a number of controversial assessments in Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel has been criticised for accepting a leader accused of growing authoritarianism.
Merkel said the visit was very important, “because in the event of disagreements, they need to be addressed by a personal meeting.”
The public heard about NSU for the first time in 2011, when the bodies of Boehnhardt and his accomplice Uwe Mundlos were discovered in a trailer house burned in eastern Germany.
One of them was believed to have killed another and then committed suicide after a failed attempt to rob the bank in the city of Eizenacho.
A third member of the neo-Nazi group, Beate'a Zschaepe, was soon arrested.
In July this year, a German court sentenced her to life imprisonment for 10 charges of murder.
She denied her involvement in the murders, but her lawyer said the accused felt moral guilt because she did not try to stop the murder.
After the NSU scandal, the German security agencies have received a lot of criticism.
Lawyers, activists and relatives of victims believe that the group had many more accomplices.
It also appeared that the German intelligence agency BfV has infiltrated many informants into NSUs and has constantly hindered the investigation of group-related murders, attempted murders, and looting.
Musk resigns as Tesla CEO and will pay $20 million fine to the Securities and Exchange Commission
Elon Musk agreed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to sue him for tweeting tweets he claimed would make Tesla a private company.
Musk will have to resign from the position of head, but the CEO will remain.
The agreement states that Musk must leave the office of Chairman of the Board of Directors of Tesla within 45 days and will be prohibited from returning to office for three years.
In addition, he will have to pay a fine of $20 million.
It all started with a tweet message that was too careless or deliberately misleading, so Musk will have to obtain approval in advance before saying or posting about Tesla in any format, including, but not limited to, social media records (e.g. Twitter, company website (e.g. company blog), press releases, and calls to investors.
Tesla will have to pay another $20 million because it hasn’t checked Musk’s original tweet.
In a complaint by the Securities and Exchange Commission, Musk is accused of misleading investors by a Twitter message on August 7, in which he said he had found funds to make Tesla a private company with a share worth $420 – making the company’s securities more than 10 percent expensive.
Musk soon withdrew his words by saying that Tesla would remain public and angered investors.
The Securities and Exchange Commission decided that Musk’s initial statement “was false and misleading because it did not rely on facts”
Musk himself explained in a blog post that this error could be justified: after meeting with a representative of the Saudi Independent Property Fund, he had the impression that he was able to agree on the funds.
Musk and the Securities and Exchange Commission were reported to have come close to the softer punishment – Musk would have had to give up the president’s position for only two years and should not be found guilty, but Musk refused the deal on Thursday.
The price of Tesla’s securities fell on Friday, and it’s likely that he changed his mind again and agreed to stricter terms.
However, under the new agreement, as under the old one, Musk does not have to admit guilty of misleading investors.
Patriarch of Alexandria committed to supporting the Canonical Church of Ukraine and urged Orthodoxs to unite
Alexandria’s Patriarch Theodore II declared that he was referring to a canonical Ukrainian Orthodox church belonging to the Moscow Patriarchate.
He spoke in response to the separation of the Russian Orthodox Church and the Patriarchate of Constantinople.
Theodore arrived in Odessa in southern Ukraine on Thursday and met with the highest church representatives and Orthodox believers.
The Alexandrian Patriarch is one of the most respected Orthodox hierarchs, descending only to the ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople.
“I have come to tell you, don’t give up the Orthodox faith and the canonical church,” Patriarch Theodore II said in a statement.
Prior to his visit to Odessa, he met with the Polish Orthodox Church metropolis, Savva, who also supports the canonical Ukrainian church.
They also called for the prevention of conflicts arising from attempts to legitimize the autonomy of the Ukrainian church.
“We will always support those who seek Orthodox unity,” Theodore II said.
The Orthodox Church has recently experienced a major crisis following the decision of the Patriarchate of Constantinople to recognize the independence of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.
It belongs to the Russian Orthodox Church, also known as the Patriarchate of Moscow.
Constantinople decided to send exarchs to Kiev in violation of the rule that one Orthodox church interfered with another’s affairs.
Exarchs are special representatives of the Patriarch who formally occupy a higher position than the metropolis Onufriy, who is the current head of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church belonging to the Moscow Patriarchate.
The Moscow Patriarchate responded angryly to the actions of Constantinople and cancelled all church worship and memberships in organizations headed or co-chaired by representatives of Constantinople.
But it is said that this decision warned Constantinople not to take other hostile actions and that both churches had completely terminated the links.
Of the three churches in Ukraine, only one church is recognized – the Orthodox Church of Ukraine owned by the Moscow Patriarchate.
Most Ukrainian clergy recognize its authority, but the government has always openly supported one of the secluded churches, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Kiev Patriarchate, which emerged in the 1990s.
This religious movement even has a Patriarchist promulgated head of Philaret, seeking official recognition of the Orthodox Church, full independence and equality with the Moscow Patriarchate.
Damascus opens major Syrian-Jordian trade crossing for the first time in three years
According to state news agency SANA, the Syrian government has said it will open a crossing along the Nasib border with Jordan, which has been closed for three years due to military actions in the area.
This can be done because the fighters on the Syrian side abandoned the lands near Daraa.
Nasib is the most important trade link not only between neighbouring countries, but also between Lebanon and the Gulf.
The most important ideas from the Lavrov UN language
During his visit to Russia, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov attacked the West for \"political blackmail and brutality\" and said diplomacy should not give in to dictatorship and unilateral sanctions.
The minister told the UN General Assembly on Friday that some Western countries, while trying to maintain “the positions of world leaders themselves,” are putting pressure on others without conscience.
He did not identify specific countries, but said they were using \"political blackmail, economic pressure and brutal force.\"
The world has to pay a high price for the selfish ambitions of a small group of countries.
Lavrov, who represented Russia in the UN for a decade, told the meeting that the culture of diplomacy and negotiation was being changed by dictatorships and unilateral sanctions imposed without UN approval.
He said the sanctions imposed on many countries were \"illegal or ineffective\" and reminded of the blockade imposed on Cuba by the United States for many years.
“But history has taught us nothing,” Lavrov said, adding that “Western supporters tend to blame only if it is “very likely.”
We recall how often such unjustified accusations have justified interference and wars, such as the 1999 bombings in Yugoslavia, the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the 2011 interference in Libyan affairs.
Of course, Lavrov mentioned not all Western invasions and reminded of Syria's seven-year war as one of the most recent cases.
The failed attempt by extremists to overthrow the Damascus regime could have been devastating for the whole country and open up opportunities to settle in a “terrorist caliphate.”
Lavrov praised Astana's peace process, which was jointly launched by Russia, Turkey and Iran, and said the process helped prevent the Islamic State (IS, formerly known as ISIS) and other groups that wanted to seize all of Syria.
Now the most important thing is to rebuild the war-torn areas of the country and to help refugees return safely home.
Lavrov returned to the battle of the great powers and said that the UN was actually founded “after the lessons of the Second World War.”
Russia’s foreign minister recalled that in 2018 it was 80 years since the signing of the “comfortful” Munich Treaty, which France and Britain agreed to allow Nazis to annex the German part of Czechoslovakia in order to calm Hitler.
While then Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain said the Munich Treaty would \"bring peace to these times\" a year later, the war began.
“Munchen’s betrayal shows how far the egoism and disregard of international law can lead,” Lavrov said.
“The dictatorship and coercion of the colonial era must be put in a history archive or trash.”
Moscow believes constructive dialogue can solve all problems in the world, Lavrov said.
“If you have questions or complaints, sit down and talk, reveal the facts, listen to your colleague’s arguments and try to reconcile interests.”

RT World News: Israel's nuclear weapons are surrounded by fog, and Bibi's finger turns to Iran
Israel's Prime Minister, in a speech at the UN General Assembly, said Tehran had sensitive nuclear weapons.
It is possible that Israel, which accuses others, is hiding something itself.
“The presentation – Israeli favorite Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu unveiled news Thursday,” showed photographs from high-profile locations where Iran allegedly holds nuclear material.
Tehran quickly replied that Tel Aviv would rather take care of its \"undeclared nuclear weapons programme\"
Although Israel has never admitted (but has not denied) nuclear weapons, RT journalist Murad Gazdiev tried to find out whether Tel Aviv should actually look for a log in his own eyes.
Scottish Government: No complaints about Alex Salmond before January
The Scottish government said there were no complaints about Alex Salmon by January of this year.
The former first minister was charged with two charges of sexual harassment in January, although he strongly denies them.
He was informed of the investigation in March.
Salmond, who resigned from the Scottish National Party, will be suing the Scottish government for a lawsuit against him.
In response to the claim that one complaint was first dealt with in 2013, the Scottish government said no complaints had been recorded by January.
A Scottish government spokesman said: “In January, the Scottish government received two complaints about Alex Salmondo.
We could ignore them or hide them.
Earlier, the former First Deputy Prime Minister received no complaints about Alex Salmondo and, as we have already said, the first minister heard about the investigation from Alex Salmondo in April 2018.
We are convinced of the legitimacy of our processes and will defend our position with perseverance.
The Scottish government will try to get as much information as possible within the time available.
However, as we have already mentioned, we cannot comment more on Mr Salmon's case at this time for legal reasons.
Alex Solomon’s spokesman said: “We will not comment on anything because our petition against the permanent secretary is now being examined at a court hearing and we hope that a decision will soon be made.
We will speak in court.
Our aim is to prove that the Scottish Government's appeal procedure against Alex is illegal.
Glasgow defeated the Dragons 29:13: “Warriors – player Lee Jones
Glasgow has regained the title of winner of the Guinness Pro14 league by earning points and winning at the Dragons Scotstoun Stadium, while coach Dave Rennie does not hide his satisfaction, but thinks the game could have been more accurate.
After an unexpected defeat for the Southern Kings team in Port Elizabeth last Saturday, Rennie’s heavily changed team asked for effort and though she managed to score the points needed to stay at the top of the A conference, the windy and rainy weather match was certainly not smooth.
“I think we defended well tonight, we played on the right side of the field and our strategy was good,” Rennie said.
“We have to play more accurately and we’ve been able to take advantage of more opportunities.
The conditions were unfavorable.
We have created many opportunities and we are happy about it.
It is necessary to play more accurately, but 40 or 50 points earned today would not have been a good result.
We had to try.
We have won points, but next week we have to do more to play at home with Zebre and next week with Saracens in Europe.
Although the weather was windy, Glasgow’s team started earning points early, but the TMO caught all of Huwo Jones’s lost balls, including his catch of Niko Matawalu’s internal handover to the left corner.
The disappointment did not last long: the left pole, Olis Kebble, erupted in the middle of the fourth minute, and Adam Hastings easily caught the shot.
“Dragons reduced the difference when Arwel Robson was fined, and safety made another player immediately after 20 minutes of tagging and the Welshs scored a point.
The first half of the match was almost half an hour later: Glasgow's attackers consistently attacked the Dragons line, then the South African judge Stuart Berry fined the Welsh people 22 minutes to keep them on the side of Hastings.
Warriors went into the wrestling, but lost the ball after a smooth handover, as the left edge of Matawalu that received a few strikes could not control the ball and it was passed to the left.
The second attempt took place two minutes after the interval: Hastings beat the Dragons line and cleverly passed the ball on to Lee Jones, who ran away.
The ball was returned to Hastings in his position and the result of the game was 12:6.
Glasgow's second half of the first minute was very successful: he dropped the Alex Dunbar ball for the second try by Lee Jones, who was helped by Hastings.
However, Warriors failed to give up after failure – just four minutes later, they took over the ball in the middle of the field, and the Dragons center, Adam Warren, took him away under the gate, earning points, and then Joseph Lewis, after playing an open game with Robson.
“Warriors quickly returned to lead position and scored additional points in 54 minutes after the fourth attempt when Huw Jones ran right and Hastings failed to pass the ball (a third failure of four tests).
Glasgow held a comfortable higher position and carried out a fifth test a few minutes later – Dunbar passed the ball after the wrestling with George Horne, and Hastings scored points.
Kebble was named the best match player, but Rennie praised Hastings.
“They obviously prevented us from playing, but we got off at the middle,” the coach said.
\"He was missing a few meters, but he was slippery, and he was still able to distance himself.
He is in good shape and confident in himself.
Ayr United won the Morton score of 1:5: The Five Stars Ayr defeated the host team
Lawrence Shankland and Craig Moore scored two goals each, while Declan McDaid added another one to help Ayr stay at the top of the championship table.
“Ayr, has been ahead of Shankland’s goal, hit from six yards after Michael Rose’s corner strike against McDaid.
“Morton, at the 35th minute of the first attempt, smoothed out the result when Charlie Telfer took the ball off Robbie Crawford on his own pitch and sent him through Ayr, a goalkeeper, Ross Doohan to the far edge.
Players from Grinok had a chance to jump forward in the fourth minute of the second half when Doohan demolished Gary Oliver, but Michael Tidser released a weak fine that was easily caught by the goalkeeper.
“Ayr, at 74 minutes, for the second time surpassed the rivals, when the long-range transfer of the replacement Craig McGuffie was repulsed in the air and another substitute player, Craig Moore, was sent to the gate.
Moore gave the ball the same minute to Shankland, who scored 17 goals this season.
As fans warmed up, Moore returned to his side the fourth from the edge of the field, and McDaid sent the ball back to the gate.
‘Alloa’ and ‘Falkirk’ match ended with a score of 0:2: the first victory of young people in the league
“I’m happy, I feel relief, I’m happy,” said Ray McKinnon after a much needed first-time Falkirk victory in the league and earned points of the season.
\"Rangers - borrowed attacker Zak Rudden (18 years old) scored a goal in both parts and pushed the Alloa Athletic host team to the bottom of the championship and freed the club from the pressured troubles.
“It was an important game for us,” McKinnon admitted.
“We probably deserved more during the last three games, so it was great to score three points in a stressful situation.
I am glad we got the first points.
It wouldn’t have taken anything, but it was important for us to win.
Rudden sent the ball to Patrick Brough for the 26th minute and scored a goal from the gate line in the middle of the second half when Diamond Petravičius slowly kicked the ball over goalkeeper Neil Parry.
“We wanted to defend ourselves firmly, but we failed,” said Jim Goodwin, head of Wasps.
Hearts: Over 11,000 signatures to the semi-finals
Hearts, a fan of the Betfred Cup, has signed more than 11,000 people in the semi-finals.
The guys are angry at the decision to hold both semi-finals on the same day and in the same stadium.
As suggested by the Scottish police, last week the SPFL decided to hold the Aberdeen Rangers playoffs at 12:00 p.m. and Hearts at 19:45 p.m., thus triggering the fury of the fans of Jamba and Dons.
“The Evening News, together with Aberdeen Evening Express, asked for an honest solution for fans on Saturday.
The so-called Super Saturday decision was also condemned by Aberdeen and Hearts: both clubs issued statements criticizing the timetable.
On Thursday, change.org posted a petition asking you to move one of the matches to another place or date.
He is accused of killing two women in Kent village
Two women in the sixth and eighth decade died at the scene of the crime.
Police said another man, who also crossed the 70-year-old line, was hospitalized and in stable condition.
The 28-year-old who lives on the same street remains in custody and will be tried Monday for two murders and one attempted murder at a video trial in Medway.
Police have not yet identified the victims, but believe they knew the suspect.
Neighbors said they were shocked by an event in the village that they said was “silent and friendly.”
Sophie Moorey-Brown-Press Association, 31, said: “We have lived here for five years and have never heard of any bad events – it’s always very quiet and nice to live here.”
The Royal Archives and the creators of Hamilton musical light the world about King George III
When the Queen presented a project that opened a huge archive of documents accumulated during the reign of George III, she hoped that letters, diaries and speeches would help the public to get to know the king as a madman.
Now these documents will reach a different audience – the Royal Archives have decided to cooperate with Vestendo music.
The academics who wanted to reveal the true face of the king invited the actor of George III to the Windsor Palace Library to review the most important documents from the reign of Queen Proproprosenel.
Researchers are trying to make old manuscripts accessible to a wider audience, so a large crowd of fans will be able to access digital documents.
Members of the royal family have already publicly approved the creation of the musical, and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will watch the performance twice, although Prince Harry’s ancestor is constantly parody on stage.
In Vestende, King Michael Jibson said the documents had made him think and helped him get to know the king whose image the audience had formed in the musical-Hamilton, the film-King George Madness, and the children's series-horrible stories.
“We fell in love with beautiful letters.”
U.S. President Donald Trump did not speak out with enthusiasm after trying to reduce tensions with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and said at a meeting of his supporters on Saturday that they had “married in love” after mailing.
Trump and Kim said they would seek nuclear disarmament on the Korean peninsula, which they discussed at an unprecedented meeting this year in Singapore.
Before moving to a new phase of history after years of public disagreements, the leaders exchanged threats and insults because North Korea wanted to build a nuclear missile capable of reaching the United States.
“I was tough, just like him.
We kept talking,” Trump said at the meeting in West Virginia.
“And then we fell in love, you know?
In fact, he wrote me beautiful, great letters.
Lekavičius and “Panathinaikos” got into the semi-final of the Greek Cup
At the Athens-Panathinaika-Greek quarter-finals, the victory was celebrated without the greater efforts of Luk Lekavičius.
The team of Athens won 76:68 (29:24, 17:15, 15:11, 15:18) for the Patri Prometheus team.
He spent 14 minutes in the field, earned 4 trails (2/2), rebounded one ball and performed one successful pass and twice passed.
The result was Nick Calathes, who scored 15 points.
Skvernelis cross for Šimonytė: everything was decided by the party - cream -
Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis said there was a lack of democracy in the Conservatives' internal elections, and the party's leadership actually appointed Ingrid Šimonytė as a presidential candidate.
“The celebration itself, the ‘democracy’, was strange, however, to put it mildly, when the party cream, the summit decided and actively supported one candidate.
Perhaps the second candidate was not even theoretical enough to win,\" Skvernelis told reporters in the government.
\"The Conservatives have appointed their candidate, and we welcome them,\" he added.
“The country’s greens – the delegated prime minister said Šimonytė should be judged by voters who remembered her work in the government of Andrius Kubilius.
Mr Skvernelis has yet to comment on whether he will participate in the presidential elections.
The Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union is going to approve its candidate next year.
Ramūnas Karbauskis, the leader of the ruling - peasants, called the Conservative elections a \"failed experiment\" due to the poor activity of the party.
First of all, we need to congratulate the experiment, which has absolutely failed.
Only 55 percent of the party members participated, with only about 20,000 voters.
Knowing what money had to be spent on organizing these elections, it is clear that this failed,\" Karbauskis told the news portal delfi.lt.
“I think the costs will not justify the result because the result is no one, the party decided that their candidate was like that, everything is fine, but to whom to spend so much money,” he added.
During the internal election, 79% of Conservatives and their supporters voted for Šimonytė's candidacy during the weekend.
Lithuanian Salaries Make Estonians Laugh: One area can change everything
According to the Baltic Salary Survey, this year’s Baltic countries survey shows that wages have grown mainly in Estonia.
Lithuania and Latvia were few behind their neighbours, the company said in a press release.
“After surveying 850 companies and examining the changes in remuneration in the Baltic States, we can see that the monthly wage before taxes in Lithuania this year grew by 81.8 per cent of employees and on average increased by 7.7 per cent, while the annual salary with supplements increased by 10.5 per cent.
Latvia has slightly outstretched us - there was a slightly higher annual salary, but, like Estonia, a smaller number of employees compared to our country - says Povilas Blusius, a spokesman for the company that organizes salary research, and adds that with such trends in wage growth, general economic indicators of the country that dictate them should be taken into account.
Estonia’s highest wage growth rate
Although wages in Latvia and Estonia were lower than in Lithuania, growth was higher.
In Latvia, annual wages increased by 71% of the employees of the companies surveyed and reached a slightly higher rate than in our country - 11 percent.
In Estonia, remuneration rose by 73% of employees this year and on average increased by 13 percent.
Wage growth trends are also strongly influenced by changes in employees, as changers can get a much higher salary than in previous jobs.
For those who have not changed their jobs in Lithuania in recent years and have not been in office, the annual salary has increased by 8.8% - here more often than in other Baltic countries, also supplements are paid.
In neighbouring Latvia, the annual salary growth for such workers was only 3.6 per cent.
Estonia remains a leader in the Baltic States, not only as the average wager for new but also for long-term employees.
For those who did not change jobs or duties, the salary was the fastest: 6 per cent per month, an annual one, including the supplements - 9 per cent.
According to the remuneration research specialist, such trends often depend on, or go hand in hand with, the country's general economic indicators: inflation or GDP growth, their forecasts, state monetary policy, prevailing market sentiments.
For example, predictions of the coming economic crisis encourage businesses to act more carefully and invest less.
The dominant and fastest growing sectors of the country, such as information technology, construction, pharmaceuticals, can also raise general statistics and overshadow smaller changes.
The biggest tax burden for Latvians
When comparing wage growth, it is important to take into account the different tax systems in these countries.
In Latvia, employees pay the highest share of taxes depending on salary – as much as 31 or 34%, which can increase to 42.4% for more earners.
Here in Lithuania there is a constant 24 per cent rate, so in case of higher wage growth in Latvia, employees can receive the same or even lower rate of growth that is felt in Lithuania.
In Estonia, a similar tax rate is applied as in Lithuania - 23.6%, so in this country we find the most favorable taxation of labour in the Baltic States.
The most competitive salary in IT
According to the study, in all Baltic countries almost no matter the level of duties, the positions of IT specialists remain among the best paid.
The opposite situation in retail trade - market indices of positions in this area are among the lowest, so employees earn lower than market average income.
Compared to last year, the fastest wages have grown for engineering professionals with higher positions, as well as risk management professionals.
Such a rise in remuneration has not exceeded some positions in the IT sector this year, with a significant percentage of organizations increasing their monthly salaries to 14 percent for information security professionals.
In retail, wages have hardly changed.
However, some companies have successfully carried out reorganizations of remuneration systems, which has led to an annual increase of about 2 percent in bonuses.
According to the specialists of the remuneration, there is a trend that wage growth dictates the demand for the most demanded specialists - in the Baltic States, demand for system analysts continues to grow.
Ariana Grande suffers again: former spouse continues to laugh
After a divorce with Ariana Grande, Pete Davidson pours out his pain by creating jokes about their relationship.
At Saturday Night Live, he chose to joke about how quickly he fell into a serious relationship.
Fans say it's true, because only three weeks ago, Ariana and Pete cancelled their engagements that took place just a few months later.
Pete tried to create scripts that mention his failed relationship, but it will find itself on the screen a little later.
There is rumors that a humorist from his former relationship irritates Arian himself.
Such jokes are painful to her and not to the heart.
At least this is how secret sources told the international news portal TMZ.
White or brown: which sugar to choose is recommended by a nutritionist
White or brown?
Which sugar to choose?
During the survey in supermarkets it turned out that although Lithuanians still traditionally prefer white sugar, it is surprising that many compatriots give up this ingredient, which is called white death.
The sales of brown sugar are growing unhidden and the representatives of the merchant networks.
According to the representative of Maximos, brown sugar is becoming more popular and is being bought more and more by compatriots, although conventional white sugar is still the first choice.
Organic sugar sales are also growing in specialized organic products stores.
One of the most popular products there is coconut sugar.
According to nutritionist Dalia Vaitkevičiūtė, the main difference is the price, and harmful effects on health can have both.
“Red raw sugar is three times more expensive, but from a health point of view, these sugars will be multiplied by consuming an excess of them is harmful to the body,” said D. Vaitkevičiūtė.
To live without sugar, the nutritionist advises you to reduce its intakes a little on a daily basis.
After doing this - the benefits in every way - will fall and unwanted kilograms, improve health.
A month of consistently using less sugar, it will be easier to give up at all.
“We build every habit in about a month, so after doing such an experiment, let’s say, a month of drinking some kind of product without sugar, coffee or tea, we’ll see how positively this will work, and I think that everyone can give up a little effort,” the idetologist gave her advice on how to give up sugar.
Doctors claim that white sugar has not been named needlessly - abuse of sweets can lead to obesity, diabetes, cancer and other diseases.
Therefore, it is worth trying to consume it as little as possible, especially since this product is additionally added to many foods, even to bread.
Another step “Lietkabelis”: Lipkevičius lends to another LKL team
Panevezys “Lietkabelis” team said goodbye to Vytenis Lipkevičius - the attacker is borrowed by the Prienai “Skycop” team.
In this season of the Betsafe-LKL, Lipkevičius dropped 6.4 points in 22 minutes, recovered 2.8 balls, performed 2 results and scored 8.5 points.
FIBA Champions League's 29-year 198-cm height athletes scored 3.8 points, 2.5 rebounds, 1.5 results and 4.8 utility scores in 21 minutes.
In the near future, “Lietkabelis” will announce a new purchase that will strengthen the composition.
S.Buškevics joined the coach’s staff
The assistant coach of Panevezys-Lietkabelis team Nenadas Chanak became Sandis Buškevics, who is well known to Lithuanians.
In the 2005-2006 season, the 41-year-old Latvian played in the morning of Vilnius-Lithuania, and in 2014-2017 he worked in the club system as assistant coach.
Last season, Buškevic trained the Jekabpils team.
Sports director Jonas Vainauskas invited Steponas Babrauskas to the headquarters, but he is still planning to continue his basketball career.
The invitation was also received by Vytenis Jasikevicius, but it was not possible to agree on both sides.
Buškevics will work with Robert Kuncavičius and Algimantas Bružas at the “Lietkabelis” coach’s staff.
Latvians will join the “Lietkabelis” on Tuesday and will be on the “Cido” arena during the FIBA Champions League match with Dijon JDA, but we will not see it on the bench as registration ended 24 hours before the start of the match.
Biofuel price cuts will not be enjoyed by everyone
In order to reduce the prices of biofuels, more deciduous trees will be cut in Lithuania in 2019, the Minister of Environment says.
According to Kęstutis Navickas, this is the way to “impact” the prices of biofuels.
“We have a lot of stocks of some species.
We need to balance (...).
The concentration on soft deciduous leaves is because it can also have a small impact on the prices of biofuels,\" Navick said in the Seimas on Tuesday, presenting the situation about deforestation.
According to K. Navickas, this year the price of wood in Lithuania increased by about 20 percent.
According to the Minister, next year the pine will be cut as much as this year, and the spruce will be cut by about 80 hectares less.
According to him, more wood is harvested in Lithuania due to favorable natural conditions.
“This shouldn’t be the case next year,” Navick said.
Now 10.2 million ha of forests are state-owned and 800,000 ha are private.
The fight against food prices - a questionable obligation: will encourage buying only in its own area
Among the measures presented by the Ministry of Economy to reduce prices, the obligation for state institutions and organizations to buy 50 percent of food products from local producers is proposed, news portal 15min.lt says.
“The law would apply not only to small traders operating in the regions, but also to other suppliers of goods and services.
For example, printing services or office supplies could be supplied to the buyer in municipalities by local companies that have won tenders – Minister of Economy Virginijus Sinkevičius told the portal.
Egidijus Mockevicius, president of the Association of Meat Processors, has no doubt that this provision would discriminate against some entrepreneurs, and it would be difficult to control the use of the law by retailers.
Valdas Sutkus, the head of the Business Confederation, also criticizes the measure because of incoherence.
Macron urges Europe to defend against Russia and the United States
French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday called for the creation of a \"real European army\" capable of protecting against Russia and even the United States
Macron, who has been calling for a joint European Union force since his coming to power, says Europe needs to reduce its dependence on American military power.
He has recently gained a valid argument after US President Donald Trump announced that Washington would withdraw from an important Cold War nuclear deal.
\"We need to protect ourselves from China, Russia and even the United States,\" Macron told Europe 1 radio.
This was his first radio interview since the start of his presidential term in May 2017.
“When I see President Trump announce that he is withdrawing from an important disarmament treaty created after the 1980s European missile crisis, who will be the main victim?” he said.
The missile crisis was caused by the rapid development of non-strategic nuclear weapons at the end of the Cold War, during which the United States deployed ballistic missiles in Europe.
The crisis was a key factor in encouraging the US and the Soviet Union to conclude the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) in 1987.
\"We will not protect Europeans unless we decide to have a true European army,\" Macron said in an interview on Monday evening in Verden in northeastern France, during his visit to World War I battles this week ahead of the 100th anniversary of the end of the conflict.
According to Macron, “When Russia, which is at our borders, has demonstrated a potential threat ... we need a Europe that defends itself better than is simply dependent on the United States.”
The French leader has been the main initiator of the project to set up forces in nine European countries capable of quickly conducting a joint military operation, evacuation from a war zone or providing assistance in the event of a natural disaster.
The defense ministers of the nine countries will meet for the first time in Paris on Wednesday to discuss details of how the forces will work.
The European Union has also set itself to significantly increase its defence budget since 2021 and to allocate around 13 billion euros over seven years to research and new technical development.
The current EU defence budget is under €600 million.
But Bruno Alomar, a professor at the French military school, said Macron's vision of a closely united European defence was difficult to implement.
\"The idea of creating a culture of common strategy is not bad,\" he told AFP.
- But there is a huge gap between the European defence that Emmanuel Macron has dreamed of and the reality - the very large disagreements between European partners -
Lukashenko threatens NATO with missiles: we are not idiots
Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko said Tuesday that his country would need a new weapon if NATO continues to pool its forces at the western border with Belarus.
\"If NATO continues to be frightened by the deployment of bases in Poland or anything else, Belarus will need a more effective weapon, in particular missiles,\" the state news agency BelTA said, citing a group of American analysts in Minsk.
The head of state also noted that Belarus already has its own missile manufacturing industry.
\"Lately - you have noticed and we do not hide - we have built our own missile industry and made our own very accurate (targeted) missile weapons,\" he said.
Lukashenko said last week that Minsk and Moscow were looking for an appropriate and inexpensive response to plans to build a base in Poland and to name it in honor of US President Donald Trump’s Trump Fort.
\"Of course we are concerned about this.
If, let's say, in Poland, they say they're ready to spend millions of dollars to deploy a Trump Fort there, of course, we're not idiots, and of course we're responding to it,\" Lukešenko said, taking part in the discussions of the Munich Security Conference's main group in Minsk.
“It is clear that we are discussing with our main ally (Russia) how to respond to all this and how to find an appropriate response at minimal costs.”
Western relations with Moscow have been wretched by Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014.
Their ties are also eclipsed by Moscow’s role in the Syrian conflict and the March this year in Britain, according to Russian special services, an attempt to poison the former double agent Sergei Skripal with nerve agent.
Tensions between Moscow and Washington further escalated after Trump announced he plans to withdraw from the Cold War Treaty on nuclear arms regulation.
Russia has warned that the move could undermine the global security system.
The man who committed the murder revealed how he killed his wife’s raped footballer.
Brazil was shaken by a gruesome crime in which its footballer Daniel Correa Freitas was subjected to brutal execution.
The athlete was killed on her 18-year-old birthday.
A 24-year-old footballer was found dead in Parana, southeast Brazil.
He was reportedly executed: cut genitals, and serious neck injuries were reported.
Edison Brittes Junior, a 38-year-old footballer, admitted guilty and claimed he had done so because Freitas raped his wife, Cristian Brittes.
The Brazilians who committed the murder later told a detailed account of what happened at night.
\"The dinner had already been accelerated when I realized that I had not seen my wife Cristiana anywhere for a long time.
I went to our bedroom, but the door was locked.
I broke the door and saw Daniel lying naked in bed and my wife asking for help.
I was deadly.
Together with my friends at the party, we pushed him out into the car.
Here I had a knife with which I stabbed my wife's raped husband to death.
I was very angry, at that moment I couldn’t do anything for myself,” the murderer said.
Together with his friends, he threw the dead body of a footballer near the river, where police officers were also looking for the main tool for a gruesome crime.
Brazilian civil police have arrested Junior, as well as his wife and daughter who celebrated her birthday.
Police officials investigating the incident are said to still lack evidence that the woman was raped during the party.
In fact, recent releases of the latest footballer's posts and photos on WahtsApp can help the investigation.
A football player sent two pictures to one of his friends via WhatsApp, in which he captured himself in bed, next to a sleeping woman who later turned out to be the murderer’s wife, Cristiana.
“I can sleep here.
There are many women who sleep in different rooms of the house.
I’ll eat my mum, even though her father is nearby,” the footballer wrote to his friend.
Daniel Correa Freitas, a member of the Sao Paulo Club, was borrowed this season by Sao Bento, the second-largest player in the Brazilian league.
Paul Walker’s daughter, tragically killed, celebrates her 20th anniversary without tears
The daughter of Paul Walker, a tragically killed accomplice, Meadow will celebrate a special occasion – she is 20 years old.

Paul Walker's brother and wife repeatedly mentioned that her daughter meant everything to the actor.
He was very proud of her.
Austin Pauers – fans lost their heads: another part of the film awaits
The cultural comedy Austin Pauers has impressed millions of people around the world.
Futuristic, funny shots and costumes are still an inspiration for many fans.
The filmmaker and star Mike Myers announced that the fourth film, Austin Pauers, was also waiting.
However, one of the main actors, who embodied in the movie Mini Me, will no longer be able to see.

Verne was a fantastic comedy actor.
When we wrote the script, his character was not lai special - the whole popularity he created himself.
He was a great stunt, a great dancer and a wonderful man,” Mike Myers said.

It's great that Claire McCarthy will lead everything, and I'm looking forward to seeing this great team play this story.
Alabama-Hurts can no longer use suspension
Alabama's spare protagonist, Jalen Hurts, can no longer be suspended this season after Saturday.
Hurts is ranked in the top-ranked Crimson Tide, a Saturday match against the weaker Louisiana team, which is the fifth game this season.
The NBAA has introduced a new rule this year – it is possible to suspend a player who took part in four matches.
Athletic said earlier this month that Hurts was planning to do so because of controversial ratings and team coach staff’s response.
Tua Tagovailoa replaced Hurts at the beginning of the season, but coach Nick Saban said he was still planning to use Hurts’ skills.
Last season, Hurts helped Alabama get into the game for the national champion's title against Georgia's team, but on the other side he was replaced by Tagovalooa, who contributed to the Crimson Tide's victory at 26:23.
The former South-East Conference year-on-year attacker Hurts started the last 28 Alabama matches and entered the season with a record score of 26:2.
In Saturday's race, Hurts completed the first four episodes of the Crimson Tide, running 276 yards, scored four points, and once took over the ball.
He also ran 15 times with the ball and ran 54 yards.
Owens: Dess must sign the contract immediately
Former Dallas-Cowboys attacker Dez Bryant said he would soon return to the NFL.
Terrell Owens, a member of the Glory Museum, said that Bryant was better off immediately.
In response to a question asked on Twitter when he was about to sign a contract with the team, Bryant posted a tweet on Friday: “Fastly.”
Three times selected to the Pro Bowl match, Bryant does not belong to any team since Dallas-Cowboys refused him in mid-April in a dispute over remuneration.
Bryant, who may have abandoned his contract with Baltimore Ravens and was constantly associated with Cleveland Browns just before the season, said he wanted to improve before signing a contract with the team.
Owens, who is still talking about returning to the NFL, told TMZ that Bryant should try to return to sport as soon as possible.
“He has to join the team and prove to everyone he can,” Owens told the website.
“Every reviewer thinks he’s no longer successful, and he’s no longer as good as he thinks.
Now he has to enter the team for any salary, accept a one- or two-year contract - it doesn't matter at all - and show everyone what he is capable of -
Bryant caught the ball 69 times in 2017, ran 838 yards and scored six points in the Dallas team.
The 29-year-old didn’t run 100 yards in his longest career – 23 matches.
After signing a five-year $70 million contract in 2015, Bryant didn’t run 1,000 yards in the season and won more than eight points.
“If the CEO or owner thinks your skills are getting worse, you won’t be able to guarantee or accumulate the desired amount,” Owens said.
He also warned that Bryant should get to the team as soon as possible, as this may not be possible at all at the time, and said he could return to Cowboys who survived difficult times.
\"Of course, I don't know if their relationship is broken,\" Owens said, who scored points 38 times in the Dallas team for three seasons.
“I think in the case of Dezo, if the Cowboys take him back and he gets the chance, it will be useful for Dez and the franchise.”
The establishment of the CERN Business Development Centre in Lithuania is being discussed.
Representatives of the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN, European Organization for Nuclear Research) who visited Kaunas last week assess possibilities to establish CERN business development centre in Lithuania.
Today there are ten such business incubators in Europe where companies receive assistance in commercialising CERN technologies, developing innovative products and adapting them to the needs of society.
Although Lithuania only became a member of CERN last year, the establishment of this organization’s business incubator in the country was already hanging.
CERN representatives visited Lithuanian University of Health Sciences (LSMU) and Kaunas University of Technology (KTU) Institutes of Materials Science and Biomedical Engineering in the Valley of Santaka.
At the meeting, guests of the National Innovation and Business Centre (NIVC) together with representatives of KTU, LSMU, Vytautas Magnus University, Lithuanian Energy Institute, Lithuanian Academy of Sciences, Ministry of Economy and business discussed Kaunas innovation ecosystem and opportunities for young, innovative businesses.
The visit of the CERN delegation is very important because if the CERN Business Development Centre is established in Lithuania, it will be the only one in Central and Eastern Europe and will have a significant impact on the regional scientific and business innovators.
“Such an incubator would encourage the adaptation of CERN’s accumulated knowledge and technology to solve important problems, such as new technologies and artificial intelligence would be used to diagnose and treat diseases, to process big data,” says Dr. Leonas Balaševičius, KTU’s science and innovation director.
CERN incubators, like other young business development centres, provide help in business development – provide information and expert advice on the application of technology in product development and help in finding sources of financing.
The only difference is that the CERN incubator is more science.
Such a centre includes experts of various fields in Lithuania: information technology, materials engineering, as well as specialists in the field of medicine.
CERN is best known for its Swiss Large Hadron Counterflow Accelerator (LHC, The Large Hadron Collider), the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator.
However, CERN is carried out not only in quantum mechanics, but also in other fields, from cryogenics (very cold temperatures for substances) to particle monitoring and radiation studies.
These technologies and the work carried out by scientists have an impact on many areas of public interest: medicine, security and industrial development.
“Vilniaus Vodka” has a new guide
Beverage producer AB Vilniaus Vodka has appointed Roka Mituz as new CEO, who will replace Raimonds Pilkė in these positions.
Since last summer, Pilkė has been the head of the company and will continue to hold the position of Finance Director of Vilnius Vodka, according to a statement released on the Nasdaq Vilnius Stock Exchange.
Mr. Mituz is the co-founder of the sauce-producing company Buga LT, indicated on his LinkedIn account.
From 2012 to 2017, Mituz served as regional director of SPI Group and previously worked in Reckitt Benckiser and Unilever groups.
“Vilniaus vodka – finished the first quarter of this year with a loss of 315.500 euros.
Last year, the company earned a profit of €392.300.
The company's sales tax-free income amounted to EUR 4.956 million and decreased by 13.16% compared to the first quarter of last year.
“There are more than 100 people working at Vilnius Vodka.
STT detained R. Ača - Business news
Former MP and former director of Raseiniai district municipality administration Remigijus Ačas is suspected of bribery.
He is arrested.
The Special Investigation Service (STT) reports that officials of the Board of Šiaulių bankas are conducting a pre-trial investigation into possible corruption occurring in Raseiniai district municipality.
\"The former director of Raseiniai district municipality administration R. A. (Remigijus Ačas - Rev. post.) is suspected of bribery.
The circumstances regarding the non-transparent procurement carried out by R. A. acting as the director of the municipality shall be examined - possible exceptional favour for one private company to conclude a public procurement contract with the company managed by Raseiniai district municipality.
It is suspected that R. A. has accepted a bribe of more than 250 MGLs for this,\" the STT said in a press release.
BNS adds that this company - \"Raseiniai Bus Park\"
On Monday, officials also detained Vladislovas Šimaitis, the head of the company “Raseiniai Bus Park” owned by Raseiniai Municipality.
This was confirmed by STT spokeswoman Renata Endružytė.
The STT report states that the allegations were also made by two corporate representatives who directly bribed Mr Ača or took part in masking bribes on various financial transactions.
All suspects are arrested and searched at their workplaces and at home.
Stopped membership of LSDD
Remigijus Ačas was the director of the administration of Raseiniai district municipality for some time, but in April, if the council did not approve his report, he lost his duties.
He was also the mayor of this district in 2011-2012. Mr. Ačas, a long-time member of the Seimas, has been elected to parliament since 2004 as a candidate for the party \"Sustainability and Justice\".
However, in 2013 he and the party divorced, and in 2016 he failed to win his mandate independently.
Now Mr. Ačas is dependent on the newly established Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party (LSDD) led by Gediminas Kirki.
Shortly after the announcement, LSD Chairman Kirkilas announced in a press release that Mr Ač had suspended his party membership while the investigation was ongoing.
“The actions of the Special Investigation Service and the allegations made against Remigijus Ačas are an unpleasant surprise to us, but in all cases it is necessary for law enforcement to take all necessary steps to find out the truth.
Achas temporarily suspended the party’s membership until a pre-trial investigation has taken place,” LSD leader Kirkilas said.
In 2003, Ačas was the head of the advisory group of then-President Rolandas Paksas, who was later removed from office during impeachment, a national security adviser.
Mayor A. Gricius: I did not directly control the work of R. Ačas
Neither Raseiniai district mayor Algirdas Gricius nor the current head of the municipal administration Liudas Kavaliauskas told BNS on Monday that he had no information on which specific purchase could be related to a law enforcement investigation.
Mayor Gricius said he had learned of Mr Ačo's detention from the media.
“I can’t really say that we were very separated by function, I, as mayor, did my job, he (Ach (BNS)), the work of the administration, and I couldn’t say for whatever reason, or for what reasons, or for what public procurement this case was done,” he told BNS.
He also argued that he did not want to appreciate Mr. Ač's former leadership of the municipal administration for the same reasons.
I would be afraid to say something that I could evaluate his activities, because I did not directly control his administrative work, as far as I was presented with regard to public procurement, as far as tenders were concerned, and said that such and such public procurements took place, such tenders, after which what was visible in the public space was concluded, which I saw as mayor.
Therefore, I cannot describe how he led the administration at that time as its director,\" Grinius said.
He said he was not involved in public procurement and had no influence on it.
The Minister of Culture's Team - A New Advisor
The advisory team of Minister of Culture Liana Ruokytė-Jonsson was supplemented by Dr. Joseph Blažiūnas.
He advises on the management of archives, libraries, museums and cultural heritage.
The Ministry of Culture reports that since 2016 Blažiūnas has been the director of the Lithuanian Archives of Literature and Art, an associate professor of the Department of Museology of the Faculty of Communication of Vilnius University.
By the way, in 2017, students of the Faculty of Communication of VU elected Mr. Blažiūnas as the best lecturer of the Faculty.
The new Minister’s advisor is the author of many scientific articles on the preservation of cultural heritage and values.
The change does not stop
In May of this year, Minister of Culture Ruokytė-Jonsson’s team was left by Dr. Viktor Bachmetjev, an adviser who advised the Minister on public information policy, and was also responsible for media literacy and strategic communication.
On 2 October, Renaldas Augustinavičius announced his resignation from the post of Deputy Minister of Culture.
He was responsible for cultural heritage, archives, museums and libraries.
Mr Ruokytė-Jonsson then said that the new vice minister she chose would fuel the same areas as Mr Augustinavičius.
At the moment, in addition to Mr. Augustinavičius’s curated area-taking Mr. Blažiūnas, the minister’s advisory team consists of Rita Grumadaitė, Evaldas Stankevičius, Egidijus Gailiūnas, Rusnė Rinkevičienė and chief adviser Eglė Saudargaite.
Gentvilas: Non-functioning GPAIS threatens 90 million euros of fines for business
Simonas Gentvilas, vice-president of the Seimas Committee on Environmental Protection, says that Lithuanian producers and importers may have to pay almost EUR 90 million in fines due to the poor functioning of the information system on products, packaging and waste.
“As the end of the year and the GPais system begin to function normally, the systemic crisis in the packaging sector is becoming a more realistic scenario.
Unofficially it is said that certificates confirming the handling of packaging waste have been issued only 1% of the planned recycling tasks,” Gentvilas said in a press release.
On 7 November, Seimūnas initiates an extraordinary meeting of the Environment Committee, where it is planned to discuss the situation, find out why the functions of this program are not working, why the program module is not actually implemented and how the Ministry of Environment intends to solve the problem.
“Without the necessary legislative or legislative initiatives, manufacturers and importers are at risk of receiving huge environmental pollution taxes again at the end of this year,” Gentvilas said.
In his opinion, the shortcomings and inaction of the GPA accounting system signal a serious crisis in the packaging waste management sector, which can be compared to the Metroil crisis.
Worry about Tasks
Some experts warn that some of the companies may not be able to cope with the state’s 2018 recycling targets for packaging waste.
After seeing the recycling indicators of the first half-year packaging published by the organizations, specialists say they see the reason to worry that part of the organizations may not be able to handle the required amount of packaging waste in 2018.
As a result, some companies might no longer be able to benefit from the pollution tax relief and would be able to pay the pollution tax for a certain amount of their annual packaging.
Two of the three existing producer organisations rejects such concerns, while one does not make any comments.
Kęstutis Pocius, the Director General of the Green Point of the largest organization, said that at least formally, the success of the tasks depends on the solution of the problems of product, packaging and waste information accounting system (GAIS).
“The green dot is planning to be able to complete all kinds of packaging handling tasks this year, except for glass.
Although the task of the glass “Green Point” will fail this year, the organization promises to compensate its members for the losses it will incur.
Experts doubt the benefits of food coupons
As the government plans to share coupons for food products among the less well-off people and thus promote family or farm trade, experts doubt the benefits of such innovation.
They agree that the new system would create an additional bureaucratic burden.
Marius Dubnikovas, head of the Tax Commission of the Lithuanian Business Confederation, says that coupons are obsolete and problems will not be solved, and the government should focus on increasing human income.
\"The system seems rather strange and as if taken from older textbooks.
If we want to help the public to buy something or have greater purchasing power, we have to direct all the capacity to increase people's income, and people have to decide whether to buy in one store or another,\" Dubnikov told BNS.
According to him, the government would hit lower-income people by offering food coupons.
“Obviously, the lower-income voucher on which it would be written, we, this government, gave you the voucher, and be in favor of us.
It sounds like some pre-election promises, where you want to write your signature very clearly to them,\" the analyst said.
According to him, the food coupon system will require additional investments, and it will increase the administrative burden, because it will need to look after who and how they are allowed, what kind of protection they have against counterfeiting.
Swedbank Chief Economist Nerijus Mačiulis says both goals – supporting low-income residents and small entrepreneurs – could not be achieved with one instrument.
\"If it is support for small entrepreneurs, vouchers help compensate for price differences and people can buy more expensive goods in smaller stores, then the price difference is compensated by the state from the budget.
Then it’s support for business, not support for the population,” Mačiulis told BNS.
In his view, such a system would probably not have a significant macroeconomic impact and would not substantially alter the competitive position of small stores, but would, on the contrary, create an additional bureaucratic burden and could make it more difficult for new entrants to enter the market.
“It would seem that it would be a rather bureaucratic instrument with high administrative costs, and it would also be rather uncomfortable for residents to shop not in some larger store with a larger range closer to home, but to look for several specialized stores with a smaller range,” he said.
According to him, coupons are used in other countries where there is a limited volume of goods or services and they need to be provided to everyone in the same way or to some social group.
Then residents get coupons for free and can spend them on food.
According to Mr. Mačiulis, they are also used in the labour market, giving temporary tax relief to businesses, employing long-term unemployed people, or, for example, former prisoners.
Such practice, in the words of Mr. Mačiulis, was successfully applied in Lithuania.
Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis said Monday that the government’s new food voucher system would help the poorest people, increase competition, and encourage small-scale traders or farmers.
Prime Minister Skirmantas Malinauskas told BNS Monday that the idea is the most focused on farmers and family businesses, and buyers with coupons could get a 20-30% discount.
According to him, the amount of coupons would be limited to prevent farmers from being abused.
According to him, 3-5 coupons would allow a person to benefit from 10-15 euros per month.
According to him, although the state budget does not yet provide funding for the programme, it could be financed from this source, perhaps also from European Union funds.
“Not everything that is currently provided or not provided for in the budget will be final, yet it will change in the Seimas, this happens, funds from one line can be transferred to another, and from ministries, things can change.
There is always a priority defeat, what would be the decision – whether by giving up something, finding another additional source of income and so on,” Mr. Malinauskas told BNS on Tuesday.
