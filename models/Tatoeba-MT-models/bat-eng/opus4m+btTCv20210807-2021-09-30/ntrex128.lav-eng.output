Members of the Assembly of Wales (Assembly) are concerned about the possibility of being perceived as baits
Some members of the Assembly are concerned about the proposal to change their name to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This is due to plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
The AM in the whole political spectrum is worried that it can make them a subject of laughter.
One of the Labour Party’s AM explained that their group is concerned by the words ‘Twp’ and ‘Pwp’.
For readers outside Wales: Welsh “twp” means “one-right” but “pwp” means “kaka”
The Plaid AM party indicated that none of the group was “unsatisfied” and suggested alternatives.
It’s a great way to make sure that you’re getting the best results.
In this context, it should be borne in mind that the Welsh letter ‘w’ is spoken similarly in the English language Yorkshire dialect ‘u’
The Assembly Commission, which is currently developing draft laws to change the title, informed: “The final decision on what terms will be used to designate the members of the Assembly is, of course, to be taken by the members of the Assembly themselves –
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposal. It received broad support for the change of the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
When it comes to the name of AM, the commission preferred the Wales Parliament Member (WMP), but the MWP received the most support in the public consultation.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
The draft law on changes will also include other changes in the work of the assembly, including laws on AM disqualification and the structure of the committee system.
The final vote of AM on how they will be called will take place once they have discussed the laws and regulations.
It is also important to note that this is not the case in the United States, but in the United States.
The voter will vote on Sunday whether the name of their country will be changed to \"The Republic of North Macedonia -
People's vote was organised to resolve decades of disputes with neighbouring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the northern neighbour creates an impression of claims on its territory and has already repeatedly objected to Macedonia’s request to be admitted to the EU and NATO.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name is simply a matter for the EU and NATO to join.
The call of St. Martin's Church to silence the churches of Harlem in the struggle for existence.
“As the old people I talked to told, earlier on each corner were in the bar and in the temple,” says Mr. Adams.
“There is no longer one or the other.”
He admits that the disappearance of the bars is understandable.
“People are socializing in other ways today,” he said.
“Barbi is no longer the neighborhood of the living room that people visit on a regular basis.”
Even to the temples, he is worried that the money he receives from selling property will end faster than the leaders expect, \"and sooner or later they will have returned to the starting point -
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
“The majority of people who buy apartment properties in these buildings will be white,” he explained, “and thus the day will come near when these temples will close forever, because it is unlikely that the majority of those who gather in these apartments will become members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by a white congregation before Harlem became a black metropolis, the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin 10 years later.
The initial white methodist congregation abandoned the building in the 30s of the 20th century.
The building was taken over by the black congregation, which worshipped God right next to it.
The Black Church of St. Martin's Church took over his blessing during John Howard Johnson. He led a boycott of working retailers on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, who had refused to hire blacks or give them a promotion.
The fire in 1939 seriously damaged the building, but as the members of the congregation of Father Johnson planned to rebuild the building, they ordered a call game.
His blessing David Johnson, the son and successor of Father Johnson in St. Martin’s congregation, proudly called the call game “the bells of poor people.”
The expert who played this call game in July used other words: \"cultural treasure - and \"an indispensable historical instrument -
In addition, expert Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan added that it was the first call game in the world played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who moved 18 years ago to a larger call game in the Riverside Church.
Mr Merriweather said that St. Martin's church did not replace him.
The events of the last few months around St. Martin’s church reflected the sanctifying relationship between architects and builders, some of which were attracted by secular power in their work, and others by the episcopal diocese of the church.
In July, the congregation council, made up of secular leaders, addressed the diocese with concerns that the diocese would attempt to pass on costs to the council, although the council was not involved in hiring architects and builders sent to the diocese.
Some members of the congregation complained about the lack of transparency in diocese activities.
Shark injure 13-year-old teenager at lobster fishing site
Shark on Saturday attacked a 13-year-old boy in California who dived after lobsters and wounded him. It was the first day of the lobster season, the services tell.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m., near Beacon's Beach beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel informed KSWB-TV in San Diego that he and his friends had a dive on Saturday morning for about half an hour when he heard that the boy was called for help, and then with the group he looked up to him to help the boy pull out of the water.
It’s a great way to make sure that you don’t have to worry about it.
I'm told \"
The whole body of his key was cut off, said Hammell, who immediately noticed it when he got to the boy.
“I screamed that everyone would leave the water: “There is a shark in the water,” Hammell added.
The boy was taken by air to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition was considered critical.
The species of the attacked shark is unknown.
In the brigade, rescue captain Larry Giles informed the media that a few weeks earlier a shark was observed in the area, but it was acknowledged that it was not a dangerous species for humans.
He added that the victim was traumatized to the upper part of the rump.
Officials closed for 48 hours access to beaches from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Encinitas for investigation and safety purposes.
Jail noted that more than 135 shark species are found in the area, but most are not considered dangerous to humans.
“Sainsbury’s plans to print into the UK beauty industry market
“Sainsbury’s” is going to attack “Boots” “Superdrug” and “Debenhams” with department store-style beauty product shelves and trained sellers.
As part of a significant investment in the UK’s 2.8 billion pound large beauty market, which continues to grow despite the decline in sales of fashion goods and household items, 11 stores in the country will try larger rows of shelves of beauty products, and if everything goes well, the next year there will be more such stores.
In the beauty industry, funds are invested when supermarkets are looking for the use of shelves that were previously dedicated to televisions, microwaves and home goods.
“Sainsbury’s reported that it would double its offer in the field of beauty up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon-Essie-Tweezerman and, for the first time, Dr. PawPaw-
The existing lines from L'Oreal-Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive more locations with branded areas similar to those in the Boots stores.
The supermarket also re-markets its Boutique line of decorative cosmetics, where most of the products will be vegan-friendly – which is increasingly demanded by younger buyers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will test the concession in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which was opened last week in Croydon in south London, and the second will be opened in Selly Oak in Birmingham, later this year.
Internet shopping and the transition to small food purchases every day in local stores mean that supermarkets need to invest more to convince people to visit them.
“Sainsbury’s Mike Coupe, CEO, has said that sales outlets will become more and more similar to department stores because the chain of stores is trying to fight with discount shops Aldi and Lidl offering a wider range of services, but without food.
“Sainsbury’s has deployed “Argos” in several hundred stores and has opened several “Habitats” since bought both chains two years ago, which is claimed to have improved sales of goods and made the purchase more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to improve its beauty and pharmaceutical departments ended with defeat.
“Sainsbury’s – a joint venture with Boots – was tried in the early 2000s, but the union broke down after a dispute about how to divide income from pharmacy stores into supermarkets.
The new strategy is developing after Sainsbury’s sale of its 281 store large pharmaceutical business to the Celesio-Lloyds Pharmacy chain owner 3 years ago, worth £125 million.
According to this plan, Lloyds will be tasked with complementing the range with a wide range of exclusive skin care products, including Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury, said: \"To improve the environment for our customers, we have transformed the look of the shelves of our beauty products and the impression they create.
We have also invested funds in specially trained colleagues who will always be ready to make a recommendation.
Our brand range is designed to meet all needs, but an attractive environment with a comfortable location means that now we are a charming goal on the way to beauty, a goal that challenges the shopping habits of the past –
Peter John “full of anger” after Holly Wilouby gives up the £11 million deal
“Dragon Den – star Peter Jones – took on anger – after Hollywood Willoughby gave up a £11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Vilouby has no time to devote to their homewear and accessories brand Truly
The couple’s business was compared with Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
“This Morning, a 37-year-old broadcast manager used Instagram to tell her she was going away.
Holly Wilouby has left Dragon Den, a star at Peter Jones in anger, as he recently left their profitable lifestyle brand business to focus on his new huge contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources of information argue that Jones was “full of anger” when a TV gold girl announced at a tight meeting on Tuesday at his business empire residence in Marlow, Buckinghamshire that her new contracts, worth up to £1.5 million, meant that she no longer had time to devote to their homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The company was compared with the Goop brand of Guinea Platrov and, according to the remark, it will double the wealth of Viloubia, which is estimated to reach 11 million pounds.
When Wilouby (37) used Instagram to announce that he left Truly, Jones took him away from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
According to the source of information, “Truly” was the most important priority of Holland.
It should have become her long-term future, for which the next decades would be dedicated.
Her decision to leave surprised everyone involved unprepared.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday: everything was so close to the start.
Mārlova Centre has a warehouse full of ready-to-use goods for sale -
Experts believe that managers of this Morning, which is one of the most financially profitable stars, can spend millions of dollars away from the company, as a huge amount of money has been invested in various products, from pillows and candles, to clothing and home goods, and their placing on the market will be further delayed.
And this can mean the end of long friendship.
The mother of three, Wilouby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been in close contact with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Vilouby-Truly was founded in 2016 with Kepu, and 52-year-old Jones joined as president in March.
Both couples spend their holidays together, and Jones owns 40 % of the shares in the Boldwin TV production company.
Vilouby must become a brand M&S ambassador and will replace Ent McPartlin as ITV-I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said yesterday: \"We don't want to comment on his business transactions.\"
Serious conversation – and then we fell in love –
He joked about the criticism he would receive from news companies about a comment that some might consider “the president indignant” and about the fact that he was so positive towards the North Korean leader.
Why is the president so much to give up?
It’s not that I don’t know what to do, but it’s that I don’t know.
“I didn’t give up anything,”
He pointed out that Kim had shown interest in meeting once more after Trump recognized their initial meeting in Singapore in June as a big step towards North Korea’s denuclearization.
However, negotiations on denuclearisation have stopped.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, one of North Korea’s main diplomats, Ri Yong Ho, on Saturday, informed world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea does not see a US response to North Korea’s initial steps towards disarmament.
Instead, he pointed out that the US continues to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining tensions.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
“We have a great relationship with North Korea,” he said.
“We were going to fight North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have this great relationship –
He said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim had brought positive results: the cessation of missile testing, aid in the release of prisoners, and the return of the remaining American soldiers at home.
And he defended his unusual approach in terms of relations with Kim.
“It’s easy to create the impression of the president, but instead of standing there by 10,000 people trying to get into this densely populated area, we have 200 here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake destroy the island in Indonesia, killing hundreds of people
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their assistance was not necessary.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok was displaced, the state of the national disaster was not declared, but it is necessary to propose foreign aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, they said very clearly that they were not asking for international assistance, so this is a certain problem,” said Ms. Sumbung.
Although “Save the children,” collects a group for driving to Pala, it is still unclear whether foreign workers will be allowed to work there.
Mr Sutopo, a representative of the National Disaster Agency, explained that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu in order to see whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid.
Given that there are regular earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is still extremely negative about nature’s arrogance.
Although shelters for tsunamis have been established in Aceh, they are rare on other shores.
Most likely, death was also influenced by the fact that Palu did not hear the sirens of the tsunami warning, although the warning was valid.
Even in the most favorable times, the movement between the many islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The ship-hospital, which had died in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake, is now going to Pala, but it will take at least three days to reach the victims of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made improving Indonesia's demolished infrastructure a central point of his election campaign and has allocated large sums to roads and railways.
However, the lack of funds has tormented the administration of Mr Joko and expects him to re-election next year.
In addition, Mr Joko must face the long-standing problem of tensions between the sects of Indonesia, where the majority of Muslims have accepted one of the conservative forms of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were driven out of their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets using machets, bows and arrows, and other primitive weapons.
Watch: Liverpool – player Daniel Starr with ambition restores balance in match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge rescued Liverpool from losing to Chelsea, winning the goal at the Stamford Bridge stadium in London on Saturday at 89 minutes.
The star received a match from Xherdan Shaqiri, about 25 metres (30 yards) from Chelsea’s gate when his team lost 1:0.
He moved the ball slightly left of himself and then kicked the ball in the direction of the further gate.
In this attempt, the ball flew high across the area, reaching the top right corner of the net.
The ball eventually crossed the head of the jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
“I just tried to get that position to get to the ball, and players like Shaq always play as far forward as possible, so I just tried to get myself as much time as possible,” he explained to LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kant approach, hit the ball, and, without thinking much, I hit him.
“Chelsea, half-time, led by 1:0 after the Belgian star Eden Hazard got the words in the 25th minute.
“Blues – the attacker played the ball back to Mateo Kovacic before cutting to the middle of the field and throw the ball as quickly as possible on the side of Liverpool.
It’s a great way to make sure that you’re getting the best results.
Then he made a beautiful kick between the players, allowing Azard to get into the zone.
Azard overtook the speed of protection and finished the combination with the left foot with a kick in the back of the network, passing by Liverpool-Alison Becker.
“Liverpool – Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3 p.m. “Stadio San Paolo – Naples (Italy) will fight Napoli”
“Chelsea – with “Videoton – UEFA in the European League will meet on Thursday at 15.00 in London.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami reaches 832 people
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has reached 832 people, the National Disaster Agency said early Sunday.
It was reported that many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings after the 7.5-magnite earthquake that hit the country on Friday and caused up to 20 feet (~6.0 m) of high waves, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, told the news conference.
The city of Palu, home to more than 380 000 people, was covered by the ruins of the collapsed buildings.
Police suspect woman being arrested by 32-year-old man
The murder investigation was launched after this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, found a woman's body.
The 44-year-old victim with stabbed wounds was found at 7.55 in Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested.
Police have called for people in this neighborhood who have seen or heard something.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: \"The investigation has just begun, but I would like to invite everyone around John's street in Birkenhead to contact us and see or hear something suspicious.
I also invite everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something in their car video recorder materials, to contact us as they may have information that is important to our investigation.
The police spokeswoman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenhead, and she was found in her possession.
This afternoon, friends who think they know a woman have come to the scene of the crime to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and, as the police informed, they are engaged in informing the closest relatives of the victim.
The taxi driver, who lives in Greisonmjuza, tried to return to his apartment, but the police said to him that no one should enter the building or leave it.
He was unable to express a word when he learned what had happened.
People are informed that it will take hours for them to return.
It was heard as a policeman told a man that the entire neighborhood was perceived as a crime site.
A woman appeared in tears instead of a crime.
She continues to repeat: “It’s so terrible.”
In two afternoons, there were two police vans inside the cordon, and another was placed right next to the outside.
A number of police officers were stationed inside the cordon and controlled the apartment house.
All those who have information are asked to use DM @MerPolCC by 30 September, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously by phone 0800 555 111 by name 247.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
It would be ethically justified in the light of Taliban-like activities, as a result of which his fanaticic puritan followers destroyed so many monuments of English culture and religion.
However, the Crick proposal was described by the Cromwell Society as \"smile\" and \"an attempt to rewrite history\"
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: \"Given the ongoing debate on the removal of the statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside Westminster's palace would also become a goal.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
It is possible that Kromwell will be sacrificed because of his forefather, Thomas, who lived centuries ago.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s gorgeous depiction of Kromwell shows views in the 19th century and is part of a historiography of a person that many believe is still worthy of honor.
Mr Goldsmith told Sunday Telegraph: “Many, perhaps at the end of the 19th century, considered it more than today to be a parliamentary defender against external pressure, which, of course, was a monarchy.
There is an ongoing historical discussion about whether this is really a complete depiction of the topic.
It is clear that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century led to the further development of our nation, and Kromwell, as such, is a recognizable personality representing one of the sides of the modern breed.
His achievement, as a protector of Lords, is worth honoring and mentioning.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
According to the information of the local media pig market in southwest China attacked the farmer and killed him.
A man named only Yuan was found dead with a broken artery, all in one blood at the pig shed market in the Guizhou province in Lupanshui, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
The pig breeder is about to inject the vaccine into the pig cull Xining in the Qinghai province of China on 30 May 2005.
It is reported that he and his cousin had arrived on Wednesday from the neighboring province of Junnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found the man dead and discovered that the door of the nearby pig barn was open.
He said that there was a large pig with blood on his mouth.
According to the information, a forensic medical investigation confirmed that 550 pounds (~249 kg) of heavy vepri had broken the farmer.
“My cousin’s feet were bloody and clumsy,” said his cousin, “only mentioned his name in Wu,” writes Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera material showed how Juan enters the market on Thursday at 4:40 p.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Juan did not belong to him or his cousin.
The market manager informed Evening News that the vepris were turned on to prevent its attacks on others while the police collected evidence at the scene.
According to the information, Yuan's family and market management are discussing compensation for his death.
Although these cases are rare, other attacks of pigs in humans are known.
In 2016, the pig attacked a woman and a man on their farm in Massachusetts, resulting in critical injuries.
Another 10 years ago, 650 pounds (~295 kg) of a heavy pig in Wales kept the farmer forced on the tractor until the animal was frightened by his wife.
After the farmers in Oregon ate his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba-CBC News explained that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a “pistole shot.”
\"They're just playful.
They like to get stuck, they are very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to show them enough respect, he said.
The end of the Orcano Rose brings a wide and strong case to the southwest of the United States
As predicted, the Orcano Rose, moving across the coldest waters on the north coast of Mexico, will weaken.
However, Rose will bring flood-causing rains in the north and southwest of Mexico over the next few days.
In five afternoons (after North American Eastern time) Rose’s wind gusts reached 143 km/h (85 miles per hour) corresponding to the category 1 orchestra, and its point was 620 km (385 miles) southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
It is expected that Rose will move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure patch is formed over the Pacific, moving east towards the east coast of the United States. The rose, with the help of a tropical storm, as it approaches the semisoil of Bay California, will begin on Monday to direct the mass of moisture deep from the tropical strip northward to the southwest of the United States.
The rose will bring up to 10 inches (~25.4 cm) of rain in the Mexican part of the city on Monday.
Then, the tropical humidity, interacting with the approaching low-pressure patch, will create a wide area of heavy rain in the southwest within the next few days.
1-4 inches (~2.6-7.2 cm) of rain will cause dangerous sudden floods, mud streams and possibly landslides in the desert.
The moisture deep from the tropical band will cause rain, which in certain places will reach 2-3 inches (~5.1-5.6 cm) per hour, especially in the southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
In a part of the southwest, especially in most Arizona, rains are expected up to 24 inches (~5.2-5.1 cm).
There may be sudden floods with rapid deterioration due to the dispersal of tropical rains.
It is very undesirable to walk in the desert because of the threat of tropical rain.
Strong rain can turn canyons into rapid rivers, but storms will bring local groaning winds and sandstorms.
A low pressure will bring local heavy rain to the South California coast.
Rainforests are possible, which together exceed half an inch (~1.3 cm), and this can lead to small mud flows and slippery roads.
It will be the first rainforest in the region in the wet season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early Monday, before the rain will take over the wider territory late Monday and early Tuesday.
A strong rain on Tuesday will spread across the Four Corner Region (DR Colorado, DA Utah, NA Arizona and DR New Mexico) and will last for the whole Wednesday.
In October, intense temperature fluctuations across the United States are possible, as the Arctic temperatures are falling, but the tropical ones are still quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature at a small distance.
This is an example of dramatic temperature differences in the central part of the United States on Sunday.
The difference between the temperature in Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and Saint Louis and Demo (Des Moines), Iowa, differs by almost 20 degrees.
The next days will try to form and expand the long-lasting summer heat.
It is expected that in most central and eastern parts of the United States, the beginning of October will be warm, reaching temperatures of 80 degrees Fahrenheit (~27 degrees Celsius) in wide areas from the southern plains to part of the northeast.
The temperature in New York City could reach 80 degrees (by Farrenheit; ~27 degrees Celsius) on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecasts show a high probability of temperatures exceeding the average in the eastern part of the United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched a hearing on the Bret Cavenne case
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday on six television channels with enthusiasm, as demonstrated by the Supreme Court’s candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Kaveno of sexual harassment, which she claims took place in the 1980s.
In the meantime, political undistinguished continued, with the broadcasting companies interrupting the regular transmission to report on the latest developments on Friday: the agreement by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to investigate charges for the FBI week.
Forda informed the Senate Justice Committee that she was absolutely convinced that Kaveno had been dressed in her drink and tried to wear clothes during the high school party.
Caveno irresistiblely showed that he was absolutely sure that this did not happen.
According to Nielsen, all of this was observed on Friday by 20.4 million people.
CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC registered the interest of mid-viewers.
Data on other broadcasters, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, which demonstrated this were not immediately available.
And Nielsen usually has problems reading people who are looking at the offices.
In order to get a better picture, this number of viewers corresponds to the number of watchers of the exclusion games or the Oscar ceremony.
“The Fox News Channel, whose commentators have determinedly supported the appointment of Kaveno, had the highest number of viewers, an average of 5.69 million during a round-the-clock hearing,” Nielsen said.
The ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
In addition, the Commission notes that the Commission has not taken into account the fact that the aid was not granted in the present case.
The interest remained high even after hearing.
Fleik was the central figure of Friday's drama.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
In a live CNN, he stood for several minutes with stabbed eyes, as barren.
\"I'm standing here right in front of you,\" said a woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth to the state?”
He was told that “you belong to power, while so many women are powerless.”
Fleik explained that his team had made a statement and told him before the elevator door closed that he still had something to say during the committee hearing.
Cable networks and broadcasters reflected on live broadcasts several hours later when the Justice Committee was preparing to vote on the nomination of Kaveno for the Senate vote.
However, Fleiks argued that he would only do so if he knew that the FBI would deal with the charges against the candidate that a minority of Democrats had asked for next week.
Fleik was partially convinced by negotiations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After the talks with Kūns and several other senators, Fleiks made his decision.
The choice of Fleek was significant because it was clear that Republicans would not vote for the approval of Kaveno without investigation.
President Trump has ordered the FBI to investigate charges against Kavanaugh.
This is the first time I’ve ever been in the United States since the beginning of the 20th century.
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused people who criticized her plan to leave the European Union of \"political games\" with Britain's future and national interests.
The British Prime Minister Theresa Maya arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, next to her interview on the front page of the newspaper, May's former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continues to attack her Brexit plan for Britain's future relationship with the European Union, the so-called Chequers plan, stressing that the proposal for Britain and the EU to use each other's tariffs is \"fully absurd\"
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
The police have arrested a suspect for shooting Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
The officials released a video showing Sims' collision with Simpson, and police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
WAFB, a subsidiary of CBS, reports that the police found the glasses at the site of the crime and found Simpson’s blood on them.
After being interrogated by Simpson, the police reported that he had admitted to the way of shooting.
According to the lawyer, he was given a $350,000 security deposit.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
The Department thanked the Louisiana State Police’s refugee search operation team, the State Police Criminals Laboratory, the South University Police and the residents of the territory for their assistance in the investigation, which resulted in arrest.
It is also important to note that this is not the case in the United States.
Sims was 20 years old.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
In the last season, on average, he won 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in one game.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
“That’s what people always worry about,” said Way.
The volcano spits ash across Mexico City
The ash rising from the Pokatepetla volcano has reached the southern part of the Mexican capital.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
The center observed multiple shaking and shaking.
Images in social networks showed that car windshields in the vicinity of Mexico City, such as Hochimilco (Xochimilco), are covered with a thin ash layer.
Geophysicians have noticed the activation of a volcano 45 miles (72 kilometers) south-east of the capital, since the 7.1-magnate earthquake struck the central part of Mexico in 2017.
The volcano, also known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police conflict with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday following the clash of independent protesters with the public order police and when thousands joined enemy demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarising vote on separation.
The group of masked separation supporters, who were prevented by public order police, housed them with eggs and bitten with powdery paint, creating dark dust clouds in the streets, which would usually be full of tourists.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
For several hours, groups of supporters of independence, chanting: “Do not forget and not forgive,” were involved in the confrontation with unitary protesters, who chanted: “For a long life for Spain,”
According to local newspapers, fourteen people were given medical assistance during protests due to minor injuries.
One year after the referendum of 1 October, which was declared illegal by Madrid, but which was praised by the Catalans, the idea of independence in the occupied region remains under great strain.
The voters were confident about independence, although the voter activity was low, and those against separation were mostly boycotted.
According to Catalonia officials, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to stop voting at polling stations across the region and there were violent clashes.
The independence support groups had set off Friday night to prevent demonstrations in support of the state police.
The demonstration took place, but the demonstrators were forced to choose a different path.
Narcissist Narciss Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, admitted that he no longer expected Catalonia to gain independence.
“Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents’ eyes filled with tears of joy that they were allowed to vote, but now everything has stopped, he said.
Although the parties that support Catalonia's independence won last year's regional elections with a small but significant majority, these parties have fought to maintain progress this year, as several of the most well-known leaders have either emigrated or arrested and are waiting for trial for their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
The 42-year-old mechanic Joan Puig, who filmed a phone call to support police protests, said the conflict was fueled by politicians from both sides.
“The tension is growing,” he said.
On Saturday, one of the nine Catalan leaders, Oriol Junqueras, who has been in custody since the previous year to the court, announced that he would stand for European Parliament elections next year.
\"Immigrantism in European elections is the best way to uncover the regress of democratic values and the repression that the Spanish Government has brought against us,\" he said.
Londonderia: men arrested after car crash in building
Three men (33, 34 and 39) were arrested after the car was repeatedly hit against the building in London.
The incident took place in Ballinagard Crescent on Thursday at around 7.30 BST.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
It may have been shot at the car at the same time.
Menga Blow Lets Livingston With 1-0 Win Rangers
Dolly Menga’s first goal was to win Livingston.
It’s a great way to make sure that you’re getting the best results.
Dolly Menga’s strike turned out to be crucial, as Gary Holt’s team smoothed out the situation with Hibernian.
It’s not that I don’t know what to do, but it’s that I don’t know what to do.
Before that, on Thursday in the European League “Rangers” welcomed Vienna-Rapid
In the meantime, Livingston extended its series without loss in the division to six games, and chief coach Holt has still not felt the taste of defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller in the previous month.
“Livingston – does not use the opportunity against dull guests
The Holt team had to be led long before they got the words with their direct game, which made it a lot more difficult for “Rangers” in different ways.
It’s been a long time since I’ve been here.
The hosts allowed “Rangers” to play in front of them, knowing that they would be able to stop the guests in the planned places.
And this is how the decisive gate came.
“Rangers allowed a free kick, and Livingston used the corridor, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined forces to enable Meng to hit and score the goal from the middle of the area.
At this stage “Rangers” managed the ball, but the protection of the guests proved impenetrable and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not particularly disturbed.
It continued in the second half of the year, although Alfredo Morelos ordered Kellie to save the gate.
Scott Pitman's attempt was interrupted by the agility of \"Rangers\" goalkeeper Alan McGregor, and Litgov missed the gate in the \"Livingston\" combination.
“Livingston,” continued to appear in the area, and two calls for penalties were rejected after Halket’s fight for the ball with Glenn Middleton and his hand played.
“I’m not sure if I’m going to be able to do that.
Scottish BBC Alasdair Lamont – Tony in the arena
Phenomenal “Livingston” performance and result.
Each of them was excellent, continuing to surpass expectations, increasing performance.
Their style of play and personality have practically not changed since returning to the high echelon, but great praise deserves Holts for how he has consolidated the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great in maintaining first-class protection, while Menga made sure that Connor Goldson and Joe Worral were always vigilant.
But the Ranger lacked inspiration.
No matter how well they were under Gerard, they were far from these standards.
Their last ball was boring – only once they broke into the host area – and it is essentially a call to wake up – Ranger, who is in the middle of the table.
“I’m not sure if I’m going to be able to do that.
On Saturday (September 29), when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin, there was a lot of smiles and a blue sky.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They have disagreements on various issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new giant mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish community outside Turkey.
The police blocked a crowd of 25,000 people for security reasons, not allowing them to gather in front of the mosque, but many of the supporters came near to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, a large part of them Kurds, also expressed their attitude, condemning Erdogan’s policy and the decision of the German government to take him to themselves.
The mutual protests between the two sides reflect the contradictions caused by a guest, some of whom consider the German Turk to be a hero, while others despise as an autocratic.
Road Traffic Accident in Deptford: Cyclist Dies in Car Collision
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
The collision took place at the intersection of Bestwood Street with Evelyn Street, on the road with intensive traffic in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, at about 10.15 BST.
The car driver stopped, and the help was provided by a medical doctor, but the man died at the scene.
The collision took place several months after another bicycle driver died on Childers Street, about a mile from the site of the Sunday collision. At that time, the driver left the place of the collision.
It’s a great way to make sure that you’re getting the best results.
There are closed roads and buses on the scene, but car drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Workers Injured During Disorder
The Prison Office reports that six prison workers were injured in disorder in a male strict regime prison.
HMP Long Lartin, a prison in Worcestershire, erupted at around 9.30 a.m. BST Sunday and is still continuing.
In order to prevent the disorder involving eight prisoners and enclosed in one wing, staff from the Tornado special service were involved.
Mild facial injuries were treated at the site of the accident.
A prison spokesman said: “In order to resolve the incident in HMP Long Lartin, highly trained prison personnel were involved.
Six staff members were provided with medical assistance due to injuries.
We will not accept violence in our prisons and make it clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and may spend more time behind bars.
“HMP Long Lartin: There are more than 500 prisoners in prison, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, the prison chief was reported to have been hospitalized after the prisoner’s attack.
And last October, the rebel control officers were sent to prison to resolve serious irregularities in which the personnel were attacked by billiard bombs.
Orcans Rose Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City are threatened with sudden floods (probably to benefit from the situation in areas affected by drought)
Arizona rarely suffers from tropical depression, but this is what is likely to happen early next week, when the Orcano Rose with the remaining strength will move across the deserted southwest, creating a sudden risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning on the sudden floods on Monday and Tuesday in the western part of Arizona, the southern and eastern part of Nevada, the southeastern part of California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rose will move directly across Phoenix on Tuesday, arriving with the rain on Monday.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix said on Twitter that since 1950, only “ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storms or depressions within a radius of 200 miles (320 km) from Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was an organ 40 miles (65 km) from the AZ borders.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict the rain of 2-3 inches (~5.08-5.2 cm), reaching 6 inches (15.24 cm) in separate locations.
Other deserted south-west areas, including the central part of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, may receive 1 to 2 inches (~2.54 to 2.08 cm), reaching 4 inches (~10.2 cm) in separate locations.
For those who are not at risk of sudden flooding, the rose rain can become a blessing because the region has been hit by drought.
Although the possibility of flooding is of very serious concern, some of the rain will probably be of benefit, as the southwest currently suffers from drought.
According to Drought Monitor, a little over 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, which is the second highest category, reported weather.com.
First of all, the path of the Orcano Rose leads to the peninsula of Lower California (Baja California) in Mexico, where it will reach the coast.
The Rose is still with the power of the orchestra on Sunday morning at a maximum wind speed of 85 miles (137 km) per hour, is about 385 miles (~620 km) south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moves north at a speed of 12 miles (19 km) per hour.
The storm encounters cooler Pacific waters and therefore calms down.
It is therefore expected that the organ with the power of a tropical storm will reach the coast of Mexico on Monday afternoon or in the morning.
In the rainy gas part of Mexico can be strong, creating a significant risk of flooding.
“It is expected that the rains will reach 3-4 inches (7.62-7.24 cm) from Lower California in the southwest of Sonora, with precipitation likely reaching 10 inches (25.4 cm),” weather.com reported.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
“The main threat to be expected from Rose or its remnants is very heavy rains in Lower California, the northwest of Sonora and the U.S. deserted southwest,” the National Orcans Center said.
This rain is expected to cause life-threatening sudden floods and mud flows in deserts, and landslides in mountainous areas.
Attack Midsommer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested for attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy with stabbed wounds was found in Somerset.
The wounded teenager was found on Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at around 4.00 BST.
He was taken to a hospital where his condition remains stable
The police said that 17-year-old and two 18-year-old teenagers, as well as a 20-year-old man, were arrested overnight in Redstock, Eivon and Somerset.
Police have called on anyone who could have cell phone material about what had happened.
Trump claims that Kaveno has suffered from the Democratic Party's \"violence and anger\"
“The vote on Judge Chaven is a vote to reject the violent and violent tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump announced at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump stressed that Kaveno had suffered from the Democratic Party's \"evil and anger\" throughout his nomination process.
Kaveno was shown before Congress, where he vigorously and emotionally denied any accusations of sexual harassment by Christine Blasey Ford several decades ago when both were teenagers.
Ford also showed during the hearing about his accusations.
The President announced on Saturday that “the American people saw the excellence, the ability and the courage of Chaveno”
“The vote on the approval of Judge Kaveno is a vote to confirm one of the most educated lawyers of our time with a bright history of serving the nation,” he told a group of supporters in West Virginia.
The President mentioned the nomination of Kaveno in terms of the importance of Republican activity in the interim elections.
“Five weeks to one of the most important elections in our time.
I wasn’t a candidate, but I was actually a candidate, he said.
“That’s why I’m going everywhere, fighting for great candidates.”
Trump argued that the Democrats had taken up a mission of “protesting and resisting”
It is expected that the first of the important procedural votes in the Senate for the nomination of Kaveno will take place no later than Friday, the senior assistant of the Republican Party leadership told CNN.
Hundreds of people killed in earthquakes in Indonesia, and it is clear that the number of victims is increasing
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
On Friday, hundreds of people had gathered for the festival in Palu, where up to six meters (18 feet) of high waves hit the shore of the chair, washing many people away and destroying everything that was on their way.
The tsunami erupted after a 7.5-mile earthquake.
“When there was a tsunami yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not escape immediately, and they became victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indian Disaster Reduction Agency, told a news conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami did not come alone, it brought cars, logs, and buildings, it ruined everything that was on the ground,” Nugoro said, adding that the tsunami had crossed the sea at 800 km/h (497 mph) before attacking the coast.
“Many people crawled into trees to escape and survived,” he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The photographs taken by the disaster agency show many destroyed houses and shops, deformed and destroyed bridges, and a water-enriched mosque.
This is the first time I’ve ever been in the United States since the beginning of the 20th century.
The earthquake series was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency in the BPPT statement stressed that the energy released by the massive earthquake on Friday was about 200 times the energy released during World War II on the atomic bomb dropped to Hiroshima.
The location of the city at the end of a long, narrow bay may have strengthened the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho’s destruction was described as “wide,” and reported that thousands of homes, hospitals, shops, and hotels had been destroyed.
He said the bodies of some victims were found trapped under the ruins of the collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho admitted that the number of victims and damage could be greater along the coastline of 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in the area called Donggala, which is located closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
“The communications were completely destroyed, no information was received from Dongala,” Nugroho said.
More than 300 000 people live there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers are going to the areas affected by the disaster.
“It’s a tragedy, but it could have been even worse,” the organization said.
The Agency was widely criticised on Saturday for not informing that the tsunami had hit Pal, although officials claimed that the waves had arrived at the time of the warning.
The video on social networks can be heard that a man on the top floor of the building desperately calls people on the bottom of the street that a tsunami is approaching.
Within a few minutes, the water wall hits the coast, wasting buildings and machines.
The Reuters news agency was unable to confirm immediately whether the material was real.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a serious loss of power supply, which disconnected the Palu communication, making it difficult for officials to coordinate rescue efforts.
They said the army had started sending cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated still needed food and other goods.
The city airport is only open for assistance events and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo's evacuation centres were scheduled to visit Palu on Sunday.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami exceeds 800.
That's very bad.
Mr Dozeba said that “World Vision,” employees who successfully reached the city of Palu from Donggala, and now in tarpaulins in the backyard of the office, passed through the ruin scenes along the way.
“They told us that they saw a lot of buildings that were destroyed,” he explained.
That's very bad.
Even when aid teams were determined to organise assistance to victims of the disaster, some complained that foreign aid workers with extensive experience were not allowed to go to Palais.
According to Indonesian legislation, funding, resources and personnel from overseas organisations will only be allowed to arrive if the territory of the disaster is declared as a national disaster zone.
This has not happened yet.
“It is still a provincial disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
\"When the government announces, \"Well, this is a national disaster, we will be able to accept international aid, but this status has not yet been established.\"
When Palu arrived on the second night after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family members of the still undiscovered people continued to hope that their loved ones will become miracles that make a gloomy life during natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small boy was pulled out of the gutter.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who was printed under the rubble for two days, next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandon, coach of Indonesia's national team of paragliders, had prepared two of the most unprecedented paragliders in the absence of Asia, which took place this month in Indonesia.
Others of those trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, including Mr. Mandaghi, were their students.
“As an experienced paraglider,” he said, “my emotions are burdened.
Mr Gendona recalled that after news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel in the Paraguayn team, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to participants of the Palu competition who took part in the beach festival for hours.
However, the result of his reports was only one gray mark, not two blue marks.
“I think it means that the messages did not reach the addressee,” he said.
Theft of 26 750 dollars at the Newport on the Levee complex
According to a Newport Police Department statement, thieves stole $26,750 in Friday morning for a staff member who filled the Newport on the Levee complex.
“The driver of the car was emptying the ATM entertainment complex and was ready to fill it with more money,” Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
As long as the driver was busy, another person ran from behind to Brink’s employee and stole a bag with ATM money.
According to the press release, the Witnesses noticed a number of suspicious persons leaving the scene, but police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
Everyone who has information about their identities should contact Newport Police 859-292-3680.
Kanje Wests: rapper changes his name to Je
Reper Kanje West changes his name to Ye (Je).
When he announced a change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “A being who knew in advance as Kanji Vestu”
The 41-year-old West has been named Je for some time and used the nickname as his eighth album, released in June.
This change takes place before he appears on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album, Yandhi.
The creators of the show tell that he replaces the singer Arian Grande in the show, who stopped his work “for emotional reasons”
The West has said that this is not only an abbreviation of his current professional name, but it also has a religious meaning.
“I believe that “Yes” is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means “You,” West explained earlier this year, discussing his album titled “Big Boy”.
\"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
At first there was Kanje, which means “only one,” followed by “Yes,” which is reflection on the good and bad in us, about our confusion, about everything.
The album is more of a reflection on who we are
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their names.
Shen Combs, known to date as both Puff Daddy and Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the words Love and Brother Love.

Mexico's elected president promises not to use the army against civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, Mexican President-elect, has promised never to use military force against civilians at a time when the 50th anniversary of the bloody repayment of students is approaching.
Lopez Obrador on Saturday, Tlatelolco Plaza, promised never to use the army to suppress the Mexican people.
A peaceful demonstration was shot by an army unit on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people at a time when left-centered student movements spread throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has vowed to support young Mexicans by issuing monthly grants to students and opening up more public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities draw young people into criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double funding for artificial intelligence
As China becomes increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount spent on research in this field, explains Investor and Artificial Intelligence Practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google Microsoft and Apple.
Comments were made after various U.S. government bodies have made statements on artificial intelligence, although the U.S. as a whole lacks a strategy on artificial intelligence.
In the meantime, China launched its plan last year: its goal is to become the leading country in artificial intelligence by 2030.
“A two-fold budget for artificial intelligence research will be a good start given that all other countries are so far behind the US, and the next cardinal shift in artificial intelligence is expected,” Lee said.
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee said that doubling funding could double the likelihood that the next achievement in the field of artificial intelligence will take place in the US.
Lewis, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” is “The Powers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the World’s New Order” published this month, is the CEO of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, which has invested in one of China’s leading artificial intelligence companies, the Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at the University of Carnegie Mellon to create an artificial intelligence system that beats America’s best Othello (Reversi) player, but later he was Microsoft Research’s leading employee and Google’s president of China’s branch.
Lee acknowledged the previous technology competition organised by the U.S. government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be ready to identify people with ideas for the future.
“Scientists in the United States often have to work very hard to get government grants, a picture of Lee.
“Not China is attracting leading scientists, but big companies,” he explained.
In recent years, Facebook and other technology companies have hired university shines for artificial intelligence.
He added that changes in immigration policy could also help the US improve its performance in artificial intelligence.
“I believe that green cards should be automatically awarded to people with a doctorate in philosophy in the field of artificial intelligence,” he said.
In July 2017, the National Council of China published its next generation artificial intelligence development plan.
Lie explained that the National Science Foundation of China provides funding to people in academic institutions, similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations providing money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
This year, U.S. Defense Department established a joint artificial intelligence centre to bring together partners from industry and academia, and White House announced the creation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month’s DARPA (Central Research and Development Organisation of the Ministry of Defence of the United States) announced a $2 billion investment in the initiative called “AI Next”
The National Science Foundation currently invests more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
The U.S. legislation, whose task was to establish a National Security Commission on Artistic Intelligence, has been in operation for several months.
It is also important to note that this is not the case in the United States, but in the United States.
On Sunday, Macedonians voted in a referendum on whether to change the country's name to the \"North Macedonian Republic\" by taking a step that will prevent decades of disputes with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's requests to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, stresses that its northern neighbour's name indicates claims on its territory and has put a veto on Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
Both governments concluded an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but the opposition nationalists insist that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that I will not vote in the referendum, and the campaign called for boycott has raised concerns whether the turnout will reach at least 50%, which is necessary for the referendum to be recognised as valid.
Question asked in the referendum newsletter: “Are you in favour of membership of NATO and the EU by concluding an agreement with Greece –
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying on the way to Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, becoming an organization such as the EU and NATO.
“I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, to live their lives freely within the framework of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said Oliver Georgievsky, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members of Parliament have declared that they will take into account the outcome of the vote, which will become decisive.
To change the name, Parliament will need 2/3 of the majority.
It’s a great way to make sure that you’re getting the best results.
However, the activity was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in previous parliamentary elections, where 66 percent of registered voters voted.
“I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said 62-year-old Josje Tanevski, a voter in the capital Skopje.
On 30 September 2018, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko gave their votes in a referendum in Macedonia on a change in the name of the country that will open the way to NATO and the European Union.
In front of Parliament, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov, prepared a small stage and arranged chairs on tents that were placed by those who boycotted the referendum.
“We are about NATO and the EU, but we want to join with a raised head, not through the door of the servants,” Kawadarkov said.
“We are a small country, but we have self-esteem.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China or Russia, and become part of European-Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zayev says NATO membership will start the necessary investments in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate exceeds 20 percent.
“I believe that the majority will vote in favour, the more than 80-50% of our citizens support the EU and NATO,” Zayev said after the vote was passed.
He said that the result, yes, would confirm our future.
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research shows that 30-43 percent of voters will take part in the referendum, less than the required activity.
In another survey conducted by the Macedonian Telma TV, 57 percent of voters were expected to take part in Sunday's vote.
70 percent of them said they would vote in favour.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the turnout must be 50 percent and another vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first serious blow to the West-oriented government, which came to power last May.
See: Manchester-City-Serhio Agvero (Sergio Aguero) has been trained through the whole Brighton protection to score a goal.
Serhio Agvero and Raheem Sterling won the Brighton – protection by allowing Manchester-City to win with 2:0 on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Agvero made the impression that his goal score in the 65th minute was ridiculously easy.
The Argentinian attacker received a match in the middle of the area at the beginning of the combination.
He ran among the three Brighton guards, and fell inside the free field.
Then Agvero covered four green shirts.
He turned the ball over to one guard, then he beat several more Brighton on the edge of the field.
Then he made the game to the left, reaching Sterling.
The English centre's attacker used his first touch to play back Agvero, who used the right football boot to beat Brigton, a goalkeeper at Mathew Ryan, by hitting the ball on the right.
“Agvero is struggling with foot problems,” Pep Guardiola, the manager of the city, told reporters.
“We discussed playing with him for 55, 60 minutes.
That's exactly what happened.
We were lucky that he scored the goal at that time.
But it was Sterling, which provided Sky Blues with an initial advantage in the Premier League fight.
The gate was reached in 29 minutes.
In Agvero played the ball in the territory of Brighton.
He sent the ball with a beautiful blow along the left-leg eggs of Leroy Sane.
It is not easy to get rid of it, but it is very difficult to get rid of it.
“Sky Blues – the attacker of the center easily threw the ball into the network just before crossing the border.

Shercer wants to have a problem with Rockies
Since the Nationals are not participating in the exclusion games, there was no reason to resume again.
However, Scherzer, who is always ready to compete, hopes to take advantage of the opportunity against Colorado-Rockies on Sunday, but only if the Rockies-Rockies-Rockies-Rockies-Rockies-Rockies-Rockies-Rockies-The National League-West Group is led by one game against Los Angeles-Dodgers-
“Rockies – have put out at least a white card on Friday night with 5:2 winning the Nationals – but still have not won their first title in the division.
“Although we play the same way, we can at least have fun knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver, with the crowd and the other team, will probably be the most frustrating I will face this year.
And why would I not want to compete?
“Nationals have not yet announced who will start the game on Sunday, but as they say, is ready to let Shercer make a shot.

It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
The President mentioned the situation in which Brett Kaveno, the candidate of the Supreme Court of his choice, was caught, while talking about the importance of the activity of Republican voters in the interim elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
Five weeks to one of our time's most important elections.
That's really very, very serious -- I didn't stand up, but I was actually a candidate, and that's why I'm everywhere and fighting for great candidates,\" he said.
Trump continued: “You see this terrible, terrible group of Democrats who are acting right now.
And they are determined to regain power by using all possible means to achieve the goal. You see evil, disgusting action.
They don't care what they're going to hurt, they're going to have to break in order to get power and control, that's why they want power and control, and we won't give them --

The Labour Party is no longer ready for diversity.
It is intolerant to the open
It was not surprising that “Momentum” activists in my local party wanted me to be subject to censorship.
After all, I am the last in a row of Labour's MPs to date to say that he is not desirable - that's all, because we do not hide our opinion.
My fellow Member in Parliament, Joan Ryan, fought similarly because she was determined to oppose anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship movement criticized me for not accepting Jeremiah Corbyn.
The importance of economically responsible policies, of national security, of Europe, was ironic, but these were issues where Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The Communication on the Labour Meeting in the East of Nottingham said on Friday that “we want meetings to be inclusive and productive –
Most of the meetings that took place during the career of eight members of my local Labour Parliament were exactly the same.
Unfortunately, in many meetings today, the atmosphere is different and the promises of a more “happier, gentler” policy have long been forgotten, if ever.
It has become increasingly clear that the Labour Party does not want to tolerate different opinions, and any opinion is judged depending on whether it is acceptable for party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader: my colleagues, who I think our political views are similar, began to expect me to turn 180 degrees and accept opinions that I would never have accepted in other cases, whether it was national security or a single EU market.
When I speak publicly - and basically no matter what I say - there is a research into the use of social networks, calling for a ban on candidates for the next elections, dispelling the centre's policy, claiming that I have no place in the Labour Party.
And that's not just my experience.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments against me are usually political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face the stream of sexist and racist insults every day, but never try to avoid obediently.
One of the most unsatisfactory aspects of this political era is how normal the use has become.
Jeremy Corbin said last week that the Labour Party must develop a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer an organization that is ready for diversity of opinion and with every distrust or change of selection rules, the party will narrow down.
During the last two years, I have often been advised not to jump on the eyebrows, to think about what I am talking about, and then to me, “Everything will be fine.”
But that is not why I decided to get involved in politics.
Since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a student in response to the neglect of the Techerian government, which literally led my class to collapse, I set out to fight for better public services for those most in need, both as a member of the local council and as a minister of the government.
I have never hid my political views, nor in previous elections.
No one in the East of Nottingham had any reason to doubt my position on political issues and areas where I would disagree with the current government.
I can only say to those who made the proposal on Friday that at a time when the state is determined to move towards Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
However, the only thing I want to report is not for the Nottingham-Momentum voters, but for their voters, whether they are Labour members: I am proud to serve you and I promise that there is no threat of denying candidates or reminders that no one is indispensable in politics, will not stop me from acting as I think it is best for all of you.

“Ayr – 38 – 17”Melrose –: Uncompressed –Ayr – reaches the highest line in the table
The last two attempts are likely to split to some extent the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves to triumph in this amazingly exciting Scottish Championship match today.
Now they are at the top of the table, the only unsaid team out of ten.
After all, it was both their excellent protection and the much better use of opportunities that led to hosts, and coach Peter Murchie has all the reasons to be satisfied.
“We have been tested in all our games and we are still not defeated, so I have to be happy,” he said.
“Melrose – Robin Christie: “All respect – Ayr – they used their opportunities better than we did”
In the 14th minute of Grant Anderson's attempt by Frazier Climo, Ayr, the yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, where Warriors changed numbers to Melrose, and Jason Baggot captured an unrealized ball.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
However, Melrose started half-time with a good game, and Patrick Anderson’s attempt by Begott reduced the gap to 5 points.
It was a long break, because Ruaridh Knott suffered a serious injury and was taken to the carriages away from the field, but when the game resumed, Ayr, quickly advanced when Stafford McDowall made an attempt by Klimo.
“Ayr, the current captain, Blair Macpherson, then received a yellow card, and again, after intense pressure, Melrose used an redundant player, with an attempt by Bruce Colvine, which was not realized.
However, the hosts slammed, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for intercepting the Klimo without a ball, from the penalty corridor, McFerson made the back of the Tachdaun Ayr clay.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
“Still Game – The star seems to be planning a new career in restaurant business
Ford Kieran, the star of the comedy series Still Game, seems to be planning to get involved in the hospitality business because he was revealed to be the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show he creates and participates with his old partner in films by Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the next ninth season will be the show's last, and Kürnan apparently plans his life after Craiglang.
According to official information, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although the Scottish Sun source pointed out that Kürnan planned to engage in Glasgow-growing restaurant business.
“The sea belongs to us: Bolivia, trapped on land, hopes that the court will open its way to the Pacific Ocean
The seamen patrol around the taverns in Flotte's Staff in Lapasa.
Public buildings have raised the blue flags of the ocean.
The fleet-based ships from Lake Titicaka, to the Amazon, are decorated with a motto: “We have a right to the sea.
Its recovery is our responsibility.
The memories of Chile in the 19th-century bloody conflict about the loss of resources in Bolivia are still alive, as is the longing to sail again in the Pacific.
These expectations have probably been the highest since several decades, as Bolivia is awaiting the judgment of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of examination.
“Bolivia is developing, it is united and calm in its spirit and, of course, looks forward to the outcome with positive thoughts,” Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla said.
Many Bolivians will watch the judgment of the International Court of Justice on large screens across the country, hoping that the Tribunal in The Hague will decide in favour of Bolivia's claim that, after several decades of interrupted negotiations, Chile is obliged to discuss the granting of sovereign exits to Bolivia.
The Bolivian charismatic local president, Evo Morales, is also very interested in Monday's ruling.
“We are close to regaining the Pacific Ocean,” he was excited at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the judgment in favour of Bolivia is unlikely, and if adopted, no major changes are expected.
The UN body based in the Netherlands does not have the power to grant the territory of Chile and its representatives have indicated that they will not determine the outcome of the negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice is passed just six months after its final hearing shows that the case was not complicated, as explained by Paz Zárate, an international regulatory expert from Chile.
And for the last four years, Bolivian affairs have not moved forward, but have, on the contrary, been delayed.
“The issue of access to the sea has been seized by the existing Bolivian administration,” said Zarate.
Morales' military rhetoric has been crippled by the rest of the good will she said.
Bolivia and Chile will once again continue to negotiate, but after this it will be very difficult to maintain the debate.
Both countries have not exchanged messengers since 1962.
Bolivian representative in The Hague, former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, did not agree that the court made the decision unusually quickly.
Monday will give Bolivia an “extraordinary opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile” and an opportunity to “put an end to 139-year-long conflicts, from which both sides will gain,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, used the sea’s problems as political crumbs.
“Bolivia will never waive its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
\"This decision is an opportunity to clarify what needs to be done to overcome the past -
North Korea will only give up nuclear weapons when it can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his nation would never be the first to eliminate its nuclear weapons if it could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to deliver on the promises made by the leaders of both countries during the Singapore summit.
His comments came at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be ready to resume the deadlocked diplomatic measures to prevent the nuclear war, more than three months after Singapore’s meeting with North Korean leader Kim Chen.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
Washington is cautious as regards its acceptance of the declaration before Phenjana takes significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
However, many are skeptical about whether or not Phenyana really wants to abandon an armament which the state probably considers to be the only way to guarantee its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Phenjana next month to prepare for the next Kim meeting with Trump.
Paris Fashion Show Presents Latest Massive Headset Line Towards You Nearest High Street
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely block the sun, then you are in the right place.
Designers Valentino and Thomas Browne presented the audience with a series of absurd, huge head-wearing items in the 2019 spring/summer season collection, which dazzled on the background of the Paris Fashion Week set style.
Highly unpractical hats have flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their stunning achievements to fashion showcasing.
The most outstanding piece of valentine was a gorgeous beige hat decorated with feathers-like wide edges that swallowed their heads.
Among the massive accessories were precious watermelons, a magic hat, and even pineapple – but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also showed a strange selection of masks, just before Halloween.
Many of the colour masks had their lips stuffed, and they served Hanibal Lecter rather than high fashion.
One of the formations reminded the breathing mind to dive, with tubes and glasses, while the other resembled the melted ice cream cone.
And if you want to continue with massive fashion, then the right time has come.
Style watchers believe that huge moths may be on the way to you near High Street.
Large hats immediately became popular after the appearance of “La Bomba” straw hats with two feet (~60 cm) wide edges seem to have worn all, from Rianna, to Emily Ratajkowski.
The status of very unpractical hats as a cult object in all social networks led to another big piece on the tongue, a straw beach bag, almost as big as the swimsuit model that brought it.
Red-yellow raffia bag, decorated with raffia fries and equipped with a white leather handle, took a special place in the “Jacquemus’ La Riviera” Spring/Summer 2019 collection at the Paris Fashion Week.
The celebrity stylist Luke Armitage explained: “I expect big hats and beach bags to appear in central street shops next summer because the designer has left such a big impression that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for huge-sized accessories –
John Edwards: Language knowledge is essential for the citizens of the world
Scotland's independent schools have a reputation for excellent educational institutions and have retained it in 2018, once again with excellent exam results, further strengthened by individual and collective achievements in sport, art music and other social events.
This school, which has a total of 30,000 students in Scotland and is represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aims to ensure the best level for their students and their parents.
Independent schools have set themselves the goal of preparing their students for further and higher education, their chosen career and their lives as citizens of the world.
As an education sector that can develop and implement specific school programmes, we see that modern languages are still a popular and desirable subject in our schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak with a person in a language that he understands, it remains in his consciousness.
If you speak his mother tongue, it remains in his heart.
This is a convincing reminder of the fact that we cannot simply rely on English when we want to build a relationship and gain confidence in people from other countries.
In view of the recent results of this year's exams, we can see that languages are at the top of the league tables with the largest number of exams passed in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who taught foreign languages reached the highest grade A.
The Scottish Council of Independent Schools estimates that 72 percent of students received the highest grade in Chinese A, and 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent of those who learned French and 63 percent of those who learned Spanish, also received the same grade.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Now, as a subject of choice, independent school programs are assessed as high as science-technology-engineering and mathematics.
A 2014 survey by the Employment and Skills Commission found that 17 percent of employers said language skills were lacking as a reason for their failure to fill the vacancies.
As a result, language skills are becoming increasingly mandatory in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
These skills are essential in a globalised world, with increasing employment opportunities that will require language skills.
Regardless of their chosen career, they will gain in the future a true advantage from such a long-term skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically improve the competitiveness of a multi-language proficient.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of over 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent did not know a foreign language well enough to keep the conversation going, while French was the only language spoken by a two-digit number of people, 15 percent.
That is why investing in language teaching is important for today's children.
A number of languages, especially those of developing countries, will provide better opportunities for children for meaningful work.
Schools in Scotland differ in terms of the languages taught.
Some schools will pay more attention to the most common modern languages, while others will teach languages, such as Chinese and Japanese, which are considered the most important for Britain’s future, according to plans for 2020.
Whatever your child is interested in, independent schools will always be able to choose from several languages, and teachers will be specialists in the field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a language environment that will prepare children and provide them with the skills needed to succeed whatever the future may be.
In today’s global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still vital for the future of the country, so this fact must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be regarded as \"the skills of international communication\"
Independent schools will continue to offer Scottish youth this choice, diversity and excellence.
Il faut bien le faire (This must be done).
John Edwards is Director of Scottish Independent Schools Council
This is the first time I’ve been in the United States since the beginning of the 20th century.
The fans have finally expected the first game of Lebron in Los Angeles-Lakers.
“Laker – coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play Sunday’s pre-season opening game against Denver-Nuggets-Sandjego.
But we still have to decide how many minutes he will play.
“It’s going to be more than one, but less than 48,” Volton told Lakers on the official website.
“Laker – reporter Mike Trudell on Twitter wrote that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
As he continued his practice this week, James asked about his plans for a series of six pre-season games for Lakers.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season games to get ready,” he said.
It’s not that I don’t know what to do, but it’s that I don’t know.
President Donald Trump launched a series of myths today in Viling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five demonstrations planned by Trump next week, including stopping in friendly places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Since the vote on his choice to fill free space has been suspended in the Supreme Court, Trump’s aim is to get support in the upcoming interim elections, as there is a risk that Republicans will lose control of Congress after passing votes in November.
How long will Trump stay in West Virginia today and how will he be able to watch it online?
It is planned to take place in Vilinga, West Virginia at seven o'clock, after ET today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the tramp accommodation in West Virginia online on YouTube.
It is believed that Trump will talk about hearing this week in the case of Supreme Court candidate Bret Kaveno, who has been charged with sexual crimes and is expected to vote in the Senate to postpone approval for a week while the FBI conducts investigations.
But the main goal of this rally is to help improve the situation of Republicans expected by the elections in November.
This is why President Trump’s campaign shows that this week’s five-seat task is to “activate volunteers and supporters while Republicans try to protect and increase the majority they own in the Senate and the House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
“Congress control over his agenda is so important that the president will visit the state as much as possible, because we start an active campaign season,” said Reuters, a spokesman for the Trump campaign who did not want to reveal his name.
This evening's accommodation, which is planned for \"Wesbanco Arena- Vilinga, will potentially attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and will be reflected in the Pittsburgh media,\" says West Virginia Metro News.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Senator Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind according to polls.
“This is not a good sign to Morrisey that the president must come to help improve his results in surveys,” said Simon Haeder, professor of political science at the University of West Virginia.
Rider Cup 2018: The United States has demonstrated its determination to fight to maintain high expectations for Sunday’s singles
After three sessions in a single word, Wednesday afternoon’s foursome format may have been exactly what was needed for this Raider Cup.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
So, which side do they think is now good?
“They were led by six points, but now by four, since I think that in a sense, it means that success has turned to us,” said Jordan Spieth, who is going on his way.
Europe, of course, has a preference, because it is under the leadership of 4 points, but another 12 will be played out.
The Story explains that the Americans believe that the wind blows in their sails and that they have a reason for optimism, of course, also in the person of Spit and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each of them can boast of three points out of four.
The barbecue has been destructive from the point of first hit, to the lawn, and is an example of the winner.
These Gutular victories became increasingly louder when his round continued, a decisive beat in the hole was made to reach the same number of beats four times when he and Thomas were two beats after two.
It is also important to note that this is not the case in the United States, but in the United States.
“It’s really got to go deep, and worry about your match,” said Sbitt.
This is all left of these players.
18 holes for success.
The only players who have scored more points in the last two days than Spit and Thomas are Frencho Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who will undoubtedly fall into the history of this Raider Cup.
Europe's strange but attractive couple is four points behind and will not be able to harm.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
This course and the way their energy flows to this crazy crowd and back convinces them that they are players to win on Sunday, and Flywood and Molinari will be the most popular players that can provide a potential European victory when the sun goes over Le Golf National
It is desirable to both at the same time in different holes.
However, the talk of the European triumph was premature.
Babba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly managed to cope with this morning's hero - fourballs - in the format Sergio Garcia, who played with Alex Noren.
Boggy and two double fronts led the Spanish and Swedish in nine, and they were not even close to getting out of it.
On Sunday, however, there is no one to help.
It’s so exciting to watch nearby for couple interaction, watch what advice they give, and don’t, and how strategy can instantly change the situation.
Europe has so far played better as a team, and it is under far-reaching last day, but the foursome format showed that the US team is determined to fight, which many, especially Stateside, have doubted.
the European Raider Cup 's Last Day
The European team will start the last day of the Raider Cup with a pleasant leadership after Saturday's \"fourball\" and \"foursome\" competitions ended under 10-6 against the United States.
The inspired couple, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, were led by two victories over the hard-working Tiger Woods, which increased the number of points in Le Golf National to four.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, in order to preserve the trophy lost by Hazeltine two years ago, dominated over the inaccurate American team in the form of morning football, and the result of the series became 3-1.
In the United States, more intensely opposed to foursomes, winning two matches, but failed to eliminate the deficit.
The Jim Furyk team needs 8 points on Sunday in 12 singles to save the trophy.
I have a lot of friends, but I don’t know what to do.
In the format of Patrick Reed and Patrick Reed, they later defeated the tired Wood and American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with an even more sensitive score of 5&4.
It’s not always easy, but it’s important to know what you’re looking for.
Justin Rose returned to partner Henry Stenson and foursomes to defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka in 2 & 2nd place in the world rankings.
Europe failed to fully achieve its goal, although the day in the southwest of Paris was pleasant and blowing light breeze.
The three-time winner of the most prestigious golf competition, Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, set the benchmark for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They extorted 2&1 against Spain's John Rahm and Ian Poulter, fourballs, and returned later to defeat Polter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 foursomes, after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Raider Cup, the team has played 4 points in deficit units only twice, but as owners, the Farika (Furyk) team is enough only with an undistinguished result to save the trophy.
After being in the second place for two days, as it looks, the Sunday counter-attack will be problematic.
North Korea has announced that \"in no case\" will be unilateral, untrusted
The North Korean Foreign Minister on Saturday informed the United Nations that the continuation of sanctions has deepened its distrust of the United States, and North Korea will in no case unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho informed the World Organization's annual General Assembly last year that North Korea has taken \"important good will steps, such as the cessation of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of a nuclear test ground and the promise of never spreading nuclear weapons and technology.
“But we don’t see the appropriate US response,” he said.
“If there is no trust in the United States, there will be no faith in the security of our country, and under such circumstances we will never unilaterally disarm the first.”
Although Ri reiterated North Korea’s well-known accusations of Washington’s opposition to a “gradual” approach to denuclearization that would reward Korea for the gradual steps, his statement left the impression that it did not automatically reject unilateral denuclearization, as Phenjana had done before.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
North Korea has attempted to formally end the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has declared that it must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also not accepted the call to ease the serious international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
“The United States insists that denuclearization must be the first to raise the level of pressure from sanctions in order to achieve the goal of power, even in opposition to the declaration of the end of war,” Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions could push us on the roads is empty fantasies by the lolo people who don’t know about us.
However, the problem is that the continuation of sanctions only deepens our distrust –
It was not about the intention of a second meeting of Kim with Trump, which the US leader had specifically mentioned when he spoke to the United Nations this week.
In his speech, the Minister highlighted three meetings of Kim with South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months, adding: “If the other half of this denuclearization would have been South Korea, not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have been in such a impasse.”
However, the tone of the speech was dramatically different from what he said last year when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea’s missile deployment to the U.S. mainland was inevitable after Mr. Trump had called Kim “the missile,” a suicide mission.
This year, in the United Nations, Trump, who was threatened last year – and completely destroyed – North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps towards disarmament, but stressed that much remains to be done and sanctions should be maintained until North Korea denuclearizes.
It’s important to remember that you can’t do anything.
China and Russia stress that the UN Security Council should reward Phenjana for what has been done.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: \"The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must be pursued vigorously, without making mistakes until final and convincing denuclearisation is achieved.\"
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions since 2006 in an attempt to achieve the depletion of funding for the Phenjana nuclear and ballistic weapons programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and then announced that he would visit Phenjana again next month to prepare the second meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip was not successful.
He left Phenjana in July, saying progress had been made, but North Korea accused him of \"gangster-worthy demands\" in just a few hours.
North Korea's meeting with Mun this month committed itself to dismantling a landfill and also a nuclear facility if the US takes \"appropriate measures\" to:
According to him, Kim had informed him that “the appropriate measures that North Korea wants to see are security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard University students will learn the subject of how to relax enough
A new subject at Harvard University this year has found that students sleep more, and it is an attempt to turn against the increasingly popular brutality culture, which includes a caffeine-filled study through the night.
A teacher discovered that students at the world’s best universities often don’t even have basic knowledge of how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, as well as Brigham and Women's Hospital, a specialist developed a subject that he considers to be the first subject of this kind in the United States.
Inspiration to create a new subject for him arose after a speech about the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
“At the end, a girl came to me and asked, “Why do I tell it only now that I’m in the last course?”
She found that no one ever explained to her how important sleep was, which surprised me, he told Telegraph.
This year, for the first time, the subject is presented, provides students with basic information on how good sleep habits contribute to learning and sport, as well as improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the University reported that the university decided to introduce a course after learning that students suffer from a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The hour-long training process includes a series of interactive tasks.
One of the parts is a dorm door image, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how performance in sports is affected by lack of sleep and the importance of bedtime routine.
In another part, students are informed about how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then the student campus card with interactive icons invites participants to reflect on their daily routine.
“We know that it will not immediately change students’ behaviour.
However, we believe that they have the right to know. Just as you have the right to know how smoking will affect your health,” said Professor Cheisler.
He said that a culture that is proud of its ability to learn all night still exists, adding that modern technology and growing pressure on students meant that lack of sleep became an increasingly serious problem.
He explained that providing enough quality sleep should be a secret weapon for students to combat stress, overwork, and anxiety, and even to prevent weight gain as lack of sleep turns their brains off in fasting mode, making them constantly hungry.
This is the first time I’ve been in a relationship with you.
He said that the subject of the study had opened his eyes and inspired him to make the course available to the entire student town.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask students who obtain postgraduate education to learn a similar program before going to enjoy competition.
Professor Čeisler recommends that students install an alarm not only when they get up, but also when they go to sleep, and keep in mind how people are hurt by blue lights – emitted by electronic device screens and LED lamps, as they can disrupt the rhythms of the day, making it difficult for them to fall asleep.
“Livingston 1 - 0”Rangers: Menga gates overtakes the men of Gerard
“Rangers were another fun game in guests when Dolly Menga hit Steven Gerrard’s confused team decided to lose 1-0 to Livingston.
“Ibrox – the team hoped to win the first outing since February 4:1 – St Johnstone – but Gary Holt’s team lost him in 18 games since he became a club manager, and his team is 8 points away from Scottish championship leader – Hearts.”
Menga kicked the ball seven minutes before the end of half-time, and the lack of inspiration at Ranger didn’t look like an attempt to smooth out the result.
“Rangers fall to sixth place, while Livingston climbs to third place, and only Hibernian beats them in terms of gate differences.
And “Rangers” may have another problem, as Judge Assistant Calum Spence needed medical help because of a head injury, apparently caused by an object thrown from the distant end.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
But Holt used the same “Livingston,” 11 players who took “Heart,” one point last week, and he would be glad that his well-dressed team repressed opponents in every episode.
Rangers may have managed the ball more often, but Livingston used what they were doing better.
They had to score a goal just two minutes after Menga's first hand sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the center's player missed his chance.
Then a long-distance free kick from Keaghan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his partner in defense Alan Lithgow was able to send the ball only far past the rear pole.
“Ranger took control, but it seemed that the last third of the game was expected, rather than believed, that it would happen.
Alfredo Morelos undoubtedly believed that he had to make a sentence in 15 minutes after he had encountered Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian call.
“Rangers did only two beats in the first half of the year, but the former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly didn’t bother either, or Lassana Coulibaly hit with his head, or the modest end of the Ovie Ejaria attack.
Although Livingston might have changed the game’s course in the 34th minute, no one can deny that they deserve it for their own efforts.
“Ranger, it wasn’t enough to deal with Jacobs’ planned long combination again.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept the balance and chose Menga for a simple ending.
In the end, Jerard replaced Kulibali with Ryan Kent, and it almost immediately affected the game, as the half-guard sent the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelli from his line immediately dropped to block.
However, Livingston continued to make guests play as they like when Litgov and Halket hit one long after another.
The Holt team would have been able to continue the leadership in the final stage, but McGregor played well by stopping Jacobs before Litgov struck his head from the corner.
“Rangers, Glenn Middleton, demanded another blow in late play, after having faced Jacobs, but Tomson ignored the demand again.
Almanah: Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now the page of our Sunday Morning almanaha: On September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today... one day in Germany Johannes Wilhelm-Hans-Geger, who grew up as a physicist, was born.
Geiger developed a method for determining and measuring radioactivity, as a result, after all, was a device known as the Geiger counter.
In fact, it’s not always easy to find a way out of this situation.
The man said, \"What, by iodine, and that's it -
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you apply these headsets, you will be able to hear the functioning of atoms that are released due to the radioactivity of these minerals.
Evans: “Truly, it’s really a bit of a mouth.”
“Hanss, Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention, named after him, continues to live.
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system – see, evil cells
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to see evil cells and kill them
As part of vaccine therapy, teaches the immune system to recognize evil cells
Using this method, immune cells are obtained from the patient, which are transformed into a laboratory
They would then be able to see the protein characteristic of many malignant tumours and will be injected back into the body.
The test vaccine has shown promising results in patients with various types of malignancies.
A woman who was treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognise evil cells experienced that her ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method is to extract cells from the patient’s immune system, convert them into laboratory to be able to see several tumours of the HER2 protein, and then inject them back into the body.
The US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland Professor Jay Berzofsky said: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.
HER2-promotes the growth of several types of malignant tumours, including breast, ovarian, lung and colon and rectum cancer, Professor Berzovskis explained.
A similar approach when the patient acquires immune cells, which are taught how to attack malignant tumour cells, has been affected by one type of leukaemia.
It’s not that I don’t know what to do, but that’s what I’m saying.
It did not end well
Kanje West was drawn out during a show at Saturday Night Live after an incoherent performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and announced that he would stand for the 2020 presidential election.
After completing the third song of the night titled Ghost Town, during which he wore the Make America Great hat, he began to brew loud phrases about the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“So many times when I talk to white people, they ask, “How can you like Trump?
Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago, he said.
“Saturday Night Live” began with parody with Matt Damon in the lead role, where the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate Committee on Justice for the accusation of sexual assault by Christine Blasey ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the material with Vesta's pity on social networks was loaded by the comedian Chris Rock.
It is not clear whether Rock tried to laugh at Vest.
And West regretted the viewers for being mistreated behind the scenes because of his headcart.
“They laughed at me behind the scenes!
They said, \"Don't go out with that hat in your head.\"
They laughed at me!
And they said that I had lost touch with reality,” West said, according to Washington Examiner.
The West continued: “You can see what happens when you lose touch with reality, and promised to put on your Superman settlement, because it means you can’t tell me what to do. Want the world to move forward?
Try Love
“Variety – reported that his comments caused the spectators’ whistles at least twice, but the members of the show’s team looked confused, and at least one person told the press release: “The studio had complete silence,”
The wedding was recently invited to replace the singer Ariana Grande, who had died a friend rapper Max Miller a few days ago.
I love it, which he performed in the costume of a champagne bottle.
The wedding was supported by the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “For one of the strongest people in the spirit: I’m happy to say that you don’t want to go to the park.
However, talk show director Karen Hunter on Twitter wrote that West simply was what he was, and that’s wonderful.
“But I choose not to reward a person (buying his music or clothes, or supporting his art), who I believe supports and bars with an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And we, too, she added.
Before this show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name by saying that he has now become \"a thing previously known as Kanji Vestu\"
He is not the first artist to change his name and acts like Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, was previously Snoop Lion, and, of course, the legend of late music, Prince, changed his name with a symbol, but then to a “scene artist, previously known as Prince.”
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.

The appeal will be dealt with by the Public Prosecution Service.
“Tron Games – Star Kit Herington turns against toxic manhood
Kit Herington is known as the sword-cancerer John Snow HBO in the cruel medieval fantasy series \"Tron Games\"
However, the 31-year-old actor has turned to the stereotype of the brutal hero, saying that such characters often make young boys think they should be strong to be respected.
In conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kitt explained that he thought he had a problem and asked the question of how to deal with toxic manhood in the #MeToo era.
The other, who recently married his Rose Leslie partner Rose Leslie, 31, admitted that this problem was important to him.
“I can’t stop thinking about what mistakes we’ve made with a man,” he said.
“What we teach young men in this aspect of the problem when they grow up in light of the present problem,”
Others believe that television with its very masculine characters may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity.
He continued: “What is innate, but what is taught?
What is taught on TV and the streets that make young boys feel that they need to be perceived as men?
In my opinion, this is one of the most important questions of our time: how can we change this?
Because young men have clearly encountered problems –
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in any continuation or pegway of the Game of Thrones, after the series ended next summer, stressing that “the battlefields and horses are tired.”
From November, Kitts will play the main role in the renewed Sam Shepard-True West, a story about a film producer and his brother’s robber.
The actor recently admitted that he considered his meeting with his wife, Rose, to be the best thing that happened to him as a result of the \"Tron Games\".
“I met my wife on this show, because in a way it provided my current family and my life from that moment on,” he said.
It’s a great way to make sure that you’re on the right track.
The couple saluted in June 2018 in the possession of Leslie’s family in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced that the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS has increased sharply by 14%.
Health officials report that more than 820,000 people have been affected in the country.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases were the result of sexual intercourse, indicating changes.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China due to transfusion of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has fallen almost to zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people living in China with HIV and AIDS has increased to 100,000 a year.
The transmission of HIV through sexual intercourse is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but it is said that discrimination against LGBT people is common.
In view of national conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have had sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many cases of sexually transmitted diseases are the result of underprotected sex in this relationship.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of measures to address the problem.
Maxin Waters denies that the employee has leaked the data of Republican senators, has turned against “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
The Democratic Democratic in Los Angeles insisted that claims are distributed by the right-wing all-newsman and websites.
“A lie, a lie, and even more disgusting lies,” Watersa said in a statement on Twitter.
It is reported that the leaked information includes residence addresses and telephone numbers belonging to the US Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch from Utah.
The information online appeared on Thursday, it was published by an unknown person from Congress, at a time when the Senate group heard about the accusations made by Bret Kaveno, nominated by the Supreme Court, that he was sexually impeccable.
The leak occurred some time after three senators had interviewed Chaven.
Conservatives, websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the origin of the records was linked to the Waters Office and revealed information about the Waters staff, Hills said.
“This unfounded statement is absolutely false and completely false,” Watersa insisted.
“A staff member whose identity, personal information and security are compromised by this fraudulent and false claim shall in no way be liable for any leakage of information.
This unfounded statement is absolutely false and is a complete lie.
The Waters announcement soon sparked criticism online, including criticism by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This is an angry denial,” Fleischer wrote.
\"This leads to the conclusion that her temperament does not correspond to a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, he must not be angry.
He must not be a soldier.
He must not speak of the defendant's motives.
He needs to be calm and calm
The task of Fleischer was to compare the reaction of Waters with the democratic fall of Judge Chaveno, who was accused of being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
If you’re looking for a job, you’ll be able to find a job.
“It’s very true, if you’re true,” he wrote.
In her statement, Waters informed her office that she had warned the responsible official and law enforcement bodies about these fraudulent allegations.
“We will ensure that those responsible will be revealed,” she continued, “and that they will be held legally liable for all of their works that are destructive and dangerous to any of my staff.”
“Jonny Anglis 3 – a review – Rovan Atkinson’s parody about spy movies left in the hemisphere
It has become customary to look for associations with Brexit in every new film with British flavor, and this seems to apply to this which has revived, the adventure comedy franchise of Johnny English, which began in 2003 with \"John England\" and was born with a bird in 2011 with \"John England\"
Do we have a new export opportunity for our nation, if we are teethed by ourselves, how hopelessly we are?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny Anglis with hung eyes and an unusually moving face has the right to create a mile after the second resuscitation – his name more than anything else signals that he is a broad-spectrum comic character developed in areas where consumers do not speak English.
He is, of course, the stupid secret agent who, despite his strange claims to charming sophistication, is a little Cluzo, a little Mr. Bin, and a little salty guy playing one note at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games.
He is also based on the traveler’s and international, incomprehensible character, which Atkinson once portrayed in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads where he left chaos on his way.
There are at least one or two nice moments in the youngest adventure of Johnny England.
I liked the place where Johnny Anglis goes to the helicopter dressed in medieval armor, and the propeller's blades are kicking away for a moment against his helmet.
Atkinson’s imagery of comic impressions is well visible, but humor is rather weak and strange superficial, especially because “seriously, film brands like “007” and “Unable mission” themselves use comedy with confidence as one of the ingredients.
The Humor gives the impression that it is designed for children rather than adults, and in my opinion, the absurd fates of Johnny England are not as creative and purposeful as the tricks of Atkinson’s memoirs in the skin of Bin.
As a rule, everything is based on the fact that the United Kingdom has got into a serious trap.
Cyberhacker has broken into the UK's super secret spy internet network, revealing the identities of all British agents in the area, disliked an active agent, a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the Prime Minister, for the pompous and conflict-seeking person who has already lost full political popularity: Emma Tomsone does what he can, with Teresa Maya partially similar character, but there is not much in the scenario to work with.
Her intelligence advisors say that since all active spyes have been revealed, she will have to call someone who has already retired.
And this man is insane Johnny Anglis, who now works as a teacher at a fine educational institution, and obediently teaches how to work as a secret agent (a pair of fun jokes), because Anglis offers to master the profession of spy from the very foundations.
The coal is brought back to Wyoth's extraordinary meeting and is combined with his former numerous victim assistant Bo, also played this time by Ben Miller.
Bo is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, a fun character who only becomes important at the end of the film, a role in which Vicki Pepperdine is not fully exploited.
And so Batman and Robin have come back to the secret service of Her Highness and meet Olga Kurylenko, the beautiful woman of fate, Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, Prime Ministers are dangerously surrounded by a charismatic technology billionaire, evil Jason Walt, who is portrayed by Jack Lacy, and he claims to be able to solve the British computer cache.
Anglis and Bo begin their wild fun odyssey: masked by the officials, they ignite a fine French restaurant; they create confusion hidden in the Volta luxury yacht; and Anglis causes absolute chaos, trying to use virtual reality on the head display to get acquainted with the interior of the Volta building.
It's all done for the end, but no matter how attractive and crazy the movie is, it has a lot of children's TV elements.
A lot of moderate elements.
As with other Johnny Angli films, can I not wonder whether the British film industry could give Rovan Atkinson a role that would fully exploit his talent?
The Labour Party denies plans that the British will work four days a week, but will receive a five-day salary
The Labour Party is going to discuss a radical plan, according to which the British will work four days a week, but will receive a salary of five.
It is reported that the party wants business leaders to give the workers savings through the artificial intelligence revolution, giving them another holiday.
In this case, employees will be able to enjoy a three-day long weekend, while receiving the same salary as before.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
The transition to a four-day working week has been supported by the Trade Union Congress, which considers it an opportunity for workers to benefit from economic change.
One of the top representatives of the Labour Party reported to the Sunday Times: “It is expected that changes in policy will be announced by the end of this year.
“This will not happen in one day, but the four-day working week is an idea that is in line with the party’s goal of balancing the economy for the workers, as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea because the Green Party promised to implement the four-day working week already in the 2017 general election campaign.
But the Labour Party, as such, does not support this desire at the moment.
The Labour Party spokesman said: “Four days’ working week is not part of the party’s politics, and the party does not consider it.”
The Minister of Shadows John McDonnell used a Labour Conference last week to give his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonald explained that he was determined to take power for the mass of directors and for the speculators of public service companies.
The shadow cabinet minister’s plan also means that the existing average stockholders in water companies will not be able to recover their entire package, as the Labour Government could implement – a deduction – due to the unfairness allowed.
He also approved plans to include employees in company boards and set up Ownership Funds to allocate 10% of the private sector capital to employees who would receive up to £500 each year in dividends.
Lindsey Grem and John Kennedy answer, 60 Minutes, or FBI investigation in Chaveno could change their mind
The investigation of the charge against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question whether the finding of the office could lead a Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview on Sunday, the programme's 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley interviewed Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham about whether the FBI could reveal something that would make them change their mindset.
Kennedy left the impression of a more open man than his South Carolina colleague.
“Yes, of course,” said Kennedy.
“I said, addressing the hearing procedure, I said that I had spoken to Judge Chaven.
I called him after it happened when the charge became known and asked, \"Did you do this?\"
He was determined, direct and unambiguous –
However, Grem’s vote is apparently stoned.
“I’ve made a decision about Bret Chaven, and there will be a destructive charge,” he said.
\"Dr. Forda, I don't know what happened, but I know that's what Bret decidedly denied,\" added Grem, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
\"And none of her names could confirm it.
The event is 36 years old.
I don't think any changes are expected --
What is the World Citizens' Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the World Citizens' Festival will be held in New York, an annual music event with impressive number of stars and equally impressive mission: to reduce global poverty.
This is the seventh year of the festival, tens of thousands of people will attend the World Citizens' Festival, which will gather in the Great lawn of the Central Park, not only to enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson, the rapper Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of the event, which is the end of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an event created by the Global Poverty Project, which hopes to end poverty by attracting more and more people who are actively fighting against poverty.
In order to receive a free ticket for this event (unless there was a wish to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors to the concert had to perform a number of tasks, such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a world leader, making a phone call or other important action to promote awareness of the end of poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen movement been, for which 12 more years have passed?
Is the idea of a free concert award a good way to convince people to act, or is it just another case of so-called cliquevism, when people think they can really influence anything by signing an online petition or sending a Twitter message?
The Global Citizen movement claims that since 2011 it has registered more than 19 million actions, from its supporters, in an effort to achieve different objectives.
It notes that these actions have helped global leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group referred to 390 commitments and notifications resulting from its activities for which at least USD 10 billion has already been paid or financed.
The group estimates that so far, nearly 649 million people worldwide have been directly affected by the funds allocated.
Some of the key commitments include “The Power of Nutrition”, a UK-based partnership between investors and implementers committed to helping children grow up in full, promising to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end the country’s under-eating after receiving more than 4700 Twitter messages from the world’s citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, governments of other countries, and citizens of the world like you, we can leave a poor diet in the history of social injustice,” Tracy Ullman, a spokeswoman for The Power of Nutrition, told a crowd in a April 2018 concert in London.
The group also mentioned that after more than 5000 measures were taken to encourage the UK government to provide mothers and children with better nutrition, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will provide nutrition for 5 million women and children.
Answering one of the most frequently asked questions on your website – “What makes you think we can end extreme poverty”
“Global Citizen” commented: “It will be a long and long road where we will kneel and fail at times.
However, just as the great civil rights and anti-aparteid movements before us have done, we will also succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janell Monáe are some of the artists to perform at this year's event in New York, led by Deborr-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use a military fleet to block Russian energy exports, Interior Minister says
“If necessary, Washington can use its military fleet to prevent Russia from entering the market, including the Middle East,” said US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia’s activities in Syria – especially in places where it operates as part of the legitimate government’s call – are an excuse for exploring new energy markets.
“I think the reason why it is located in the Middle East is that it wants to deliver energy in the same way it does in Eastern Europe, in the southern part of Europe,” he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
“The United States, through its military fleet, can make sure that the maritime routes are open, and if necessary block them so that Russia cannot bring its own energy to the market,” he said.
Zinke turned to the public who had come to attend an event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organisation that called itself “the voice of the energy consumer in the United States”.
He compared Washington's approach to addressing the situation in Russia and Iran, indicating that they are actually the same.
“The economic opportunity of Iran and Russia is more or less fuel use and replacement,” he said, referring to Russia as a country whose economy depends primarily on fossil fuels.
It is said that the Trump administration is promoting the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper option for consumers in Europe.
For this reason, Trump’s administration officials and US President Donald Trump himself are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the “non-suitable Nord Stream 2” gas pipeline project, which would make Berlin dependent on Moscow in the words of Trump.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 – a US$11 billion gas pipeline that would double the capacity of the existing gas pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters – is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin believes that Washington’s passionate opposition to the project is simply based on economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we agree that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose a supplier,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after the September meeting with the US Energy Minister in Moscow, Rick Perry.
The United States has expressed its negative position against Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organisation, the German Industrial Federation (BDI), has called on the US to refrain from engaging in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I feel a big problem if a third country intervenes in our energy supply,” Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Industry, said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabete Warren will seriously consider her candidacy for the 2020 presidential election
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
During the Council meeting in Holioka, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering running for presidential elections.
“It’s time that there are women in Washington who “relieve” the imperfect government, which also means the woman-president, as reflected in The Hill.
“After November 6, I will carefully consider my candidacy for the US presidential election.”
During the Council meeting, Warren referred to President Donald Trump, claiming that he “led the country in the wrong direction”
“I’m worried about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy,” she said.
Warren has openly criticized Trump and his selected Supreme Court candidate Bret Kaveno.
In Friday's Twitter report, Warren said: \"Of course, the FBI needs an investigation before the elections.
However, a survey published on Thursday revealed that the majority of Vorenees do not believe that she should stand for the 2020 elections.
According to the results of the University of Sufolk’s Center for Political Studies/Boston Globe survey, fifty-eight percent of the potential voters in Massachusetts claimed that the senator should not stand for elections.
Thirty-two percent supported this decision.
The results of the survey revealed that former Governor Deval Patrick had received more support, with 38 per cent for election and 48 per cent against.
In the context of a possible candidate for the 2020 elections, the names of high-profile Democratic party actors, such as former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont, Childy Sanders, appear.
The Associated Press reported that Biden was committed to providing a formal decision by January.

On Monday evening, he was arrested and accused of domestic violence.
“To whom my own son passes through, to whom he passes after return, I can extend to other families who are faced with the consequences of PTSD and some of the dose vulnerabilities that our soldiers return to,” she told the public at Donald Trump’s headquarters in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
He called his arrest “an obvious problem that everyone pretends to be unseen” and said about his son and other war veterans that “they return a little differently, they return fortuitously, they return to wonder if what their fellow soldiers and pilots, as well as all the other members of the military, have given to that country,” he said.
According to the Vasily Police Department spokesman Den Bennett, he was arrested on Monday in Vasily, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman and of holding a weapon while intoxicated.
18 states, Colombian region faces challenges for new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia support a legal challenge for a new US policy that denies asylum to refugees fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
This 18-state and Colombian district representatives in Washington on Friday presented a brief presentation to the court counsel to support asylum seekers faced with the obstacles created by the policy, NBC News reported.
The applicant’s full name in Grace v. Sessions, which was launched by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy in August, was not revealed.
She claimed that her partner – and the sons of a member of his violent gang – abused her, but US officials rejected her asylum request on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
State attorneys who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, many of whom come from US asylum seekers, as countries where gangs and domestic violence are common.
The new US asylum policy changed the decision of the Immigrant Appeals Council in 2014, allowing undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
On Friday, the Prosecutor General of Colombia, Karl Racin, announced that the new policy “gives attention to the national, federal and international laws introduced by the Decades.”
“The federal law provides that all asylum applications are dealt with on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the claim in question, and such an obstacle violates this principle,” the court counsellor said in a brief statement.
In addition, the lawyer said in his statement that policies that prevent immigrants from entering the country are detrimental to the U.S. economy, as these immigrants are likely to become entrepreneurs and \"secure the necessary workforce\",
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions addressed immigration judges with a request to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang abuse.
“Shelter is available to persons who leave their homeland for the sake of persecution or fear associated with their race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion,” he said in a statement on the policy side of June 11.
Asylum has never been designed to solve all the problems, even all the serious problems that people face every day around the world.
The desperate rescue efforts in Palu, doubling the number of survivors in the search process
For those who survived, the situation became more and more difficult.
“The situation is very tense,” said the 35-year-old Rise Movement, comforting her hectic baby in the center of the devastation of the destroyed city of Palu.
“Every minute the emergency medical service brings new victims.
Clean water is a deficit
The people were seen returning to their destroyed homes and extolling the water-boiling possessions in an effort to save everything that was found.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals affected by the 7.5-magnificence earthquake were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had a broken spine and shoulder, slept outside the Paleo Army Hospital, where patients were being cared for by the constant strong afterslaughter.
In his eyes tears would form, remembering how the strong earthquake began to shake the fifth floor hotel room where he was with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save.
I seem to have been printed into wall ruins,” Harry told Associated Press, citing his family had come to the city for a wedding.
“I heard my wife call for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they are safe.
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of Intimidating Attempts With Propaganda Advertising
A week after the official Chinese newspaper launched a four-page ad, emphasizing the mutual benefits of US-China trade daily, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to the bill paid by China Daily in the Des Moines Register, accusing China of trying to intervene in the U.S. Congress on November 6, but China denies it.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to intervene in the US election marked what US officials told Reuters, a new phase of Washington’s growing campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is quite normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a growing trade war, resulting in a series of tariffs on each other's imports.
At the beginning of the trade war, China’s repressive tariffs were directed against exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported the Trump Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
Terri Branstad, US ambassador to China and former long-term governor of Iowa, a major agricultural exporter to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote his opinion for the Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register, claiming that China now doubles this intimidation by placing propaganda ads in our own free press.
“By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses its tradition of freedom of speech and free press to its advantage America by placing paid advertising on the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
\"In contrast, here in the usual Beijing news kiosk, you will find a limited amount of different views and you will not see such a real reflection of the different views that the Chinese people may have as a result of China's worrying economic trajectory, given that the media are here under the strict supervision of the Chinese Communist Party,\" he wrote.
He said: “One of China’s most influential newspapers avoided publishing his article, but he did not mention who the newspaper was.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
Since many leading Republicans support and defend the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, against whom several allegations of sexual violence have been made, analysts have warned that they will experience a negative reaction in the upcoming mid-term elections, especially from women.
The emotions associated with this have been extremely high, and it can be seen that most Republicans have already been ready to give their vote.
Such cases cannot be withdrawn,” Grant Reeher, professor of politics at the University of Syracuse, told The Hill, Saturday.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday. They will not forget it tomorrow or November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and state spokeswoman for the progressive movement MoveOn, according to the Washington newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters in the Senate hall sang demonstratively “November is coming” when Republicans under the authority of the Judicial Committee chose to continue with the nomination of Chaveno despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be very high,” independent political analyst Stu Rothenberg told the news portal.
“People say it’s on a high level, that’s true.
However, it could be even higher, especially among suburban volatile voters and younger voters (aged 18 to 29), who often do not go to elections even if the president does not like it.
Even before Forda’s public testimony, in which she made claims about sexual violence on the part of the candidate for the position of the Supreme Court, analysts mention possible failure if Republicans would continue to raise this candidacy.
“This Republican Party has become a messy chaos,” Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee’s vote or the final vote, or about whether Caveno will be convicted, it’s also about how Republicans have dealt with the situation and how they treated it,” Guy Cecil, the director of Priority USA, told the news channel, who heads the group that is helping to elect Democrats.
However, it seems that the Americans are slightly divided in relation to who to believe in the testimony of Ford and Caveno, a little more inclined to believe in the latter.
The new YouGov survey shows that 41 per cent of respondents are likely to believe in Ford’s testimony, while 35 per cent are likely to believe in Kaveno’s testimony.
In addition, 38 percent claimed that Caveno may have lied about his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
The Guardian reported that, following Fleik’s encouragement, the FBI is currently investigating claims made by Ford, as well as at least one other defendant, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week, Forda showed in the Senate Justice Committee that Kaveno had committed a sexual attack against him at the age of 17.
Ramireza claims that during his studies in Yala in the 1980s, the candidate for the position of a judge of the Supreme Court has shown her his genitals at a party.
The global web inventor plans to launch a new Internet to take over Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, a global web inventor, is launching a project that could compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project “Inrupt” is a company based on the Childers-Lee open source platform “Solid”
“Solid – allows users to choose where their data is stored and what people are allowed access to some information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company- Berners-Lee joked that “Inrupt-hidden intention is to dominate the world.”
“We need to do this now,” he said about the start-up.
“This is a historic moment,”
The app uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own personal online data storage, or PTD.
It may include contact lists, lists of works to be done, calendar, music library, as well as other personal and professional tools.
This is like if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available in the same browser at the same time.
The personal online data repository is unique in that only the user determines who and what kind of information can be accessed.
The company refers to it as \"personal authority through the use of data\"
According to John Bruce, the company’s CEO, Inrupt, the idea is to provide the company with resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently operates a security platform purchased by Berner-Lee, Bruce, IBM, some freelance developers engaged in the project, and a voluntary coding community.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world could build their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
He and his team don’t talk to Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change, turning all their business models around overnight.
“We are not asking for their permission,”
In an article published on Saturday by the Medieval Platform, Bernerss-Lee mentioned that “Inrupt-mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web based on Solid.”
In 1994, Burner-Lee transformed the Internet by setting up a Global Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had an influential opinion in discussions on net neutrality.
Even after the launch of Inrupt, Burners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the Global Web Consortium, the Global Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I am truly optimistic about this new web era,” said Burners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Marking of the Victorian Cross for the clergy during World War 1
For 100 years in its hometown, the event is celebrated when the only clergyman of the Church of England has received the Victoria Cross during the First World War as a fighter.
Lt-Col Bernard Ven received this award on 29 September 1918 in connection with the Bellengly and Lehaucort attack.
However, four days later, he was killed by a sniper, so he did not know about the highest British military award.
Saturday appeared in Rašden, Northamptonshire, his two grandsons revealed a memorial stone dedicated to him.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, mentioned that it was “excellently symbolic” that such a stone was discovered just 100 years after his grandfather had received an important award.
According to the London Gazette newspaper, on September 29, 1918 Lieutenant Colonel Ven led his battalion across Canal de Saint-Quentin through large fires caused by heavy fog and gun and machine guns.
He later rushed to the shooting line and, with the greatest certainty, led the line forward before taking over the cannon zone, where he defeated three groups.
Lt-Col. Vene was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Ven (72) said that his grandfather's actions were \"something I would never be able to do, and which at the same time is also a very humble act.\"
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid the crown on Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Wen argued that he felt “honored in this debt” and said that “the value of a true hero is demonstrated by the support of many people.”
It is not just a matter of time, but also of time.
Imagine spending the whole night in front of you to see Bellator 206, but at the end you are denied viewing this major event.
In San Jose there were 13 battles, including six on the main map, which were broadcast live all night long on United Kingdom Channel 5.
At 6:00 p.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to stand against each other, the audience in the United Kingdom was pleasantly surprised by the replacement of the transmission to Peppu.
Some had a real misunderstanding when they were awake all night until early morning, waiting for the battle.
A fan on Twitter described the change of transmission to children's cartoon as \"unlucky jokes\"
“The government has determined that after 6 p.m. this type of content is not acceptable, so the switchover to the children’s program took place,” Dave Schwartz explained, “Bellator is the oldest vice president in marketing and communication.
“Pepa pig,” yes
“Bellator” President Scott Coker said he would be working on schedule planning to allow viewers in the UK to see these broadcasts.
“When we think about repeating the transmission, I think we’ll be able to solve it somehow,” Koker said.
“But the clock is there six in the morning on Sunday, and we will not be able to solve this problem until Sunday after our time and Monday after their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, after switching the transmission appeared a lot of texts, and they were not positive.
We tried to prevent it because we thought it was a technical failure.
But that wasn't the case, it was controlled by the government.
I can promise you that there will be no such problem next time.
We will stick to five battles, not six (as it has been so far). We tried to please fans, but we tried too hard.
This is a failure –
“Desert Island Discs: Tom Deilly doesn’t feel good enough because of his sexuality
The Olympic diver Tom Daley claims that he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality, but this motivated him to succeed.
A 24-year-old man did not realize that “not everyone is like me, until he attended high school.
While visiting Radio 4's first \"Desert Island Discs\", led by Loren Laverne, he mentioned that he started talking about homosexual rights to give others hope.
He also mentioned that becoming a parent made him less worried about winning the Olympics.
The permanent manager of the long-term programme, Kirsty Young, has left several months of rest due to the disease.
As he appeared to be excluded from the society in Laverne’s first program, Deilly said he felt less valuable than others as he grew up, because “in the society it was not assumed that girls and boys could like it.”
He said: “Until today I feel that I am not as good as others, or that I am different, there has been a key driver that has given me strength and endurance to succeed.”
He said he wanted to prove that there was “something” to prevent people from being disappointed when they finally learned about his sexuality.
The double winner of the Bronze Medal of the Olympic Games has become the leader of the high-level LGBT campaign and used his appearance in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia, calling for even more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he decided to address society because he was happy to live openly and without complications, and wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time World Champion said that falling in love with a man in the US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, “surprisingly unprepared”
Deilius married the 20-year-old Oscar laureate last year, and claimed that age difference was never an obstacle.
“When you’ve gone through so many people at such a low age – (his first Olympic games were 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later) it’s hard to find someone at your age who would have experienced similar peaks and falls.
The couple became parents to their son Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Deilius claimed that he had changed his outlook.
“A year ago, everything that was important to me was getting a gold medal,” he said.
“Do you know what? There are more important things about Olympic gold medals in life.
My Olympic Gold Medal is Robby
His son Robert has the same name as his father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
He said his father did not want to accept his death, and one of the last things he asked for was whether they had tickets for the 2012 London Olympics where he wanted to be in the first row.
“I couldn’t tell him that she wouldn’t be there anymore to be in the first row,” he said.
“I kept his hand until he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing and was dead, I finally recognized that he was not invincible,” he said.
The next year, Deilius took part in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze.
“I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life – to dive in front of the homeowners in the Olympic Games. There was no better feeling than that,” he said.
It also inspired the choice of his first song, Heather Small, which resonated with him on his way to the Olympics and continued to raise the goose.
The Desert Island Discs program is available on BBC Radio 4 Sundays at 11.15 p.m. following British summer time.
It is also important to note that this is not the case in the United States, but in the United States.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday by playing his 47th Rider Cup match, but he will need to change his strategy to avoid a failed turn of events.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
Instead of being at the centre of action, as has been so often the case with US teams, the five-time winner divided his day, acting both as a supporter and participating in his game with the hope of correcting what suppresses him.
Since the 48-year-old golfer has never been the most accurate player even at the top of his career, he is not the most suitable candidate for the stressful Le Golf National fight in a rough field where inaccuracies are regularly punished.
And if the game itself is not frightening enough, on Sunday's ninth match, Mikelson will fight with the exact British Open Championship winner, Francesco Molinari, who has combined forces with the young Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If Americans, who are behind four points when starting 12 single-game matches, are successfully leading, Michelson’s match could be crucial.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
“He was fully aware of his role today, tucked me back, put his hand on me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” said Furik.
“He is very confident in himself.
He is an outstanding athlete who has given so many of these teams earlier and also this week.
I don't think I've ever imagined playing him in two matches.
I imagined more, but everything changed as it turned out, and we'll count on it.
He wants to be out there, like everyone else.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
This could mark the end of the Raider Cup career, which never really coincided with the heights of his individual record.
It’s a great way to make sure that you’re on the right track and that you’re on the right track.
“He is cheerful, sarcastic and witty, he likes to be entertained by people, and he is an excellent member of the team,” he explained.
“I think the youngest players liked to tease him this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives much more than just a game –
It’s a great way to make sure that you’re able to get the best possible results.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
“You continue to remind yourself that we have made a significant contribution to the leadership of Valderrama; we have made progress in the leadership of Brooklyn, where we lost, and Valderrama, where we won, but only with a small majority,” said Bjorn (pictured), watching the 2018 release group’s win with 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, in the leadership of the 10-6 golf course Le Golf National.
So history will show both me and every member of its team that nothing is over.
Tomorrow you will return everything.
Go in the field and show your best performance!
It will not be over until the screen shows the score.
Our goal is to get this trophy and we will focus on it.
I have always said that I am focused on the 12 players who are on our side, but we are very well aware of what is on the other side of us - the world's greatest players -
Easily facilitated by the performance of his players on the golf course, Bjorn added: “I never enjoyed it early.
There are new challenges ahead tomorrow.
Tomorrow designed individual games, and it's a completely different thing.
It’s great if you have a partner alongside you at the moments when everything is going well, but your golfer’s skills are fully tested in individual games.
This message you need to pass on to your players, namely, so that they give themselves everything in the game for the next days.
Now you leave your partner, and also he has to show his best performance –
Unlike Bjorn's opponent team, Captain Jim Furik will make sure that his players show their best performance directly in individual and not partner games. The exception is only Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Fourteen years later, he was arrested and sentenced to death.
“I remember every word condemned,” he said in response to Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 team’s captain, bringing together his players for the last day’s battle.
\"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you'd like to get to the quick hit you've seen in Brooklyn, you've experienced in Medin.
When such a pulse is transmitted in one direction, it creates great pressure in relation to the mid-term games.
We made our own composition accordingly and ranked the guys in the way we felt right.
Thomas was given the task of trying to manage the attack, and he ranked Rory McIlroy as the main game and Europeans Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter in the first part of the list.
“I rank guys in this order because I think it fits best in the course of the tournament,” said Bjorn in terms of the chosen participants.
In addition, it is important to note that in order to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market, Member States should be able to take into account the need to ensure a high level of protection of the interests of consumers.
The German caraflotte's youngest frigate had to be put into service in 2014 to replace the ageing Cold War-time warships, but it would not happen at least until next year due to the incorrect system and rising costs, it reported by local media.
The first half of 2019 was now postponed by the main ship of the Baden-Württemberg Frigate class Rheinland-Pfalz, it reported in the newspaper Die Zeit, citing a military spokesman.
The ship had to join the caraflotte in 2014, but the unpleasant post-supply problems had an impact on the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg class ships ordered by the caraflot in 2007 will replace the outdated Bremen class frigates.
They are expected to be equipped with a powerful gun, a range of anti-air and anti-ship missiles, as well as some secret technologies such as reduced reception of radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other essential features include longer maintenance periods: it should be possible to place new frigates up to two years away from the ports where they are registered.
However, continued delay means that state-of-the-art technology warships, which would allow Germany to demonstrate power in overseas countries, will already be obsolete until the entry into service, according to Die Zeit.
The failed Fregate F125 was visible in all titles last year when the German caraflotte formally refused to put the ship into service and sent it back to the shipbuilder Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time that karaflotte returned to the yard after the ship was delivered.
Little was known about the reasons for this move, but German media reported a number of major software and equipment defects that would make warships invalid if used in a battle mission.
The software shortcomings were a particularly important factor since Baden-Württemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 seafarers, which is only half of the older Bremen class frigate personnel.
Also, it turned out that the ship has too much weight, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of caraflotte to perform its improvements in the future.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is thought to be twice as heavy as the ships of a similar class used by Germany during World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the cost of the whole project (including crew training) has also become a major problem.
It is said that its cost has reached €3.1 billion instead of €2.2 billion initially earmarked.
The problems associated with the new frigates are becoming particularly significant in the light of recent warnings that the German navy is falling.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German Parliament’s Defence Committee, admitted that the caraflotte really “becomes out of use ships.”
The official claimed that over time this problem has been significantly compounded, since old ships are withdrawn from operation, but no new ones are delivered instead.
He regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class had joined the caraflot.
“National Trust” listens to the life of secret bats
The new study, which is being conducted in the Scottish Highland, is aimed at discovering how bats use the landscape in the food search process.
It is expected that the findings will bring new clarity on the unique behaviour of these flying mammals and help in their future protection measures.
Scientists at the Scottish National Trust in Invereves Gardens in Westeros will explore dwarf bats, pygmey bats, as well as brown longhaired and water-snacked bats.
In the main locations, special recorders will be placed in the ownership, which will track the activity of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Sound experts will analyze all records to determine the frequency of bat calls and which species perform specific actions.
A habitat map and a report will then be developed to create a detailed landscape view that reflects the behaviour of bats.
This is the first time I’ve been in the United States since the beginning of the 20th century.
This information will help to identify the benefits of habitat management such as the creation of meadows and how best to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
Over the last century, the bat population in Scotland and the United Kingdom has decreased significantly.
These lands are threatened by construction and development works affecting the loss of bat skiing and residence.
Wind generators and lighting can also pose a risk, as can beous paper and chemical treatment products for some building materials, as well as cat attacks.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, due to their evening hunting habits, their ears during hunting are more useful than the eyes.
They use a complex echo-location method to detect insects and obstacles on their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for over 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of land maintenance across the country, takes the problem of bats very seriously.
The organization has ten trained experts who regularly conduct surveys, check-ups of bats and sometimes even rescue work.
The organization has even set up the first and only special bat reserve in Scotland – Threeve – owned by Damfres and Galway, which hosts eight of the ten bat species in Scotland.
Property Manager David Thompson claims that this area is ideal for bats.
“There’s a great place for bats,” he said.
“We have old buildings, many ancient trees and generally suitable habitat.
However, there are still a lot of things we don’t know about bats, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us better understand what they need to survive –
He stressed that it was important to check that bats were not staying at the site before the property maintenance work was carried out, as it may be possible that up to 400 females and their toddlers may be killed as a result of the unknowing destruction of one of the mother's hiding places, possibly destroying the entire local population.
Bats are protected animals and must not be killed, tortured, disturbed or destroyed by their hiding places.
Elizabeth Ferrell, an employee of the Bat Conservation Trust, has called on the public to help.
She said: \"We still have a lot to learn about bats, and for a number of their species, we just don't know how they go.\"
Ronaldo rejects rape charges by posting lawyers to sue German magazine
Christiano Ronaldo has condemned his accusation of rape as “false news,” claiming that people “want to pay attention to themselves by using his name.
His lawyers have been ordered to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published these claims.
The football star of Portuguese origin and Turin-Juventus is accused of rapeing American woman Catherine Mayor in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
It is claimed that he paid a woman $375,000 to keep her silent about the incident, she told Der Spiegel on Friday.
A few hours after these claims were made, Ronaldo, 33, turned to his 142 million followers via Instagram, calling this \"fake news\" information.
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they claimed today is false news,” said the fifth winner of the Ballon d’Or award.
“They want to be famous with my name.
That's normal.
They want to become famous at the expense of my name, that is part of my work.
I am a happy person, and everything is fine – the player added a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are going to sue the Der Spiegel magazine for the allegations they have made that they are “supposing the provision of unacceptable information on grounds of privacy.”
The lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would claim compensation for \"moral harm to the extent that corresponds to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of a person's rights in recent years -
The incident occurred in June 2009 in the Palms Hotel and Casino – suite class room in Las Vegas.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and had photographs of the injuries she had received in the hospital, but later she agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt “fear of revenge” and worried about “public humiliation.”
A 34-year-old woman claims that she does not want to agree to the terms of this reconciliation anymore, because the incident left a lasting injury.
At the time when these claims were made, Ronaldo was about to move from Manchester United to Real Madrid, but this summer it was 100 million euros to the Italian Grand Juventus.
Breksits: United Kingdom – permanently regretted – the loss of automakers
“The United Kingdom – I regret it forever – if after Brexit it loses its world leadership in automotive production,” said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
They are concerned by the fact that Toyota UK has announced to the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, it will temporarily stop production at the Burnaston plant near Derby.
\"We need an agreement,\" said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker said that a delay at the borders in the case of Brexit could be put on the playing jobs without agreement.
The Burnaston factory, which produces Toyota models Auris and Avensis, produced almost 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“In my opinion, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production in our factory will be stopped,” said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota in Burnastone.
Other UK automakers, including Honda-BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, are concerned about leaving the EU without a contract and how cross-border trade will work.
For example, BMW claims that after Brexit, it will close its mini plant in Oxford for a month.
According to the car manufacturers, the main concern is the supply chain at stake if no agreement is reached after Brexit.
The Toyota production line works on a time-by-time basis, where cars made on order arrive every 37 minutes at parts from both UK and EU suppliers.
If the UK leaves the EU without agreement on 29 March, there could be disruptions at the border, which could lead to some delays and gaps.
According to the company, Toyota would not be able to hold more than a day worth of inventory at its Derbyshire plant, so it would have to stop production.
Mr Clark said that the Chequers withdrawal plan for future relations with the EU, drawn up by Theresa May, was \"precisely calculated to avoid such checks at the border.\"
“We need an agreement. We want to get the best deal that would allow, as I would say, not only to benefit from the present moment, but also to take advantage of this opportunity,” he said in the BBC-Radio 4 program Today.
“The proof not only of this from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers is that we must be able to fully pursue our very successful supply chain strategy.”
Toyota was unable to tell how long production could be stopped, but warned that the increase in long-term costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and ultimately put jobs at risk.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is working at the plant as coordinator of the union, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “From experience, I can say that as soon as a position disappears, it does not return.”
The government spokesman said: \"We have presented an accurate and credible plan for our future relations with the EU.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
Donalda Trump’s important meeting with Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein may be “a further week left” because the fight in relation to the Supreme Court judge’s candidate Bret Kaveno continues, the White House reported on Sunday.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
For months, Trump has been in Washington, D.C. about whether Trump will dismiss the Deputy Prosecutor General and thus undermine Miller's independence.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the recording of the negotiations with Trump and the possibility of renouncing the president with Amendment 25.
Rosenstein denied this information.
However, last Monday he went to the White House, where he had spoken of his resignation.
Instead, a Thursday meeting with Trump was announced, which was then at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Trump said that \"it would probably not forgive Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a collision with the hearing of the Senate Judicial Committee, in which both Chaven and one of the women who accused him of committing sexual misconduct - Dr. Kristine Bleizija Forda.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
Trump press secretary Sarah Sanders visited Fox News Sunday
He said: “The date of the meeting has not yet been set, it could be this week or postponed for another week, taking into account all the cases that are taking place around the Supreme Court.
But this we will see, and I always want to inform the press about the news –
Some reporters challenge this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press release since September 10.
Leader Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of brigades is not associated with a dislike of the TV reporter-the desire of fame, although she added: \"I do not deny the fact that they are the desire of glory.\"
Then she proposed direct contact between Trump, which would increase the interest of the press.
“The president is involved in more questions and answers than any president before him,” she said, adding, without providing further details: “We are interested in their number.”
Sanders said that the blinkings would continue, but “if the press had the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it is certainly better than talking to me.
We are trying to do a lot, and you see that we have done a lot in recent weeks, and it will happen instead of press releases when you can talk to the President of the United States –
Trump regularly answers questions by leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences attended by important persons.
Individual press conferences are rare.
Perhaps the president showed the reason this week in New York, devoting a crowd of reporters to an uncontrollable and sometimes strange expression.
Health Minister writes to EU staff at Scottish NHS on Brexit-related fears
The Minister of Health has written out to EU workers working at the Scottish National Health Service (NHS) to express gratitude and wish for endurance after Brexit.
Jean Freeman sent a letter to the MSP less than six months before the UK's withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to cover the costs of permanent status applications for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In his letter, Frimen wrote: “The negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU continued during the summer on the withdrawal that led to the upcoming decisions this autumn.
However, the UK Government is also preparing for the possible scenario if no agreement is reached.
I know you have a very restless time.
I would therefore like to stress once again, at this point in time, how much I appreciate the involvement of every employee, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues both from within and outside the EU provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and benefit our cared patients and communities.
Scotland is definitely your home, and we really want you to stay here.
After a head injury, Kristen Abercromby has an emergency operation
In Tennessee, Tigers (Christion Abercrombie) had an emergency operation after a head injury, which he won in a Saturday game where 31-27 hit Vanderbilt Commodores, reported to Tennessean, a sports reporter, Mike Organ.
It’s a great way to make sure that you’re getting the best results.
“He came to the side line and said so collapsed,” Rid said.
While Abercrombie was on the sideline, the coaches and medical staff gave him oxygen, then put it on the stretchers and delivered him for further investigation.
A Tennessee official told Nashville, Tennessee WSMV reporter Chris Harris that Abercrombie had been removed from the Medical Center at the University of Vanderbilt.
It’s not always easy, but it’s important to know what to do.
Abercrombie, a representative of the red shirt, is in its first season after the replacement of Ilionis for the Tennessee State team.
It’s a great way to make sure that you’re getting the best results.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher public fee when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher public levy when buying property in the UK and the additional funds obtained will be used to help the homeless under the new Tory plan.
Such a move will neutralize Corbin's efforts to attract new voters.
An increased public levy will apply to persons who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The Treasury provides that up to 120 million pounds may be collected per year to be directed towards the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher state fee when buying property in the UK and transferring the additional resources they have obtained to provide assistance to the homeless, she will today announce Teresa Maya.
This step is seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract new voters with promises to provide housing at more affordable prices and address the wealthiest parts of society.
An increased public levy will apply to people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, adding additional money to the government's efforts to combat the homelessness problem.
The premium included in the current public levy, including the application of a higher level of charges introduced two years ago for the purchase and purchase of a second home for the purpose of renting out, could be up to three percent.
The Treasury expects that such a step can supplement its budget by up to 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the newly built properties in London are purchased by non-residents, thus hitting prices and making it difficult for first-time buyers to get to their homes.
Many of the richest areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become \"popular cities,\" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy was introduced just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the state fee so that more young people can afford to buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices by grabbing the land but not using it, and urged Ms May to give up quotas on affordable housing to address the housing problem in the UK.
Mr Corbin has proposed a series of attractive housing reforms, including a reform on rent control and removal without cause.
He also wants to give councils greater powers for the construction of new housing.
Mrs. Maya said: \"I mentioned last year that I would use my position as Prime Minister to restore Britain's dream, i.e. that every new generation should have a better quality of life.
And that means getting the housing market we've been hit by.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and arrange their lives here.
However, it is not right that housing can be purchased equally easily by foreign companies and non-residents in the United Kingdom, as well as by hard-working British citizens.
For many, the dream of their homes has become too far away, and the harsh problem of homeless people is still urgent.
Jack Ross: “My biggest goal is to lead Scotland.
“Sunderland, head of Jack Ross, says that his goal is to become Scotland’s leader at some point.
Scott, 42, has accepted the challenge of renovating the North-East Club, which currently ranks third in the first league with three points from above.
This summer, he went back to Stadium of Light after taking St Mirren back to Scotland's prime minister last season.
“As a player I wanted to play for my country.
I won the B Cup, and that was all, Ross told the Scottish-BBC transmission Sportsound.
“But I grew up watching Scotland games in Hampden Park with my father, and it’s always calling me back.
However, such an opportunity would only appear if I were successful in managing the club –
The predecessors of Rosa are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former “Alloa Athletic” boss claims that he has not felt upset following the footsteps of such a large club recognized leader, previously rejecting the offers made by Barnsley and Ipswich.
“My success will be assessed right now by whether I can return this club to the prime minister.
It’s a great way to make sure that you don’t have to worry about your health.
“It is not easy to return to the club’s prime minister, but I will probably believe that I will only succeed here once this task has been completed.”
Ross is only in the third year of his career as a manager, previously acting as Deputy Director in Dumbarton and spending a 15-month period in Hearts’ coaching.
He then helped Alloa recover from the fall to the third level and helped St Mirren win the title in the same season.
Ross claims that he feels much more comfortable now than he did during his career in Clubs Clyde--Hartlepool--Falkirk--St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“They may have been a real crossroad,” he recalls, taking responsibility for Alloa.
“I really believed that management was my real call, much more appropriate than playing.
It sounds strange, because I have achieved good success, could live from it, and also enjoy certain heights.
But playing can be difficult.
We have to go through a lot of things every week.
I still feel it because of work-related stress and pressure, but management is my area.
I've always wanted to lead and now I'm doing it. I think I'm in the right place, I haven't felt so good throughout my life --

The survey found that the best time to enjoy the pint is at 5.30 p.m. on Saturday afternoon.
The summer heat wave has caused Britain’s less popular pubs to swell, but this has increased pressure on restaurant chains.
The data collected showed that sales of pubs and bars increased by 2.7 percent in July, but in restaurants they decreased by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, who represents the CGA business advisory agency, which compiled the data, said: “Continuously, the sunny time and the prolonged participation of England in the World Cup meant that in July there was a similar trend as in June, i.e. pub profits increased by 2.8 percent, while restaurants experienced a fall.
The restaurants, whose trade in June fell by 1.8 percent, experienced an even more serious situation in July.
The situation in the pubs and bars was the most grateful, as they experienced a much larger upturn than the restaurants experienced a downturn.
Food-based pubs also suffered from the sun, but not as dramaticly as the restaurant workers felt.
It seemed that people just wanted to go out to a drink.
In pubs and bars, beverage trade grew by 6.6 per cent per month, while food trade decreased by 3 per cent –
RSM Recreation and Hospitality Analyst Paul Newman said: “These results continue the trend observed at the end of April.
Weather conditions and the impact of wide-ranging social or sporting events are the major factors determining the turnover outside the home market.
It is no surprise that restaurant groups continue to fight, although the drop in sales by 4.8 percent compared to the corresponding period of the previous year will be particularly painful for additional constant cost pressures.
With regard to food providers, long and hot summers could not come at an even better time, and time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we usually experience in August will provide the much-needed breath we need.
The overall increase in sales among pubs and restaurants, including in new businesses, reached 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the decline in brand sales.
Coffer Peach Tracker, a UK pub, bar and restaurant sector sales supervisor, collects and analyses data from 47 operating groups with a total turnover of over £9 billion, and this has been incorporated into the industry benchmark.
Every fifth child has a secret social media account that it hides from their parents
The survey reveals that every fifth child, some of whom are just 11 years old, has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rise in fake Instagram pages.
This has raised concerns about the publication of content of a sexual nature.
Twenty percent of students said they had a “key” account to show to their parents.
Each fifth child, some of whom are just 11 years old, creates social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed that the number of false profiles on Instagram's photo sharing site is growing rapidly.
This has raised concerns about the publication of content of a sexual nature.
Twenty percent of students said they had a “clean main” account to show to parents and also private accounts.
One mother, who was a member of her 13-year-old daughter’s secret site, discovered a teenager who encouraged others to rape her.
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent School Managers (HMC), found that 40 percent of 11-18 year olds had two profiles, and only half of them admitted to keeping private accounts.
HMC CEO Mike Buchanan said: “It’s scary that so many teenagers are creating online profiles where parents and teachers can’t find them.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
Doila is Scotland’s most award-winning space and outdoor athlete, and Ian Beattie, President, described this step as a great opportunity for those driven by sport to benefit from her extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Eilide is given immense respect throughout the Scottish, UK and global Athletics community, and we are confident that Scottish Athletics will gain an enormous amount of involvement in their board,” said Beatty.
Doila said: “I want to act as an “easy voice” and I hope that I can really get involved and help guide this sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the 200-meter and 400-meter race at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, thus obtaining a total of four Olympic gold medals, and is now a regular BBC pandite, was unable to pass after a transient ischaemic attack.

It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
The breast milk pump production company has taken care of shared online views in connection with advertising comparing nursing mothers with cow milk.
To mark the release of the so-called “world’s first silent breast pump”, the consumer technology company Elvie released an advertisement for a sticky beard to demonstrate the freedom of the new pump for breastfeeding mothers.
The four real mothers danced in a wall-filled cow-bow at a song whose words read like this: “Yes, I knock myself out, but you don’t see any tail – and if you haven’t noticed them, they’re not udder, they’re my breasts.”
“Sink, suck, feed, suck, suck, suck, suck, I drown my ladies.”
However, advertising posted on the company’s Facebook page has called a wide range of online resonances.
The 77,000-time view and hundreds of-time commentary videos have received shared reviews from viewers, and many argue that this highlights the light of the dairy industry.
“A very wrong decision to use cows for product advertising.
Just like us, they need to become hard and be born to produce milk, but their babies are taken away from them a few days after their birth, someone wrote.
“Elvie – breast milk pump inconspicuously fits into breast-feeding women (Elvie/Mother)
Another commentary states: “I understand that it is traumatic for both mother and baby.
But why not use them to promote a breast-milk pump for mothers who can keep their babies –
It also said: “Advertisers didn’t know what they were doing.”
Others defended the advertisement, and a woman admitted that she thought the song was “exciting”
“I think that’s an excellent idea.
I would buy one if I were still breastfeeding.
Milk sucking made me feel like a cow.
Advertising is a bit crazy, but I understood its idea.
This is a great product, as he wrote.
Another commentary points out: “It’s a fun advertisement for moms who drink milk (difficulty in workplaces or toilets) and feel like a cow.”
It is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry.
At the end of the ad, a group of women discover that they all danced with unobtrusive pumps placed in their bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the observation that many women who loosen milk claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump pump is completely silent, does not have wires and pipes, and it is inconspicuously part of a breast-feeding bra, allowing them to move freely, keep babies and even take part in events outside the home.
Anna Balarin, partner and creative director, commented: “Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves bold and provocative placing on the market.
In parallel with the milk-milking women and dairy cows, we wanted to pay attention to milking while demonstrating in an entertaining and understandable way the stunning feeling of freedom that the new pump will bring:
This is not the first time that the Elvie pump has been put at the centre of attention.
In the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the tongue in the view of Marta Jakubowski using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved quietly to the tent town at the Texas border
The number of children of detained migrants has increased rapidly, although there are relatively many people crossing the border each month as before, partly through the harsh rhetoric of the Trump administration and policies that have made it difficult to accommodate children at sponsors.
As a rule, most sponsors have also been documentless immigrants themselves, fearing that, by openly applying to receive a child, it will threaten their ability to stay in the country.
The risk increased in June when federal officials announced that potential sponsors and other members of their household would have to be allowed to remove fingerprints, and that data would also be transferred to other immigration-related authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, senior immigration and customs officer, showed prior to the congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for sponsors for unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of arrested persons were not previously punished.
“Almost 80 percent of the persons who are either sponsors or members of the sponsor household are staying here illegally, and most of them are criminal aliens.
That is why we continue to persecute such individuals, Mr. Albensa said.
According to asylum workers, in an attempt to speed up the handling of children's cases, officials have introduced new rules that require some of them to appear before the court within a month of arrest, not after 60 days, as the previous standard was provided for.
Many will use the chance of a video conference call instead of coming in person to defend their legal status before the immigration judge.
Persons who will be considered unfit for release will be quickly expelled.
The longer children are held in custody, the more likely they are to become restless or depressed, which can lead to violent attacks or attempts to flee, according to the information and evidence provided by asylum workers that have been withdrawn from the system in recent months.
Lawyers have argued that these concerns will be heightened in larger sites, such as Tornillo, where signs that a child is suffering are more often overlooked due to their expanse.
They added that moving children to a tent town without spending enough time on their emotional preparation or allowing them to say goodbye to their friends could lead to injuries that many are already struggling with.
Syria orders U.S., French and Turkish-Occupant armies to immediately withdraw their troops
When addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Moualem also urged Syrian refugees to return home even though the country’s war has been going on for the eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, claimed that foreign forces were illegally based in Syria on the pretext of countering terrorism, and \"this will be addressed accordingly\"
“They must resign immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have been forced to leave their homes, \"the war against terrorism is almost over.\"
He announced that Damascus would continue to fight in the holy war until all Syrian territories were purified from both terrorist groups and any foreign military presence.
The United States has deployed some 2,000 troops in Syria, who mainly train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs, who are opponents of President Bashar Al-Assad.
France has sent more than 1,000 men to this war-torn country.
With regard to the issue of refugees, Mualem declared that the circumstances had been excellent for them to return, and blamed individual Western countries – the spread of irrational fears – for which refugees do not want to return.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return,” he said.
“These people politicize what should be just a humanitarian issue,”
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not receive assistance to restore the country before an agreement on ending the war is concluded between Assad and the opposition.
UN diplomats explain that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone on the basis of the last rebels in Idlib has made it possible to speed up political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by the Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province of three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had \"dead deadlines\" and hoped that military action would be directed against jihadists, including fighters from Al-Qaeda-related group Jabhat al Nusrah, which \"will be destroyed\".
The UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to convene the first meetings of the new committees, which will include representatives of the government and the opposition, to develop the Syrian constitution for the post-war period and pave the way for elections.
Moualem laid down the conditions for the participation of the Syrian State in the Committee, stressing that the group's work should be limited until the review of the existing constitutional articles, and warned of intervention.
Why Trump will be elected for the second term
From this point of view, Mr Trump will be re-elected in the 2020 elections, unless, and perhaps, many liberal observers, the impeachment and the scandal put an end to his Presidency prematurely.
In this case, it will be the most dramatic Presidency final of all time.
At the moment, there is nothing to show about the relaxation of the observers.
Since 2014, ratings have more than doubled in CNN's most advantageous transmission time, reaching 1.05 million viewers, but MSNBC has almost tripled, reaching 1.6 million viewers.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
“It’s a fire that attracts many people because it’s an incomprehensible thing for us,” explained Neal Baer, a supporter of ABC’s Designed Survivor drama. This drama tells us about a Cabinet Secretary who becomes president after the attack is destroyed by Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a comedy writer-veteran and Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, have their own theory.
She remembers the trip with a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The head told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
She wanted to know why.
\"He said, 'Because he's smiling me,'\" said Miss Skowell.
Chaos is, to some extent, entertaining.
Of course, unlike the rest seen on TV, news from Washington could determine what will happen with the Rou v. Way case, whether immigrant families can unite, and the state of the global economy.
Ignoring is a luxury that only the most privileged observers can afford.
And yet this is more than a well-informed citizen, when at six o’clock we look at the expert group discussing how Bob Woodward has used unnamed sources of information for his book “Fear Paul Manafort” 15,000-dollar bomber-type jackets from a stream-feather and leather-cloth from which arrogance sucks,” said the Washington Post, and what role Stormy Daniels will play in the passionate description of Trump’s anatomical details.
For example, I will never again take Super Mario as before.
“Some of what he does, which gives the impression of a reality show, is that he is endowed with information every day,” said Brent Montgomery, “Wheelhouse Entertainment – CEO and show “Pawn Stars” – the creator explained about Trump’s changing team and daily twists (a pig with N.F.L., Kim Chen’s praise).

It is no wonder that the 17th Congressional District of Pennsylvania is seeking money thanks to the conversion of Congressional Areas, which will result in two existing Members fighting for one place.
This recently redesigned remote area of Pittsburgh is linked to the Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in a special election in another area last spring.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
After the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old areas were unconstitutionally divided in favour of Republicans, the maps were recycled.
Competition in the new area 17 has led to a battle between party major financial groups: Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee and National Republican Campaign Committee.
Lemb became known in Pennsylvania, when he won a small majority in the widely observed March elections in Pennsylvania’s 18th Congress.
This place was held by Republicans for more than 10 years, and President Donald Trump won with 20 points in the area.
Politics experts have a small predominance for Democrats.
The United States considered the punishment of El Salvador for supporting China, but then pondered
The diplomats acknowledged that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing without much pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and he stayed at the hotel in Panama until the partner put the Trump organization management team behind the door.
The officials of the State Department decided to withdraw the heads of the United States diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of a \"recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan\" – spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
However, the penalties were considered to be limited to El Salvador, which received some 140 million from America in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which would include a reduction in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country where unemployment and murders have reached the highest levels.
During the internal meetings, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic well-being, following a similar meeting last year, which was recognised as an attempt to bring migrants closer to the US.
In mid-September, senior officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, essentially ending their arguments to punish El Salvador.
The diplomats informed that Vice President Mika Pence has now decided to attend a conference scheduled for mid-October to show how serious the administration highlights the meeting.
And three American ambassadors quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new and serious statements or penalties from Washington.
A representative of the White House, who spoke on behalf of Mr Bolton, did not want to provide further information on the debate, which three American officials described, including two diplomats who agreed to consult in the internal negotiations, should their anonymity be maintained.
He was confirmed by an external analyst closest to the administration, who also spoke on condition that his anonymity will be preserved.
Researching History
The second stone garden could be a report by special prosecutor Robert Mueller on the fact that Mr Trump may have hindered justice, which has a lot of evidence at the disposal of the public.
It is claimed that Mr Miller will also investigate whether Trump's campaign has co-operateed secretly with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If a second party prevails in Congress, Trump will have to respond to this structure and perhaps also to his fellow jury right at the moment when he is about to meet the voters again.
There are many – but – and I did not argue that Trump’s fall is inevitable or that it will happen to his fellow Europeans.
There are choices that will have to be made for all of us on both sides of the Atlantic, and these choices will show the duration of the fight.
In 1938, German officers were ready to make a coup against Hitler if the West had resisted him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We broke out and missed the opportunity to avoid a year-long blood bath.
History revolves around such turning points, and the unstoppable path of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans now have to face a number of such turning points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump dismisses Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein, a man who controls the fate of Mr. Miller's investigation?
It is difficult for Rosenstein since it was reported last year that he proposed to secretly record the conversation with the president and thought about his inability to function.
Mr. Rosenstein says the story of “The Times” is not accurate.
“How do we respond if the requested FBI investigation into Bret Kaveno will not be complete or fair, or if he will be confirmed as a judge of the Supreme Court despite his unfair testimony and faithful accusations of sexual assault?
And what is most important, will we vote in the interim elections of the Congress, which will call Trump responsible?
If we do not pass all these trials, democracy will have a long winter.
However, I believe that we will succeed by referring to what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was sent to Auschwitz exactly the same Nazi regime that once mythized in my envoy's house.
She survived, emigrated America and sent me 60 years later to light up the Sabbath candles on the table with a swastika.

“Rangers – star Graham Dorrans feels optimistic about fighting Vienna-Rapid
“Rangers – will take Vienna – Rapid – on Thursday knowing that the victory over the Austrians after the impressive undistinguished game in Spain with Villarreal – earlier this month will allow them to take a stable position to qualify from the European League G Group.
The road injury prevented the centre's attacker Grem Dorans from taking part in the season's games until the undistinguished score of 2:2 with \"Villarreal\", but he believes that \"Rangers\" can be used as a springboard to achieve even more.
“We can be happy about this because Villarreal is a good team,” said the 31-year-old footballer.
“We went to the game believing that we could succeed and we got this point.
Perhaps we could have overcome them in the end, but overall an undistinguished result is a fair result.
They may have been better in the first half of the year, but we got rid of in the second half of the year and we were a better team.
And on Thursday there will be another important night for Europe.
I hope we get three points, but it won't be an easy game, because they got a good result in the previous game, but I'm sure with the help of our supporters we'll be able to continue fighting and get good results.
The last year with all my injuries and changes in the club itself was clearly heavy, but now new cools are visible, which I feel good about.
The team is great and the guys enjoy it; the training is good.
I hope we can continue the fight, leave the last season behind and succeed –
Women are not able to sleep because they are worried about their pension savings
Although the survey participants clearly knew what care they wanted, few had discussed the issue with family members.
About half of individuals in a national study indicated that they did not talk to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had talked about it with their children.
“People want them to be taken care of by family members, but they don’t do anything to talk about it,” Holly Snyder, Vice President of the State Insurance Agency, says.
Here's what you should start with.
Talk to a spouse friend and your children. You can not prepare your family for the fact that you will need care if you do not make your wishes known for a good time in advance.
Work with your consultant and family to discuss where and how to receive care, as these choices can be an important factor in determining costs.
Engage with your financial advisor. Your consultant can also help you figure out how to cover these costs.
Your ability to provide long-term care funding may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid insurance policy with an amount of money to cover these costs, or the provision of your property – the main thing for you to have money.
Develop your own legal documents. Prevent legal battles before they start.
Talk to an authorised health professional so that you have a trusted person who will monitor your health care and will ensure that professionals act in accordance with your wishes if you are unable to express them.
Consider also the possibility of conferring a financial mandate.
Choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf, who will take care of paying your bills if you are unable to do so by your own efforts.
And do not forget the seemingly tiny details! Imagine that one of your elderly parents is being taken to the hospital for emergency help.
Will you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Set out these facts in a written plan so that such a situation does not surprise you not prepare.
“And it’s not just about finances, but about who is a doctor,” said Martina.
“What are the medicines used?
Who will take care of the dog?
Make sure that such a plan is drawn up:

Earthquakes and Tsunami in Indonesia
According to the government, a strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday has killed at least 384 people. The number of victims is expected to increase.
Because of the destroyed communications, the rescuers have not been able to obtain any information from the Donggal area north of Palu, closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnificence earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after a devastating natural disaster.
Here is the basic information about Palau and Dongale, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulavesi Island. It is estimated that in 2017 it had 379 800 people.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami erupted.
Dongala is an area stretching about 300 km (180 miles) along the northwest coast of Sulawesi Island.
It is estimated that 299 200 people lived in the area of the administrative region of the province in 2017.
Fisheries and farming are the economic pillars of the Central Province of Sulawesi, especially in the coastal Dongala area.
The production of nickel also plays an important role in the province, but it is mainly concentrated on the opposite coast of Morowali, Sulavesi.
According to Indonesia's Disaster Prevention Agency, Palu and Dongala have suffered from the tsunami several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings in Dongale.
The Tsunami also crashed over the western part of Dongala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in a seismically active Pacific fire ring, where earthquakes are regularly formed.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of Aceh province in the north of Sumatra caused a tsunami on 26 December that affected 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast line, of which more than half were in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nia off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: 6.8 Magnitude earthquake erupted in the south of Java, Indonesia’s most populated island, causing a tsunami hit on the south coast, killing almost 700 people.
2009: 7.6 Magnitude earthquake erupted near Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnite earthquake hit one of the Mentawa islands off the coast of Sumatra, causing up to 10 meters of tsunami waves that destroyed tens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: The Earthquake neared Pidie Jaya was found in Aceh, causing damage and panic, as it reminded of the destruction brought to itself by the 2004 devastating earthquake and tsunami.
This time, the tsunamis did not form, but more than 100 people were killed by wounded buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily prevented hundreds of tourists from returning home.
Sarah Peilin's eldest son arrested after domestic violence
Trek Palin, the eldest son of former Governor and Vice President of Alaska, Sarah Peilin, has been arrested because he has been charged with the attack.
According to a report issued by Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, 29-year-old Peilin, who lives in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for domestic violence and resistance to arrest.
According to a police report, when a woman-in-law tried to call the police to report what she claimed was a crime, he took her over the phone.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
He came to court on Saturday, where, when asked about whether he found himself guilty, he declared that \"there was definitely no fault\"
A knife has been charged with three Class A offences for which he may be sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of $250,000.
He is also accused of a B-class violation that can lead to a day-long prison sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that Peline has been charged with criminal offences.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father Tod Peilin.
His mother Sarah Peilin called the police and reported that an attack had taken place.
This case is currently being dealt with in Alaska Veterans Court.
In 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, of delaying a report on domestic violence and of carrying a weapon intoxicated state in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend says he's tied to her with a face-to-face fist.
In 2016, veteran groups criticized Sarah Peilina for linking her son’s violent behavior to posttraumatic stress syndrome, returning from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake created by tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of people killed
At least 384 people have died following the earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-mile earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been destroyed and the number of victims is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake erupted near the central part of Sulawesi, southeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
In social networks, there are videos that show the moment of collision.
Hundreds of people had gathered at the beach festival in Palu, where the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors want to demand the execution of a person suspected of a terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors want to demand the execution of Sayfullo Saifov, who is suspected of a terrorist attack in New York City when eight people were killed. This is a rare type of punishment that has not been committed in the state of federal crime since 1953.
The 30-year-old Saipov used a Home Depot to attack a bicycle track along West Side Highway in October, where he hit pedestrians and cyclists on his way.
In order to justify the execution, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov, with his intention, killed eight victims and, with his intention, caused a serious injury, as stated in the statement on the intention to claim the death penalty submitted to the New York Southern District Court.
According to the court document, in both of these charges, the death penalty can be imposed.
Within a week of the attack, the Federal Grand Jury issued an indictment in 22 charges involving eight charges of extortion killings commonly used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, as well as charges of cruelty and damage to motor vehicles.
The attack required \"significant planning and prior intent\" explained the prosecutors, mentioning that Saipov's attack was \"shot, cruel and inhuman.\"
“Saifullo Habibullaevic Saipov injured, harmed and caused damage to the families and friends of these people: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Anna-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alehandro Damian Pagnocco,” the statement reads.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years have passed since the New York Southern District Court’s prosecutors charged with the death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but he was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in 2009.
The death penalty was last executed in New York in 1953 by Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple sentenced to death after being charged with spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The death penalty in the electric chair was executed on 19 June 1953 for the couple of Rosenbergs.
According to court documents, following days and months, Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, did not regret the attack.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
Police said he had also asked for permission to put the ISIS flag in his chamber.
He has rejected 22 indictments.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipow, said he was “a mildly naturally dissatisfied with the decision of the charge.”
“We believe that the intention to demand the death penalty rather than accept the recognition of guilt in exchange for life imprisonment without the right to release will only prolong the ongoing injury to all parties involved,” Paton explained.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
It’s a great way to make sure that you’re on the right track and that you’re on the right track.
The former leader of the British Independent Party said that politicians should feel the anger of Eurosceptics when one of the Members of the Theresa May Parliament suggested that talks with the EU should be trusted by him.

However, the challenge that Mrs Maya will have to face when trying to link her contradiction with the broken party was demonstrated by conservatives who support staying in the EU and joined a separate urban protest against Brexit.
The Prime Minister is struggling to maintain her compromise plan on Chequers compromise and is experiencing attacks from those who want to leave the EU, from those who want to stay in the EU and from the EU itself.
The Allied parties insisted that she would make a determined effort to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the negative reaction, and would make Eurosceptics and Labour choose between her offer and “haos” –
Mr Bouna, Leave Means Leave, announced in Solihull that he wanted to throw away the May plan in the manure.
He suggested making Mr Farage an ally and entrusting him with the talks with Brussels.
“If he had been told, we would have already left,” Boun said.
Wellingborough, a Member of Parliament, added: \"I support Brexit, but we have to throw the May Plan into manure.
In support of his opposition to the EU, he said: \"We did not fight to have crews!
We want to adopt our own laws in our own country –
Mr Bounas ignored the assumption that public opinion could have changed since the vote in 2016: \"The idea that the British have changed their thoughts and want to stay in the EU is absolutely false\"
Andrea Jenkins, a supporter of Brexit, also took part in the March, and the reporters were told: “I just say, Prime Minister, listen to the residents.
“The Chequers plan is not popular, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular with our party and our supporters who actually do all the work and elect us.
Please opt out of Chequers and start listening
In a message directed at Maya, she added: “Prime ministers remain in their place when they fulfill their promises –
Mr Farage said politicians should feel pressure if they intend not to respect the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
\"Now it's a matter of trust between us -- people -- and our politicians,\" he said.
“They’re trying to put Brexit in place and we’re here today to tell them we’re not going to let it happen.”
In his message to an enthusiastic crowd of people, he says: “I want you to let our politicians, who are planning to hand over Brexit, feel the pressure.
“We will call on the citizens of this country who have allowed us to win the Brexit fight and will never relax until we are independent, self-governing, proud of the United Kingdom.”
In the meantime, the Witnesses walked through Birmingham before a two-hour accommodation was held in the center of the city.
This is the first time I’ve been in the United States since the beginning of the 20th century.
This is the first time I’ve been in a relationship with you.
“These are the people who tell us that they are able to maintain the order of the IT system and all their technology for Canada and yet, for an undivided border, free trade without borders with Ireland,” he added.
“It’s an absolute farce.
There is no such thing as a successful Breksit,\" he added.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will “thought-out” to run for the US presidential election after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday the Democrat of Massachusetts spoke about her future in the Town Hall of West Massachusetts.
Voren, who frequently criticizes President Donald Trump, takes part in the repeated elections in November and is a candidate for GOP Republican Geof Dīla, who was the Vice President of the 2016 Massachusetts Campaign.
It is speculated that she will be the main one who will dare to stand up for Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon event Holyoke was her 36th meeting with the voters using the city hallhouse since the entry into office of Trump.
A visitor asked her if she was going to stand for presidential elections.
To which Warren replied that it was the right time for \"Washington to have women who are \"good-bye to the imperfect government, which also means women-presidents.\"
In the case of the shooting of LSU basketball player Sims has been detained
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
The Batonruža Police Station announced that Dayeons Simpson, 20 years of detention, was arrested at 11 a.m.
On Friday, they broadcast a shooting video, calling for help in the recognition of the visible man of the video.
Sims (20) shot and killed near the Southern University student town on Friday morning.
“Vaid Sim was shot in his head, resulting in immediate death,” police chief Murphy J. Pol told the press on Saturday, during 247 Sport.
The way was to defend his friend and Simpson shot him.
It’s a great way to make sure that you’re getting the best results.
The Simpson was arrested without resistance and he is in the East Batonruža village police station.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the title of world champion after the team lets him beat Sebastian Fetel
It’s been a long time since I’ve been here.
From the start, Botas started well and almost left Hamilton dry, defending his place on the first two trips and calling on Fetel to attack his teammate.
Fetell first entered the garage and left Hamilton engines to cope with the rest, it was most likely decisive.
The Mercedes pilot filled the circle later and left behind Fetel, but Hamilton continued to stand up as leaders after the force balance, which saw Ferrari riders persistently leave the inside free, risking to lag behind double manevra to defend in the third corner.
Max Verstapen began from the back row, and at the end of the first circle was the seventh on his 21st birthday.
After that, he was led by a large part of the race, as he focused on the tires to quickly reach the finish and overtake Kim Raikonen in the fourth.
After all, he came to the garage in the 44th circle, but was unable to increase the speed in the remaining eight circles, because Raikonen remained fourth.
This is a difficult day, because Walter did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman.
The team did an extremely important job to get one two, Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Diana Feinstein on Saturday about her perseverance to unveil a letter from Kristīne Bleisija Ford, in which she accused Supreme Court candidate Bret Kaven of sexual harassment.
In a speech at West Virginia, the president did not speak directly about Ford’s testimony to the Senate’s legal commission, but commented that what happened in the Senate showed that people there were “evil, ugly, and unreliable.”
“One thing that can happen and something beautiful that is already happening in the last days of the Senate, when there is anger, when you see angry, evil, ugly and unreliable people,” he said.
“When you read press releases and leaked information, and then they say, ‘Oh, no, I didn’t.
I didn't do that --
Remember that?
Diana Feinstein, did you leak the information?
Remember her answer to the question...or did you leak the document? “Oh, what did you do?”
Oh, no.
I didn't do that --
Okay, wait a moment.
It is also important to note that this is not the case in the United States, but in the United States.
In July, a letter was sent to Feinstein explaining in detail what Forda accused Caveno, and in early September, the content of the letter was disclosed, but Feinstein denied it would have happened in her office.
\"I didn't hide the accusations of Dr. Ford, I didn't leak her story,\" Feinstein told the commission, reports The Hill.
“She asked me to keep it confidential and I did it,” she said.
But her denial did not please the president who commented on the situation on Saturday night, saying: \"I will tell you that it was a very bad body language.
Perhaps she didn’t do it, but it’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.
Continuing to defend the candidate of the Supreme Court, whose three women are accused of sexual harassment, the President proposed that Democrats use accusations for their own benefit.
“They are purposefully determined to regain power through any means,”
Whether you see evil, don't bother, they don't care what they hurt, what they have to destroy to gain power and control,\" the president said.

The air traffic controller dies, allowing hundreds of people on board to escape during the earthquake
One air traffic controller in Indonesia is praised for being a hero after he sacrificed himself to make a plane with hundreds of passengers safely take off land.
More than 800 people have died and many have disappeared after a powerful earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
The area continues to have strong post-ceilings and many are trapped in mud in the city of Palu.
However, despite the fact that his colleagues saved their lives, the 21-year-old Antonio Ganavanni Agung refused to leave his job at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport at the Palu Airport Control Tower, which was a strong swing.
He remained in his position to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was at that time on the runway, would safely take off in the air.
Then he jumped out of the traffic control tower, thinking that it could collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
Indonesia’s air navigation representative, Johannes Sirait, said his decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australian ABC reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan to take him to the largest hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost her this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“We are saddened to hear it from the heart, he fills up.
Meanwhile, public authorities are concerned that the number of deaths could reach thousands, the National Disaster Prevention Agency claims that access to Dongala, Sigi and Butangao (Boutong) is limited.
“It is believed that a beautiful growth will take place because there are still many bodies under the rubble and many cannot be accessed,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
The waves, which reach a height of 6 meters, destroyed Palu, where mass funerals will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft continue to supply assistance and necessary goods.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, “Sky News” said: “Every minute the emergency medical service brings new victims.
Clean water is a deficit.
Small shops everywhere are over-exposed.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, CNN said: “The Red Cross of Indonesia is in a hurry to help the survivors, but we do not know what we will find there.
“It’s already a tragedy, but it can all get worse.”
On Sunday, Indonesia's President Joko Widodo came to Palau and said to the country's military bringer: \"I ask you to work day and night to accomplish all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready, CNN reported?
Indonesia was already hit by earthquakes in Lombok, where more than 550 people died this year.
This is the first time I’ve been in the United States since the beginning of the 20th century.
The airline carried out a flight during which it crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia and now claims that one of the people has disappeared, although previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
The airline Air Niugini announced in a press release on Saturday afternoon, when they could not be held accountable for one of the passengers, a man.
The airline announced that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the missing man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more detailed information on the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Locals with boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water, trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, officials said seven people were hospitalized.
The airline said six people remained in hospital until Saturday, and all of them were in stable condition.
The causes of the accident and the sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the US Navy report that the plane fell into the lagoon shortly after taking off the runway.
Some eyewitnesses thought the plane overestimated the length of the runway.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane was very low.
“It was really good,” Janes said.
He said that he and other passengers were able to get out of the sinking plane using emergency exits, because the water was only to the waist.
He said that the Stuarts fell in a panic and screamed, as well as that he had a mild head injury.
The U.S. Navy sailors, who worked nearby to improve the ship’s pier, also helped in rescue operations by using an inflatable boat to transport people on shore before the plane sinks about 30 meters (100 feet) under water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show 111 people have died in PNG-registered airlines in the last twenty years, no one is related to Air Niugin
The commentator of psychoanalysis explains the course of events at night, in which a woman was burned alive
The appeal on Saturday provided evidence in a re-examination of the case, where a man is accused of burning a living woman in 2014.
The commentator of the U.S. Department of Judicial Expertise, Paul Rovlet, pointed out for several hours as a witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used the phone information to put together the 29-year-old Quinton Tell and the 19-year-old inmate Jessica Chambers acted on the night she died.
Rovlet said he had received location data from a number of phones showing that Telis was with Chambers on the evening of her death, challenging his previous testimony, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his phone was near Chambers when he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to question Sanford.
It’s not that I don’t know what to do with it, but I’m sure I’ll be able to do it.
When the charge asked if Tellus told the truth, claiming he was in a Sanford car that night, Sanford said he was “laughter because my car was in Nashville.”
Another contradiction was that Telli said he only knew Chambers about two weeks after she died.
Phone records show that they only knew each other for a week.
Rovlet said that a little after the death of Chambers, Telly deleted text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
“He took her out of his life,” Heil said.
It is planned that the defence will provide its concluding arguments on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury later on the same day.
The High Breed group: What is a conscious hip-hop?
Hip-hop trio wants to challenge negative opinions about this genre of music, providing a positive message with its music.
“The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip-hop has turned away from its roots on messages of a political nature and when dealing with social issues.
The group wants to return to the roots of the genre and make conscious hip-hop again popular.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have experienced a recent rebirth in the UK with artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Again black?!
It is also important to note that this is not the case in the United States, but in the United States.
In New York, a babysitter sued a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a false text message from a mother who complained that the babysitter was black again.
The couple denies that they would be racists, equalizing the trial to extortion
Lindsey Plasko-Flaksman, a mother of two, expressed her rebuttal attitude when she found out that the new caregiver, Gizele Maurice, was black when she came to work on the first day of 2016.
“DON’T BECAUSE, BLACK BLACK,” Plasco-Flaksman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, she sent the message not to her husband, but to Maurice, and twice.
It is important to note that this is not the case in the United States.
Mauris paid for her one working day and sent home with Uber.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
\"I want to show them that they don't do this,\" she said on Friday, adding, \"I know it's discrimination.\"
The couple rejects the accusations that they are racists, claiming that stopping Maurice’s employment was a reasonable decision because they feared that she would not be able to trust her after her insult.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists, Joel Plasko, husband, said \"Post\"
\"But would you entrust your children to someone you treated grossly, even if it was only because of a mistake?
Your newborn?

As a court hearing, Plasko said that his wife had only given birth two months ago and was in a very, very, very difficult situation.
“Do you really turn to someone in this way?
It is not acceptable to do so, the investment banker added.
As long as there are still legal proceedings, public opinion is quickly tried across social networks, deceiving them for their behavior and logical thinking.
A new letter reveals that the publishers of Paddington’s book were concerned that readers would not be able to associate with the talking bear
Bond's daughter Karen Jenkel, who was born shortly before the book was approved, said about the letter: \"It's hard to put yourself in a shoe -- who reads the book for the first time before it is published.
It’s amazing to find out now what we know about Paddington’s great success.
Saying that her father, who worked as an operator at the BBC before feeling inspired to write a book for children about a little toy bear, was optimistic that his work would be rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book's issue was \"sweet bitter - after the father left forever last year.
As for Paddington, who she calls “a very important member of her family,” her father was quietly proud of her potential success.
“He was a quiet, quiet man and was not great,” she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was like if you had a child who achieved something: you were proud even if you didn’t do it yourself.
I think he saw Paddington’s success in a similar way.
Although he was created by him and the fruit of his imagination, he always gave all the merit to Paddington himself.
I had to say goodbye to my dying daughter by phone.
After landing, her daughter took her to the hospital in Nice, Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors were constantly fighting for her life.
“Ned called regularly and said it was very bad and expected that she would not survive,” Ednan-Laperuz said.
“Then I received a call from Ned, saying she would die within the next two minutes and I have to say goodbye from her.
And that's what I did, too.
I said, \"Tash, I love you very much, dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicine that the doctors gave her to maintain the heart rate slowly ended and left her body.
She would have died even faster and it all ended now.
I had to sit and wait, knowing that it was all happening.
I could not catch or scream because I was in a situation where there were families and people around me.
I needed a lot of strength to get me in control.
After all, then already the daughter of the grieving, Ednan-Laperuz boarded the plane with other passengers, who had no idea who she was going through.
“No one knew,” she said.
“I put my head down and my tears were running all the time.
It is difficult to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt deep sympathy for Ned.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved him --
Seduce women fasten their bridges to prevent suicide
Two women whose loved ones committed suicide act to help others not take their lives.
Shiron Davis and Kelly Hamfria are strengthening their tickets at the Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers so that people can call and get support.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression, but he committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want a parent to experience what I do every day,” she said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook with an addictive smile.
“Everyone recognized him after a smile.
Everyone always said that his smile – lit up – always and everywhere –
However, he refused to work before he died because he was “in a very, very dark place”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, was the one who found him after Tyler committed suicide.
Davis said, \"I'm constantly worried that this will have consequences for me.\"
Davis created the cards, “to make it known that there are people you can turn to and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
You don't have to sit in silence -- you have to talk --
Hampshire, who has been Davis’ girlfriend for years, lost Mark, her mate for 15 years, shortly after his mother’s death.
“He didn’t say that he would feel sad or depressed or anything else,” she said.
“Some days before Christmas, we noticed that his attitude had changed.
He reached his lowest point on Christmas morning, when the children opened the gifts he did not make eye contact with them or anything like that.
His death was a great trauma for children, but they have to deal with it: \"It irritates the whole family.
That's what separates us.
But we must all continue and fight –

The future of Bret Kaveno hangs in the air as FBI initiates an investigation
“I think if we could really get what he requires – in terms of time and volume in a limited investigation – we could have a little consensus,” Fleik said on Saturday, adding that he was concerned that the commission was sharing a fortified partisan mine.
Why do the supporters of Chaveno and his Republicans not want the FBI to investigate?
Their abstaining is just a coincidence.
It is five weeks later, on 6 November, that if the Republicans are expected to fail, their attempts will be much weaker to elect a man from among themselves to the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush calls senators by lobbying them to support Caveno, who worked in the White House during Bush and thanks to him met his wife Ashley, who was the personal secretary of President Bush.
What will happen after the FBI prepares its report?
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
It is still unclear whether Caveno can win at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pens, Vice President, to settle the vote and approve it in the Supreme Court.
Kim's leadership has decreased - North Korea's number of political asylum seekers
North Korea’s number of political asylum seekers in South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong came to power seven years ago, South Korea’s legislature said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Unification Ministry, said that last year there were 1127 political asylum seekers, compared to 2011, when their number was 2706.
The park said tougher border controls are staring North Korea and China and high rates of human smuggling are key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of political asylum seekers from North Korea are ultimately offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most go through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarization Zone (DMZ) between both Koreas.
China considers political asylum seekers to be illegal immigrants and deports them by force.
Relations between North Korea and South Korea, which are still technically in war, have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the delayed denuclearization negotiations.
This followed a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, when, on large trains, they agreed to cooperate to free the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions since these talks had not progressed.
“If there is no trust in the United States, there will be no faith in the security of our country, and under such circumstances we will never unilaterally disarm the first,” Ri said at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Bret Chaven “historic” and claims that he is inappropriate for work in the Supreme Court.
Nancy Pelosi, the minority leader of the Court, named Bret Kaveno the candidate of the Supreme Court as “historic” and claimed that he was not suitable for work in the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi commented in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t stop thinking that if a woman had behaved like this, they would call her “historic,” Pelosi said of her response to the testimony given to the Senate Judicial Commission in Chaven on Thursday.
Cavano emotionally denied accusations of sexual harassment against Dr. Kristina Bleizie Ford when they were both teenagers.
In its initial argument, Kaveno was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and teaching, talking about his family and high school years.
He condemned, in particular, the Democrats in the Commission by calling against him the charges of \"grotesque and co-ordinated destruction\" organised by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that she believed that Kaveno’s testimony is a justification for not being able to work in the Supreme Court because it shows that he has a bilateral attitude towards Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with such statements and attitudes towards whom he is turning against Clinton and Democrats,” she said.
It is not possible to get rid of it in the first place.
“I will say that if he does not tell the truth to Congress or FBI, then he is not suitable for office not only in the Supreme Court, but also to work in the existing workplace in the court,” Pelosi said.
Chaven is currently a judge in the Washington County Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added by saying that as a Democratic, she was concerned about the possibility of Kaveno taking decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Way because she was considered a conservative judge.
In his approval negotiations, Kaveno overtook questions about whether he would reject decisions of the Supreme Court.
“It’s not a good time to have a hysterical and two-legged man in court, but we’d expect that we’re happy to say, ‘Isn’t that wonderful?’” said Pelosi.
But women need to keep themselves in their hands.
It is a denunciation; for months and years, everything has come together – across the edges – but she is not allowed to get it out of herself by crying.
“We’re crying when we’re angry,” said Mrs. Steinema, 45 years later.
\"I don't think it's something unusual, as you think.\"
She continued, “Sometimes, a woman who was a manager in a company who said that she was crying when she was angry, but made a technique – when she became angry and started crying, she told the person she was talking to: “You can think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry --
And then she continued to go.
And I thought it was great --
Tears are only partially recognized as a form of discharge of anger, because they are misunderstood in the very foundations.
One of my brightest memories is from the oldest piece of work, in which the proportion of men was expressed, when I cried once because of inexpressible anger, when an older woman, a stubborn head (a woman) from whom I was always a little scared, took me to the stairwell.
\"Never let them see you cry,\" she told me.
\"They don't know you've been transferred.
They think you’re in trouble and will only be glad you’ve managed to get under your skin.
Patricia Schröder, then a U.S. Democratic Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart for the presidency of his pre-election campaign.
In 1987, when Hart, who had been caught in extramarital relations, abandoned a ship also called “the making of fools,” and left the elections, Schröder, deeply disappointed, considered that there was no reason why she could not stand as president.
“That wasn’t a carefully thought out decision,” she told me 30 years later while laughing.
“The delay was already seven other candidates and the last one they wanted to find another one.
There were those who called it “Snow white and seven dwarves.”
She was late in the campaign, behind the fundraising and promised she would not participate in the election unless $2 million was collected.
It was a lost battle.
She found that many of her supporters, who donated $1,000 to men, donated only $250 to her.
\"Do they think I'm getting a discount - she was surprised.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was very emotional, grateful to those who supported her, disappointed in the system that made it very difficult to collect money and address the voters rather than the delegates, and angry about sexism, in which she was “moistened”
“You would think I had a nervous breakdown,” Schröder recalled how the press responded to him.
“You would think that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.”
I remember thinking about what they would write on my gravestone.
“She was crying,”
Why the U.S.-China trade war can be beneficial to Beijing
The main excuses for the beginning of the trade war between the US and China are hidden and while the fight does not see an end, differences between countries can be favorable for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning at the beginning of this year, taxing key Chinese export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation began this week with new rates affecting units worth $200 billion (£150 billion), immediately imposing half of the goods exported to the US from China.
Beijing also responds “wrongly” every time, the latest rates of five to ten percent for $60 billion American goods.
China has declared that it undertakes to respond to the US alone and is questionable that in the near future, the world's second-largest economy could be thought of.
In order for Washington to resign, certain requirements should be accepted, but the US would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi-Sji-Ji-Ji-Ji-Ji-Ji-Ji-Ji-Ji-Ji-Ji-Ji-Ji-Ji-Ji-Ji-Ji-Ji-Ji-Ji-Ji-Ji-Ji-Ji-Ji-Ji-Ji-Ji-Ji-Ji-Ji-Ji-Ji-Ji-Ji-Ji-Ji-
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the US trade war pressure can have a positive effect on China in the long term, reducing the interdependence of the economies of both countries.
“The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create uncontrolled economic conditions in any of the countries that are really more dangerous than those previously recognized by observers,” said Abigail Greis, a New American Security researcher who focuses on Asia.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
Syria says it is ready for voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to restore a country that has been destroyed by war for more than seven years.
Speaking at the United Nations Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Almualem said that the country’s circumstances were improving.
“The situation on land is now much more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to restore terrorist-destroyed areas in their normal state.
There are all conditions for refugees to voluntarily return to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations assumes that the country has left 5.5 million Syrians since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six million more people still live in the country and need humanitarian aid.
Almualem said that the Syrian regime would accept assistance in the reconstruction of the destroyed country.
But he stressed that the state would not accept assistance or assistance from countries that helped to sponsor anxiety.
European golf team wins Raider Cup sensually in Paris
The European golf team won the 2018 Raider Cup, surpassing the U.S. with a score of 16.5:10.5 “Le Golf National” outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost Europe six times in a row and has not won the Raider Cup since 1993.
It’s a great way to make sure that you’re getting the best results.
