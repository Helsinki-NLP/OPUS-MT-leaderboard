28-year-old cook found dead in San Francisco supermarket
This week, a 28-year-old cook, who recently moved to San Francisco, was found in the staircase of a supermarket.
But the victim’s brother says he can’t imagine anyone who would like to harm his brother, saying: “His life finally began to improve.”
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
The San Francisco police said that his death was recognised as a murder and is currently under investigation.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
A representative of the restaurant Sons & Daughters informs that the news of his death shocked them and shocked them.
“We’re a small team working as a family and we’re going to miss him very much,” the spokesman said.
In this difficult time, we will think together with Frank's friends and family.
It’s been a long time since I’ve been here.
\"He got into a new apartment and met a girl -- Louis tells the radio station KGO.
Louis Galicia says he doesn’t know who would like to marry his younger brother.
He was a good man with a wide heart.
“He always pampered his family by cooking a delicious meal and cooking lunch,” said Luis Galicia.
He never wanted to enter into a dispute.
He was the brother who adapted to the rest.
“Considering everything that went wrong in the world, he was like a rough diamond that glowed brightly every day,” he says.
Anyone who has information about the event is invited to call SFPD Infoline 415-575-4444.
New Doctors Strike: Calls for New Protests
The representatives of the new doctors ask their trade unions to initiate protests in the dispute over the new treaty.
The Committee of New Doctors of the British Medical Association (LMA) is going to ask the Council to support wider protests in early September.
It is also important to note that this is not the case in the United States, but in the United States.
In July, young doctors and medical students rejected the contract offered by LMA.
58% of all members who took part in the vote voted against the contract.
In a message posted on Twitter on Thursday evening, JAK board member Elena Makcorta says that the government continues to remain silent on this issue and therefore the offer of the contract has been rejected.
She said: \"Given this, the JAK vote has resulted in a complete rejection of the contract proposal and a decision has been made to request new formal discussions to discuss the most important issues -
In response to the government's silence, the JAK today formally requested a meeting with the LMA council to authorise the development of new contracts, which will enter into force in September.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
It is important to note that this is not the case.
Before meeting with 54,000 new doctors and medical students, he had told BMA members that the offer was good and would be accepted.
After the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt announced that the contract would be concluded with medical professionals in England.
Russia and Turkey: Displaced Alliance?
A gesture that puts an end to the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to come together and announce the end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
However, Vladimir Putin’s greetings to the Turkish leader at St. Petersburg’s Palace gave the impression that this partnership was more necessary for Ankara.
However, they were both insane.
The smile of Vladimir Putin looked crafted and did not cause warm emotions, even taking into account his usual restraint.
On the other hand, editor Tajjip Erdogan described Putin at least five times as his “beautiful friend.”
I've been hit by a number.
He also promised that relations with Russia will not only improve to the pre-crisis level, but will become even stronger.
The next day, a newspaper reported that Erdogan behaved as if nothing had happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm leads to conflicting feelings.
But the radiant coolness of Putin shows that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
The first one he mentioned in his address was the crashing of a Russian plane on the Syrian border.
At that time, Moscow responded sharply.
Putin accused Ankara of inserting the drone into Moscow's back.
It was even more painful, given that it came from a friend.
Restoring genuine trust will be very difficult, perhaps even impossible.
The public position of Russia has changed since November.
For several months, government-controlled television spread aggressive insults against Ankara.
And suddenly, the Turks seemed to be guilty.
The most serious accusations were that Erdogan’s own family made a profit from illicit oil trade with the Islamic State-controlled part of Syria.
He, of course, denied it.
But the main message of the St. Petersburg meeting is that it is time to forget the past.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology of President Erdogan.
Russia could perceive this as a kind of victory.
The benefit of Ankara for peace is evident.
First of all, Erdogan needs all possible friends after a failed coup last month, in which he was tried to break down.
The countless terrorist attacks have also shocked his position.
There are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have caused serious damage, in particular the ban on charter flights, which usually provides an influx of several million Russian tourists every year in Turkish resorts.
The number of tourists decreased by almost 90%.
Russian tour operators and charter companies will also breathe lightly when regular flights are restored.
They hope for a holiday in fever in the Mediterranean season.
This week, national TV provides for a fall in fruit and vegetable prices, as imports of Turkish fruit and vegetables will be renewed.
As the local newspaper Vedemosti quotes: “Tourists for them, tomatoes for us –
However, the visit also had other political motives from Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West for their view of the weak reaction to the coup attempt.
All of this can also be seen in discontent with the lengthy negotiations on EU accession and Putin's intervention, which is happy to take advantage of Turkey's alienation from the West.
The Russian leader has undoubtedly won additional points in the eyes of Ankara, expressing support for its elected government after the coup attempt.
Note that Moscow understands this well, because the fear of changing the regime in the country is deeply rooted in itself.
The summit in this luxurious seaside castle gave Russia and Turkey the opportunity to present, as an analyst named it, the two countries that feel excluded from the West unite forces.
However, despite the publicly demonstrated unity, there are still significant differences of opinion between the two countries.
The main differences affect Syria, where Russia presents itself as a peacekeeper, but in fact Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
After more than three hours of initial negotiations, without wanting to disclose information, the two presidents announced at a press conference that they had not discussed the matter.
The President of Turkey purposefully avoided the differences between the two countries, while President Putin wanted to highlight them.
There is no clear consensus on how both countries could find a common language on Syria.
However, after months of openly hostile relations and potential disasters when a NATO member Turkey hit a Russian combat plane, the situation has improved, as both leaders have at least resumed negotiations.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside of Scotland
The SKB brand will play a supporting role in the future, as announced by the Executive Director of the Bank.
Outside the Scottish SKB will no longer be available.
Ross Makevan tells the BBC channel in Scotland that the SKB brand was associated with the bank’s global ambitions.
It has abandoned these ambitions because eight years ago the bank almost went bankrupt and needed financial assistance.
Meanwhile, branding strategy experts have used the SKB brand to protect other consumer finance brands.
The bank received millions of pounds from international sports sponsors, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon Tennis Champion Andy Murray.
But now it is decided to put other national brands at the forefront.
The Scottish Royal Banca will be available to Scottish customers, but it will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all SKB references, outside the main office and official stock exchange list, will be replaced by the name NatWest.
In the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, the brand The Ulster Bank is already in use.
Smaller private finance brands, such as Couts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank, will now also be highlighted.
Makevans was interviewed during the trip with clients and employees through Invernessir.
He told the BBC’s Scottish Channel: “The SKB will become our investor brand and our employees work with, because now we become more a brand bank.”
In time, the bank itself became a global brand and SKB became a global brand.
Now I say that we no longer have global ambitions, we have local ambitions.
Each of these brands will represent something unique in its industry and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
It’s a great way to make sure that you don’t have to worry about it.
“It’s time to become a brand bank, because we’ve been asking ourselves how to become a better bank for our customers for a long time,” says the CEO.
Three years ago it would have been very cynical if we announced that we would become a great bank for our customers and develop these brands.
However, thanks to hard work and focusing on the needs of our customers, not our own needs, we obviously have made big changes.
We can revitalize these brands again, so I think now is the right time.
Frankie Detori wins 3000th win in New York with horse predilection
It’s not that I don’t know what to do, but it’s that I don’t know.
On Friday, jockey Frankie Detori won his 3000th victory in British history, winning first place in New York City.
He achieved this by winning the second victory in this race, which took place in his hometown, riding with Predilection, which is trained by John Gosden.
It is the sixth joker, 45 years old, who has achieved such a result in the horse sprint race.
He has joined Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Leicester Pigot, Pete Eder and Willie Carson.
The three-time champion of the joker Detori, who previously won with the horse Ghayyar, said: \"It's something special.\"
I'm very touched because my family is here.
I am very happy that this happened in New York because I have lived here for 30 years.
This is not a big race, this is not a Royal Ascot, but an ordinary Friday evening with 20,000 people.
I feel relaxed and very grateful.
After the victory, Detori and Predilection are expected with a lashes and gavillas.
The two jokers have reached this record in the race with obstacles - champion Richard Johnson and the 20th-time champion Sir Antony McCoy, who has set several records in his career, winning more than 4300 victories.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
Frankie is one of today's best jokes and has no surprise that he has achieved success that only rarely can be achieved.
He is stylish and strong, but his sense of tactics distinguishes him from other jokes.
He is a fantastic racer, his enthusiasm and charisma for years attracts fans of this sport.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie at the Epsom race that he had already won 6,000 if he did not participate in the weekends and the big race.
But seriously, it is a real pleasure that Frankie has regularly won the UK race for 30 years.
He's a happy person who's great at the British race, and he's an excellent jockey.
Frank Detori noted this achievement with his branding - a flying jump.
From finishing at wind speed to flying jump, Frankie Detori has been the face of British horse racing for twenty years.
This has been a journey full of adventures.
He has won countless major races, including the famous 1996 “The Great Seven” in Ascot, and has survived a plane crash and disqualification for the use of preparations.
Three years ago, he had difficulty returning after six months of disqualification, but he demonstrated his character's strength, challenging those who questioned him, returning to his best form.
And he could take part in the race for another time - Detori has previously said that he would be happy to continue participation in the race until at least 50 years old.
Russian President Putin Releases Administration Manager Sergey Ivanov
It’s not just a matter of time, but also a matter of time.
This is the first time I’ve been in the United States since the beginning of the 20th century.
A 63-year-old politician is currently appointed as a special representative for nature and transport.
The Kremlin said in a statement that Putin “decided to release Ivanov from the duties of the head of the Russian President’s administration – without mentioning the reason.
Mr Anton Vaino, who has been his deputy since 2012 was appointed as Ivanov.
The 44-year-old Vaino is a former diplomat.
He was born in 1972 in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute of National International Relations (MVSAI) and later worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
After his appointment, Putin said: \"Thank you for your trust -
In my opinion, the main task of the administration is to support your work in the position of the President of the State by drafting laws and controlling the implementation of your decisions.
It’s a great way to make sure that you’re on the right track and that you’re on the right track.
Are you sure of smiles?
This step confuses Moscow.
Sergey Ivanov is an ancient and close ally of Vladimir Putin and, like Putin, worked at the Soviet Security Service in the KGB.
In this position, he was one of the most influential men in Russia.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
But despite the smiles of the cameras, rarely convinced by such an explanation, especially before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the result of the fight for power?
No one knows.
But the official statement that the man, who was considered a possible president, suddenly wanted to become the head of environmental policy in Russia, is perceived with great skepticism.
In the comments published on the Kremlin’s website, Ivanov says to Putin: “It is the fact that in early 2012 I ask you to entrust me with this difficult position, one could even say a problematic position, for four years.
It turns out that I have worked in this position for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
Former Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former KGB member of the State Security Service, just like Putin.
In the late 1990s, Putin led the Federal Security Service, which is the successor to the KGB, Ivanov held the post of his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov the number of five people he trusts the most.
In the end of the second term of Putin Ivanov was considered a potential candidate for the post of Russian President, because Putin's re-election for the third term would be unconstitutional.
But then another close ally of Putin became president - Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister and returned to office three and a half years later.
The arrival of mysterious fish in a garden in the city of Banff
A man from Banff asks for help to find out the conditions under which fish species appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bein thinks that 75 fish could be sandfish, who have canceled with a water room .
Mr. Beina, who lives about 500 metres from the sea, made the fish on the Periscope video, hoping that someone could know how these 5 centimeters of fish came to his garden.
Quansfery Crossing: The bridge is now connected to Faife.
This is the first time I’ve ever been in the United States since the beginning of the 20th century.
Engineers have connected the northern part of the Quinsferian intersection and viaduct, which means that the bridge is now connected to Faife.
The first of the four connecting parts is complete, which means that the bridge construction is coming to an end.
The construction of the faif bridge is 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It consists of 10 000 tonnes of steel, 20 000 tonnes of concrete and 46 supporting cables.
The project worth £ 1.35 billion is currently planned to be completed in May 2017.
Economic Secretary Katie Brown had arrived at the construction site today and was one of the first to climb the bridge.
He said: “This is a symbolic and historic moment in the construction of the Queensferium Bridge.”
In this project we see an unsurpassed engineering solution, where only the construction of this part used more than 30,000 tons of cement and steel.
Despite the huge weight and size of the bridge, the connection between the bridge and the viaduct is an extremely delicate process that requires enormous accuracy.
In general, more than 79% of the bridge deck has already been built and the last stage that will connect the bridge to Rosita will be laid today, which means that all parts of the bridge are ready for laying.
Michael Martin, Director of the fourth bridge connection project, says: “The first connection is a very important point in the construction of any bridge.
In this fantastic project, the first connection demonstrates the construction of high-end engineering.
After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the support of the northern tower, we were left to connect the section of the northern road with the part of the land or viaduct.
This was done by moving the part of the viaduct of the northern driveway 700 millimeters south.
It was a huge and at the same time very delicate operation.
Huge, because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6000 tonnes and had to be pulled at a slope of about 3%.
Delicate, because the tolerance in both directions with which the team worked was just a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything worked well.
Simon Bails acquires gold in gymnastics for women.
Forget the tension.
Forget the excitement.
Simon Bailey doesn't bother with that.
Dynamic jumps.
It is easy to do exercises on a log.
Unsurpassed on the floor.
Completely impeccable.
And finally, the Olympic Champion.
It’s a great way to make sure that you’re on the right track.
It’s a great way to make sure that you’re on the right track and that you’re on the right track.
It’s a great way to make sure that you’re on the right track.
This is the first time I’ve ever been in the United States since the beginning of the 20th century.
When the final result was announced, she flowed into tears, because the long road to this moment was over.
This achievement ranks him next to such unparalleled athletes as Michael Felps, who raised his sport to a different level.
For the last three years, Bailes has dominated in its sport, winning 15 medals in world championships, including 10 gold medals, fulfilling such outstanding, accurate and ambitious exercises combinations that 1984 Olympic Champion Mary Lu Reton called him “the best gymnast she’s ever seen.”
In Brazil, she was faced with the final test, where she had to compete to a large extent with expectations placed on her, rather than with other sportsmen.
She would be disappointed if she returned to her home in Spring, Texas, without gold medals.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
The first gold medal was won by Bails on Tuesday, making a special farewell party by the random coordinator Marta Karolji.
Although Baiels claims that on its long journey to the tops of glory there was nothing to expect, it is not true.
Some of her performance in free movement, which includes her special acrobatic transition, is accompanied by Latin music, which would fit perfectly on the street next to the Rio Olympic arena.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl, who was adopted by her grandparents when she was still a baby and was discovered by the mother of coach Amy Bourman on a tour of the gym where Bourman's bodies were held, has now become the power with which to count.
She has not lost many battles since the summer of 2013 and the victory series can continue as long as Bails wants it.
Although Mustafin was slightly led during the two rotations, it was only an illusion.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
She stood at the forefront with a score of 15,433 on the beam and strengthened control with a score of 15,933 in free movements
Raismane gently embraced her while waiting for results that were only formality and she burst into tears of joy when the dream she had ever recorded in her notebook was fulfilled.
The result of Raismane was like a little revenge for four-year-old events, when she shared third place with Mustafin, however, lost the fight for the bronze medal.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of the team, whom Americans call “grandmother,” came under strong leadership.
After her performance in free movement, she was able to devote herself to a crowd of air kisses.
In the meantime, the 19-year-old Bailes’ viral Twitter record r, which she published this week, is now of completely different importance.
6-year-old Mahay Brown, a bullet-punched man, survives a shooting at Philadelphia.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
The parents of the child confirmed to the CBS Philadelphia news channel that it is Mahay Brown.
My grandparents say that Brown was shot several times, including in the groin, leg, arm, and abdomen, but was still conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
His grandmother Delors Melendez told television: “His little body was simply bullet-punched.”
I can't believe it.
The boy in a critical condition is placed in the hospital and has already suffered several operations.
The family is told that he will surely recover.
He had to start in the first grade at a local primary school.
Brown is one of four people shot in the city of Jermantown.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-old men and one 32-year-old man.
The CBS Philadelphia channel reports that one of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition, while the other two victims are in stable condition.
The channel says that the child was found in the front seat of the car next to the 29-year-old victim in a critical condition.
The other two victims were not in the car and the police were investigating whether one of them had been an attacker.
The investigator told CBS Philadelphia that several shooters were likely involved in the shooting.
In the event of an accident, the guns belonging to a variety of weapons have been found.
It looks like it has been a long shot.
It’s not that I don’t know what I’m going to do.
“It looks like there have been a number of armed shooters there who took an active part in the shooting,” says Philadelphia Police Captain Antony Ginaldi.
The damage has also been caused by several homes and cars.
No one has yet been arrested and police are reported to check the surveillance camera records.
A bullet fell down during the shooting on Tuesday hit a six-year-old girl in her hand while she was playing in front of her home in the Vestouklein district.
She gradually recovers, but the police are still looking for the guilty.
Why do we need Simon, Gaby, and Laurie?
I call it the Women's Olympic Athletics Team of the Year for several reasons.
First of all, I have been to all the summer Olympics since 1984, and the US team has never been so good.
Second, this team includes three athletes, Simon Bails, Gabby Duglas and Laurie Hernandez, who are inspired by many girls of new origin.
People can be proud that this team also includes Alija Raismane, who is Jewish and Madison Kociana, who is Catholic.
Finally, this team truly represents America.
It has also strengthened the participation of black and Latin American athletes in this sport.
For the last four years, the best gymnast is an American of African origin.
Last year, Simona and Gaby took 1st and 2nd place.
These are impressive results.
In the previous Olympics, Gabby Duglas was surprisingly the Olympic champions, and America was able to rejoice.
Now the world has seen incredible exercises performed by triple world champions Simona Bails, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, performing unprecedented but skillful exercises.
On Thursday, Simona became the fourth American in a row to win a gold medal for individual women.
This is the first time I’ve ever been in the United States since the beginning of the 20th century.
We have seen the best that this sport can give, but in the rest of the country the situation during gymnastics hours is completely different.
Simon, Gabby, and Laurie entered the Olympic team as well as Aliya and Madison.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
Gymnastics is in fact an expensive sport. Gymnasts mainly train in private athletic clubs, and they are maintained by parents who pay for training, premises, trips, uniforms, hotels (coachs, athletes and their families) and other expenses.
Most of these athletic clubs are located in urban areas that can afford this sport.
In these clubs, athletes spend all their trainings, and this is an expensive and long contribution to athletic families.
It’s been a long time since I’ve been here.
We need to provide young girls inspired by Simona, Gabija and Laurija, with cheaper gymnastics.
I established my athletic organization 20 years ago.
My organization is located in Harlem, and we offer more than 15,000 gymnastics for young people (mainly black and Spanish) free of charge or at a low price. We have also trained national and international champions.
In September, we will open a branch in Detroit, my hometown, to provide local youth with the opportunity to get to know this great sport.
Athletes develop strength, flexibility and body coordination, as well as learning hard work, discipline and striving for a goal.
This combination provides a long life with good health and success, both at school and at work.
This team will inspire thousands of young girls to train in athletics and it is fantastic.
This sport is very important, especially for young girls.
This is a very exciting time.
Thank you to Simon, Aliya, Gabby and Madison for the excellent demonstration of the Girls’ Force, winning the gold medals of the Olympic Games and motivating countless young girls of different origins to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
It’s not just a matter of time, but also a matter of time.
Ministers hoped to put an end to the dispute by reaching an agreement on changes to the agreement with representatives of the British Medical Association, however, it was rejected by 58 percent of the 37,000 young doctors who took part in the vote.
In July, Hunt announced plans to conclude a contract, stating that the NHS is in a state of instability and that further delay will only harm workers and patients.
The first new doctors have already signed a new contract, which provides for changes to the conditions for work at night shifts and weekends, in order to improve working conditions during non-standard working hours.
Last night, BMA new doctor spokeswoman Dr. Elena Makourta announced that young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed treaty, especially that it will deepen the labour crisis and does not provide for a level playing field for all doctors.
The remaining eight weeks until the first group of new doctors sign the new agreement, so progress should be made, because there is not much time left.
BMA’s efforts to resolve the problem through negotiations have been faced with the government’s unwillingness to engage and sometimes with complete silence.
This happened despite the fact that Jeremy Hunt said last month that his door was always open.
Jeremiah Hunt must act immediately, stop inaction and work with new doctors.
If he does not, then the new doctors are ready for new protests.
During the last strike, more than 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits were postponed at the end of April, while nurses and consultants tried to replace doctors who had gone on a picket.
The ministers hoped to put an end to the dispute by reaching an agreement on changes to the agreement with representatives of the British Medical Association.
BMA wants to raise the rate of work on weekends for 54 000 new doctors covered by new contracts.
Daniel Mortimer, Executive Director of NHS Employment, called on young doctors not to go on strikes.
Mr Mortimer explains that strikes do not solve anything, but only increase pressure on busy workers and worry, cause stress and obstacles to patients, carers and their families.
In the last two months, we have spoken with the Committee of New Doctors and together with the Ministry of Health and other institutions, we have responded positively to their questions about guardians and rapporteurs.
Employers expect active cooperation on other important issues, such as employee placement, flexible training, additional training for those returning after a career break, training costs, mutual recognition of training programmes, study leaving and gender pay inequalities in medicine - show that employers, England's health education institutions and the Ministry of Health are serious about implementing agreements concluded with BME in November, February and May.
The drug for 2 pounds per day can reduce the risk of heart attack.
Thousands of patients with a history of heart attack could be treated with a dose of 2 pounds per day, as official representatives recommend taking it more in humans and for a longer period of time.
The anti-reclamation drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attack in people with heart disease.
This medicine is already prescribed for use for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of recurrent heart attack.
The NHS-represented NICE recommends using this preparation for 4 years after a heart attack, in order to further reduce the risk of heart attack in people with cardiovascular problems.
However, at present, NICE under NHS is recommended to be used for 4 years after heart attack to further reduce cardiovascular risk.
Every year, about 140,000 people in England experience heart attack, and a quarter of them experience a repeated heart attack or stroke.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
If the blockage breaks, it can cause a clot, blocking the blood flow to the heart and causing a heart attack.
In turn, if the clot separates from the wall of the blood vessels, it can go further into the bloodstream and block blood access to the brain, causing a heart attack.
People who have had a heart attack are at greater risk of re- heart attack.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the name Brilique, reduces the risk of blood clots.
The new NICE guidelines published today recommend that people take 90 mg of Ticagrelor for 12 months and another 60 mg twice daily for 3 years with aspirin.
Professor Kerola Longson, Director of NICE Health Technologies, explains: “Despite the availability of medicines to prevent re-heart attack, more than a quarter of people who have had a heart attack experience another heart attack or stroke, often with severe consequences.
Fear of repeated heart attack can have a negative impact on the quality of life of a person.
Evidence suggests that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin effectively reduces the risk of recurrent heart attack and infarction in people who have experienced it.
By recommending treatment with Ticagrelor in advance, we are pleased that we can expand the treatment options for thousands of people who are thus beneficiaries.
Given the limited information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor, in particular the risk of bleeding with this medicine for more than three years, the draft guidelines do not recommend taking it for longer than this deadline.
The culture of political correctness promotes electoral fraud in Muslim communities
According to the management report, Lutfur Rahman, the former mayor of the city of Tauerhamlet, was dismissed in connection with corruption.
The government report reveals that the culture of political correctness is turning its eyes on large-scale fraud in Muslim communities.
Former Minister of Government Sir Erik Pickl criticizes police, electoral supervisors and city councils for ignoring signs of fraud in the election process because “fearing to offend ethnic and religious interests”
The former community secretary, who has now become the head of the anti-corruption organisation, says that intimidation of voters for religious reasons is so common that police should allow the deployment of guards at electoral stations to protect the intimidated voters.
He also recommended that voters should present an identity document when they vote to prove their true identity.
At present, voters only need to indicate their name and address.
He even recommends that the fingers of the voters be marked with a special ink to prevent double voting.
The rapporteurs should also provide greater protection, says Sir Erik.
He believed that the press should have more access to Council documents and decisions taken by informal committees and working groups.
He says: “It’s not only a matter of preventing fraud in elections, but also of protecting the local government from a wider culture of corruption and fraud that goes hand in hand with it.”
The report was commissioned by Downing Street following a scandal in the Taverhamlet city elections.
Last year, a special electoral court decided to remove the mayor of the city Lutfur Rahman from the office of mayor of the city due to corruption and illegal activities.
The court found that Rahman “cynically perverted” the religious view of his Muslim community and silenced his critics by accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
“Rahman has led his election campaign with the stance that the religious duty of Muslim believers is to vote for him,” he said.
About 300 votes were fake or dubious because one person had voted repeatedly.
It is also important to note that there are signs of fraud across the country.
He pointed out that fraud in postal voting was particularly worrying, where senior members of Muslim communities forced others to vote for their desired candidates.
Sir Erik recommended a series of measures to improve the electoral system, including the presentation of an identity document, in order to clarify the identity of the person.
His report says: “The evidence shows that vulnerable members of ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, are forced to vote on candidates chosen by the community’s oldest, especially in the Bangladesh and Pakistan communities.
“There are concerns that district authorities do not pay attention to these problems due to political correctness, because ethnic and religious interests could be offended.
Sir Erik set out 50 recommendations to improve the electoral system, which also includes a ban on political activists working with votes passed by post in order to prevent vote-gathering.
The report, which is being examined by Theresa May, also calls for a more thorough verification of the registration in order to prevent electoral lists from being used to fraud immigration and benefits.
Consider asking voters to present an identity document before voting.
Mark the fingers of the voters with a special ink to prevent double voting.
Systematically check the nationality of the person to make sure that the person has the right to vote.
Set a three-year limit for requests for automatic postal voting.

In 2016, fans of the Rio Olympics were excited about the French biker Pauline Ferrand Prevot, whom fans found to be extremely similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But a 24-year-old biker is not the only athlete who fights for gold this summer, who, according to media, is proud of his celebrity companion.

In the United States, a member of the men's circle shooter team, Breidy Elison, caused a storm in a tweet when photographs were published, where he was very similar to Wall Street Wolf.
It’s been a long time since I’ve been here.

The Canadian channel CBC was forced to apologize because one of its commentators commented that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer had “come out of the race, that he had died alone – and “ended like a pig”
This is the first time I’ve ever been in a relationship with you.
McDonald, who was included in the CBC’s commentary team to give the comments vitality, said: “The little fourteen-year-old from China is unable to keep up with it.”
“When she got too caught up, she flew out of the race, that she smelled alone and ended up as a pig,”
Thank you very much.
The result of the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhana in the second stage was 1:57.79, which is 1.61 seconds slower than the result of Canadian Taylor Ruck, allowing Canadians to reach China.
The viewers all over Canada immediately responded to the internet because they were shocked to hear such tone and expressions.
It’s important to know that you can’t be alone in this situation.
Idiot did not realize that they were still in the direct air.
Ai Yanha of China at the 4x200m freestyle final was named “little fourteen-year-old from China who does not keep up”
The criticism against Bairon McDonald quickly came into effect, as many asked for explanations.
Twitter users were not able to believe when they heard Bayron McDonald’s insensitive comments.
Twitter user Sarah Paradi wrote: “Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and because of you, we all sound like racists.
Soon after, Scott Russell, who led the CBC live at the time, apologized for McDonald’s comments, saying: “We apologize that the comment on the result of swimming appeared in the live air.”
It was an unsuccessful choice of words and we are very sorry that this happened.
The CBC apologized to more than 90 people who had responded to this comment on Twitter.
This is the first time I’ve been in the United States since the beginning of the 20th century.
The CBC then copied an apology to more than 90 Twitter users who complained about McDonald’s comment.
The channel also quickly published an apology and a statement.
We regret that the following comments were made and they came to the direct air.
Yesterday we immediately responded and apologized to all live viewers and followers on social media.
For the sake of clarity it should be said that Bairona's comments were made about the performance of the swimmer, not addressed to her personally.
But they were in any case unprofessional and unsuccessfully chosen statements and Byron is very sorry for what happened.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald personally apologized in the live air and tried to explain that he did not think that his comment would be perceived as a personal attack.
In the CBC Olympics, he said: “I would like to take the moment and apologize for the comment I made yesterday after the women’s freestyle competition.”
I am talking about the performance of the swimmer, not about him personally.
Needless to say, I didn't think I was disrespectful, and I'm really sorry that this happened.
It’s not that I don’t know what to do, but it’s that I don’t know.
It’s not easy to say that I’m not going to be able to do anything.
In addition, it is important to note that there is no risk of developing a disease.
She continued to look for clothes in the Folkston Bouverie Place shopping centre store and held four more panties.
The Primark store in Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone – a place where this woman kept underwear and then put it back on the shelf.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
She said that people couldn’t believe their eyes.
It is also important to note that this is not the case in the United States, but in the United States.
She didn’t even try to find a more discreet place to measure them, she just kept them on the spot.
Everyone looked at how she took off the panties and apparently the woman did not like them, because she just put them back on the shelf.
She looked at three more panties until she decided that she didn't like them and left the store.
It did not seem to worry that someone would look or think about someone who would buy the clothes she would wear.
Miss Davidson (33 years old) from Kent says: “It is the thought that someone will buy clothes that have been worn by another person and that have not been washed away.”
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidsone adds: “I assume that store workers took out these clothes from the shelves of the store after she left, which is also acceptable.”
I can't imagine buying a new underwear and finding out that another woman has missed it and then they're not washed.
The Primark representative pointed out that Primark was known for the incident that took place on Tuesday, August 9.
The specific clothes are removed from the shelves of the store.
How to protect yourself from firearms using Krav Maga
The world is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer.
To find out how to protect ourselves in a close distance from the attackers with a gun, we talked with the great master of Krav Mag from New York Rhone Mizraki.
Whether you're being attacked from the front or back, this video shows you how to protect yourself and get the lead over the attacker.
The bark indicates that if the attacker attacks from the back, then first it is necessary to turn to clearly see the attacker and avoid the shot trajectory.
Then the weapon should catch between his front arm and shoulder and make a blow in the face of the opponent with his free elbow.
Then follow the blow with the knee through the groin and while the attacker is stagnating in pain, take away his weapon, hit his face with a spout of weapon and step away, continuing to turn the weapon against him.
If the attacker approaches the front, the situation is similar - avoid shots of the trajectory, grab the weapon and fold it so that the evildoer can not shoot.
At the same time, pressure should be put on the weapon and a blow on the opponent's chest and finally take off his weapon and step back while continuing to target him.
Sounds complicated?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizzaki does it.
But remember, if you're not the master of Krav Mag, then it's safer to give your robber your money back.
The Vandal family is excavating Saltash Cornwall's social house and is laid on the street.
The Vandal family has been put out of residence for terrorizing neighbors, causing damage to a social home of £50,000.
Tanja Skeldon and her partner Shon Trebilkok justput out of the property in Saltash Cornwall, because several complaints have been submitted about them.
When they were forced out of the property, shocked representatives of the housing service found that the property was completely demolished.
The walls and walls had bulging holes, waste was thrown everywhere, and the walls were covered with graffiti.
The family is now laid out of property and most likely lives in a private property.
Donna Makevoja, the manager of Cornwall Housing, says that there is a concern that the housing will not be able to be restored.
She tells us that people who lived here were extremely difficult and she believes that people cannot live there.
In this case, several factors need to be considered, since in future this property in Cornwall will not have a good reputation.
This family is famous and their name is well known.
The couple had three sons who were periodically in possession and the police said their terror manifested itself as violence, blasphemy on the street with baseball sticks, intimidation of the local population, drug use, drug sales and loud groaning and laziness.
In June, the 47-year-old Skeldon, whose name was owned, was sentenced to death for anti-social behavior.
In a number of demolished rooms, plastered waste was found.
In a house where drugs can be traded in advance, several floorboards are also drawn.
The neighbors say that they regularly married on the street and are constantly called police.
The Cornwall Housing Service forced them out of the property when they were given 11 weeks to leave the house on a voluntary basis.
The desperate neighbors were very happy about the eviction, because their life was an absolute hell.
One said: “They didn’t care about other people.
We lived next to them for 20 years, it has always been crazy.
Unbelievable how often we have seen the police here.
We couldn't sleep this morning.
We woke up because it was so quiet - we are not used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, it's going to be wonderful.
Adam Fitzpatrick, who is the Head of Neighbourhood Protection for the Cornwall Housing Service, said that the family did not cooperate with local security authorities.
The family has lived here for 20 years and is regularly referred to as the police.
In the home-grown garden, various old and unused items were found.
He also said: “It is a great pity that tenants did not show any responsibility for their behavior, because eviction from home is always the last step considered by Cornwall Housing Service.
This was a very difficult case, because their behavior was extreme and their neighbors were very hard to watch.
I appreciate the work that my entire team, the Devon and Cornwall police and community members have invested in this case, who were brave and worked with us to provide the necessary information.
I hope that this event will make the lives of neighbours easier and show that antisocial behaviour is unacceptable.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
The staff of the service will now have to clean up a pile of waste left in the house.
In 2014 the police house was searched and found more than 70 grams of marijuana, scales, accessories and 1700 pounds of cash.
Skeldone was only found guilty of storage of Class B drugs for the purpose of distribution.
She insisted that the money was meant to commemorate her son, Lee Sheldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
It is now known that they are renting some private property in Plymouth.
There were graffiti on many walls of the house.
Police say they will continue to lay out tenants who violate their rental agreements.
I’m not sure if I’m going to be able to do that.
She also said: \"This is a warning for those who believe that they can behave as they wish and will have no consequences for them.\"
The Devon and Kronwall police do not accept criminal and antisocial behavior and the police will continue to work with our partners to protect local communities.
Preparedness to spend can give a boost to the economy.

The mayor of Cannes banned burkini swimsuits on the beaches.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
The mayor of Cannes, David Linard, has signed an order that “access to beaches and swimming is prohibited for anyone who does not wear a swimsuit that respects good customs and secularism, as a fundamental principle of the French Republic.
“A beach suit that extraordinarily shows religious affiliations at a time when France and places of worship are the target of terrorist attacks can create a risk of public order disruptions (faults, clashes, etc.) that need to be prevented,” the order said.
“We are not talking about the prohibition of wearing religious symbols on the beach, but about the extreme clothing associated with trust in the terrorist movements that we are fighting with,” said the municipal communal services manager, Thière Miguls.
He added that burkini swimsuits on the beaches of Cannes have not been seen since July 28, when the right-wing member of the Central Party, Republican, Linar, signed the order and entered into force.
This week, the water park in Marseille cancelled a planned private event for Muslim women who would have dressed in burkini swimsuits, because the indignation about such an event was expressed by politicians from both the right and the left.
In France it is forbidden to wear masking Muslim women's hats, but religious symbols or appropriate clothing are not prohibited.
On 14 July, 85 people were killed by the Islamic State group in the nearby resort town of Nice.
On July 26, two of the attackers, who had committed an oath of loyalty to the Islamic State, brutally murdered a priest in a church in the northwest of France.

The first night of the meeting was visited by groups such as Enter Shikari from Britain, which was expected last year, but disappeared without notice from the program, the American punk NOFX-DJ Maxim from The Prodigy and others.
In the next days of the festival, the programme also features notable words – “Guano Apes” and “Garbage” punk legends – Ramones – drummer Marky Ramone’s Blitzkrieg – with Belarusian punk leader Sergey Mihalok, popular Georgian actor and singer Vahtang Kikabidze, Ukrainians – Vopli Vidoplyasova – and a series of other, but full program of the event can be viewed here.

The British Trek Cycling team doubles the Olympic record and wins the sprint.
The British Trek team on Thursday amended the Olympic record twice and won the sprint race for men.
The first Olympic record was corrected by the British in qualification, but in the first round of the competition it was repaired by the New Zealanders.
The British team met with New Zealand at the Sprint Final, and the British took away the title of owners of the Olympic record for the New Zealanders, leaving them with silver medals.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
In the fight for bronze, the French team beat Australia.
It’s important to note that the record was also corrected in the qualification of the women’s career trip – the British team corrected the world record, which is now 4:13.260.
The President, who remained in the shadow: Gustav Zemgal - 145.
It’s been a long time since I’ve been here.
It’s a great way to make sure that you’re getting the best possible results.
It’s not that I don’t know what to do, but that’s what I’m looking for.
In conversation with the portal Delfi-Auziņš emphasizes that Zemgale is one of the rare high-ranking politicians who have had a sense of humor.
The rest are so stiff, always very correct.
He taught him not to be, nowadays it could be similar to what Raimonds Vējonis is.
“He was the one who was close to the people,” says Auziņš.
It is also important to note that this is not the case in the United States, but in the United States.
It’s the only person he’s ever shouted at in government meetings was General Balodis.
Even if in pictures he was kind and smiling, by nature he was hysterical.
“The earth with its sense of humor and democracy leaves the exact opposite impression,” says Auziņš.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
He also noted that Zemgals paid tribute to minorities, regularly invited Jewish representatives to the Presidential Palace.
“At that time, it was not a common practice, after the Zemgale Presidency, Alberts Kviesis took over this tradition,” says the historian.
He was such a quiet and weighed man, whom he had long had to pretend to be president.
He did not seek for it himself, he simply did not hunger for fame.
He was also quite critical of himself, because he did not know the French language, but believed that the president must understand it.
“During the presidency, the basics of the French language were learned,” explains Stranga.
It’s a great way to make sure that you’re on the right track.
In all respects, he is a very respectable personality in the history of Latvia, before entering the presidential palace he was in a serious position - he was a very demanded notary.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
He was always progressive.
There was no great lover of Ulmanis, but he was also not publicly opposed.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
He lived a peaceful life, there was no suspicion of irregularities or corruption.
How do you remember Zemgale today?
It’s a good idea to take care of yourself.
He was an absolute democracy, and the beliefs were central.
“There were no major shocks during his time, that is, he could associate himself with such a truly stable presidency, in the summary of Stranga.
During the Presidency of Gustav Zemgals, from 1927 to 1930, the visit of the Latvian state to Sweden took place, which indirectly meant to Latvia at the time full recognition in the neighboring country and integration into the Northern European democratic nation family.

The answer of King Gustav V of Sweden was to Latvia on 29 June 1929.

Simple ways to help a child cope with anger attacks.
I often have to face the fact that the anger of a child, the appearance of anger, is seen by parents as something wrong and unpleasant.
When a child openly shows his anger - we do not know how to react, \"Econet\" says psychologist Ekaterina Kessa.
The specialist encourages to a small conversation about these so natural and human feelings - anger and anger, which is periodically experienced by everyone.
Aggression - it is already a physical activity directed against another person, and it usually appears when you feel angry.
When we adults are angry, excited - we usually know what is happening to us and how to deal with it.
We can express our anger and anger in ourselves: to express, suppress, hide, keep in ourselves, tell about it to our friends or other relatives, we can slip a sofa in anger, smoke a cigarette (this is not the best way to dispel anger!), enter the shower, sew a bullet on the table and do other things that we usually do not do.
We do not target our aggression against others because we know different ways to deal with these emotions.
Children, when they are caught up in anger, do not understand what is happening to them, how to name them and how to live with them.
They can say, \"Go away, you're a fool,\" \"bad mom,\" \"I don't see you,\" \"I won't be with you,\" and very rarely, when you can say, \"I'm angry with you.\"
Children live in the literal sense, they are completely located right here, at this moment, they are spontaneous and truly show their own feelings, and often also are in the trap of various emotions.
It is very important that parents do not forbid a child to show feelings, including anger, not to be ashamed of it and not to cry, but on the contrary - to help the child.
Do you need a pause in your relationship?
A spirit working day, where everything hasn't gone as you would like, or just bad mood - there are so many reasons why I would like to go for a moment, a day or even longer -- to go off from all over the world.
It is also possible to inhale the relationship for a moment and breathe a little?
Or does it show that each of the partners has their own path?
In his views, the gentlemen share at different ages.
John (23) is short and succinct: “In my view, if you need a pause in a relationship, then don’t be with the real person –
In the meantime, Eduards (30) has discovered a scheme that could possibly help someone.
If you feel that your partner is starting to fall on your nerves for every little trifle, then definitely - this is the right moment to explore other hunting fields to understand if you lack her, or especially if you don't think about her or even don't want to see her anymore.
So the answer is yes, keeping a pause can help save time and understand how important the second half is for you.
Caspar (29) reveals his theory.
I think that we have to keep a pause from each other on a daily basis, because if you spend time with a person 24 hours a day, seven days a week, then disputes are inevitable.
They are caused by the fact that you notice every trifle that the other does, and it begins to fall on the nerves.
People start to bother each other, especially if there is nothing else to talk about, just what you have done during the day.
My personal experience makes me think so, so I haven’t been in a relationship for more than a couple of months.
If you think for a moment about the fact that somewhere else or next is better - then why is this woman, with whom you are together, deserving someone who can think that there is not enough here and there are paradise fields behind the mountains?
Thinking is a little betrayal.
If not, then not.
\"I have, therefore, a little condemn those who do not,\" said Edmund.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
I think everyone needs a moment to relax.
You can't look at each other's eyes every moment, all the time, from morning to evening, and rejoice at the unfailing love.
Get out of here!
There are so many things - friends, work, parties.
Everything has its time.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
That's it.
It’s important to remember that you can’t be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be in a situation of conflict.
If this question sounds, then it should be borne in mind that in the near future there will be some change - to the right or to the wrong side, it depends on yourself.
I think that while you are still young and crazy, you still need to pause - although all the time, but when everything remains serious and the relationship goes into a completely different phase, then there can be no talk about rest.
You decide to spend your whole life together!
“If you can’t tolerate each other’s society right now, and once upon a time you need to breathe, then what will happen when you’re retired, who are commenting on how passers-by cats have any disputes about which day the garden should be better seen,” explains Kristaps (19).
All the words of the lord have been changed.
With its enthusiastic and exciting personality, Rozentāls was the first to awaken interest in fine arts in the Latvian nation.
“In this sense, he was the first love of the Latvian people, which as such will remain forever unforgettable – so Roman Suta wrote as the old Latvian painter Janis Rozentāls.
In 2016, too, when opening the grand master’s extensive retrospective exhibition in the restored main building of the Latvian National Museum of Art, it is clear that Rozentāls is the first love of Latvian art.
The exhibition was opened on 12 August, but from 13 August it is open to visitors and will be open until 30 October.
The Latvian National Museum of Art with its extensive retrospective in the newly opened Great Exhibition Hall honors painter Jani Rozentāls (1866-1916), whose one hundred and fiftyth birthday on an international scale is included in the UNESCO celebrates day calendar.
The retrospect exhibition, which includes more than 150 works, is one of the main events of Janis Rozentāls’ annual programme.
The selection of works of art is mainly made from the collection of the Latvian National Museum of Art, which convincingly represents the main stages and genres of the classic’s creative activity, stylistic variability and diversity of techniques.
In addition, exhibits from the Akseli Gallena-Kallela Museum, the Museum of Literature and Music, the Liepāja Museum, the Museum of Tukums and several private collections in Latvia and Finland were used.
The atmosphere of centuries-olds is revived by the presence of photos, the mobile application of the exhibition reveals individual works of art in association with photographs taken by the painter for the sake of creativity with his own camera.
The Finnish-Latvian Society of Friendship – Rozentāls-seura – named after a Latvian classicist, offers small informative exhibitions at the Latvian National Museum of Art – With a look in Finland, with a heart in Latvia – the first stop.
A similar exhibition with a presentation of the content in English, Finnish and Swedish will be opened in the “Virk” gallery in Helsinki in autumn.

The US models business behind the scenes in his interpretation have gained a perverted glamour of a sophisticated photo session and the hatefulness of a horror film.
Basically - a very provocative, balancing work on sophistication and banal vulgarity, in which the boundaries between European art house films and the territory of the Hollywood genre product can be easily removed.
The film with Vigo Mortensen in the main role emphasizes the question of whether the conceptually chosen lifestyles of parents (ecologicalism, vegetarianism, alternativeism and exclusion from the glut and values of the consumer society) bring blessing or destructiveness to their children.

This survival soloumor can be compared to a demonstration of James Frank's performance in the film for 127 hours and Ryan Reynolds's game in the film Aprudence live.
It is also possible that Mila Kunisa, the main figure of her role, is to blame, whose transformations from the role of a model mother into a creative resident and almost family-value commemorator seem to have been created only by the fantasies of the desperate Hollywood scriptwriters.
The Islamic State has captured 2,000 civilians in Syria.
The Islamic State fighters of the terrorist group, fleeing Menbiza, in the Aleppo province of Syria, have captured about 2,000 civilians used as a shield, the US-backed Kurdish and Arab alliance and observers said on Friday.
“We were not shooting at them because they took civilians with them when they fled to Jerabulus,” said a spokesman for the Kurdish Menbige Military Council.
After two months of fighting, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (QSD), a U.S.-backed Kurdish-Arab alliance in northern Syria, announced on Friday that Menbiza was freed from jihadists.
The Islamic State of Menbizu took over in 2014.
The QSD raised the majority of Menbiza fighters last week, but some stood still and showed strong resistance.
However, on Friday they left the city, taking the prisoners with them.
Islamists go to Jerabulus, which is located on the Turkish border.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), based in London, reported that “Islamic State” has kidnapped about 2,000 people.
Sohr reported that Islamists stole the cars of the city's inhabitants, forced people to defeat them, and then took them to Jeraculus.
The Islamic State fighters have also previously carried out mass abductions.
In January, Islamists kidnapped more than 400 civilians, including women and children, in the Deir ez-Zor province of eastern Syria.
Later, some 270 of the prisoners were released by Islamists.
How many Islamic State fighters have escaped from Menbiza, it is unknown.
A spokesman for the Kurdish Menbiza Military Council reported that QSD managed to rescue 2,500 people held captive by Islamists in Menbige.
The information collected by the SOHR shows that at least 437 civilians, including 105 children, have lost their lives in the battle for Menbiži.

In the event that her candidacy would be confirmed in the government, it is clear that this would not be a convincing vote and would not allow to fully work and implement the necessary changes in the SRS, feeling the support of the whole government.

The Freeport of Riga has implemented all recommendations of the VK regarding the Russian island project.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
The approval of the project is planned for the next meeting of the Freeport of Riga Board.
In order to implement the recommendations in accordance with the opinion of the VK, preparing the necessary documentation for the implementation of the recommendations, the Freeport of Riga Authority was also guided by the conclusions of the legal and operational audit carried out by the International Auditor at the Freeport of Riga Authority and the recommendations provided to improve project management in the next phase of the project.
Information on the implementation of the recommendations has also been sent to the CC today.
Although the Freeport of Riga Authority disagrees with the opinion prepared by the VK on the effectiveness of the implementation of the Russian Island project, we are very responsible for the implementation of the project and the provider of funding - the European Commission (EC).
I would like to stress that all the planned construction works within the project have been completed in full within the specified time limits and in the planned amount.
“To prove to all those involved in the implementation of the project, including the EC, the VK and also the Styvidors that the main aim of the Freeport is to successfully implement the project, we have fully implemented all the recommendations of the VK regarding project management and monitoring issues,” says Sanita Kaire, Project Manager of the Russian Island.
The long-term action plan for the control and monitoring of the achievement of the project goal was supplemented with the main planned activities of the parties involved and the necessary decision time limits, definitions of meetings and regular reports and their time limits, tools for monitoring the planned construction process, as well as definitions of the most important border points.
The approved action plan to achieve the project goal by 31 December 2018, in accordance with the recommendations of the CC, has been supplemented with performance monitoring activities, thus strengthening the control of the activities of other parties involved in the implementation of the project from the Freeport of Riga side.
A project management plan has been developed to improve project management and mitigate potential risks by defining project management areas and specifying the developed documents that provide a control and monitoring mechanism for each of them.
A project management structure scheme has been developed to increase project capacity, which reflects the planned project management team structure, qualification of employees and functions.
In order to improve communication between the Freeport of Riga administration and the parties involved in the project, a project stakeholder communication plan has been developed, which, in addition to the parties identified in the project action plan, defines the stakeholders for successful completion of the project, principles, types and periodicity of information exchange.
In turn, in order to improve the control of the use of financial resources, it will be necessary to justify in more detail the need for the conclusion of a service contract or the initiation of procurement and the rule of law in the future.
Within the framework of the project, the port infrastructure conforming to the world standards - four new deep-water piers, railway connections, as well as engineering communications have been built on the Russian island.
The constructions co-financed by the Cohesion Fund have been completed and put into operation already at the end of the previous year, achieving savings of EUR 10.6 million in funding for it.
As a result of the threats, security at airports in Slovakia was enhanced.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
“Given the threat, we have stepped up security measures at international airports in Bratislava, Poprad and Košice, a spokesman for the Slovak Ministry of the Interior told AFP on Friday.
“The National Security and Analysis Centre is currently analysing the information we have received, he added.
In the Slovak capital, an informal European Union (EU) summit will take place on 16 September with the participation of all the bloc countries except the UK.
The meeting will discuss the consequences of the Brexit referendum and discuss the future of the EU without Britain.
Slovakia is the EU Presidency until January.
German researchers are discussing the number of victims of the Berlin Wall.
According to a new study, the number of deaths at the border of the former East Germany could be much higher than previously thought, but doubts about the true number of victims still remain.
According to the data transferred to the Berlin Wall Museum on Wednesday by Checkpoint Charlie, 1841 people have been murdered by the Communist authorities of the later West Germany and tried to get out of their controlled territory between 1945 and 1989.
The museum has been investigating border-related deaths for years and adjusts the number of victims from time to time.
This year, another 11 deaths were added to the list, including a six-year-old boy who drowned when the family tried to get to West Germany through then Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
There are also Soviet deserters among the new victims of the Berlin Wall.
“The final extent of harm caused by the double evil of communism and socialism has not yet been fully documented,” says the museum director Alexander Hildebrante.
“Our task is to ensure that the graves of those who died trying to escape the Communist-controlled state are maintained and not lost,” said Hildebrandt’s statement.
However, other researchers have already questioned the new figures.
“The figure in 1841 is unconvincing, Johen Stat, an expert in East German history at the Free University of Berlin, says in an interview with Süddeutsche Zeitung.
He and other researchers from the Free University of Berlin are currently reviewing suspected deaths at the border, and so far they have managed to confirm only 260 cases.
In the past, researchers estimated that only 138 people were killed by the communists at the Berlin Wall.
In the light of those who have died trying to escape the Baltic Sea or to reach the West through the territory of neighbouring countries, according to the State, the number of victims could reach about a thousand.
However, it is not much less than 1841.
One of the reasons for the different number of victims could be different methodologies.
Checkpoint Charlie Museum also lists all suicides of East German border guards, regardless of whether they were directly related to their service.
The museum also lists deaths not related to direct violence.
“If seniors aged 70 to 80 died of heart attack after shrinking with border control, it must be the consequences of this murderous border,” says Hildebrante.
However, Schtat is convinced that a distinction must be made between the old folks who may have died as a result of their experienced treatment and those whose death was caused by long-term waiting in a hot bus at the border.
It is not easy to record victims, however, because the Communist East German authorities did not collect such statistics, and researchers have to send documents in various scattered archives, according to the State.
However, the Shata Group has recently come up with new documents and could therefore come up with a new estimate of the number of victims in the near future.
LPF President Mr. has gone to Rio with coach accreditation; it’s a surprise.

It’s a great way to make sure that you’re getting the best results.
Mr. President, who is a member of the LOC Executive Committee himself, strongly criticised the activities of the LOC, denouncing the blame for the monitoring organisation of Olympic sports.
In my opinion, it is unethical for the LOC Executive Committee to approve five persons and not to take one of them.
“I don’t know why the Swimming Federation was not enough,” he said, saying that the work of the Federation and its presidents was not evaluated in society, reminding the presidents of the federations that they are not receiving salaries.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
“I’ve been nominated as president of the federation – Team Leader, but for unknown reasons I’ve received coach accreditation and now I don’t go anywhere inside.”
The situation changed every day, the number of accreditations available changed.
I think until the last moment that Germans will have, because I did not have any other information.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
It is also important to note that there is no need to use this medication for any reason.
The President of the Federation expressed that issues of laziness are also very important in Latvia, and he also talked about such programs when he was in Rio de Janeiro for almost two weeks.
He praised the work of the Federation and expressed that in 2018 Latvia could face the World Cup stage.
It is not my vacation in Rio de Janeiro, I work here, spend my time and try to implement four-year programmes.
In the Daugava there will be 600 000 salmon cubs.

“In the measures to protect and reproduce fish resources, every activity is aimed at environmentally friendly actions in close cooperation with the scientific institute Bior, carrying out both the production and introduction of fish toddlers in the Daugava basin and carrying out other activities,” said Kuņickis.
This year, more than 600 000 annual salmon and time cubs will be introduced into the Daugava griva.
In the second year, the juveniles of fish are marked before they are introduced, cutting off the fatty tissue.
The cargo delivered today contains 25,000 salmon pups with an average weight of 31.3 grams.
Every year, the scientifically justified composition and number of species in the Daugava and its water bodies of the basin are introduced into the fish juveniles and larvae.
It is important to note that this is not the case in the United States.
In turn, the State Environmental Service, on the basis of the above-mentioned expertise, shall take a decision on the amount and type of compensation.
The annual compensation amount of Latvenergo in the programme for the restoration of fish stocks is EUR 1 035 000.
In the spring of 2016 Latvenergo in cooperation with the association “We Fish – for the fifth year place 400 nest of artificial fish in the Daugava near Kaibala and Ikšķile.
Cooperation with the association, promoting the natural spawning of fish, is additionally supported by the initiative of Latvenergo within the framework of the programme for the restoration of fish resources.
The placement of artificial spawning nests in the water storage facility is an important measure that contributes to the protection and reproduction of fish resources in the Daugava.

The Reid claims that if Clinton is elected President, she will appoint Garland as a judge of the Supreme Court.
The leader of the Senate Democratic Party, Harry Reid, is convinced that if she becomes president, she will nominate Merika Garland as the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.
The Senate Republican Party has blocked the approval of Garland since President Obama nominated him in March.
The leader of the Senate majority, Mich Maconnell, announced that the next president would choose who will replace the current Supreme Court judge Antonina Skalia.
It’s a great way to make sure that you’re getting the best results.
The Raid spokeswoman later stated that he had not personally talked about the subject with Clinton and that it was only speculation.
He praised Garland and said that the Clinton team wouldn’t want to sew a boat with a different choice.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the Appeal Court of the District of Columbia of the United States.
The Reid said that the Republicans blocking the Garland nomination are \"inlays\" and act in the interest of the Republican Party presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also said that Trump was not fit for the president's office.
Treats announces a bald calendar for women and men.
The magazine Treats will work with photographer David Belmer to create the 2017 Pirreli calendar in the 1970s style.
In its 2017 NU Muse calendar, it is planned to show new supermodels, not naked celebrities.
At the beginning of this year, the magazine Treats President Steve Show announced that his erotic art magazine is different from the old-fashioned Playboy because “Playboy is a men’s magazine.”
This magazine is for women.
It seems that he is also talking about the calendar.
In a press release on calendar creation, Show says: “We have to return to the imagery of immeasurable and classic nudity, where the woman’s body does not confuse, but inspires both women and men.”
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a great work of art.
Models can send your photo electronically or personally to casting sessions in Los Angeles and New York.

Greenland shark is the longest live vertebrate - video overview
Scientists claim that Greenland sharks have the longest life span of all vertebrates on our planet.

The French court rejects the request to break down shops in the Jungle refugee camp.
The French court rejected the call by the Calais authorities for the destruction of dozens of self-made shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, home to thousands of refugees.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
In Calais, the Prefecture Office pointed out that these self-established enterprises must be demolished because they form a shadow economy and do not pay taxes, as well as create fire and sanitary risks.
The humane group explained to the court that these small businesses are essential because the food provided by the government and support groups does not provide for the needs of the camp, in which the number of residents continues to increase.
They also pointed out that self-made shops and restaurants often offer free shelter and food for those who need it most.
The Court of Lilles ruled that there is no legal basis to expel people who have created 72 self-made shops, but it understands the concerns of Calais Prefec.
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food, coffee and restaurants play a greater role than simply providing food for people living in \"extraordinary circumstances\"
He pointed out that these places were peaceful places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places at risk of demolition is the Jungle Book Kids camp, which provides more than 200 free meals a day, English and French classes and provides asylum advice to hundreds of vulnerable minors without adult assistance.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition for the protection of a children's cafe.
In a letter to the Guardian, the closure of the cafe would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are just 8 years old.
On Friday, two charities, “Help for Refugees” and “L’Auberge des Migratory,” reported that the number of residents of the “Jungle” camp has increased to 9,000, the highest rate since the rapid influx of migrants in the summer.
The United Kingdom wins silver in the Rugby-7 series of battles, when the Fijian government skillfully wins gold.
It’s not just a matter of time, but also a matter of time.
Fiji demonstrated a master class in the management of the ball, the balls play with their feet, support in the game and brutal strength in the game, fighting gold - the first Olympic medal in its history.
The defeat brought an honorable prize of comfort - the silver medal, which was Britain's third medal that day. The British team can boast of their success in the first Olympic Rugby-7 tournament in which they won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
It’s a great way to make sure that you don’t have to worry about your health and well-being.
But in any case, Fiji is currently in its best form to win the team of 15 men.
Although unlikely, however, there may be some comfort for Britain that at least one brit got a gold medal. This is the main coach of Fiji team Ben Ryan, a former English coach from Wimbledon.
For Britain, it was an exciting adventure.
Eight years ago, under the leadership of Ryan, they lost all the games of the Rugby-7 series in Adelaide.
This time they lost only one game.
The defeat is painful, but growth is amazing.
Fiji impressively started a match, repelling British power techniques for joy.
It was like a race with several buses ahead and World Series champions led by 5:0 when Osea Kolinisau got the first landing.
In the last four minutes, Jerry Tuwa has also increased the majority by implementing the right-wing landing.
The result is 12:0 and the British team did not really touch the ball.
This is not the first time I’ve ever been to the United States.
In the seventh minute of the game, Jasa Veremalua got a landing in the right corner, strengthening the majority over the United Kingdom until 17:0.
After the match, Nakarava increased the majority even further and had more than a minute left until the end of the first half of the year.
Vatemo Ravouvou avoided some clumsy British techniques and crossed the line to score points.
This is the first time I’ve ever been in a relationship with you.
It seemed that Fiji was born to play Rugby-7 matches while the British are still learning.
In fact, it is also true.
The British team made a major change in half-time by breaking the Fiji player line... full four minutes, which after the first half-time standards was good until Joshua Tuisov, after a fantastic team game, scored a few more points for the Fiji team.
It’s a great way to make sure that you’re getting the best results.
Do not be surprised by Fiji’s joyful attitude.
It’s a great way to make sure that you’re on the right track.
It’s a great way to make sure that you’re getting the best results.
In the first half of the day, Fiji defeated Japan with a score of 20:5, while the British were superior to South Africa, where both teams lost only a few points in a very fierce battle.
In the first half of the year, Naked Brown raised Boxing under the command of the teams, but in the second half, Den Norton crossed the line with brilliant craftsmanship and delivered the ball between the poles, providing the British with victory.
Markus Watson, a brother of England Rugby-15 team player Antony, provided the team with victory and another silver medal at the end of the game.
It’s a great way to make sure that you’re getting the best results.
It will be the most emotional gold medal in these races and it already expresses a lot.
From the first to the last cancer, the golden moment of Helena Glover and Hetere Staning played a special role in the Estacio da Lagoa.
Although there are only two athletes in the boat, they were accompanied by Robin Williams’ echo, which inspired them to get the second Olympic gold medal in rowing for women, becoming the first women in British sports history to achieve such success.
They do not doubtless dominate, because for the 39th time they gained an unsurpassed, unprecedented victory.
The two great athletes with swan elegance, moving across the water surface, do not fully reflect this triumph.
It’s a great way to make sure that you’re on the right track.
According to him, it disappeared as quickly as it appeared.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of those that can be operated and it happened.
If not, it would spread throughout the body.
And the situation would become uncontrollable.
This changes your vision a little.
Williams was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
This trio was lucky that William could start the recovery procedure at the beginning of the 2014 season and reduce the duration of the break to a minimum, if possible.
I needed income, so I had to recover quickly.
This stimulated recovery.
I was in the hospital, and I walked a distance of 6, 10 and even 15 metres, although the doctor said it would be enough for a few steps.
That's how it all started.
Airing itself is a challenge, but this time it was even bigger.
After the victory, the first idea was about Williams, who was very worried all morning and spoke more than usual under the influence of excitement.
Stanning, who served in the Royal Artillery Unit in Afghanistan, said: \"It was an emotionally tough week, but it means a lot to me --
This only confirms how much it means to us and how much I, Helena and Robin have worked.
The last 3 years with Helen and Robin have been great.
Without Robin we would not have achieved anything, so huge thanks to him, he is the best coach in the world.
I can't think of a better coach or a better coach.
Helēna Glovere and Hetere Staning have not lost any race in five years.
The couple reaches such a huge speed that competitors can not compete with.
Even in the last 500 metres, when teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, the predominance of Stanning and Glover was too high.
We felt every moment.
Helena screamed: “Saves your rhythm, saves your rhythm
It is really important not to lose focus.
We managed a good start, but at the same time we did not have high expectations.
We had no intention of breaking the record on that day, but we just had a good ride and win the race, and we did it too.
A couple of years will rest to decide what to do next.
The next month will be the wedding of Glover and TV adventurer Steve Bashal.
So far, she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean that this was my last race.
It would have been too much pressure.
In London, it took me about six months to understand that I was an Olympic champion.
It was a new experience and I was very excited.
This time it took about four minutes.
She said, \"The feeling is fantastic.\"

In Spain, the possibility of reducing the deficit is threatened by the inability to create a government.
On 12 July, the European Commission (EC) issued an opinion that Spain and Portugal have not taken sufficient measures to reduce their deficit to 3% of their GDP required by the euro area.
According to estimates, despite the austerity measures implemented, Portugal's budget deficit was 4.4% of GDP at the end of last year and 5.1% in Spain.
However, the European Commission decided not to impose economic sanctions on both countries, while setting fiscal targets for the near future.
One of the reasons why the EC did not impose sanctions against the two countries is that Euroscepticism is growing in many European Union countries.
Additional sanctions would only increase such negative mood.
Critics point out that the EC has no consistency in its decisions by agreeing on uniform rules from the outset and failing to apply them in life.
For example, the President of the German Bundesbank, Jens Veimmann, pointed out that Europe was losing confidence in itself, giving citizens the idea that European Union rules are recommended rather than binding.
The EC has now proposed and all Member States have approved an extension of the deadline for the correction of the deficit until the end of this year for Portugal and for Spain by 2018.
The European Commission promises to check progress made by both countries in the coming months, while noting that both Spain and Portugal must be prepared to introduce additional austerity measures if circumstances so require.
The initial projections show that Portugal could achieve its target within the time-limit set and that the budget deficit could fall to 2.5% of gross domestic product this year.
This means that, as part of the Stability Programme, the government of this country has to implement austerity measures of 0.25% of GDP this year.
These measures should be included in this year's budget, with an additional focus on controlling the costs of purchasing goods and services.
In the case of Spain, the situation is much more complex.
This year, the budget deficit has to be reduced to 4.6%, to 3.1% next year and 2.2% of GDP in 2018.
In addition, consolidation measures should be 0.5 % of GDP annually over the next two years.
The fact that for eight months already, the Spanish political parties have failed to agree on the establishment of a government, makes it particularly difficult to achieve these objectives, and the possibility that Spain may already have to hold an early parliamentary election for the third time in a year is increasing.
But public opinion polls show that the political picture of the third election in the country would not change significantly.
The most popular party is still the current popular party led by Prime Minister Mariano Rahoi, whose election will again receive less than 33% of the votes.
It’s been a long time since I was a kid.
The People's Party wants to get socialists and \"Ciudanos\" involved in the government this month, otherwise it will not be possible to adopt and submit to the European Commission for approval the draft budget for 2017.
As announced by Rafael Hernando, a representative of the parliamentary group of the People's Party, if the government is not set up and parliamentary elections are still held for the third time, Spain will become a laughter for the whole of Europe.
The cleanliness of beaches in the Gulf of Riga is critical.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
The most polluted bathing sites are directly in Riga.
The city council explains that bathing sites are cleaned every day, but fighting against dirty visitors is quite difficult.
In addition, land-based waste can be rinsed during rainwater, thereby significantly damaging its quality.
In addition to Liepaja beach and certain places in Kurzeme, the cleanliness of beaches elsewhere in Latvia is critical.
Such a statement has been distributed this week by the volunteers of the campaign \"My Sea\".
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
Unfortunately, this year, this critical assessment has come into play.
“We see that this will be the year when the number of waste on the beach 100 meters may even exceed 200 units,” says Jānis Ulme, representative of the expedition “My Sea”.
It’s a great way to make sure that you’re on the right track.
This year, even daylight bulbs left in the sea sand were collected among the activists of various household waste and picnic remnants.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
“The main source is the beach visitors themselves, because more than half of the total waste is plastic, various waste, starting with bags, plastic pieces that are already in the process of degradation, they can no longer be identified, and dumps, bottles, corks,” says Ulme.
Among the dirty beaches there are also bathing sites in Riga.
For example, almost 800 pieces of waste were collected in the Daugava every hundred meters, which is critically high.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
“The average number of all three bathing sites in Riga together - the Daugava, Western Bulls and Vecnieki - unfortunately comes big and far exceeds the desired goal, or goal, to which Latvia is moving, to reduce the number of waste units to 135 units by 2020,” concludes the environmental defender.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
However, the fight against dirty visitors is quite difficult.
We are returning to the cultural issue of these people.
“For those who love, drink, smoke and do all those things that are not allowed, even special signs do not work,” says Vidkis.
This is why Vidkis invites bathing visitors to report pollutants to the police as well.
Can be called police, safely point to these violations and thus everyone fight.
Maybe you can put some new warnings, but as I said, it is unlikely that this will radically change the situation.
“As everyone together simply has to approach and be intolerant of such offenders,” he said.
In the meantime, water quality measurements have been carried out by the Health Inspectorate for the fourth time this summer, which can impose a ban on official bathing sites.
This year, as in other years, the quality of water is good and satisfactory everywhere.
The situation is that in all 56 bathing sites the quality of water has always been good and there are no restrictions on bathing.
“For the last time, we will take the analysis at the end of August,” said Normunds Kadiķis, Senior Environmental Health Specialist of the Inspectorate.
During heavy rains, waste left on land can be rinsed into water.
This, in turn, can affect its quality, according to an environmental specialist.
Rotations in the Russian elite continue - change of head of Putin administration.
Did he leave the office?
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
In his announcement of the change, Putin gave his congratulations to Ivanov in front of television cameras: “Dear Sergey Borisovich, we have been working with you for many years and are doing it successfully.
I am pleased with how you fulfill the duties entrusted to you.
I remember well about our agreement not to use you in this post of Head of the Presidential Administration for more than four years.
Therefore, I treat with understanding your desire to change the field of activity.
And I hope that you too will make full use of your knowledge and experience in the new position.
However, it is highlighted that the administration of the President is a very important position and this made Ivanov one of the most influential people in the country.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
This is the first time I’ve been in the United States since the beginning of the 20th century.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
Ivanov has been an ancient and close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He started his course at the special services in 1975, where he met Putin.
Later, as Putin became the head of the Federal Security Service, Ivanov became his deputy.
The first Russian President Boris Yeltsin was appointed Secretary of the Russian Security Council at the end of his reign.
In 2000, after Putin came to power, the “Information Security Doctrine” developed by Ivanov was approved, which, among other things, provided for the revitalization of state censorship mechanisms in Russia.
In 2001, Sergei Ivanov became the Minister of Defence of Russia, but already in 2005 he was deputy Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov and was responsible for the development of Russian defence industry companies and arms exports.
Now, after the departure of the head of the President's administration, Ivanov will also retain his seat in the Russian National Security Council, where the new head of the President's administration, Vaino, will now work.
It’s a good idea to take care of yourself and your loved ones.
It’s not that I don’t know what to do, but that’s what I’m looking for.
Anton Eduardovich and I have known each other for a long time.
Even from the days when we worked under your leadership in government.
And in the last almost five years, we have been in touch practically every day.
“That is why I am convinced that after all his professional and personal qualities he is ready for this work,” Ivanov said.
The fault comes from the family, which belonged to the elite of the Soviet party.
His grandfather Karl held high positions in the Estonian Communist Party, including his first secretary for ten years until 1988.
The internet publication Meduza, referring to the book Estonia’s self-determination and independence, writes that at the end of the 1980s Karl Vaino asked Moscow to give permission to use force against participants in demonstrations.
However, he received a refusal and soon lost his position.
Soon after, Vaino has moved to live in Moscow.
Anton Vaino has graduated from the Moscow Institute of International Relations and manages Japanese.
However, he has left the diplomatic service to work in the administration of the President's minutes.
It is also important to note that this is not the case in the United States.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
One of the main features - more and more often in the leading positions are representatives of the structures of strength.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
This was the first battle, and the Latvian judo fighter concluded his participation in the Olympic Games by finishing in 17th place.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
He also discovered that the judo fighter had suffered a shoulder injury in the fight.
It is important to note that in order to get on the Olympic road sign, Nikiforenko had to start in a different weight category than usual - namely, in the weight category up to 100 kilograms.
The Azerbaijani wrestler was 25 kilograms heavier.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
This is why Latvia’s judo competition in Rio has been closed.
Dreams disappear in the sand of Rio.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
Yes, he had a more titled opponent on his side, but ambitious ones are sometimes able to make a surprise.
He didn't get it.
It’s a great way to make sure that you’re getting the best results.
The result was similar, although he stayed on the tatami for almost a minute and a half longer than Borodavko.
It’s been a long time since I was a kid.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
It’s not that I don’t know what I’m going to do.
But if they don’t, they won’t.
And that's the federation's prerogative.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
Flight far from reality.
In the evening we were looking forward to the beach volleyball match Samoilovs/Smediņš - Evandra/Pedru Solbergs.
Intrigued as already \"deaths\" in the group - for losers of the game ended.
It’s a great way to make sure that you don’t have to worry about your health and well-being.
The tension was compounded by the long previous game.
No one wanted to die - this feeling over the windy card boiled throughout the match.
For players, the groaning wind created additional difficulties.
At first it seemed that it could be an ally of ours - which is more comprehensive.
But he didn't.
It was quite simple to play against the Latvian duet here.
Serve so much to Samoilov and wait for him to break.
In the end of the first set and in the beginning of the third set, the load was not a joke.
It’s a great way to get to know someone who’s not afraid of you.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
The third was already in the sign of Evangelical servitude.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
It’s a great way to make sure that you don’t have to worry about your health.
It was also a mistake for Kreilis, and quite symbolically, that the last ball in the block was hit by him.
The team is losing.
This time, there was also a lack of luck - in the third set, only two Evandra attacks almost flew out of the card, but the ball still hit the line.
Two walks were next to the line.
The video also decided in favor of the opponents.
If in the first two games Evandra suffered with servitude, then they were very productive against us.
All together, we put together a loss on the table.
Now, the causes of failure must be calmly analysed.
It may have been necessary to live as many as possible next to the stadium, not together with a delegation in the Olympic village.
It took two and a half hours on the road.
Perhaps a little self-confidence was given by a series of seven semi-finals.
You may not have had to play in Clagenfurt, but come here faster and acclimatize better.
It may have been a failure to find the top of a sporty form.
So far, more questions than answers.
Our beekeepers have finished the game.
The dream of medals is over.
What's next?
There are still some World Cup tournaments left and also Jurmala Masters
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
But this is not necessary either.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
It is not difficult to make a decision, but it will be much more difficult to find a worthy partner in Latvia.
It’s a great way to make sure that you’re able to get the best results possible.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
Copacabana sand did not smile at them this time.
That's it.
It is also important to take into account the fact that beach volleyball is becoming more popular, new pairs come into circulation, and only for the rare one is less than two meters.
This does not yet guarantee success, but is an essential argument in the fight for victory.
We don't stay longer.
It’s a great way to make sure that you’re getting the best results.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
It’s also a part of the beach volleyball players who have visited the hotel in Copacabana.
This time, high prices were demanded for modest accommodation offered by journalists.
Therefore, the choice also fell on the rent of the apartment.
The risk is, because sometimes they can be uncomfortable from a logistical point of view.
This time the risk is justified.
Together with Vladimir Vladimirovich, we rent apartments on the border between Kopakabana and Ipanema.
The beach is 200 metres away, on the bikini arena for half an hour.
The district is safe enough, because the bedside of the favel, however, the alertness should not be lost here too.
It is not what some immediately imagine, but the most professional sports journalist in Russian media Vladimir Ivanov.
P.S. It seems that on Friday morning another dream of medals was dreamed.
In the 100-meter race and high jump, Laura Ikauniece-Admidiņa lags behind her personal records.
But there are still five disciplines.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
In Latvia, opera “Porgy and Bess” was first performed at the Latvian National Opera in 1973.
Since then, the internationally recognized masterpiece has not been repeatedly performed.
That is why the organizers of the Cesis Art Festival and the Liepaja Art Forum decided in close cooperation to give the audience the opportunity to enjoy George Gēršvin’s masterpiece.
“It’s a great pleasure for us that after ten years, when Liepaja was last able to enjoy an opera production, this great version of the concert studio by George Gēršvin-Porgy and Bessa, is to be enjoyed with us at the new, newly opened concert hall “The Great Amber”, says Baiba Bože, the head of the concert hall “The Great Amber”.
Opera-Porgy and Bess is a vivid musical story about love, its volatility, passion, as well as domestic tragedies and simple daily joys.
It reflects African-American vitality, music and rhythm.
It is this lack of political correctness in this opera, this exclusion of tolerance makes it so lively.
“And yes, this love story is extremely strong, extremely beautiful and somehow really deep,” says director Viesturs Kairiss.
What I like the most - listening or playing this opera, there are always such stops - famous melodies, famous motives, but these transitions from one character to another, highlighting one character or another character, or choirs or orchestras.
“It’s the most exciting, this building – opera is appreciated by opera’s music director and conductor Andris Poga.
The visitors of the opera agree that this is a grandiose event.
They are very happy to hear this world-famous Guerschwin opera.
Happy that you can feel the breath of the world in Liepaja.
“The performance professional – the opera is rated by the visitor Edgars Lāms.
It was a special concert studio with the fact that for the first time in the orchestra’s pit, the orchestra was played at the new open concert hall “The Great Amber” and for the first time an opera concert was performed.
The area could be named Janis Rozentāls on behalf of the renovated building of the Museum of Art.
It is also important to note that this is not the case in the United States, but in the United States.
It’s a great way to make sure that you’re on the right track and that you’re on the right track.
The city of Riga has placed a kind of foundation for this idea in 1936 by creating a Burkards Dzenis monument for Janis Rozentāls, who stands next to the museum.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
In this way, this further action could be purely logical.
This is the first time I’ve been in a relationship with you.
\"But if you, Mr. America, promise to think,\" said Lace.
It is reported that the building of the National Museum of Art officially opened its doors this May after an ambitious reconstruction and modernisation.
This week will finally begin the reconstruction of the VEF Culture Palace.
The castle will be renovated by SIA Velve for about 11 million euros
It is planned to renovate several palace rooms, including two viewers' halls, as well as to adapt the building to people with reduced mobility.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
“Despite the political will to start repairs of the VEF Culture Palace by attracting European Structural Funds, it is, we are waiting for months for a decision, real action from officials of the Ministry of Finance, will have its money allocated or not – says Burov.
Last December we were told that everything depended on Brussels.
Two weeks ago, the Ministry of Finance received a letter from the European Commission that you should make your own decision that Brussels does not take a decision here.
We are now seeing another circle of discussions being formed again, well, then we will see what we can expect in the coming days.
It’s important to know that you can’t be alone in this situation.
It is also important to note that this is not the case in the United States, but in the United States.
Although a year has passed, renovation of the building was still not started and collectively continued to work under inappropriate conditions.
In the strategy of the Riga City Council Property Department, the renovation of the VEF Culture Palace is divided into sets of seemingly independent reconstruction works, where each will ensure the implementation of different functions of the castle.
The first is increasing the accessibility of the VEF Culture Palace and improving the surrounding area.
It is intended to arrange the surroundings and engineering communications, as well as to restore the facade of the building.
The second is to improve the offer of the services of the VEF Culture Palace.
It plans to restore the interior, walls and ceilings of the building, improve the stage and sound recording studio, as well as arrange internal engineering communications of the building.
The third - improvement of creative amateur collective working conditions, which includes plans to improve workshop equipment, space heating and ventilation systems.
Before the 40th anniversary, you can get acquainted with the legendary rock band at the exhibition in Liepaja.
The exhibition will show various objects describing “Līvus” - photos arranged in a time line to reflect the group’s activities from the beginning until 2010 when the group’s activities are announced.
In addition, participants’ stage costumes, musical instruments, awards and concert recordings, as well as other things that have not yet been seen by the general public, will be shown, which reflected the creative activity of the group “Live”.
The exhibition will be supplemented with items of the Liepaja Museum collection.
The visual design of the exhibition was created in cooperation with fashion artist and painter Elita Patmalnieki.
This is the first time I’ve been in the United States since the beginning of the 20th century.
“Līvu” – the beginnings are searched in 1972, when a vocal instrumental ensemble, led by Juris Pavitolis, is created in Liepaja Culture House.
The ensemble has participated in the festival Liepājas amber in 1972 and 1974, as well as in city and republic shows.
In 1976, a fateful meeting took place, when Juris Pavitolis met Eriks Ķigelis and Metalurgs in the cultural castle founded the group, inviting to join Ingrids Gutmanis, Andris Krūzins and Jānis Grodums.
Over the years, the composition of the group has been felt more than once.
The participants have joined, others have gone their way, some have returned.
However, the most important thing - the desire to confirm that Latvian rock music is able to live and exist - has remained unchanged.
“What to see was not lacking – jeans, hairy and beards, these boys differed from the generally accepted stereotype of the gourmet song – musician Claude Vāvere says about the group.
In addition to the above-mentioned musicians, such outstanding musicians as Igo, Vilnis Krieviņš, Modris Šterns, Valdis Štarks, Laimis Rācējs, Tālis Pusbarnieks, Ainars Virga, Aivars Brize, Guntars Mucenieks, Dainis Virga, Tomass Kleins and many others have worked in the group.
Entrance to the exhibition free of charge.
The exhibition is open from 19 August to 30 October.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.

Annual average inflation after PCI, in the last 12 months (August - July 2016), was -0.8% compared to the previous year.
The consumer price index was 101.9% in July 2016 compared to the previous year and average monthly inflation was 1.0%.
Since the beginning of the year, the inflation rate was -0.2% (July 2016 compared to December 2015) and the annual inflation rate was -0.2% in July 2016 compared to July 2015.

Many are already on the way to the celebration of the reception of the Blessed Virgin Mary in the heavens in Aglona.
What message will believers receive this year?
In recent years, the desire to lead the main worship service in Aglona has been expressed by Pope Nuncis.
The content of the main message is therefore also in his hands.
It is also a kind of tradition that Bishop Jānis Bulis drives the Way of the Cross.
He will also make his own message.
I run the festive vigilian worship on the previous day.
Last year I focused on Pope Francis’ encyclical “Laudato si” and updated the common house, the Earth theme in the context of Latvia.
This year... of course, I'm watching what's happening in the world, and I'm trying to respond to it in my own address.
My approach coincides with the church’s recommendation that the Gospel message should be put at the heart of life.
It must be shown that the Gospel responds to the most painful problems of human life and gives him inspiration for the way ahead.
Then it addresses people.
But in Cesis, in the Lamp's discussion, you said that \"it is necessary to return to the understanding of the full man -
What do you understand?
Does this mean that a person is avoiding a church message?
And does the church have a resource for such a return today?

The Kolegova’s explanation of the withdrawal of candidacy in connection with the contradictions in the ruling coalition is due to the fact that she has prevented the fall of the government.
In a conversation with the agency LETA, he found it difficult to imagine that next week at the government meeting “Unity” would support the candidacy of Koļegova.

This year, the number of residents in Riga has decreased
In the beginning of this year, there were 638 784 residents in Riga, which is 0.34% less than in 2015, when 641 000 residents were officially registered in the capital, the Central Statistical Bureau (CSP) informed LETA.
In terms of population, the capital of Latvia ranks 30th among the capitals of the European Union (EU) countries and the largest cities with a population of more than one million.
According to the data of the EU statistical office Eurostat, Riga has the highest proportion of women - the capital of Latvia is firmly placed in the first place among the largest cities of Europe with 127 women per 100 men.
All three Baltic capitals have the largest share of women in Europe's largest cities: in Vilnius they are 123 and in Tallinn 121 women per 100 men.
A warning icon will be placed next to the LNMM.
In the next few days, warning signs will be placed near the Latvian National Museum of Art (LNMM) - icons, Baiba Gailite, a representative of the Riga City Council Property Department, told LETA.

This summer, Riga municipality has installed two more new playgrounds in the city, Ķīpsala and Čiekurkalns, which are already available for children.
There is a large, multifunctional toy ship on the beach of Ķīpsala with a variety of climbing elements, bridges, games, truffles and slides.
The play area is designed for children of all ages.
The area is also equipped with swings and various balancing elements.
The world of fantasy for small sailors is marked by the location of the attraction on the banks of the Daugava with a view to the passenger port and the visible cruise ships.
In turn, a playhouse, trampoline, step track, balance bridge, swings, play balls and other elements of the game, as well as a gymnastics area with circular strength and coordination exercises, co-extreme sports elements, etc., are installed in the playground between the 4th and 5th cross-line of Čiekurkalns.
Under the square a rubber cover is applied in different colors.

In the hunts, the reconstructed section of the road was discovered.
The Minister of Transport Uldis Augulis, management of the State Roads of Latvia (LVC), as well as representatives of the builders SIA-Binders and local governments today opened the reconstructed section of the main road of the state (Grebneva) -Rēzekne-Daugavpils-Lietuvos border (Medumi) (A13) from Medumi to the border of Lithuania (156.4-163,05 km).
Roads are a national business card, especially border roads, so it is a special pleasure to discover a reconstructed section on the border with our southern neighbours.
This is another example of how the situation on the main roads of the country is improving thanks to the co-financing of European Union funds.
“As forecast, during this planning period the funds available to roads will be acquired already in 2018, and we need to think about how to continue maintaining the most busy roads in very good quality, and also to ensure the mobility of the population in all regions of Latvia without funding from the European Union – turning the symbolic tape stressed by Uldis Augulis.
The Minister of Transport also indicated that the proposals prepared by traffic experts on sustainable financing of Latvian roads will be presented to the government in the near future.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
The cost of reconstruction is EUR 13.5 million (including VAT), the project was co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
“In the reconstructed road section, the road construction has been completely restored and next year repairs will be started in the next stage from Medumi to Daugavpils itself, so the entire road from the Lithuanian border to Daugavpils will be arranged,” said Jānis Lange, Chairman of the Board of LVC.
The country's main roads are the most busy, and by 2018 we plan to have all the main roads in the country in good condition.
The next task will be to maintain them in good quality, providing timely periodic maintenance and to make a replacement of the asphalt top layer every 7-9 years.
“This will, of course, require adequate funding, and all travelers look forward to the proposals developed by the expert group to arrange the road financing system,” said Lange.
During the project road connections and lighting were arranged in the Medumi center.
Significant land works have been carried out: four stages of large-scale de-icing and large-scale dug and erupted works, leveled road long profile, which until now was very uneven.
It is also restored public transport stops and a new turn-around area for public transport has been built.
In the past, the road had insufficient load and the terrain of the area was not transparent due to mountainous valleys, as well as the old way of common terrain.
In the next construction season, it is planned to restore the road section from Daugavpils city border to the now reconstructed section (144,80-156,40 km).
This year LVC plans to perform various types of works more than 1,100 kilometers of national roads.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
“To achieve the desired results of weight loss, the right choice of food combinations is very important,” admits Lithuanian nutritionist Laura Romeraite-Kukleriene.
In addition, it is easy to do in the summer period, when fresh fruits, berries and vegetables grow in our own gardens.
A combination of thoughtful diet products can help not only reduce excess weight, but also purposefully promote various processes in the body.
This is the first time I’ve ever been in the United States since I was a kid.
Studies published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition have shown that vinegar has a beneficial effect on blood glucose levels and helps us feel like mundane.
Cayenne pepper and protein-rich food, such as poultry or protein cocktail, cause not only a feeling of satiety, but also reduce the desire for large meals in the next meal.
This combination of dishes is also able to increase the amount of calories burned after a meal by up to 35%.
Studies show that Cayenne pepper can help get rid of fat in the abdominal area.
The egg contains a metabolism-promoting nutrient - choline, while paprika is a good source of vitamin C.
It’s not just a matter of time, but also a matter of time.
A porridge of oatmeal, accompanied by fresh berries, is another delicious and fat-burning meal for breakfast, which is worth adding to your menu.
Oat flakes and berries contain fibers that, according to Canadian scientists, control the feeling of hunger and therefore grelin - an appetite-stimulant hormone.
In addition, berries contain polyphenols, which are helpers in weight reduction, as well as prevent the formation of fats.
Vegetables and proteins are also able to perform wonders in weight reduction.
Such a combination is able to create a feeling of satiety.
Vegetables contain water and fiber, therefore contribute to the feeling of satiety.
At the same time, proteins slow down the digestive process and provide a feeling of satiety for a longer time.
In lunch, you can eat chicken with salad or cook a protein cocktail from the finished mixture and enjoy it together with your favorite vegetables.
Avoid any combinations of products.
The fruit contains sugars - monosaccharides or disaccharides - compounds of one or two molecules.
On the other hand, starch contained in vegetables is polysaccharide.
The fruit breaks down mechanically in the stomach, while chemically they do not break down until reaching the third or fourth degree in the digestive process that occurs in the intestine.
The starch breaks down into three different stages, which begins already in the mouth.
Therefore, it is important not to eat sweet food immediately after a meal.
When you eat sweet food immediately after a meal, it is blocked in the stomach with other dishes, where it is not chemically digested and begins to rot.
Do not eat bread, potatoes, peas, bananas, dates or other carbohydrates with lemons, lime, oranges, grapefruit, pineapple or other sour fruits.
The enzyme pthialine, which is present in saliva, acts only in alkaline environments.
Fruit acids inhibit not only the digestion of carbohydrates, but also contribute to their fermentation.
Do not eat eggs and meat, nuts and meat, cheese and eggs or cheese and nuts, meat and milk, eggs and milk or nuts and milk and similar combinations of protein-rich products in one meal.
It requires a variety of digestive juices, each of them with different strengths, features and the time when it is necessary to get into the stomach.
Watermelon, honeymelon, nutmellone and other melon should always be eaten separately from other dishes.
Melons are not digested if they are in the stomach together with other foods.
Fat in combination with protein-rich products.
The fat forms a successful combination with starch, however, the same can not be said for fats and proteins - fat prevents the digestion of proteins.
Proteins can be combined with a very small amount of fat.
If a large amount of protein-containing products is consumed, avoid the use of fat at all.
This also applies to freshness - it is not recommended to combine large amounts of nuts (contains proteins) with whole avocado (contains fat).
This combination inhibits effective weight loss.
How better to cook?
“Food preparation, heat treatment cause significant nutrient loss – about 15% to 55% of the original nutrient composition of the products – says the nutritionist.
In most cases, nutrients go lost by cooking foods in water.
However, the nutritional value of some foods increases directly by cooking.
It is recommended to use the remaining liquid for making soup after cooking the vegetables - in this case, you will not lose nutrients that are left in the water, and you will be able to eat them later.
It is recommended to cook vegetables, including when steaming them.
Thermal treatment significantly increases the bioavailability of lycopene in tomato composition.
When cooking tomatoes for 30 minutes, the amount of lycopene increases by 25%.
Heat treatment also significantly increases the bioavailability of betarotene found in red, yellow, orange plants such as tomatoes, carrots, sweet potatoes and spinach.
The heat treatment of eggs and meat deprives the natural properties of the proteins contained in them, making them more easily digestible.
Also, the heat treatment of meat and eggs makes the iron and other minerals contained in these products easier to absorb in the body.
It should also be borne in mind that freezing of products can reduce the amount of vitamin C from 10% to 90%, while freezing of fiber does not affect.
Bean in combination with tomatoes can increase the intake of iron in the body, which in turn ensures better brain and muscle function.
Our body absorbs up to 33% less non-bloody iron found in plant products such as beans, leafy greens, cereal products than bloody iron found in animal products such as beef, fish and chicken.
You can significantly increase the absorption of non-bloody iron in the body by taking non-bloody iron-containing products in the diet together with vitamin C sources such as oranges, tomatoes and berries.
Vitamin C helps to change non-bloody iron so that our body absorbs it more easily.
Iron is necessary for the production of hemoglobin, which ensures the transfer of oxygen to the muscles and brain.
To get the maximum benefit from salads, add healthy fats to them, such as olive or linseed oil.
When preparing sandwiches with salmon, add with vitamin D-rich salmon or sardines an additiveless yogurt, which is a good source of calcium.
Vitamin D increases the amount of calcium absorbed into the intestine and plays an important role in the process of bone formation.
Oats (as well as other whole grain products) together with sources of vitamin C such as strawberries, blackberries, raspberries and other fruits or berries help to stabilize cholesterol levels, as well as avoid blockage of the arteries.
The effect of Snapchat Anime on Asian Caring
Snapchat representatives say that this filter is inspired by animation, but some commentators argue that it is racistly insensitive.
With this lens effect, Snapchat allows 150 million users to change reality in a rather absurd way every day and play with their identity.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or an image that would fit into Roy Likhtenstein's painting.
Lenses are foggy, image distorting instruments that generate more than 30 million transformed selfies per day.
Any error quickly becomes visible to the public.
The effects of Snapchat lenses have already been criticized, receiving accusations that the application promotes too blackish or light shades of facial skin as a benchmark of ideal beauty.
This week, the new effects of lenses were published, allowing users to create the eyes of solitude, the teeth of solitude and round cheeks, and some critics called it racist Asian caricature - \"yellow gems\"
The question was also whether such contradictions did not indicate that the company had greater problems with diversity.
News and public negation erupted on Wednesday, when The Verge and Motherboard reported that the effects of the lenses had been removed from the application.
The company explained that the objective of the lens is to depict the images of Anime, not to fight the people of Asian origin.
However, in people who had experienced racism, these effects resembled painful stereotypes.
Others categorically denied the similarity with Anime.
In a letter to a Korean-American art student, Grace Sparapani, she said that the effects of the lens were “offensive and uncomfortable to say no more” on Twitter.
She added that it is difficult not to notice the apparent similarity between Asian cartoons and lens effects.
This indicates that the effect of the lens is not just a yellow face, but a yellow face in the sense of racism.
Snapchat is not the only company that has fallen into these cultural traps.
American culture is also involved in the endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood and the devices we use on a daily basis.
And Snapchat's large audience of young people, representing different races, unlike older residents, is more sensitive to such things.
If Snapchat lenses create an image that offends users, then \"in modern times such things do not go unnoticed\", Katie Zhou, 25, said in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Product Manager Zhou deleted his Snapchat application and recommended that others do the same.
In her article \"Medium\" and telephone interview, she explained that she felt that the race problems were caused by Snapchat's employment policy, which was not enough to support racial diversity.
This is the first time I’ve been in the United States since the beginning of the 20th century.
“This means that the company does not have a variety of races, so such decisions are allowed. Whether some representatives of other races work in the company, but they do not take up such a position to be able to express their views safely and conveniently, according to the Chinese American Jou.
Others also agree with her opinion, while Snapchat has not responded to her complaint.
The company does not disclose how many employees represent different races, indicating that it is a private company.
Snapchat refused to discuss the origin of its employees, but its representative revealed that the company has awarded a staff specialist who will focus on the fact that the company also represents racial minorities, which are not widely represented and will promote inclusion in the company.
In turn, Zhou will not renew his Snapchat account, adding: “Interestingly, do they really need more users like us to understand that this is not right –
The Congressional Chamber declares that military officials have distorted reports on the Islamic State.
In a statement issued on Thursday, the Congress Chamber notes that the U.S. Central Command has distorted the reports, depicting the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria more optimistic than it actually is.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
The Central Command, known as Centcom, is a military base in Tampa, Florida, which oversees US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The latest news about this report says that intelligence reports, approved by high-ranking Centcom leaders, reflect the US fight against terrorism more positively than it actually is. The facts were regularly distorted by depicting better achievements than other intelligence analyses show.
California Republican spokesman Ken Calvert says: \"Centcom's action is unacceptable - our soldiers are those who suffer if our policy makers receive false reports -
Centcom management errors can be found in the top management of the organization.
This 10-page report shows in detail the current problems in the reflection of the Central Command and in the analysis of American efforts to prepare Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
Although this does not provide conclusive evidence that senior officials of the Obama administration would have distorted the reports, it shows that Centcom's leadership has put some pressure on analysts to show a more optimistic view of the threats posed by the Islamic State (also known as ISIS or ISIL).
The report indicates that in the first half of 2015 the press releases, statements and reports of the Central Administration to Congress showed the situation in a much more positive light than it actually was.
For example, Centcom’s representatives publicly announced that Mosul’s recovery operation could start as early as April or May 2015.
Mosula is Iraq's second largest city, still under Islamic State control.
Mike Pompeo, a spokesman for the Kansas Republican Party, said in a report: “The investigation over the past few months has clearly shown this:
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, U.S. central government chief officials distorted reports showing ISIS threats in Iraq weaker than they actually were.
The Republican Party set up a working group to find out that analysts are concerned that information about the Islamic State is being distorted.
As the investigation continues, the report published on Thursday will be followed by new findings in this case.
The general inspection of the Ministry of Defence shall carry out an investigation into the activities of the Centcom intelligence service.
The members of the Democratic Party of the Intelligence Management Committee published their own report on Thursday, in which they agree with some of the conclusions of the working group of the Republican Party.
Democrat spokesman Adam B. Shif said in his report that from 2014 to 2015, Centcom too limited the preparation of intelligence assessment reports on ISIS and the Security Forces of Iraq.
Mr. Schiff explains that this process – which has stopped the dissemination of information – has weakened the ethics of analysts’ work and “distributed facts that are untruthful to the truth”
But Schiff and Democratic party members added that there is no evidence that the White House has put pressure on Centcom analysts to produce reports, according to “pre-defined or political position”
The Daily Beast published the preliminary results of the congress investigation on Thursday.
In August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon General Inspectorate had launched an investigation following complaints from Centcom analysts.
It’s not just a matter of time, but also of time.
He also added that experts sometimes interpret complex data in different ways, and the Ministry of Defence and Intelligence calls for a constructive dialogue on vital national security issues.
The investigation is not limited to the question of whether the American-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is a success (a claim made by more and more representatives of the Ministry of Defence).
But last year's charges call into question whether President Obama can fully rely on reports from the Central Authority on military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and other hotspots.
The criticism of Islamic State intelligence is reminiscent of more than a decade-old events when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker published a study claiming that George W. Bush's administration launched the Afghan war, too little thinking about its possible consequences.
Hukher also played an important role in discovering the Islamic State's intelligence issue.
Last year, official representatives reported that the Huker team found that, unlike public reports, air raids to Islamic State oil factories did not significantly worsen the financial situation of the terrorist group, as they had built temporary factories to sell oil on the black market.
The Times reported in September that this discovery did not go beyond the borders of Central Management.
At that time, Centcom Commander General Lloyd Austin III received a sharp criticism because many lawmakers believed that war reports described the situation as too positive.
In April, General Austin was on vacation and General Joseph L. Votel came to his place.
In the US duel with the United Kingdom in women's field hockey, wins the USA, thus winning the fourth consecutive victory.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
Five goals in two games are an unforgettable achievement, but 27-year-old Bama said she couldn’t remember what she would ever have done.
She said, \"I have no idea -
I'm not from those people who count on their score.
But she knows that the American score in the Olympics is 4:0, which gives them in their group an indistinct with Britain, which on Thursday after the victory over Japan with a score of 2:0 remained unwinned.
The United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday to play the last match in the first round of games.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
The winner of the first place will be a little longer to avoid meeting with the strong Dutch selection, which is the leader of the second group.
It is also important to note that this is not the case in the United States, but in the United States.
This team also included Bama.
She grew up in Blubela, a field hockey stick she took for the first time in her hands at the age of 3 (her older twin sisters were already engaged in this sport in Dreksela) and joined the national team when she was 16 years old, becoming the most popular player in the history.
She was not in the 2008 Olympics because she was not in the finals.
But 2012 was a failure for her and her team.
The next year, Kreg Parham was appointed as a team coach and everything changed for the better.
Bama called it “cultural, mental and physical change.”
We did not invest as much in London as we are now.
We have changed everything.
In Thursday's game Bama revealed the result, winning the goal in the first half of the year with a rear shot from a close distance.
India started the game without victory in its account, but their selection was very fierce and kept a minimum score of 0:1 until the end of the third period, when Bama repeatedly scored the goal.
It’s a great way to make sure that you’re getting the best results.
In the middle of the fourth period, Melissa Gonzales won another goal.
This was the first dry game of the US Gateway Jackie Brigg, playing one goal in each of the first three games.
She's stuck.
And so is Bama.
“We’re going very well right now,” Paham said, but just how well will show the game on Saturday.
The most depressing dish of the depression period is “Fast meal”
In March 1933, shortly after the presidential election, Franklin Delano Ruzvelt sat in an oval room to hold a meal.
It’s a great way to make sure that you’re on the right track.
But on that day his meal was much more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, potato porridge and dessert - plum pudding.
Jane Ziegelmane says: “This is a way of solidarity in cooking with people who were very hard at work.”
Her husband, Andrew Kou, adds: “It’s also a message to Americans, how they should eat.”
The couple from Brooklyn Heights district are food historians.
Kou’s last book, “Girls Sew,” describes Chinese cuisine in America, while Ziegelmane describes life through a rental house in the eastern lower part of Manhattan.
Their new joint work, The Fast Meal, published by Harper on Tuesday, is a story about American food during the Great Depression.
In showing some solidarity in the culinary field, they held a meal together with the reporter, Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, at a simple lunch meal in the district of Flatiron, which has been in operation since 1929, when the great depression began.
I’m not sure if I’m going to be able to do that.
When the reporter ordered a fake hare, the couple admitted that his choice was very consistent with the conversation about the food of the Great Depression.
She said that the bunny was very popular.
There was a peanut hare, a liver hare and a bean hare.
They were prepared from the basic ingredients and other ingredients that enriched the meal.
Imagine, as it is - eat as many peanuts as possible, so that they are at lunchtime.
Mr. Kou was tired.
“It seemed safe that the belly was full of lead,” he added.
In pre-depression years, the American dining table resembled a Swedish table, especially in rural areas.
Women were prepared to eat to their husbands-workers and breakfast, and freshly prepared biscuits were served at lunch and dinner.
During World War I, it was the Americans who sent food to Europeans.
“At the time, food became the main focus of the American people’s daily life,” says Mr. Kou, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about this topic.
New budget diets were equally important: unknown foods such as fake bunny and stews became commonplace, stews were “a great way to use excesses,” noted Mrs. Ziegelmane, as the cooks could hide unattractive ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruits were replaced by inexpensive dried fruits.
The meat, which for years was the main ingredient of American meals, now became an extremely rare luxury product.
At a time when the number of calories and nutritional value of food was more important than taste, new, yet unseen formations were born.
In an ancient cookbook, Mrs. Ziegelmane found a recipe for cooking onions stuffed with peanut butter.
Mr. Kou adds: \"It was not a popular addition to the lunch table -
Mrs Ziegelmane stressed: \"It was surreal.
Groundnut butter and fried onion are incompatible.
Many recipes of homemade dishes applied to difficult times.
Household economists such as Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Household Economics from 1923 to 1943, determined the state’s eating habits that had not been experienced either before or after the Great Depression.
When publishing articles and recipes in newspapers and magazines, they advised housewives to become “economics” and accept challenges such as turning pasta and carrots into a delicious meal.
“Sufficient meal is a treat for historical delicacies.
Especially interesting are the testimony of the government’s attitude towards its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Huver’s “let me eat a cake” attitude.
Although publicly he told about his simple childhood and feeding in Iowa, he actually ate as a fine millionaire, whom he had become.
Mr. Kou says: \"He liked European cuisine, like a fish with cucumber sauce,\"
He ate in a nearly gilded living room, wearing a lunch jacket.
He was completely isolated from reality.
President Ruzvelt would have made the same mistake unless his wife Eleonora had advised him to set an example with his eating habits.
The book tells us that Rūzvelt has trained a homemaid who did not cook, and thus the White House became a place – where not only was one of the most delicious meals in Washington, but also the worst-boiled dishes –
As soon as the country’s economy recovered, most of the culinary signatures of the era of depression disappeared.
But we continue to pay attention to calories and nutritional values, as well as how to apply science in culinary, added Mrs. Ziegelmane.
The couple tells us that when writing the book, they gained a greater understanding of the eating habits of Mrs. Ziegelmane’s mother, for example, why she was unable to throw out the food.
“She was really afraid to throw out the food,” Mr. Kou said.
Mrs. Ziegelmane said: \"She actually shocked people -
Once upon a time there was an incident with wind cakes.
When we ate in Eisenberg, a couple of writers pulled out a homemade dessert from the bag: a plum pudding, which President Ruzvelt used to eat at lunch.
“This is plum whipped cream,” said Mrs. Ziegelmane, adding that at that time it was common practice to give a chic name to modest dishes.
It does not contain whipped cream, only dried plums, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
All impatiently soaked into the brown mass of the spoons on the plates.
Surprisingly, it wasn't so bad.
Mr. Kou ate a few more cubes.
He sounded like an experienced economist and said to his wife, “A pinch of ground hazelnuts would be cut.”
Gilead will receive a refund for legal expenses in the fight against Merck for Hepatitis C patent
The regional judge has ruled that “Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to reimbursement of the costs of legal services it has paid in the case of breaking the patent for Hepatitis C against the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was acquitted in the case of a £200 million fine for breaking two Merck patents that threatened it in connection with the successful Sovaldi and Harvoni tablets when the US federal judge found violations in Merck’s activities, such as lying after an oath and other unethical acts.
In the case of Thursday, U.S. District Judge Bet Labson Frimen stated that Gilead has the right to claim compensation for legal expenses incurred in defending the case.
Merck tries to get positions on the market against Gilead, which dominates the market with the new generation of Hepatitis C drugs that are effective in 90% of liver diseases.
The case was started already in 2013, when Gilead and Merck complained to each other in an attempt to acquire ownership of the newly developed active component sofosbuvir, which is the main component of Gilead’s medicinal product.
The US-backed forces claim to have taken full control of the city of Manbija from the Islamic State.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDS) are currently cleaning the city from the last enemy fighters that have not left the city yet.
They have released more than 2,000 hostages-civils captured by militants, Sharfan Darvish, of the SDS ally's Manbij Military Council, told Reuters.
“The city is under full control and we are searching for fighters,” he told Reuters.
In 2015, Clinton’s income reached $110.75 million and the couple paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
During 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million, mainly to their Clinton charity. Former President Bill Clinton earned about $5.3 million in performance as a Spyer and former Secretary of State earned $3 million in revenue from her work at the State Department, published in collaboration with Simon & Schuster.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
In 2015, they paid a federal tax rate of 20.3 per cent.
“Hilary Clinton and Tim Kane continue to set new financial transparency standards,” Jennifer Palmer, a partner of the Clinton campaign, said in a statement.
In contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind various factors and reservations, so that promises to disclose his tax information should not be fulfilled.
Public disclosure of paid tax information is a record practice for US presidential candidates, but is not required by law.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers mention audit of the State Revenue Service as a reason not to disclose tax information.
“Your move – in her Twitter post, Ian Sam, a campaign partner at the Clinton campaign, told about Democratic party candidate tax information.
On Thursday, Special Advisor to Trump, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish tax information before audits are completed.
It’s not always easy, but it’s important to know what you’re doing.
It’s a great way to make sure that you’re on the right track.
She returned to this issue during an economic speech on Thursday in Michigan.
She told the crowd, “He refuses to do what other presidential candidates have done for decades.”
“Politico says that during the 1990s Trump paid very little or no taxes, and on Friday, the author of the New York Times business column reported that many accountants and lawyers believe that nothing has changed even today.
Federal tax rates are an important issue in this presidential election.
Clinton, in support of the billionaire Varen Bafet's proposal, promotes the idea that anyone who earns more than $1 million a year should pay a tax of at least 30%.
This proposal is also supported by President Barack Obama.
Last week, in Clinton's speech in Omaha, Nebraska, where he is also a conglomerate of Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett called on Trump to exchange tax returns.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
The Clinton campaign has made tax information public by 2007.
The Clintons now live in Chapakwa, New York and have paid an average federal tax rate of around 32 per cent between 2007 and 2014 and a total tax rate of around 40,5 per cent.
The 2015 Clinton Tax Review shows that unlike most Americans, only $100 from their income is a salary.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund, from which Clintons received $109,000 in dividends.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
Jewish film director criticizes hotel in Berlin for disabling Israel's code of long term talks at the request of an Arab - RT News
The director of a French film of Jewish origin raised a storm in social media when he discovered that \"Kempinski Bristol - a hotel in Berlin has no Israeli far-reaching code. The hotel's employees base it on the demand of Arab customers.
Claude Lancman, director of documentary films about the Holocaust “Shoah”, did not hide his discontent with the Berlin-Kempinski Bristol hotel and addressed an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his recent visit, Lancman tried to find Israel's far-reaching code on the hotel's list.
However, this country was not included in the list of countries to which you can call directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible that in 2016, in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel has been wiped out and destroyed?
It is written by Lancman.
Instead of Kempinski Bristol, the hotel offers to call this country through its call center.
The director asked for an explanation from the hotel staff.
It’s been a long time since I’ve been here.
The hotel administrator explained that “this was a conscious decision of the hotel’s management.
The reason for the removal of the code was even more outrageous for the film director.
“Most of the guests are Arabs and they asked for the Israeli code to be deleted,” Lancman quoted the hotel’s staff as saying.
Suddeutsche Zeitung says that the Israeli ambassador to Germany, Jakov Had-Handelsman, called the case \"a great shame\"
We are surprised and shocked at this incident.
This is a great shame in itself.
And the fact that this happened exactly in Germany, it is on this hotel network that there is even more humiliation.
Explanations are not required.
The official said: “We hope that the hotel will draw the right conclusions
This event was also quite widespread on the Internet, where people called it a scandal.
Others believe that Kempinski – the hotel is simply naturalized by Arab customers.
One of the other recordings said – be ashamed – indicating that the hotel is located on Kurfurstendamm Street next to the synagogue.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
“We have not received a direct order to remove Israel from the list of national numbers,” Suddeutsche Zeitung is quoted as saying by Kempinski’s representative.
And he added that the code was added to the list again.
Police use rubber bullets and tear gas against protesting Brazilian students.
The student and police clash took place on Thursday in São Paulo, Brazil, where students gathered in a demonstration against government education reforms.
Police used rubber balls and tear gas against students.
The problem started when law enforcement officials tried to eject students, as a result, police applied rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstration to show their dislike for the reforms of the education system.
The proposal of Sao Paulo Governor Geraldo Alckmina aims to close almost 100 public schools, while 300 000 students will be relocated to other schools with the aim of saving money.
Some demonstrators drew graffiti on the walls with messages against interim President Michael Temer.
This protest took place only a few days after the previous protest, when students gathered in demonstrations to support the suspended President Dilma Rousef, whose empire was voted by the Senate.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
Kelums Skinner from Scotland finished the first men's cycling team in the sprint race in Rio last night. The British team protected their champions' title at the 2012 London Games.
The 23-year-old athlete from Glasgow played an important role in this race, making a proud legendary scout of Sir Chris Hoy and setting out a victory for favourites in New Zealand.
Four years ago, the United Kingdom won an amazing victory when Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated it at the World Championship in London, although Hoy had already completed his athlete's career.
The problem was at the stage between the Beijing and London Olympics, as it had to replace the experienced start-up specialist Jamie Staff.
They did it at the last moment.
When Hoy left, Kian Emadi and Met Crampton tried to fill his place.
The British coach set expectations for Skinner, seeing in him potential, which he later proved.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
However, the British trio got gold medals.
Hindès was a close pioneer in his circle, Kenny was led and Skinner guarded the leadership.
The change of strategy played an important role in the victory, as Hindes drove with a greater gear to allow Kenya and, in particular, Skinner to drive faster.
Hoy watched the race as a representative of the BBC and caught the eyes of Skinner, Kenya and Hindes at the moment they climbed the honorary pedestal.
The 23-year-old glacier said: “It was an inexpressible honour.
I do my best to defend my name.
In the finals we set the Olympic record and won the World Cups.
It was just incredible.
There is no better victory.
It’s a great way to make sure that you’re getting the best results.
He later denied this comment and the British competitors were not able to prove the opposite.
This time there was no such incident.
Hindes said: \"The British flags in the tribines recalled London \"
In the last 3 months, we have become a team.
We have lost so many World Cups, so the win in the Olympics was really special.
One medal will compete for the country, which won seven out of ten gold medals for cycling in Beijing and London.
If this achievement is an indicator of team progress over the last five months, then the next five days will be very exciting.
Taking into account Kenya’s outcome, he could indeed repeat Hoy’s success in obtaining three Olympic gold medals.
For Kenny, this would mean six gold and one silver medal. In addition, Kenny was also born on March 23 (it seems to be the sacred date of the British, because Steve Regreiv, Mo Farah and Roger Banister were born on this day).
Hoy was also born on this date.
Kenya's next race is a sprint that starts today and lasts for the next three days.
The 28-year-old Bolton athlete said: “I just enjoy it right now.
A team trip is always the best.
Because then you can win together with the team members.
If it's fair, then it's a little lonely to win one --
Hinde said, \"If he got two more gold medals, he would have to be appointed as knights.\"
That day it was the only battle for medals, but it was not the only good news for Britain.

Remembering the outstanding and unprecedented performance in Beijing and London, everyone expects the same achievements in Rio.
In the meantime, behind the scenes have gone various, after accusations of sexism and respect, technical director Shan Saton resigned, and Hoy and Victoria Bendleton also finish their career.
But with the start of the first cycling race, it seems that Britain, as always, will reach the highest level at the right time.
The future of the Portland meltdown becomes uncertain due to the termination of an ambitious contract.
The future of aluminium melters and hundreds of its employees in Portland, Victoria has become uncertain because its main customer energy company has announced the termination of cooperation.
This announcement is based on Victoria's plans to stop subsidising the energy company, which is vital for the company to continue its work.
The 20-year grant will be discontinued in November.
As a result, more than 2000 jobs at the Alkoa Portland plant are at risk.
Up to 2000 direct and indirect jobs could be at risk.
In addition, it will also have unpredictable side-effects, as the melting house consumes about 10 percent of the total Victorian electricity supply.
In 2014,ender closed Point Henry’s Cowhouse, which led to a break in the operations of the English plant.
The Alkoa Portland Cowboy works with losses and can be closed.
These events were caused by several years of speculation about the rise in Australian dollar value and the cost of factory production.
The factory energy supplier AGL, who supplies energy from its own Loy Yang A power plant in the Latroubes Valley, says the other three owners are likely to break their contracts.
The majority of the power plant is owned by the Marcoa and Alumia Joint Undertaking, and in addition to the shares of the company are owned by the Chinese-CITIC and Japanese-Marubeni Corp.
“AGL – looks forward to continuing the operation of the Portland plant, which would mean further supply of energy to the fused plant,” the spokesman said.
“AGL” stated that contracts are so-called “risk-restricting contracts” which are expected to enter into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month validity period, so they will remain in force until 2017.
“AGL is planning to receive revenue from these contracts in the fiscal year 2017,” said the company’s representative.
From the fiscal year 2018 onwards, the potential impact on profit is limited by favourable market forecasts for future wholesale electricity prices.
“AGL” claims that it has already calculated losses of USD 187 million in its forecasts, and that these contracts will be terminated.
‘Alcoa’ means that the decision to terminate the contracts will not affect the possibility for the ‘Alcoa’ to continue operating or to supply energy to the slaughterhouse.
The U.S. company says it has entered into a contract with Loy Yang for 20 years in 2010, but it will be terminated in November. The company does not provide any explanation why it will stop cooperation.
Analysts have raised concerns both about the possible closure of the Portland melting house in Victoria and the closure of the Tomago plant near Newcastle, due to the weak economy of the industry.
“AGL – Executive Director Steven Mikelson said last week that analysts estimate that they use 600 megawatts and Tomago 900 megawatts of energy per year in Portland.
If both of these plants left the energy market, energy demand would be significantly reduced.
And that wouldn't be good at all.
The Community Legal Centre rejects 160 000 people each year.
More than 160 000 claims are rejected each year and the situation could deteriorate as the budget declines.
Three out of five people in Queensland - mostly pensioners, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those who do not have the means to combat illegal eviction - are denied free legal aid and representation.
The Community's legal centre, which has already been overloaded, warns that a reduction in funding will only make the situation worse.
As of June next year, these legal centres will receive 30% less funding than before.
James Farell, Director of the Queensland Legal Centre, said that the latest report by the National Legal Centres Association says that currently, legal aid is being refused to thousands of people in need.
Mr Farel pointed out that if this decision is not repealed, then the situation will only get worse.
He also says: “The legal centre of Queensland is constantly underfunded, which means that thousands of people in need of it are denied assistance.”
People who are trying to end violent relations, people with deep debts, families experiencing divorce, workers who are unfairly fired - all of these people have legal problems and this report shows that they do not receive the necessary help.
From June 2017, the federal government will reduce funding by 30 percent, which means that several thousand more people in Queensland will have to deal with their complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on General Prosecutor and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately stop reducing funding so that people in need of legal aid can get it.
Last year, the government revealed its plans to raise the level of legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to also pay attention to the needs of local communities and their customers and the Palazchuk government to invest in this important area.
Donalda Trump’s campaign has been sued because one of the employees has pulled out a gun.
New York: The organisers of the Donald Trump campaign have been sued because they have not acted on receiving information that its North Carolina operations manager has opened a firearm against an employee when they have driven in February in a single car.
This incident was described in a court action brought on Wednesday before the Charlotte Court by Vincent Bordini, a former campaign programmer.
So, what do you think is the most important thing in your life?
“I’m not sure if I’m going to be able to do that,” he said.
He also claims that by submitting complaints to local and regional campaign management, Bordini learned that at least four more people had experienced the same thing.
“Weapons don’t have to shoot to cause damage,” says Bordie in his complaint.
It’s just two days before the case was filed, the Republican Party candidate for presidential office caused a scandal, declaring to the people that “People of the Second Amendment, i.e. gun owners and enthusiasts, could act in case his rival Hillary Clinton and his elected judges would win the election.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
In addition, it is important to note that there is no risk of developing a disease.
It is also important to note that this is not the case in the United States, but in the United States.

It’s a new tradition – a parish and sports festival in Ķūlciems.
It’s a great way to make sure that you don’t have to worry about your health.
It was decided this time, after ten years of celebration, that the Festival of the Lake would no longer be held.
A new page has now been split.
The day began with sports competitions.
This time, the competition was not traditional and too serious, because, for example, darts had to be thrown into a sleeping target, the boot flew, a man's left hand thrown, \"balling - there were no Olympic games at all.
However, each participant was able to show how strong, bold, agile and attractive he is.

Britain must maintain the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow.
Heathrow will not only promote prosperity and growth in local regions and London, but also across the country.
This, in my opinion, makes Heathrow very attractive, as in 2012 in London, where we invested a huge amount of work to make all the regions of the country benefit from the Olympic Games.
Stratford and Real estate gained an enormous amount from the Olympic Games.
And we will do it again, providing locals and businesses with business opportunities near Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new business opportunities, 40,000 new jobs, and finally put an end to youth unemployment in Heathrow.
As in the 2012 London Olympics, there will also be people who believe that this challenge is too big and that the expansion of Heathrow is too ambitious.
In the meantime, people said that Britain would never be able to prepare for the Olympic Games and that it would be a world-wide collapse.
The skeptics made a mistake in 2012 and, in the case of Heathrow, they will not be right.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow has overcome everything so far.
As in the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that will benefit society as a whole and not individual individuals.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs, economic growth of 211 billion, creating a soil for both employment and experience at the airport and across the UK.
Heathrow has an excellent team that has created an infrastructure investment programme worth £11 billion, including a time frame and a budget ranging from Terminal 5, which for five years has been named the best airport terminal in the world and Terminal 2, which has been built between two more intensive runways in the world.
Now they are ready to set up a third runway, which will be financed by private investment of £16 billion.
The 2012 London Olympic Games were a great success, and I am sure that the enlargement of Heathrow will be the same.
It is time to revive the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, ensuring our trade future and creating a new employment environment that Britain could be proud of.
Lord Paul Deiton is a member of the Heathrow Board and former Secretary of Commercial Affairs of the Ministry of Economics.
In Switzerland, a woman runs on a highway trying to commit suicide.
In the middle of the night, he fell on the highway.
The police are trying to find witnesses for the accident when on Thursday morning on the highway she crossed a number of cars.
The accident took place on Thursday shortly after midnight on the A1 road near the Morge city of Vo Canton.
In a report by the canton police said that desperately wanting to commit suicide, a woman was caught on the road in the dark, where several cars met her.
It’s not easy to get rid of it, but it’s easy to get rid of it.
She died at the scene.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
The case also opened a criminal investigation, which is a logical step in this case, the lawyer Gilles Hofstellers told Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it is not yet known whether any of the drivers involved will be punished.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
Hofsteller adds: \"The prosecutor will find out this --
Two similar cases that have taken place over the last 5 years indicate that none of the drivers will be held liable.
In both cases, the pedestrian was on the highway in the middle of the night, so it was decided that the drivers could not predict that a pedestrian would be on the highway in the middle of the night, the newspaper said.
Last year, a police officer was justified in killing after carelessly driving a man in August 2014 who slept on the A1 road near Paijerne in the middle of the night.
The court found that the 22-year-old was drunk and later noticed to fall asleep on the road.
The Court concluded that the policeman on the road to the scene of the accident was driving in a manner appropriate to the circumstances and the judge admitted that the sleeping man on the road was -a completely unpredictable and extreme case -
Anyone who has information about an accident on Thursday near Morges is invited to contact the police by phone 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.

In a petition addressed to the ministers of the National Union (NA) and the Greens and Farmers Union (ZZS), the public wants a transparent and professional process for the nomination of officials.
The petition was made on August 10 and is currently signed by 55 people.
The process of nomination of the Director-General of the SRS candidate Inga Koļegova is opaque and unprofessional.
It recalls the best functional traditions of the Soviet Union.
It discredits the state administration and once again puts the public at risk in government and politicians.
“There is a need for a competition with clear criteria, against which all candidates must be evaluated – the text of the petition is written.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
It is also not clear what the candidate's plans for the work of the SRS are.
The petition states that the State Chancellery should create a new open competition, in which professional candidates are actively addressed, staffing specialists are attracted and appropriate remuneration is offered.

We started it in the same way, but after the parties changed, the result grew to only one team.
We had too many mistakes in the attack.
In the subgroup all teams were similar, in almost all matches there were three sets, so small points were important.

“They played well, and at the end they got to the “urra.”
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
We also had a chance to fight for the first place, but we were not even out of the group.
“All of us were waiting for the medal and we were there, but then there is no difference – 25th or 4th place – said Samoilov, who predicted that the duet will continue to play together in the future.
I think there will be no question and we will continue to play together, because this is only one tournament.

“Latvenergo – follows the process of opening the gas market also from the position of a potential trader.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
“The decision on whether to join the Latvian gas market as a trader in the future will be determined by which gas market model and regulatory framework will be set up.”
“We are actively involved in drawing up and commenting on laws and regulations, as well as submitting our proposals – Bidere said.
The Agency BNS has already written that the Ministry of Economics (EM) in cooperation with the Public Service Regulatory Commission and the energy company Latvijas Gāze has developed a draft Cabinet Regulation “Regulations on Trade and Use of Natural Gas – which will change the existing principles of the operation of the natural gas market, providing natural gas users with the right to freely choose a natural gas trader from 3 April 2017.
When working on the new regulation of the natural gas market, the aim of the EM is to make the natural gas trading process as simple and user-friendly as possible.
Therefore, as the most efficient and user-friendly service solution chosen – the trader’s central model – in which all activities related to customer service are provided by the trader – one contract, one invoice and one information provision and customer service place, leaving technical issues to the distribution system operator for natural gas distribution system.
A similar solution is currently being implemented in electricity trade.
We remind you that the gradual opening of the market for domestic customers is planned - even after 3 April 2017, those household users who do not want to choose another natural gas trader will be able to continue to receive natural gas from the existing trader at a regulated price, thus becoming related users.
“In this case, the obligation to supply natural gas to related users at a regulated price is imposed on the public trader – informed the Ministry.
In turn, merchants will have to choose a natural gas trader with whom to enter into a natural gas trade agreement.
Until the conclusion of the contract for the sale of natural gas, the merchants will ensure the sale of natural gas for a certain period of time by the previous natural gas trader at a certain price.
The Cabinet of Ministers draft regulations detail the rights and obligations of the natural gas trader, system operator and users.
The rules determine the procedures by which natural gas is delivered to users and terminates its supply, the requirements for safe use of the natural gas system, the rights and obligations of the trader, the public trader, the system operator, the user and the owner of the gasified object in the supply and use of natural gas; the procedures by which payments for the services received, the amount of late payment interest, the procedures for exchange of traders and the provision of users in case of disruption of natural gas supply shall be made; the procedures by which the supply of natural gas to the related users shall be ensured by the public trader.

The turnover of the canning producer Blue Lagoon is decreasing by 33.8% last year.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
The company’s management report says that in 2015 the company worked with losses due to several reasons, including due to a persistent lack of working capital caused by Unicredit Bank’s exit from the Baltic market by breaking the previously valid credit line and leaving the Blue Lagoon with concluded contracts without the possibility of fulfilling them.
So the company did not have enough funds to buy cheaper raw materials in large volumes and get a volume discount.
The departure of the respective bank from the Latvian market also prevented the company from implementing European Union Structural Funds support projects that would have allowed the production facility to purchase new production equipment and upgrade the infrastructure.
The company’s financial creators in the past year were also negatively affected by the rise in raw material prices and the lack of customers’ willingness to pay more for the goods produced by the company.
“Only in the second half of July 2016, customers recognized price changes and were ready to buy goods at the new - higher - prices,” said the company’s management.
In 2015, “Blue Lagoon” started negotiations with potential investors, including the valuation of the company’s movable and immovable property.
Investors have already been with Unicredit Leasing, the largest creditor in the company, where the parties have known and discussed possible investment plans.
At the same time, the company’s activities and development were positively influenced by the implementation of the restructuring and optimization plan started in 2014 and 2015.
This plan included improvement and optimization of technological processes, which allows to achieve higher production productivity and capacity.
“A number of equipment was purchased, which provides higher production speed,” said the company’s management.
“Blue Lagoon – management notes that the purchased equipment in 2016 will allow the company’s production to fulfill orders that were not yet possible.
The first batch of production, which will be produced on this equipment, will be ready in August.
Since there are already signed agreements on the sale of the product, all production will be sold according to the intention protocols.
The new product will increase turnover by about 300 thousand euros per month, according to the company’s management.
The company also plans to sign a cooperation agreement on the supply of fish products to Iraq in August 2016.
“The blue lagoon has sent the first experimental container to Israel in 2016, has expanded its market to Cyprus and will sign a cooperation agreement with a new supermarket chain in the United States this September.
As a result of all the above measures, the company plans to increase its turnover.
In 2014, “Blue Lagoon” worked with a turnover of 6.347 million euros and losses of 5.113 million euros.
The Blue Lagoon was founded in 1997 and has a share capital of EUR 1.156 million.
The company belongs to two Latvian individuals - Mikhail Kaidanov (89.11%) and Igor Širšhon (10.89%).

Despite the ban on carrying out any repairs in the upper apartment, from there it is still heard that the construction is continuing.
The punishment for arbitrary construction without a construction permit is from 70 to 700 euros, but in this case, the punishment can be much more severe.
This is the first time I’ve been in the United States since the beginning of the 20th century.
“This is not a case in the practice of the construction board, where, due to ignorance or simply unwillingness, residents may have threatened not only their property, but also the owner of the lower property, as a result of which this owner cannot exploit his property – says the representative of the construction board.
Now it's time for Dmitry to look for another place to live - at relatives, friends, in a hotel or rent another apartment.
But Dmitry can try to recover from a neighbor’s civil war, which can take a lot of time.
It is forbidden to stay in both apartments due to arbitrary construction, until the construction engineer will give his conclusion, and it may have to wait up to three weeks.
The loss incurred will have to be borne by the owner of the apartment where the repairs took place.
The owner of this apartment due to the fact that the building board has not taken into account, the prison sentence is also threatened for a period of up to six months.
Guess what!
How many lions in this picture?
The correct answer is five.
In Ukraine, five white lions were born in Demidova Zoo near Kiev.

The conversion of the former Ķemeri sanatorium into a five-star hotel will cost 22 million euros.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
The hotel is the first stage of restoration of Ķemeri’s former sanatorium.
The second stage will be “wellness – or wellness clinic, which is planned to be opened in 2022, while the opening of the hotel is scheduled for May 2018.
It is important to note that the exact cost of the clinic is not yet known.
However, she points out that it will be located in the polyclinic building of the former Ķemeri resort, with an area of about 12,000 square meters.
The clinic will be located on three floors.
“Park Hotel Ķemeri – and the intended clinic owner is the international foundation G Capital Europe, which invests in European assets.
“G Capital Europe – owners are several investors who invest money in this fund, says Želve.
As George Jones, CEO of G Capital Europe, plans to invest between €12 and €15 million in the creation of the former resort polyclinic, totaling more than €30 million.
It is already reported that in the restoration of more than 42 hectares of cultural historical park, restoration of access roads and street sections, construction of an interactive nature tourism object, improvement of the territory and parking place are built on Emila Dārziņa Street, which will contribute to the socio-economic development of Jurmala city and increase in the number of tourists, Jurmala City Council plans to attract from the funds of the European Union 14.5 million euros, co-financing with three to four million euros.
Design works are scheduled for mid-2017, but construction works and arrangement works will begin in the autumn of next year.
In the historical sanatorium complex “Ķemeri” it is reported that it is planned to build a five-star hotel “Park Hotel Ķemeri” and “wellness” or wellness clinic.
However, the reconstruction took a long time.
In the 2010 report, however, it was further stated that “Ominasis – regularly communicating with the hotel operator Kempinski – which continues to provide daily technical control at the sanatorium Kemeri – and already in 2011 will definitely be completed reconstruction of the future hotel Kempinski – and preparations for the opening of the hotel chain will begin immediately.
In October 2014, the Ķemeri sanatorium set owned by the insolvency estate of Ominasis Latvia confirmed its readiness to acquire the property of the Ķemeri sanatorium in the auction, but a month later the auction was recognised as not having taken place because the winner had not paid for the purchase within the specified time.
The sales price was determined according to the initial price of the last non-lotted auction - EUR 2.86 million.

The former NATO commander Brīdlovs e-mailed by Russian hackers.
The hackers who hacked the computers of the U.S. Democratic National Committee (DNC) may have carried out several other cyberattacks, also hacked the e-mail of former NATO European force commander Filip Bridlow and servers of the George Soros Institute of Open Society, Bloomberg reported Thursday.
The information collected by hackers has been published on DCLeaks.com
It’s not just a matter of time, but of time.
For hackers, the Institute’s computers have been available for a whole year.
According to Bloomberg, these cyber attacks were carried out by the same hackers associated with Russian special services who hacked DNC emails.
The Wall Street Journal reports that President Barack Obama’s administration is currently examining the issue of imposing new sanctions on Russia in response to the hacking of DNC computers.
In order to impose sanctions, the administration will have to formally appeal against the hackers supported by Russia or Russian authorities in a cyber attack on the servers of the Democratic Party.
In July, the WikiLeaks website published some 20,000 emails from the DNC computer system, which it is clear that Democratic party leaders have tried to harm the former rival Vermont Senator of the party Hilary Clinton, Kids Sanders' campaign in the fight for the nomination of Democrats for the presidential election.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation, which investigates the breakup of democratic servers, as well as other U.S. specs, reported that Russia’s relationship with the cyber attack is almost undoubted.
Maccartney: The presence of Yoko Ono threatened the Beatles
Paul McCartney acknowledged that the presence of Yoko Ono created a sense of danger for the legendary Beatles group.
The 74-year-old rock star currently maintains a good relationship with the widow of the late John Lennon, but at the time when she went to the group to visit the recording studio, she frightened Macartney because Ono was the only woman in the group - George Harrison, Ringo Star, Lennon, and McCartney.
When asked about the relationship between the two, he replied to Rolling Stone magazine: “They are really good.”
We were in danger at the time.
While we recorded, she sat on the amplifiers.
Most of the group could not tolerate it.
We were able to do this, but not quite successful, because we were very tight.
We were not sexists, but the girls usually did not come to the recording studio, they allowed us to work.
When John began to meet Yoko, she did not sit in the control room, but in the middle of our four.
The author of the Yellow Submarine also acknowledged that he now regularly communicates with former member Ringo, and from time to time confirms the work plans of the recording studio Apple, but otherwise “The Beatles” have “completion”
Asked if he still meets another single member of the legendary rock band, McCartney told Rolling Stone magazine: “Often not.”
We meet at social events and parties.
However, I don’t go to meetings, I feel a little isolated from it.
I left Apple during a hard divorce.
In my place, I sent John Realman to the meetings and said, “Tell me what everyone is saying, because I can’t suffer sitting at that table.”
It was too painful as if we were dying of our pet.
The company now works so that I just listen to all the records.
I am part of the approval process.
NASA climate model: Venus has ever been a habitable planet
On the basis of NASA’s latest climate models, Venus has ever been a habitable planet.
Scientists at NASA Godard Institute for Space Research have developed a model to explore Venus’s history using tools and algorithms that are also used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether on Venus, the surface of which is hot, where there is no water and whose atmosphere consists almost exclusively of carbon, has ever been under Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously mentioned that Venus’s slow speed of rotation is due to its dense atmosphere.
However, recent simulations show that Venus has once had a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and has slowly turned around.
The model also looks at Venus's earliest topography.
There were more dry areas on the planet than on Earth, but there was enough water and geographical diversity on it so that life could be formed and water could not be evaporated.
In the early days of Venus, the sun was 30 percent brighter.
In the simulation of the GISS model, Venus's rotation model reveals that the light part of the day on it lasts 2 months, Giss scientist Antony Del Genio explained in the press release.
This process heats the surface of the planet and causes the matter, which in turn forms thick layers of clouds that act as an umbrella, protecting the planet from the heat of the sun.
As a result, a moderate climate temperature is formed, which is actually a few degrees lower than the temperature on Earth today.
The model depicts Venus’s history, similar to the theory of evolution developed by scientists in their hypotheses.
Although once inhabited, Venus has been exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation over several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated, and the spirits were burned by ultraviolet rays.
As the water completely evaporated, the couple remained only a thin atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse gas - Venus, as we know it today.
Scientists published the results of the new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters
Patrick Roy resigns as a trainer at Avalanche
On Thursday, the coach of Colorado-Avalanche and Vice President of Hockey Operations Patrick Roy submitted a remorse, mentioning the insufficient impact of the team’s decision-making process.
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
“For the last three years, I have been energetic, enthusiastic and purposefully fulfilling my duties as head coach and vice president of the team hockey operation in Colorado,” said 50-year-old Roy in a statement.
During this summer, I have thought a lot about how I could improve the performance of the team to give it the necessary brightness and achieve a higher level of performance.
To achieve this, the visions of the head coach and the vice president of hockey operations must fully coincide with the visions of the organization.
He must also be able to influence decisions relating to team performance.
These conditions are currently not met.
It’s a great way to make sure that you’re on the right track.
Sakiks said that Patrick informed him of his decision today.
We appreciate all that he has done for the organization and wish him all the best in the future.
In its first season with the Avalanche team in 2013-2014, Roy was recognized as the best coach of the league and received the Jack Adams Award.
He helped the club to reach 112 points and first place in the Central Division, but in the first round of the shutdown games, the team of Colorado was defeated by the Minnesota hockey. Since then, the club has not entered the shutdown games for two years.
“Avalanche closed the 2015-2016 season with a score of 39-39-4 and remained five points behind the Wild team, without obtaining the second special invitation of the organisers of the Western Conference.
It is also important to note that this is not the case in the United States, but in the United States.
North Sea oil platform workers resume negotiations and postpone strike
It’s not just a matter of time, it’s a matter of time.
Periodic strikes on North Sea oil platforms operated by Royal Dutch Shell
The joint statement states that “Wood Group and Unite and RMT” trade unions have agreed to resume negotiations on the settlement of the dispute.
A number of full-day meetings are scheduled for the coming weeks, which will start early next week, with a view to re-examination of the issues.
Trade unions have announced that their recent activities, organised after a break of more than 25 years, are directed against a planned 30 percent reduction in wages.
The negative market pressure has led Wood Group to lower wages for North Sea workers by 9 percent this year.
In 2014, the company reduced the wages of land workers by 10 percent.
The company explains that additional wage cuts would allow the company to survive the recession of the market.
Shell, on the other hand, has already reduced wages for several thousand people and announced plans to stop oil and natural gas operations in 10 countries to optimise its work in preparation for a large-scale merger with the British energy company Group
Energy companies are under pressure due to falling oil prices, and Britain’s decision to leave the European Union is further complicated.
At the beginning of the week, Scottish MEP Dave Anderson met with workers' representatives to discuss one of the most important issues - the North Sea strike plans.
He said the North Sea was vital for the region's economy.
In his report, he explained that the North Sea and the country as a whole needed an economy that would benefit everyone, not individuals.
In 2016, new North Sea projects are expected to invest almost USD 1.4 billion, compared to USD 7 billion invested over the last five years.
Kepler measures the star rotation speed in the Pleasure constellation.
The mission of the newest Kepler telescope has helped astronomers to compile the most complete catalogue of star rotation speed in the constellation of Plejade.
New data helps astronomers understand why stars in this constellation rotate at different speeds, as well as how star rotation speed refers to the formation of planets.
“We hope that by comparing our results with other constellations, we will get more information about the relationship between star mass, age and even the history of its solar system,” said Luisa Rebula, a scientist at the Pasadena Caltech Infraredano Process and the Center for Analytics.
It is located 445 light years away from Earth.
Many stars in this constellation are just beginning to grow, reaching the age of about 125 million.
They rotate at maximum speed.
At maximum speed, these growing stars emit a large amount of star wind.
When winds enter the magnetic field of the stars, they stop the stars.
As the stars age, their speed of rotation decreases.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star, determining the time between the appearance of a recognizable star area, such as a sunspot.
The latest star rotation speed catalogue shows that larger stars turn slower than smaller stars.
The Rebul compares the stars with the dancers, the larger the size the dancers make the pirouettes slower than the small the size dancers.
Rebul says that the ballet shows that slowly rotating objects are larger and more massive, while faster rotating objects are very small stars.
Thanks to the proximity of the Plymouth constellation, it serves as an excellent space laboratory, where you can compare the star characteristics with the speed of rotation.
Rebuls tells that the Pleiades constellation helps to create theoretical models for rotation of stars in both directions for both older and younger stars.
We still have a lot to learn how, when and why the speed of star rotation slows and for this complete stop process.
Rebuls and his colleagues presented in detail an analysis of the star rotation rates of the Plejade in three new publications, which will soon be published in the Journal of Astronomy.
