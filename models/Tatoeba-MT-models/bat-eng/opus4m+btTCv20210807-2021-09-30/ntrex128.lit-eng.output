Members of the Wales Assembly are concerned that “it looks like dolls.”
Some members of the Assembly have ceased to accept the proposal to change their name to MWP.
This is due to the intention to change the name of the Assembly in the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly are concerned that this could lead to laughter at the political level.
One member of the Assembly said that his group was concerned, \"but it is serious about Twp and Pwp.\"
Not for the readers of Wales: Wallish \"twp\" means \"fool\" and \"pwp\" means \"kaka \"
“Plaid, a member of the assembly, said that the whole group was “unsatisfied” and offered alternatives.
The Welsh Conservative claimed that his faction was “open” to the change of name, but noted that it was a shortening of the word from MWP to puppet.
The Walloon letter w is thought to be similar to the English letter u.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing draft legislative acts to change the title, said: \"The final decision on the names of all the members of the Assembly will, of course, be a matter for the members themselves.\"
In 2017, the Welsh Government Act gave the Wales Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on proposals that received strong support from the Assembly to name the Parliament of Wales.
As regards the name of the Assembly, the Commission preferred the Members of the Welsh Parliament or the WMP, but received the highest support from the MWP during the public consultation.
The members of the Assembly are obviously proposing alternative options, but efforts to reach an agreement can become a headache for the presidency, Elin Jones, from whom it is expected to present draft legislation on the amendments within a few weeks.
Reform legislation will also include other amendments to the Assembly's work, including rules on disqualification of the Assembly's member and the Committee's framework plan.
During the legislative debate, members of the Assembly will have a decisive vote on the question of how they should be called.
Macedonians vote in referendum on change of name
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
A general vote was held to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor means claims to Greek territory and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia’s aspirations to join the EU and NATO.
Opposing to the plebiscite over the name change, President Gjorge Ivanov said he would ignore the vote.
But referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is simply a price that just needs to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's and other churches' bells were silenced during Harlem's difficulties.
“The old people I talked to said that it was historically possible to find a bar and a church on each corner,” Adams said.
You won’t find one or the other today.”
He said he understood why the bars disappeared.
“People are talking differently these days,” he said.
- Bars are no longer neighborhood sites where people are constantly gathering
When it comes to churches, he is worried that the money from the sale of property will not be enough for a long time, as leaders expect, “and sooner or later they will return to where they started.”
He added that the churches could be replaced by multi-apartment co-operative apartments, where people would live who would not help the remaining temples.
“Many of the people who buy cooperative apartments in these multi-apartment apartments will be white,” he said, “and will therefore close the moment when churches close completely, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into these cooperative apartments will become members of these churches.”
Both churches were built in 1870 by the White Congregations, before Harlem became a black metropolis – a metropolis community, and St. Martin’s church was built ten years later.
The initial Congregation of White Methodists arose in the 1930s.
The nearby congregation of the Blacks took over the name of the building.
St. Martyn's church was taken over by the Black Congregation with priest John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott of retailers on 125th Street, the main Harlem store where blacks were refused to be recruited or appointed to senior positions.
In 1939, the building was greatly destroyed by fire, but because the parishioners of spiritual father Johnson planned to rebuild it, they ordered a carillon.
The priest David Johnson, the son and heir of spiritual father Johnson in St. Martin's church, proudly called the carylion \"the bells of the poor.\"
Experts who took the carillon in July called it a different name: \"the treasure of culture\" and \"an irreplaceable historical instrument.\"
Tiffany Ng, an expert at Michigan University, also mentioned that it was the world's first carillon, played by black musician Dionysio A. Lind. 18 years ago, he began playing a larger carillon at Riverside Church.
Merriweather said St. Martin's church hadn't replaced him with another musician.
What happened in the past few months in St. Martin’s Church was a complex story about architects and contractors – some of whom were invited by the lay people of the church and others by the diocese of the Episcopal Church.
In July, Zacristia, a parish governing body made up of lay leaders, expressed concerns to the diocese that the diocese “will try to pass on costs to the Zacrist, even though it did not hire architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners have complained that the diocese lacks transparency.
California shark kills 13-year-old lobster
Officials said the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy on Saturday when he caught lobster in California on the opening day.
He was attacked at 7 a.m. in Ensinitas near the Shytur Beach.
Chad Hammell told KSWB-TV that he was diving with his friends about half an hour after hearing a boy shouting for help, and then came with a group to help pull him out of the water.
Hammelis told me at first that the boy was worried that he had caught a lobster, but then realized that the boy was shouting: “I was bitten!
I was bitten by \"
Hammelis said that when he approached the boy, he noticed that his whole key bone had been ripped.
“I started screaming at everyone to climb out of the water, ‘A shark flying in the water,’” Hammell added.
The boy was on a plane to a children's hospital in San Diego-Rady, where he was found to be in critical condition.
The species of shark that attacked the boy is unknown.
Rescue captain Larry Giles told the media in a statement that a shark had been sighted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was decided that it was not a dangerous species of shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper part of the waist.
Officials closed the beach from Casablad Pontas to Ensinitas Swami for 48 hours due to investigation and protection.
Giles mentioned that there are more than 135 shark species in the zone, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to move to the UK beauty market
“Sainsbury’s – takes over “Boots” “Superdrug” and “Debenhams” with department of beauty in the style of universal shops, where specialist consultants will work.
With an active push to the UK £2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow and the fashion and household goods sales figures fall, larger beauty stores will be tested at 11 stores across the country and, if they succeed, more stores will be installed next year.
Investments in beauty are growing, and supermarkets are looking for ways to use shelves, once intended for televisions, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury's has announced that it will double its range of beauty to 3,000 product names, including brands such as Revlon' Essie's Tweezerman and for the first time Dr. PawPaw's
The existing range of L'Oreal-Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive more space in branded areas similar to those in stores like Boots.
The shopping center also re-releases its Boutique makeup range, most of which are vegan, which is increasingly demanded by younger buyers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will try out discounts at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, South London last week, and the second will open later this year in Seli Ouke, Birmingham.
Due to online shopping and the desire to buy in small quantities daily from the local supermarkets of essential goods, it is necessary to try more to attract people to visit there.
Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe said the store is increasingly looking like a department store as supermarkets are trying to fight cheaper Aldi and Lidl stores by offering more services and non-food products.
“Sainsbury’s has added Argos stores to hundreds of stores and has also installed a number of Habitat stores, as two years ago they bought both networks, which are claimed to have strengthened the sale of food, and their purchase was more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to renew its beauty and pharmacy department ended in failure.
In the early 1990s, Sainsbury’s tested the joint venture with Boots, but the union ended up in a dispute about how to distribute revenue from pharmacy stores in supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury's three years ago sold £125 million worth of its pharmacy 281 store to Lloyds Pharmacy, the owner of the network Celesio
It was claimed that Lloyds contributed to this plan by adding an expanded range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
“Sainsbury’s commercial director Paul Mills-Hicks said: “We have changed the outside of the beauty department and the atmosphere to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be ready to give advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet every need, and thanks to the attractive environment and convenient places, we are now an attractive beauty place that challenges the old way of buying.
Peter Jones is \"involved\" because Holly Willoughby broke a £11 million deal with him
\"Dragons Den-star Peter Jones-introduced\" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby ended a £11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
H. Willoughby no longer has time for their household and accessories brand Truly
The couple’s business was compared with the Gwyneth Paltrow-Goop brand.
The 37-year-old, This Morning, has announced her leaving on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby left a profitable lifestyle brand at the last moment to focus on her new big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV, angering Dragons Den, star Peter Jones.
Sources say Jones was “involved” when, at a stressful meeting on Tuesday, a golden television girl at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that she would no longer be able to devote time to his household goods and accessories brand Truly due to new deals of up to £1.5 million.
The business was compared with Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand, and it was assumed to have doubled Willoughby’s £11 million wealth.
As Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that he had left Truly, Jones had flown from Britain to one of his summer cottages.
The source said: “Truly has been one of Holly’s top priorities so far.
It should have been her long-term future, which will last for the next few decades.
Her decision to leave everyone was extremely surprised.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday because the beginning was so close.
The Marlow headquarters is full of ready-to-sell goods warehouse
Experts believe that the release of The Morning, one of Britain’s most financially successful stars, could cost millions of dollars to invest in products, ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and household items, as well as from delays in getting started.
This could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been in close contact with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for decades.
In 2016, Willoughby and Cappu were founded by Truly, and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
Couples are on vacation together, and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become M&S's trademark ambassador and will replace ITV's I'm A Celebrity host, Anta McPartlin.
A close source of Jones said yesterday: “We will not comment on his business affairs.”
We talked very hard and then we fell in love.
He joked about the criticism he had received from the media over the comment that some might see as “non-presidential,” as well as being so positive about North Korea’s leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said with a voice of mockery-newsman:
“I didn’t give up anything,”
He said Kim was interested in the second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June was a major step towards North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
However, nuclear disarmament negotiations have been strangled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders during the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea was not receiving an appropriate response from the United States on North Korea’s early disarmament.
Instead, the United States continues sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
“We are doing well with North Korea,” he said.
We were going to fight with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have this great relationship...
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had brought positive results: the end of missile tests, aid in the release of hostages and the return of the remains of American troops.
He defended his unusual attitude when talking about relations with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people who want to get into this stuffy arena, we’d better have about 200 people standing here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Indonesian tsunamis and earthquake destroy the island, killing hundreds of people
In the wake of the Lombok earthquake, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that their assistance was not needed.
Although more than 10% of the Lombok population was deployed, this was not declared a national disaster – a prerequisite for international assistance.
\"Unfortunately, many cases have been said very clearly that international aid is not needed, so it's a bit complicated,\" Sumbung said.
While “saving children” prepares a team to travel to Palu, it is still unclear whether foreign workers will be able to work locally.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute.
In view of Indonesia’s constant earthquakes, the country is still unprepared for nature’s wrath.
Although tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, they are not common on other shores.
The apparent shortage of tsunami-warning sirens in Palu, despite the announced warning, is likely to increase the loss of life.
Travelling between many Indonesian islands is difficult at the best time.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok, which treats the victims of the earthquake, sails to Palu, but will reach the site at least three days later.
President Joko Widodo has chosen to rebuild Indonesia's destroyed infrastructure for his election campaign centre, spending generously on roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding did not bring peace to the Yoko administration, because in the coming years he will again take part in the elections.
It is also under pressure from the ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where Muslim majority members adhere to a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands driven out of their homes because Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets using mosques, bows with arrows and other simple weapons.
Liverpool: Daniel Sturridge wins a far-reaching goal with Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing in a Chelsea-Premier League match at a 89-minute goal on Saturday at the Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
With a score of 1:0, Xherdan Shaqiri passed the ball about 30 metres from Chelsea’s gate to the former Sturgeondge.
He kicked the ball on his left leg and hit the far-wire.
The ball raised high above the penalty deck flew right to the top corner of the net.
He eventually crossed over the jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and reached the network.
“I just tried to get the ball out, and players like Shaq always play as far ahead as possible, so I just tried to keep as much time as possible to hit,” LiverpoolFC.com said in a statement.
- I saw a run in Kante, I checked the ball with one touch and, without thinking too much, I just kicked it.
Following the 25-minute goal of Belgian star Eden Hazard, Chelsea, from the first half of the first 1st half.
During the attack, the blue attacker returned the ball to Mateo Kovacicius in the middle of the square and rushed towards Liverpool.
In the middle of this square quickly played the wall.
He then sent the ball between the opponents to the attacking Hazard.
Hazard overtakes the defenders and directs pro Liverpool, a player, Alison Becker, with a left leg blow, to the net at the far edge of the whirlpool.

The number of deaths from the Indonesian tsunami is now 832.
As reported by the country's disaster agency early Sunday, the number of deaths in Indonesia has risen from an earthquake and tsunami to 832.
A spokesman for the agency told a news conference at Sutopo Purwo Nugroho that many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings destroyed by a 7.5-point earthquake on Friday, which caused a six-meter wave.
The city of Palu, home to more than 380,000 people, was covered with debris of destroyed buildings.
Police arrested 32-year-old man suspected of murder after woman was killed
The murder investigation was launched after a woman’s body was found in Berkenhed this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55 p.m. on John Street with a 32-year-old man who was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have urged people who have seen or heard people on the territory to speak.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: \"So far, the stage of the investigation is early, but I would like to address anyone who was near John's street in Berkenhed and saw or heard someone suspicious that they would contact us.
I would also like to contact anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have been able to capture something with a video registrar, and contact us as they may have information that is essential for our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Berkenhead and was found in the building.
This afternoon, my friends who met a woman came to the scene to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing as police have reported that they inform the victim’s closest relatives.
The taxi driver, who lives in Greison Muse, has just tried to return to his apartment, but police said no one can enter and leave the building.
He lost his promise when he found out what had happened.
People are now told they will have to wait a few hours before they are allowed to return home.
It was heard as a police officer told a man that the entire territory was now considered a crime site.
The woman appeared to be paralyzed at the scene of the crime.
She said, \"It's so scary.\"
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans stood in front of the barrier on the inside and another van behind it on the outside.
Many officials stood on the inner side of the barrier and watched the block of multi-apartment buildings.
Anyone with information is asked to write to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously by 0800 555 111, indicating the number 247 on September 30.
The statues of Cromwell in Parliament are impacted by the last blow of a dispute in history.
It would be a poetic justice for the destruction of English cultural and religious heritage, which resembles Taliban actions, under the responsibility of the fanaticic followers of the Puritans of Cromwell.
However, the Cromwell Society described Crick’s proposal as “malice” and “an attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the current debate on the transfer of statues, Oliver Cromwell’s statue was inevitably a target at Westminster Palace.
Cromwell did not order or carry out the iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of ancestor Thomas in the last century.
Sir William Ham Thorneycroft’s wonderful image of Cromwell is a reflection of the approach of the 19th century and a part of the historiography of the figure that many still hold to be honored.
Goldsmith, The Sunday Telegraph, said: \"Many people, perhaps at the end of the 19th century more abundantly than today, Cromwell was considered to be a defender of parliament against external pressure, which was certainly a monarchy.
Whether this is accurate, historians argue so far.
One thing is clear: the conflict of the middle of the 17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell became an exclusive figure representing one of the sides of this section.
His achievements as a defender of the Lord are also worthy of commemoration and honor.
Swine killer killed Chinese farmer
According to local media reports, in the Southwestern Chinese market, the pig attacked and killed the farmer.
On Sunday, the Morning Post reported that a dead person named Yuan had been found. Due to a damaged artery, he was blood-filled and lay next to a pig in the Lupanshu market in Guizhou Province (south China).
On 30 May 2005, a pig farmer in Sining, Qinghai Province, China, prepared to give vaccine to pigs.
He said Wednesday, along with his cousin from the neighboring province of Junan, he plans to travel to the market to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, the cousin found the relative dead and found the door open to the nearby pig.
He said there was a large pig in the pig, whose mouth was stained with blood.
According to the report, a court expert confirmed that a 250-kilometer pig was destroying the farmer.
“Guiyang Evening News quotes: “My cousin’s legs were bloody and wounded,” he said.
The security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market on Thursday at 4:40 p.m. to feed his pig.
His body was found in about an hour.
Yuan or his cousin did not belong to him.
The market leader told Evening News that the pig had to be locked to stop attacking other people and kept until the police collected evidence on the spot.
Yuan’s family and market power are reportedly negotiating death compensation.
Although few cases have been reported, earlier cases of pigs that attack humans have been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, and the man was particularly seriously injured.
Ten years ago, a pig weighing 295 kilograms pressed the Welsh farmer to the tractor and pressed the animal until his wife had driven it away.
After pigs ate an Oregon farmer in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBS News that pigs were usually not aggressive, but that their aggressiveness could be caused by the taste of blood.
“They’re just playful.
They like to bite, very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to respect them accordingly,” he said.
Hurricane Rose’s Remains Will Bring Big Rain to the U.S. Southwest
Hurricane Rose is expected to weaken as it moves through the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
But in the next days, Rosa will bring plenty of rain to all of northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
On Sunday from 5 a.m., Rose moved at 137 km/h as a Category 1 hurricane and was 620 km southwest of the Cape Euchenia (Mexico).
Rose is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, on the Pacific side, the stretching of low-pressure areas begins to form, moving eastwards towards the west coast of the United States. As Rose approaches the California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to carry large tropical moisture northwards to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rose will cause up to 25 centimeters of rain in some areas of Mexico.
Then, the tropical humidity, interacting with the approaching area of low pressure, will bring in a wide rain to the southwest in the next days.
Instead of 2.5 to 10 centimeters, rain will cause a dangerous sudden flooding, a stream of debris and possible landslides in the desert.
High tropical humidity will cause precipitation in some areas, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona, to fall from 5 to 8 centimeters per hour.
5 to 10 centimeters of rain is expected in the southwestern regions, especially in the large part of Arizona.
Due to the nature of tropical rains, sudden flooding and rapidly deteriorating conditions may occur.
In a tropical storm, a particularly bad idea would be to take a walk to the desert.
Severe rain canyons can be turned into raging rivers, and thunderstorms will cause wind and dust to jump.
The upcoming stretching of low pressure areas will bring some local heavy rain to the southern coast of California.
It is possible to expect more than 1 centimeter of precipitation, which can cause a small flow of debris, and the roads can become slippery.
This would be the first rainy season in the region.
Some tropical rains will start approaching Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, and then rain will spread late Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rain in Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah will spread on Tuesday and Wednesday.
In October, intense temperature fluctuations are possible across the United States due to the cooling of the Arctic, but in the tropical zone it will be quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to huge temperature changes over short distances.
On Sunday, there was a great example of huge temperature differences in the central United States.
Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha (Nebraska) temperatures are almost 20 degrees different from St. Louis and Di Moin (Iowa).
Summer heat in the next few days should rise again and cover more places.
In most central and eastern parts of the United States, from the Great South Plains to the Northeast, a warm October is expected to arrive with a temperature of 27 degrees Fahrenheit.
The temperature in New York is expected to rise to 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows that in the eastern United States, temperatures in the first half of October will be higher than the average multi-annual temperature.
More than 20 million people watch over Brett Kavanaugh trial
More than 20 million people on six television shows on Thursday were watching the hottest speech by Supreme Court candidate Bretto Kavanaugh and the accusations of female Christine Blasey Ford over sexual violence in the 1980s.
But the political deadlock continued after broadcasters interrupted regular programs over Friday’s last-minute shift: Arizona Senator drafted an agreement to conduct a week-long investigation by the FBI into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate’s court committee that it was absolutely certain that she had been groomed by Kavanaugh at a high school party and tried to wear her clothes.
Kavanaugh, in an angry witness, said that he was absolutely sure that this was not the case.
\"Nielsen said Friday that more than 20.4 million people were watching the broadcast.
The company calculated the average number of viewers who watched the broadcast on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Numbers were not immediately available for other networks, including PBS-C-SPAN and Fox Business Network
In addition, Nielsen usually has some difficulties in counting people watching television in offices.
In order to explain more clearly, it is the same size as in the playoffs or Oscar awards.
Nielsen reported that Fox News Channel, whose hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh’s candidacy, was the first of all networks when the number of viewers reached an average of 5.69 million during the day’s trial.
ABC, at 3.26 million viewers, was in second place.
Nielsen reported that CBS had reached 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million.
There was also a great deal of interest at the end of the trial.
The main figure in Friday's drama was Flake.
After a small Republican office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was captured by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning when protesters shouted at him as he tried to take an elevator to the court committee.
CNN filmed him directly down his eyes when people flooded him.
\"I'm standing here in front of you,\" said one woman.
Do you think he is telling the truth to the country?
He was told, “You have power when so many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement before closing the elevator, adding that he would have more to say at a meeting of the court committee.
cable television and broadcast networks were then discussed directly when the Courts Committee voted in favour of Kavanaugh’s candidacy for the Senate.
However, Flake said he would only do so knowing that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the candidate in the next week, which the Democratic minority urged to investigate.
Flake, who spoke with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons, was partially convinced.
After talking to Coons and several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake’s choice had power because it was obvious that Republicans would not have votes to confirm Kavanaugh’s absence from the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses critics of 'playing politics' over Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused the newspaper of her plans to quit critics of the European Union, playing politics with Britain’s future and seeking to undermine national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham (UK) on 29 September 2018.
In another interview published after her photo on the front page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued to attack her so-called \"Brexit\" plan for Britain and the EU to collect each other's tariffs, saying it was \"totally absurd.\"
Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson over LSU player's death
Police arrested a person suspected of killing 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department said Dyteon Simpson, a 20-year-old, was arrested and sentenced to a second degree in prison.
Authorities released a video of the clash between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims had lost his glasses during the fighting.
The CBS, a branch of WAFB, reports that the police took the glasses from the scene and found the Simpson DNA on them.
After listening to Simpson, police said he killed Wayde.
The lawyer said his release deposit was $350,000.
The East Baton Parish’s expert service published a preliminary report Friday stating that the cause of death was a head shot that turned to the neck.
The department is awarded to the Louisiana State Police Staff Working Group, the State Police Crime Laboratory, Southern University, for the police and residents of the district who helped during the investigation that led to the arrest of the suspect.
LSU Sport Director Joe Alleva thanked district law enforcement for “cruising and enforcing justice”
Sims was 20 years old.
A 1.98-meter tall guy grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball at LSU.
Last season, the young man dropped 5.6 points on average during the game and caught 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was “blowed” and “shocked”
“It’s always been thought about,” Wade said.
Volcano speculates on ash in Mexico City
Ashes erupted from the Popocatepetl volcano, which reached the southern neighborhoods of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano when the crater's activities were detected and the discharge of gas and ash was recorded 183 times within 24 hours.
The center observed a lot of thunders and earthquakes.
The photos on social media show thin ash-plated car windscreens in Mexico City, such as Chochimilke.
Geophysicians have noticed that the activity of a volcano 72 kilometres southeast of the capital has increased since the 7.1-point earthquake hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, called Don Gojo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists before independence vote
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after protesters clashed with riot police for independence and thousands joined the opposition demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia’s controversial secession vote.
The riot police stopping the group of masked separatists were thrown with eggs and powder paints, which caused dark dust clouds on the streets, which are usually filled with tourists.
Police used sticks to stop the fighting that started later in the day.
Within hours, groups for independence singing “Unforgettable, unforgivable” faced unionist protesters who shouted: “Long live Spain”
The local press reported that fourteen people were treated for minor injuries caused by protests.
One year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid regards as illegal, but which is sung by Catalan separatists who seek independence in the region, tensions remain high.
Most voters decided to become independent, but the majority of those who boycotted the vote were low in turn.
Catalonia’s authorities said nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year as police across the region were trying to stop the vote in polling stations.
Independence groups set up a camp on Friday night to prevent a demonstration supporting the national police.
The show took place, but was forced to change the route.
The 68-year-old electrician, Narciss Termes, who is involved in a separatist protest with his wife, said he was no longer convinced of the prospect of Catalonia's independence.
Last year we experienced one of the best moments.
I watched parents shouting joyfully for those who can vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite the fact that in regional elections in December last year a vital and difficult victory was ripped out, Catalonia's independence parties have been struggling to keep pace this year when many of their best-known leaders have left for voluntary exile or are in detention and are awaiting trial for their role in organising a referendum and subsequently declaring independence.
The 42-year-old policeman Joan Puig, who filmed the protest on his phone, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
“The tension is constantly growing,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial prison since the end of last year, announced he would take part in the European Parliament elections next year.
\"Candidation in European elections is the best way to condemn the decline in democratic values and the repression demonstrated by the Spanish government,\" he said.
Londonder: Men entering the house by car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after they re-entered the house in Londonder by car.
The incident took place on Thursday at around 7.30 p.m. (BVL) in Ballinagard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gate and the building were damaged.
At some point, the car could also have been shot down by a arbor.
Menga strike secured Livingston’s win of 1:0 against Rangers
Livingston: Dolly Menga's first goal guaranteed victory
Livingston, who was transferred to the upper league, surprised Rangers by forcing Ibrox club leader Steven Gerrard to lose the second of 18 matches.
Dolly Menga's strike turned out to be very important, as Gary Holt's team compared to Hibernian in a moment.
Gerrard’s team remains unlucky during this Premier League season and will meet with leaders Hearts next Sunday, eight points behind them.
\"Rangers - European League games at home with Vienna-Rapid\"
At the time, Livingston extended its unparalleled series of unmatched matches in the division to six, while chief coach Holt has not yet felt the taste of losing, as Kenny Miller has only changed last month.
Livingston loses chances in match with Orthodox guests
Even before you hit the goal, Holt’s team had to be ahead of it because of its perseverance in the Rangers’ various problems.
At first, Scott Robinson broke out and struck across the gate, then Alan Lithgow failed to reach the ball passed by Craig Halkett's head, and this ball went down next to the gate.
The hosts, allowing Rangers to play ahead, didn’t worry because they knew they could cause trouble for guests by creating standard positions.
This is how the decisive goal was achieved.
“Rangers – missed a free kick and Livingston began to move forward; Declan Gallagher and Robinson shared the menga ball with a joint effort, which stopped him and scored a goal from the middle of the penalty.
Since then, the ball has been more controlled by Rangers, but host defenses have been insurmountable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly has hardly worked.
The game continued in the second half, even though Kelly had to work to repel Alfredoed's blow to the gate.
Scott Pittman's Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor played his foot off, and after another Livingston, the ball in the standard position was played next to the goal.
The ball was constantly in the Livingston penalty ground, but every time there was a push and two demands for a penalty – one for Halkett’s collision with Glenn Middleton, who passed through the field after the change, and the other for touching the ball with his hand – was not met.
Analysis of the Phenomenal Performance of Livingston
BBC Scotland – Reporter Alasdair Lamont from Tony Makai Arena
Phenomenal \"Livingston\" game and result.
For all to one, they were excellent and continued to exceed expectations of an ever-increasing gameplay.
The style of the game and the staff have hardly changed since returning to the highest league, but it is appropriate to devote great merits to Holt as he set fire to the team when he arrives.
He was helped by many heroes.
Captain Halkett played amazingly, focusing on a well-organized defense, and Menga forced Connor Goldson and Joe Worralla not to lose sight.
However, Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they play great under Gerrard’s leadership, this time they lacked much to reach their level.
They had little decisive strikes and only once broke through the host defenses. A certain alarm call was made to the Rangers team in the middle of the table.
Erdogan in Cologne has been met in various ways
On Saturday (September 29), there were smiles and blue sky when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany to restore relations between NATO allies.
The leaders argued on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new huge mosque.
The city is the largest population of Turkey outside Turkey.
Police banned 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque for security, but many supporters came to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of them Kurds, have also tried to be heard condemning both Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to accept it in their own country.
Different protests show the division of visitors: some German Turks consider him a hero, while others call him a dictator.
Road accident in Deptford. A cyclist died in a car collision
A cyclist in London died in a car accident.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn streets, the busy Deptford road, on the southeast of the city, at 10.15 BVL.
The car driver stopped, paramedics also arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The accident occurred a few months after another cyclist was killed on Childers Street, hit by a culprit who then fled about 1.6 km from Saturday's accident.
City police said officials were trying to identify the man and inform his closest relatives.
Roads are closed, and bus routes are changed, drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartino prison: Six officers injured during the breakup
The prison service said six prison officers were wounded during a major breakdown in a special security men's prison.
HMP Long Lartin took place in Wuspeg on Sunday at around 9.30 a.m. BVL, where it continues.
Special Tornado officials were summoned to control the split between eight prisoners and one wing of the prison.
Officials are treated for minor facial injuries at the site of the accident.
A prison spokesman said: “In order to manage the ongoing incident, HMP Long Lartin was summoned by specially trained prison personnel.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we are sure that those responsible will be handed over to the police and, possibly, will spend longer than they can play.
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners in prison, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, he was reported to be hospitalized by the prison governor after being attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, riot control officers were summoned to prison to control a serious breakdown in which some workers were thrown into billiard balls.
Hurricane Rose threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with its sudden flooding (it may be useful for dry areas)
It’s not normal for tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that’s likely to happen next week when Hurricane Rose and his rest of the energy will drown through the desert’s southwest and this will put you at risk of sudden flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already said it is watching a sudden flooding on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, spreading toward southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
When it comes to rain late on Monday, Rose is expected to head straight to Phoenix on Tuesday.
In Phoenix, the National Meteorological Service noted that only “ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storms or tropical depression status no further than 322 kilometers from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane no more than 64 kilometres from the Arizona Wall.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict that the prill will reach 5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation, and in some areas of Arizona Mogolon Rimo, the precipitation will reach 5 centimeters.
Other areas in the southwest of the desert, including the central Rock Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to fall from 2.5 to 5 centimeters, and in some places can fall to 10 centimeters of precipitation.
For people who are not threatened by sudden flooding, the rose rain can be a blessing because the region suffers from drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of these precipitations can be beneficial as the southwest currently suffers from droughts.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitoring Center, slightly more than 40% of Arizona suffers from very high droughts, which corresponds to the second highest category,” weather.com said.
First, Hurricane Rose travels to the coast across the California Peninsula, which belongs to Mexico.
On Sunday, Rose, still equivalent to a hurricane category with a massive 137 km/h wind, is 619 kilometres south of the Cape Euchenia, Mexico, and moves north at a speed of 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm is facing colder waters in the Pacific region and is therefore getting worse.
So it is expected to reach the coast of Mexico with tropical storm force on Monday afternoon or evening.
The fall in certain parts of Mexico can be severe and cause a significant risk of flooding.
“From the California Peninsula to northwestern Sonora, it is expected to reach 8 to 10 centimeters, but perhaps up to 25 centimeters of precipitation,” weather.com said.
Later, Rose will move north through Mexico as a tropical storm, later on Tuesday morning reaching the Arizona border as a tropical depression, and on Tuesday late evening, Arizona will move toward southern Utah.
“The main danger that Rose or its remnants are expected to pose is a very high amount of rain in the California Peninsula, in northwestern Sonora and in the U.S. desert southwest,” the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening sudden floods, debris flows in deserts and landslides in mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsamer Norton: Four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after finding a 16-year-old man in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Midsamer Nortone-Excelsior terrace area, approximately 44.00 BVL, Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital and is now in stable condition.
Police in Eivon and Somerset said 17-year-olds, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested in Radstock at night.
Officials called on all those who could have any cell phone footage about what had happened.
Trump says Kavanaugh “has suffered from the disgust and anger of the Democratic Party.”
\"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice we would like to reject the merciless and offensive tactics of the Democratic Party,\" Trump said in a speech in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had \"experienced the disgust and anger of the Democratic Party\" in the process of raising his candidacy.
Kavanaugh on Thursday witnessed a congressionally and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that he sexually attacked her a few decades ago when they were still teenagers.
Ford also testified to his accusations during the trial.
On Saturday, the president said: \"The Americans saw on that day what kind of Kavanaugh was great, noble and brave.
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice for one of the most experienced legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a reliable reputation in the field of public services,” he said.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's candidacy while talking about the importance of Republican electoral activity in the mid-elections.
\"There are five weeks left until the most important elections in our lives.
I don’t participate, even though I really do,” he said.
“That’s why I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere.”
Trump said the Democrats wanted to \"resist and hinder\"
Senior GOP chief assistant CNN said the first major procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh should take place no later than Friday.
Hundreds of deaths from Indonesia earthquake and tsunami continue to rise
Authorities said at least 384 people had been killed, many of them set off because of the huge waves that hit the beach when a severe earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia.
Hundreds of people gathered at the Palu City Beach Festival on Friday when waves of six metres [6 m] were knocking on the coast when they darkened, and many of them deadlylyly demolished and destroyed everything that had happened on the road.
There was a 7.5-point earthquake after the tsunami.
“When the tsunami threatened yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not run away immediately, so they became victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian disaster relief agency, told BNPB in a news release in Jakarta.
“The tsunami did not open on its own, it pulled cars, logs, houses, it struck everything that was on the ground,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had flown at 800 km/h before it hit the coast.
He said that some people climbed the trees to avoid the tsunami and so survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Photos of the disaster agency from the air showed that many buildings and shops were destroyed, bridges were curved and destroyed, and the mosque was surrounded by water.
On Saturday, repeated strikes continued on the seaside.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said that the energy released in a particularly severe earthquake on Friday was about 200 times the energy of the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The tsunami was reported to have been able to strengthen due to the geographical location of the city, as it was located at the end of a long, narrow bay.
Nugroho described the damage as \"big\" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been destroyed.
He said the bodies of some victims were found trapped under the ruins of the buildings, later added 540 people were injured and 29 people disappeared without knowledge.
Nugroho said the number of victims and damage could be greater along the coast, 300 kilometres north of Palu, an area known as Dongala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Nugroho said communications networks were \"fully paralyzed, so no information was received from Dongala.
“More than 300,000 people live there,” the Red Cross spokesman said in a statement, adding that workers and volunteers are going to areas affected by the disaster.
It was said that \"this can already be considered a tragedy, but the situation can deteriorate even further.\"
The agency was heavily criticised on Saturday for not reporting a tsunami that struck Palu, despite officials saying the waves came after a warning was issued.
In a shared social media amateur material, you can hear a man on the upper floor of the building shouting at the approaching tsunami for people standing below the street.
In minutes, the water wall hits the shore, carrying buildings and cars.
“Reuters could not immediately confirm the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami have led to disruptions in electricity supply, resulting in the cutting off of communications networks around Palau and difficulties for the authorities to coordinate the delivery of assistance.
Authorities said the army had started sending cargo planes with aid supplies from Jakarta and other cities, but those evacuated still need food and other essential supplies.
The city’s airport was reopened only to provide assistance and will be closed by October.
President Joko Widodo planned a visit to the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami exceeded 800.
That's very bad.
Dozeba said that when the World Vision staff from Dongala safely traveled to the city of Palu, where the workers were in tarpaulin tents built in an office yard, the images were taken along the way.
\"They told me they had seen a lot of destroyed houses,\" he said.
That's very bad.
Even when aid teams began to take difficult steps to provide emergency assistance, some people complained that foreign aid workers with extensive experience were banned from travelling to Palau.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, provision and foreign staff can only help when the disaster site is declared a national disaster zone.
This has not yet happened.
“This is still a provincial disaster,” said Indonesian Red Cross spokeswoman Aulia Arriani.
– When the government says, “Yes, it is a national disaster, we can call for international assistance, but this status has not yet been declared.”
The second night after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami in Palu, friends and loved ones hoped that their loved ones would become part of a miracle that would affect the gloomy history of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small boy was pulled out of the drain.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who was pressed under the ruins next to her mother’s body for two days.
Gendon Subandon, a coach of Indonesia’s national paragliding sports team, had learned two missing paragliding paragliders from the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others of those trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, including Loyalty, were his disciples.
“As I’m older in paragliding sports, I carry my emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon described in detail how in a matter of hours, when he announced the fall of the Roa Roa hotel, this news traveled through the paragliding sports community. He desperately sent messages using the WhatsApp app to Palu rivals who took part in the beach festival.
However, in his messages there was only one gray, not two blue beads.
“I think it means that messages have not been received,” he said.
Newport on the Levee steals $26,750
According to a press release from the Newport Police Department, on Friday morning thieves stole $26,750 from the Brink's employee who filled an ATM at the Newport on the Levee entertainment center.
“The driver of the car was an empty ATM in an entertainment complex and ready to add more money,” Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
While he was busy, another man “went back from Brink’s, the employee’s back, and stole the extra bag of money.
According to the press release, the Witnesses noticed several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police could not determine the number of persons involved in the crime.
Anyone who has information about their identity should contact Newport Police by phone 859-292-3680.
Kanye West. The rapper changed his name to Ye
Reper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
On Saturday, he tweeted: “A person previously officially known as Kanye West.
West, 41, has been called Ye for some time and named the eighth album, which was released in June.
The change began before Saturday Night Live, where West was expected to release its new album, Yandhi.
He has to replace singer Arian Grande who canceled the show for “emotional reasons,” he said.
Not only is this abbreviated by the current professional name – West said earlier that it had a religious meaning for him.
“I think “yes” is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means “you,” West said earlier this year about the album’s title with radio host Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, it means us.
It began with Kanye, which means the only one, and turned into Ye, which means the reflection of our good, evil, confusion, everything.
The album better reflects who we are.
He is one of many famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced that he preferred the names of Love and Brotherhood Love.
The former West colleague, Jay-Z, also changed his name and used it with or without a dash and capital letters.
Mexican politician Andrés Manuel López Obrador (abbreviatedly Amlo) vows not to use troops against civilians.
Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador vowed never to use military forces against the civilian population when the country's 50th anniversary of bloody repression against students is approaching.
López Obrador on Saturday vowed “Tlatelolco Square” never to use military forces to tame Mexicans.”
On October 2, 1968, at the time when left-wing student movements began across Latin America, representatives of the military in the square shot at a peaceful demonstration, killing 300 people.
López Obrador solemnly pledged to support young Mexicans by subsidising students and opening up more free state universities every month.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities involve young people in criminal groups.
The U.S. should double artificial intelligence funding
“As China is becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount spent on research in this area,” said Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and specialist in artificial intelligence at Google and Microsoft.
These comments came after various U.S. government bodies published reports on artificial intelligence, even the absence of an official artificial intelligence strategy in the U.S. at all.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year to lead artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
\"A double budget for AI research would be a good start, given that all other countries are more advanced than the US and are expected to face another breakthrough in AI,\" Lee said.
Double funding could double the likelihood that the next big achievement of artificial intelligence will be in the US, as Lee said earlier this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book “The Superstates of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” is published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of China’s leading artificial intelligence companies, Face++
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University with an artificial intelligence system that defeated the top-ranking Othello player and later was Microsoft Research CEO and president of Google’s China affiliate.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology contests, such as the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be to help find more insightful people.
Lee said U.S. scientists often have to make hard efforts to win state grants.
\"It's not China that takes away academic leaders -- it's companies,\" Lee said.
Facebook and other tech companies have been hiring bright university minds to work with artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. strengthen its efforts for artificial intelligence.
“I think that doctoral students working in the field of artificial intelligence should automatically be offered green cards,” he said.
In July 2017, China’s State Council announced its New Generation of Artificial Intelligence Development Plan.
In addition, Lee said the Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences funds people from academic institutions, similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations, is spending money on U.S. scientists, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment for the AI Next initiative.
NSF is currently investing more than $100 million in artificial intelligence research per year.
In the coming months, however, nothing has been done about U.S. legislation aimed at establishing a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change country name
Macedonians voted on Sunday in a referendum to change the name of the country in the Republic of North Macedonia, a move that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that blocked its desire to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which is a province of Macedonia, says its northern neighbor’s name means claims to the territory of Greece and vetoed Macedonia’s accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments agreed on the proposed new name, but opponents nationalists said the name change would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority of Macedonians.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and boycott campaign expressed doubts about whether the voter turnout would reach the minimum of 50% required for the referendum to come into effect.
Referendum question on the voting card: \"Are you in favour of NATO membership and EU agreement with Greece \"
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, is worth paying a price to join institutions such as the EU and NATO.
\"Today I came to vote for the future of the country, the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely, protected by the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,\" Olivera Georgievska, 79, told Skopje.
Although not legally binding, a sufficient number of MPs said they would follow the results of the vote and make them decisive.
It would take two-thirds of the majority in parliament to change the name.
The state electoral committee said that no reports of violations had been made before 1 p.m.
But the voter turnout was only 16%, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of voters cast their votes.
“I have come to vote for my children, for our place in Europe,” said Gjos Tanevski, the 62-year-old voter for Skopje.
Macedonian MP Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Duško, voted in a referendum in Macedonia on the change of name to open the way for joining NATO and the European Union. Macedonia, 30 September 2018.
In front of Skopje's parliament, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small scene and pulled chairs in front of tents that boycotted the referendum.
“We are behind NATO and the EU, but we want to join with raised heads, not to enter through the door of the servants,” Kawadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and participate in Eurasian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev said membership of NATO in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 percent, would attract the necessary investments.
“I believe that the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said.
He said that the result “Yes” would be “the guarantee of our future.”
According to a poll released last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research, 30 to 43 percent of voters are expected to participate in the referendum, less than the required turnout.
According to another poll conducted by the Macedonian television network Telma, 57 percent of respondents are expected to vote on Sunday.
70 percent of them said they would vote yes.
For a successful referendum to take place, 50 percent of voters will have to take part, plus one vote.
If the referendum failed, it would be the first serious failure of pro-Western government policy since it took power in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero overcomes all Brighton defense and profit goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton's defense, and the Manchester City team won 2:0 on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero scored the goal in the 65th minute, it would seem, incredibly easy.
The Argentine attacker received the ball in the middle of the square at the beginning of the attack.
Before entering the open field, he flew among three Brighton defenders.
Aguero was then surrounded by four players wearing green shirts.
He broke through one defender, before crossing the edge of Brighton’s penalty court, overtaking several others.
He then passed the ball to the left, where Sterling was.
The English striker returned the ball with one spring from the penalty deck to Aguero, and this right-hand leg kicked the ball to the right side of the gate net, defeating Brighton’s goalkeeper Mathew Ryan.
“Aguero has foot problems,” Pep Guardiola, the head of the city, told reporters.
He said he would play for 55-60 minutes.
Here's how it was.
We were lucky that in that moment he scored a goal –
However, it was Sterling that helped Sky Blues, the first to get ahead in this Premier League.
The goal is 29 minutes.
Aguero received the ball at the depths of Brighton.
Along the left side of the field, he transferred the ball to Leroy Sane.
Sane pushed the ball forward with a few springs until Sterling moved on to the next ball.
Sky Blues – The attacker launched the ball into the gate just before slipping out of the field.
On Tuesday, at 12:55 p.m., City meets Hoffenheim at the Champions League's Zinsheim Arena Rhein-Neckar (Germany).
Scherzer wants to play a friendly match with Rockies
After the Nationals fell out of the playoffs, there were no valid reasons for re-emergence.
The competitive Scherzer hopes to win Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies still have the chance to stay in playoffs; in the national league West, they are one point ahead of Los Angeles Dodgers.
“Rockies – at 5:2 p.m. on Friday night – at least secured a chance to get a preferential trip, but still have to make efforts to secure the right to play in the first division.
“While we play for nothing, at least we can run to the pitch knowing that the atmosphere in Denver, where the crowds of people and the other team will gather, will probably be at the highest level we can achieve this year.
Why not talk -
The nationals have not yet announced Sunday’s startup team, but they are clearly inclined to throw the ball out of Scherzer.
Scherzer, who will be in the 34-year-old building, got a shot training on Thursday and will take the position of a meticulous on his usual day of rest, Sunday.
Washington right-handed statistics for this season: 18-7, 2.53 ERA and 300 auts per 220 2/3 half.
Trump Speaks in West Virginia
Speaking of the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections, the president indirectly refers to the situation with regard to the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
\"Everything we have achieved will be placed on the scales in November.
There are five weeks left to the most important elections in our lives.
That's very important, I don't run... but I'm actually running, that's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere,\" he said.
And then he said, \"You see this terrible, terrible group of Democrats, you see how it's happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by any means, you see how low it is, how angry it is.
They don't care what they hurt, what they crossed through to get power and control; that's what they really want -- power and control, but we won't give it to them.
Democrats, he said, have a mission to \"resist and hinder\"
\"And you see this in the last four days,\" he said, calling the Democrats \"bad, ugly, low, and unjust people.\"
He referred to the Senate Courts Committee as the name of Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which led to huge audience evolutions.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Oh, hm, how.
No, hm... no, I'm waiting for one -- it was really bad body language -- the worst body language of all I've ever seen --
Labour has lost its diversity of views.
They do not tolerate openly speaking opinions.
When “Momentum” activists in my local party voted for distrust in me, I wonder if it was necessary to be surprised.
Finally, I am the latest of Labour MPs to whom I am said to be undesirable, and this is for my opinion.
My fellow lawmaker Joan Ryan has faced similar threats as she firmly opposed anti-Semitism.
My distrust was expressed by criticising me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironic, on similar issues that Jeremy has not agreed with previous leaders.
The report on the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated that “we want a large number of members to be involved in the meetings and that meetings to be productive.”
The majority of the eight-year-olds, when I am a local Labour Party MP, were the same on Friday evening.
It is sad that, today, the tone of many meetings is not so much, and the promises of a “softer, more pleasant” policy have long been forgotten, even if they have ever been put into practice.
It is increasingly clear that a different opinion in the Labour Party is intolerant and that every opinion is judged by whether it is acceptable to the party's leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader of the party, and my colleagues, whom I believed to be similar, began to expect me to turn around 180 degrees and stick to opinions I would never agree with, whether for national security or for the EU single market.
When I speak in public, and even no matter what, social networks are plowing up with insults that promote my withdrawal, condemning the centre's policy, and saying I'm not in the Labour Party.
And this is not just my experience.
In fact, I am far more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments addressed to me are political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who have to withstand the avalanche of sexist and racist insults every day.
One of the most disappointing things about this political era is how insults have become a normal phenomenon.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a party of the same views, and with every “distrust” procedure or amendment of the electoral system, this party is becoming increasingly inferior.
Over the last two years, I’ve received many tips that encourage me not to jump, not to talk so loudly, and then with me, everything will be fine.
But I didn’t come to politics for that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, provoked by the negligence of Thatcher’s government, which in a real sense failed my whole school class, I have sought to win better public services for those most in need, whether as a member of the local council or as a minister of government.
I have never kept up with my politics, including the recent elections.
No one at Nottingham East should have been surprised by my political opinions and areas of disagreement with current leaders in any way.
For those who on Friday encouraged the procedure, I can say that when the country is moving towards Brexit, where households, businesses and public services will suffer, I do not realize the desire to waste time and energy because of my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But in fact, one message I have from Nottingham \"Momentum\" is addressed to my constituents, Labour Party members (or not): I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threats of cancellation or political expediency will stop me from acting in accordance with my beliefs and all your best interests.
Chris Leslie is a Nottingham East MP.
Ayr--Melrose – 38:17 Insurmountable Ayr – conquers the tops of the tables
Two late attempts have distorted the final results, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved this triumph in the spectacular, promise-free day-to-day matches of Tennent's Premiership.
Now the team is at the top of the table – the only one that has not been overcome.
Finally, the victory was brought to them by impeccable defense and well-tapped opportunities, so coach Peter Murchie can really feel satisfied.
“We’ve raised all the tests in all the games we’ve done so far, and we’re still unsurpassed, so I’m really happy,” he said.
Robin Christie, from Melrose, said: \"Ayr, it turned out good, the players took their chances better than we did.\"
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt, which was completed by Frazier Climo, led Ayr forward, but the yellow card for Scott Rory Hughes, released by Warriors, allowed Melrose to collect numbers, and Baggot stopped the non-performing attempt.
Climo increased Ayr’s advantage by a fine, when before, in the middle of the competition itself, he scored points and successfully completed his personal test, helping Ayr to break off the score at 17:5.
However, Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson’s attempt, which was successfully completed by Baggothdad, reduced the gap to five points.
The match was suspended for a longer time because Ruaridh Knott suffered a serious injury and was transported from the car to the car. After the extension of the match, Ayr continued to move forward when Stafford McDowall's trial was successfully completed by Climo.
Ayr's captain Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, and Melrose tried to take advantage of the surplus of players, but Bruce Colvine's attempt was unsuccessful at the end of the fierce pressure.
The home team player returned, but after Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for stopping Climo without a ball, MacPherson pushed the ball from the penalty line behind the continuing Ayr battlefield.
Climo successfully completed his test, as he had done almost since the start of the match's re-launch, after Kyle Rowe stopped David Armstrong's spring at the corner of the square and prevented the country's attacker Gregor Henry from holding the fifth home team's attempt to score points.
Still Game: A Star Looks Ready to Start a New Career in the Restaurant Industry
“Still Game, Star Ford Kiernan seems to be ready to move into the accommodation and catering sector when it turns out he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old man plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC comedy, writes and plays the script with his longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the last season of the show, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning his life after Kraiglang.
With official data, he became director of Adriftmore Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the fact, although Scottish Sun sources suggested that Kiernan was looking for ways to get involved in the Glasgow-rich restaurant business.
“We own the sea,” Bolivia, jailed on land, hopes the court will open the way to the ocean again.
The sailors patrol at the Navy headquarters in La Paz.
There is an ocean blue flag on public buildings.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are decorated with the slogan: “We legally belong to the sea.
Recovering it is our duty.
Throughout the land in Bolivia, there are still memories of access to the ocean that Chile had to sacrifice in the 19th-century bloody conflict over resources, a living and longing again in the Pacific Ocean.
Hopes that have been held over the last few decades have now been greatly strengthened, as Bolivia is awaiting a decision of the International Court of Justice, which will be published on 1 October, after five years of deliberation.
“Bolivia is a concentrated spirit of unity and peace and, of course, hopes for positive results,” Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla said.
Many Bolivian citizens across the country will be watching the announcement of the TTT decision on large screens, hoping that the Hague Tribunal will take a positive decision on the Bolivian complaint – Chile will be obliged to negotiate access to the sea by the Bolivian state.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic president, is expected by a controversial election campaign, and is very interested in the outcome of Monday's decision.
“We are very close to the opportunity to return to the Pacific,” he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts tend to believe that it is unlikely that the court will rule in favour of Bolivia – even if it does, little will change.
The UN authority based in the Netherlands has no power over Chile and has indicated that it will not determine the possible outcome of the negotiations.
The fact that the TTT’s decision will be published only six months after the last arguments were heard is unlikely to show that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, an expert in international law in Chile.
And even if Bolivia managed to make some progress, the past four years have been able to block it back.
“This issue of access to the sea has been unlawfully raised by the current Bolivian administration,” said Zárate.
She believes that any remnants of Chile's goodwill were destroyed by the revengeful Morales rhetoric.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the conversation at some point, but it will be very difficult to discuss it afterwards.
The country has not changed its ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, a Bolivian spokesman in The Hague, opposed the idea that the judgment had been passed unusually quickly.
“Bolivia will have an exceptional opportunity on Monday to start a new relationship with Chile and end the 139-year-old disagreement for mutual benefit,” he said.
Calzadilla has also denied that Morales is still one of the most popular Latin American presidents, and uses the sea issue as a political manipulation.
“Bolivia will never deny its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The decision is an opportunity to see that we have to reconcile with the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament is only possible if it can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho assures his nation will never give up nuclear weapons first if it can’t trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep its promises that rival leaders agreed to at a summit in Singapore.
His comments were made at a time when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to be planning to resume the stuck nuclear diplomacy more than three months after meeting Kim in Singapore.
Ri says that “the utopian dream is that if sanctions are continued and the U.S. refuses to declare the end of the Korean war, North Korea could ever be hit.
Washington avoids acceptance of the declaration unless Pyongyang first takes convincing steps to disarm.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want to hold a second meeting.
But it is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang does not seriously intend to give up the arsenal that the country seems to see as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare the soil for the second Kim and Trump meeting.
The Paris Fashion Show has revealed that the latest trend is massive headwear, and they will soon conquer the nearest fashionable stores
If you want to supplement your hat collection or completely protect yourself from the sun, this trend is right for you.
Designers Valentine and Thomas Browne presented a wide range of eccentrically large headwear in their Spring and Summer 2019 collections, and he simply stunned the viewers of Paris Fashion Week by his style.
These particularly unpractical hats conquered the Instagram social network this summer, and these designers presented eye-catching works on the podium.
The distinguished work of Valentin was a huge body-colored hat decorated with a wide, feathers-like edge encircling the head of the dummy.
Other non-standard accessories were precious watermelons, sorcerer hat and even pineapple – but they were not designed to protect your head from the cold.
Thomas Browne also presented a collection of strange masks – at the same time Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks were sewn with lips and more resembled Hannibal Lecter than the high fashion.
One of the works looked like a diver suit, with a tube and underwater glasses, while the other resembled an equator of melted ice.
And if you follow this huge fashion trend, you won’t ask.
Stylus experts assume that these huge covers can get into stores.
Huge hats became popular with La Bomba, with high heels, straw hats with two-foot edges were worn by everyone – from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cultural brand, which created extremely unpractical hats that conquered all social networks, released another huge piece on the podium – a straw beach bag – almost the same size as the dummy wearing it in a bathing suit.
The red brick-colored raffia bag, decorated with raffia cones and a white leather handle, has become an exclusive highlight of the Jacquemus collection La Riviera SS19 in Paris Fashion Week.
The celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I think that next summer there will be huge hats and beach bags coming to stores because the designer has made such a big impact, so it would be difficult to ignore the need for non-standard-sized accessories.”
John Edward: “Speaking is a crucial skill for the citizens of the world.”
Scottish independent schools have improved their records of academic achievements without falling down in 2018, and have once again demonstrated outstanding exam results, which are only further enhanced by individual and collective achievements in the fields of sport, art, music and other community merits.
When more than 30,000 students are enrolled across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide their students and their parents with the highest possible level of service.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers, and to be global citizens.
While working in the education sector, which can create and implement the planned school programme, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and they prefer schooling.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you can talk to a person in a language he understands, he will understand you with his mind.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will speak to his heart.
It is a strong reminder that we cannot rely on English alone if we want to build relationships and build trust in people from other countries.
According to the results of this year's last exams, we can say that the language boasts at the peak of popularity and in independent schools has the best maintenance ratings.
In total, 68 percent of foreign-language students received the highest A grade.
The data collected from 74 schools that are members of the SCIS showed that 72 percent of students received the highest A rating at the Mandarin language exam, 72 percent of those who studied German, and 69 percent of those who studied French, and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland consider the knowledge of foreign languages to be an essential skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages, as an optional subject, are now considered as important in independent school programs and elsewhere as key subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
According to a 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission, 17 percent of all the reasons employers find it difficult to fill jobs were lack of language skills.
As a result, language skills are becoming increasingly mandatory so that young people are prepared for their future career.
As future employability will depend heavily on languages, these skills are becoming essential in a globalising world.
No matter what career a person chooses when teaching a second language, in the future he will be far superior to others if he has these life-long skills.
By being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, a person who learns several languages will be much more competitive.
According to a 2013 survey by YouGov, involving more than 4,000 UK adults, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to participate in a conversation, while French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage of people, i.e. 15 percent.
That is why investing in language learning is important for today’s children.
By learning several languages, especially in developing countries, children will have better opportunities for meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school is different according to the languages taught in it.
Many schools focus on classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be most important for the UK in view of the future of 2020, such as Mandarins or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of your child, there will always be many languages from which you can choose in an independent school with teaching staff and specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are ready to develop a teaching environment that will prepare children and equip them with the necessary skills to live in the future.
Languages remain vital to the country’s future in today’s global business environment, and this must be reflected in the education system.
Indeed, modern languages should indeed be considered as \"international communication skills\"
Independent schools will continue to offer this opportunity to young people in Scotland for choice, diversity and results.
This must be done.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron to launch Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
There’s little left to wait for LeBron James to launch the Los Angeles Lakers season.
“Lakers – coach Luke Walton announced that James will be playing Sunday season opening competitions with Denver’s Nuggets San Diego.
But how many minutes you will play, it is still unclear.
“It will be more than one minute and less than 48 minutes,” Walton said on Lakers’ official website.
“Lakers – reporter Mike Trudell said on Twitter that James is likely to play for a limited time.
Earlier this week, James was asked about plans for Lakers in six pre-season matches.
“At this stage of my career, I no longer need pre-seasonal matches to prepare,” he said.
Short talk in West Virginia, YouTube
President Donald Trump is launching his campaign this evening in Willing, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five planned Trump languages next week, including stops in friendly areas such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
After voting on the suspension procedure for his chosen Supreme Court candidate, Trump seeks to mobilise support in the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans were threatened with loss of control in Congress in November.
A short speech in West Virginia will take place tonight and how to watch it online?
Short speech in Willing, West Virginia scheduled for 7 p.m. in the evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump speech online in West Virginia on YouTube
Trump is likely to touch on the topic of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh this week as she has sowed a lot of tension over allegations of sexual misconduct when the Senate voted to suspend the candidate until a week before the FBI investigates.
But the main goal of the campaign is to help Republicans gain some strength in the run-up to the November elections.
Therefore, representatives of President Trump’s campaign argue that the aim of the five meetings next week, according to Reuters, is “to energize volunteers and supporters in an effort by Republicans to defend and expand the majority held in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Congress control is so important on his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible because the campaign season starts with a very hot one,” Trump’s spokesman said in a statement.
“A speech scheduled for the Vilnius-Wesbanco arena tonight should attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract the attention of Pittsburgh media,” said West Virginia-Metro News.
Trump will visit West Virginia for the second time in the last month, a state that has won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Senate candidate, Republican Patrick Morrisey, who according to polls is in low ratings.
“This is not a good sign to Morrisey that the president had to come to hit him on top of the ratings,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, Reuters reported.
2018 Ryder Cup Tournament: U.S. team is wary and hopes to enter Sunday unit competition
After three personal rounds on Saturday afternoon, quartets can be exactly what was needed during this Ryder Cup tournament.
Such a swing of success is completely fictional, but players really believe it, especially in competitions like these.
On whose side is success now?
\"They took six points, and now they're four, so I guess we can count it a bit of success,\" said Jordan Spieth, in preparation for the day.
Of course, Europe is leading, has a four-point lead, and there are still twelve matches ahead.
American enthusiasm, according to Spieth, faded, and they did not lack it, not to mention the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each scored three points out of four.
Spieth was invincible from beginning to end and impeccable.
As the round continued, these wild cries of victory became increasingly famous. Thomas scored two points out of two possible to complete the fourth match.
His blow, which won them a victory in this match at the 15th pit, was accompanied by similar shouts that said the American team hadn’t yet threatened the end.
“Just focus and take care of your match,” said Spieth.
Each of these players has been played separately.
By the end of the year, there are 18 successful projects.
The only players who scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last few days are Francesco Molinaris and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed Ryder Cup story.
A strange but charming couple from Europe scored four points out of four possible and can be calm.
“Moliwood was the only couple who didn’t need any additional strikes not only on Saturday afternoon, but also on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning.
The course of the events and the reaction of the fiery viewers only confirm that they will be the players who win on Sunday, and no one else will be able to achieve such popularity as Fleetwood or Molinar, who, after the last sunshine in Le Golf National’s field, have the chance to win Europe.
It would be good to have both of them at the same time.
It’s too early to talk about Europe’s glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson played briefly with Sergio Garcia, the eastern hero of four balls when he was paired with Alex Noren.
An additional blow and two double additional strikes during the first nine series of pits pushed Spain and Sweden into trouble, from which they failed to escape.
But no one will get out of trouble on Sunday.
Four-ball and four-ball matches are so interesting to observe because of the interaction between couples, the advice they give and don’t give, and the fact that the strategy can change instantly.
Europe has played better as a team, and therefore came to the final with decisive leadership, but this stage of the quadrants has also shown that the US team has a fighter's spine, which some, especially in the states, doubted.
Ryder: Europe Leads at 10:6 on the Last Day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will meet the last day of the Ryder Cup with a strong lead, ahead of the United States in Saturday’s fourth round at 10:6.
Inspiring Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinario’s duo continued to heat up the atmosphere by winning two victories against the hard-wrestling Tiger Woods and leading Le Golf National in four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, in order to preserve the trophy that he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American side in the morning four-way match against the unsuccessfully playing American side and finished the stage with a score of 3:1.
The U.S. showed more resistance in four when two matches were won, but failed to win points.
The Jim Furyk party needs eight points from Sunday's 12-unit match to keep the trophy in its hands.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a row when Molliwood, along with Molinari, doubles after a sensational weekend, and they’re just the second couple to win four points during their first four matches in the Ryder Cup’s history.
Overcoming Woods and Patrick Reed in four, they impeccably defeated Woods who lost trust and American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau for even better results at 5:4.
Woods, who otherwise did not win two Saturday matches, at some point showed a high level of professionalism, but had already lost 19 and 29 of his matches in four, seven in a row.
Justin Rose was resting in the morning's fours and returned to play with partner Henrik Stenson in the fours; they scored 2:1 over 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Coepk, who ranked first and third in the world's rankings.
Despite a pleasant, gentle breeze day in the southwest of Paris, Europe did not go as far as butter.
Three times the winner, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, raised the American cartel, winning two points on Saturday.
In the four-ball match, they won a tough score of 2:1 against Spanish Jonas Rahma and Ian Poulter, and in the four-ball match they won the Poulter and Rory McIlroy score of 4:3 without winning the ball in the first two points.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, the team managed to win a four-point lead in individual matches, although the Furyko half would have enough equals to keep the trophy going.
While two days were in second place, Sunday’s success seemed to have turned away.
North Korea Says It Will Never Displace Unilaterally, Unable to Trust
North Korea’s foreign minister said Saturday that sanctions continued to deepen their distrust of the United States and that the country would not give up nuclear weapons unilaterally in such circumstances.
The General Assembly of the Ri Yong Ho World Organization said North Korea had taken \"significant measures of good will\" in recent years, such as halting nuclear missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test base and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
\"But we didn't get a similar response from the US side,\" he regretted.
“With no trust in the US, we will not be able to trust our national security, and in such circumstances we will not be the first to unilaterally disarm ourselves.”
While Ri repeated North Korea’s complaints about Washington’s opposition to nuclear disarmament, which would reward North Korea at its steps of action, his statement broke out in that he did not completely reject the idea of bilateral disarmament, as Pyongyang had done before.
Ri mentioned a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at his first US presidential-North Korean summit in Singapore on June 12, when Kim committed to working on the “disarmament of the Korean Peninsula” and Trump vowed to ensure North Korea’s security.
North Korea is looking for a formal end to the Korean War of 1950-1953, but the United States says Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also refused to ease international sanctions against North Korea.
“The U.S. demands nuclear disarmament first and increases the pressure on sanctions to reach its goal through violent methods, even by refusing the declaration of the end of the war,” he said.
“To think that sanctions can knock us down is the same thing as for people who don’t care about waking up utopian dreams.
But the problem is that continuing sanctions deepen our distrust.
Ri did not mention plans for the second meeting between Kim and Trump, which was highlighted by the US leader at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, he highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months: “If another country were South Korea on this issue of nuclear disarmament and not the United States, the issue of nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not have reached such an agility.”
However, the tone of the Ri speech changed dramatically compared to last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that when \"Mr. Evil president - Trump called the Kim - rocket Mr. - on a suicide mission - directed North Korean missiles to the United States was absolutely inevitable.
This year, in the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take steps toward disarmament, but said much remains to be done and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea meets its nuclear disarmament requirements.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a timetable and said \"if it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter.\"
China and Russia said the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
But U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pomeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that “the Security Council’s sanctions must be decisively continued without any concessions until complete final evidence-based nuclear disarmament is carried out.”
The Security Council has voted in favour of sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to prevent the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri at the backstage of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to clean the soil for the next meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip was unsuccessful.
In July, he left Pyongyang saying that all progress had been made only to make North Korea announce within hours that he had \"gangsterical demands.\"
North Korea vowed to dismantle its missile base and nuclear facility at a meeting with Moon this month if the United States takes \"the appropriate measures\"
Kim said the “appropriate measures” he sought were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and a shift to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn enough to rest
A new course at Harvard University this year encouraged all its students to sleep more in order to combat growing match culture in studios, taking caffeine and without sleeping at night
One academic found that in the world’s best university, students often do not even have basic knowledge of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and Brigham City, a female hospital specialist, have developed a course that he says is the first of its kind in the United States.
Inspiration to prepare for this course was visited by him after talking about the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
\"At the end of the speech, one girl came to me and said, \"Why am I told only now, in the last year of study?\"
She said no one had told her about the importance of sleep, and that surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course is offered for the first time this year. It explains to students how the most important habits of quality sleep help to achieve academic and sporting results, improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard School of Medicine and executive director of the university’s health services department, said the university had decided to offer this course when it turned out that students lack sleep in a week.
Hourly course includes a series of interactive tasks.
One section contains a dorm room photo, where students can click on a cup of coffee, curtains, trainers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine, light, how sleep deprivation affects sports results and how important the routine of going to bed.
In the next section, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A student campus map with interactive icons that encourage participants to reflect on their daily routine.
“We understand that this will not immediately change the behaviour of students.
But we think they have the right to know – just like you have the right to know about health consequences when you choose to smoke, Professor Czeisler explained.
A culture of pride for not sleeping overnight, he said, still exists. Modern technology and increasing pressure on students have led to an increasing problem of lack of sleep.
“To ensure that enough and quality sleep, should be the secret weapon of students in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety,” he said, “even while avoiding gaining weight, because lack of sleep turns the brain into a starvation mode, so students constantly feel hungry.”
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler prepare a course when he attended one of his subjects last year, in his first year in Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to ask for a course accessible to the entire student town.
He hopes that the next step will be to invite all postgraduate students to listen to this course before attending this competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advised students to set up an alarm clock when it’s time to go to sleep just like it’s time to wake up, and to beware of the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic devices and LED lighting, as they can beat your circadian rhythm out of balance, so it can be hard to fall asleep.
Livingston 1:0 Rangers: Menga's goal upset Gerrard's men
“Rangers have experienced another disappointment when Dolly Menga in Livingstone managed to overcome the weakened Steven Gerrard score of 1:0.
“Ibrox was hoping to win his first victory on a trip after the February triumph score of 4:1 St Johnstone, but Gary Holt’s team won Gerrard for the second time in the 18th position as head of the game, and now he’s eight points behind the ever-evading prime minister Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, but those who played Rangers without inspiration did not see the possibility of equalizing the result.
“Rangers have now fallen to sixth place, Livingston has risen to third and just one goal is behind Hibernian.
And Rangers’ worries don’t end with this, as the butter object most likely hit the side judge Calum Spence and wounded him.
Gerrard made four changes that allowed him to overtake Ayr and led him to the semifinal of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, trusted the same monk who took a point from Hearts last week and would have liked his well-thought-out combinations to smash opponents at every step.
Rangers dominated the ball, but they did more with Livingston.
They were able to win the second minute after Menga gave the ball a close blow to Scott Pittman, who was in the allan McGregor's gate, but safety destroyed his chance of turning the ball away from the gate.
After Keaghan Jacobs’s long-distance free kick, the ball reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his partner, defender Alan Lithgow, applied for a pass.
\"Rangers took control, but the last third of the match was only hope, not faith in their game.
Fifteen minutes later, Alfred Morelos thought he deserved a fine when faced with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson took the complaints to Colombian by hand.
“Rangers, in the first half, were able to hit only twice, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly frightened by Lassana Coulibaly’s head-blow or by the gentle parody of Ovie Ejaria.
Although the 34-minute goal may not have been in line with the match, no one will argue that they deserved it just for their efforts.
“Rangers, again, failed to overcome Jacobs’ virulent defense.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his self-control and passed the Menga for easy completion.
During the break, Gerrard took action to replace Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and the change almost immediately brought fruit when he played Morelos in the country's guard, but when Kelly ran away with his impressive play.
“Livingston has added guests to the game they like – with the distant transfers of the Lithgow and Halkett ball.
Holt's team was able to increase his lead at the end, but McGregor defended Jacobs' blow after Lithgow's delivery from the corner.
Glenn Middleton, who left the field after the change, appealed again at the end of the match for a fine after a collision with Jacobs, but Thomson ignored him again.
Almanach: Inventor of the Geiger counter
And now the page of our Sunday Morning almanacho: September 30, 1882, today it's 136 years ago and MORE... On that day, future physicist Johannes Wilhelm (Hans) Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a method to detect and measure radioactivity. The invention by which the device was later developed, known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, this device has become the hit of the world of science, and later a hit of popular culture as well, when the 1950 film Bells of Coronado played cowboys in less-liked scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What the hell is that?”
Rogers: “This is a Geiger meter used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can actually hear how atoms work, touched by radioactive action in minerals.
Evans: \"Oh, now it's really shooting.\"
Hans Geiger died in 1945 just days before his 63rd birthday.
His name, however, is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see bad cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see bad cells and kill them
The vaccine has taught the immune system to recognize bad cells – this is part of the treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory
Then cells can ‘see’ the proteins that are present in many cancers and are injected back again.
The test vaccine has shown promising results in the treatment of patients with various forms of cancer.
One woman treated with this vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells, lost her ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory, then cells can see proteins specific to HER2 cancers and are injected back again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our findings suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
“HER2 promotes the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovaries, lungs and rectum,” explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach when immune cells are extracted from patients and used to target cancer cells has been successfully applied in the treatment of leukaemia.
Kanye West released a Trump-sponsored Tirad wearing a MAGA hat after his performance on the SNL show.
This is not over in good time.
After a non-binding performance on Saturday Night Live, spectators screamed at Kanye West, who praised US President Donald Trump, saying he would take part in the 2020 campaign.
That evening, he performed the third song, \"Ghost Town,\" in which he wore a hat with the inscription \"Make America Great,\" continued to condemn the Democrats and expressed support for Trump.
“How many times have I had to talk to whites, they said, “How can you like Trump, because he’s a racist?”
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he explained.
The SNL’s show began with a comic scene in which Matt Damon laughed at Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate Court Committee over allegations of sexual misconduct by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn’t broadcast, filmed footage with West’s replicas was uploaded to social networks by comedian Chris Rock.
It’s not clear if Rock was trying to make a mistake in this record.
In addition, West complained to the audience that behind the scenes of his head covering had troubles.
“They were mocking me behind the scenes.
He said not to go there with such a hat.
They're mocking me!
They said I reached the bottom, he was comforted by Washington Examiner.
West continued, “Do you want to see what the bottom is?” he asked. “Give me my superman hat, and that means you can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to live?
Start to Love
His comments at least twice sparked dissenting shouts in the audience, and SNL broadcast members seemed embarrassed, according to the report “Variety – One person told the media: “A whole studio had a deadly silence.”
West was invited to replace singer Arian in Grande as her ex-boyfriend rapper Mac Miller died a few days ago.
West confused many with his performance in which he performed the song \"I Love It\" wearing a Perrier bottle suit.
He received support from TPUSA’s leader, Candace Turner, who posted on Twitter: “For one of the most courageous spirits to man, thank you for the MINI”
But the interviewer Karen Hunter posted on Twitter that West simply “was himself and it’s incredibly amazing.”
“But I choose NOT to buy a person’s music or clothes, or to support his art, whose beliefs are a poisonous ideology that harms my community.
He's free.
But we are also free,” she added.
Prior to the start of the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and that he was now formally known as Kanye West.
He was not the first creator to change his name, but followed the same path that Diddy has already called, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Colleague rapper Snoop Dogg was originally called Snoop Lyon; music legend Prince changed his name to symbol and later became known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder of knife attack at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been accused of attempted murder after a man was injured with a knife on Friday in eastern Belfast.
According to police, the incident took place in Balihakamore.
The accused is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The prosecutions will be reviewed by the prosecutor’s office.
Next Harington Criticizes Perverted View of Maleity
Another Harington became famous as a sword-swallowing character in John Snau HBO's fantastic adventure series about the Middle Ages \" Game Wars \"
But the 31-year-old actor criticizes the stereotype of the match hero. He claims that such roles on the screen often make young boys feel as if they had to be tough to be respected.
Speaking at Sunday Times Culture, another said he thought “something is wrong” and raised the question of how to deal with the problem of distorted masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Another, who recently married Rose Leslie, a 31-year-old colleague, said he was “strongly touched” by the theme.
“I feel that this topic is very important to me now. Where we made a mistake in nurturing masculinity,” he asked.
“What we teach growing men that we face such problems”
Another believes that, in part, this distorted wave of masculinity could be responsible for television because it creates very masculine characters.
He continued: “What is innate, and what is learned?
What is so taught on television or on the street that young people are convinced that they should have this kind of masculinity?
I think this is one of the most important questions of our time: how do we change it?
Obviously, we made a mistake with the young men somewhere.
He also confirmed in the interview that he would not participate in any prehistory or sequels of the \"Shist Wars\", when the series would end next summer, and claimed that \"he already had enough battlefields and horses\"
From November the next film will be in the modern version of Sam Shepard’s True West, a film about the robber of the film director and his brother.
The actor recently revealed the best thing that happened to him in the creation of the \"Treat Wars\" - there met his wife Rose.
“I met my wife in this series, so in this sense the series gave me a future family and a future life,” he said.
\"Emmy - in the award-winning fantastic series Rose played Igrit, the object of love of another character John Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie’s family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China announces 14% increase in new cases
China reported an increase of 14% in HIV and AIDS infected citizens.
According to health authorities, more than 820,000 people have been infected.
In the second quarter of 2018, 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most newly infected people have been sexually transmitted, which is different from the statistics of the past.
Traditionally, HIV infection has spread rapidly in some parts of China due to infected blood transfusion.
But this reduced the number of people infected with HIV to almost zero, according to Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, over time, the number of people living with HIV infection and AIDS has increased to 100,000 in China.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a sensitive issue in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
As conservative values prevail in the country, 70-90% of men who have sexual relations with men ultimately lead women.
Most cases of infection with this disease occur due to inadequate protective measures during such sexual relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as one way to combat this problem.
Maxine Waters denies workers leaking Republican senator data, condemning “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
U.S. spokeswoman Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that one of her employees had posted personal information from three Republican U.S. senators on Wikipedia.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the charges were made by ultra-right-wing experts and websites.
“A lie, a lie, and a lie again,” said Waters on Twitter.
The disclosures included the home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday, reported by an unknown person from the Capitol Hill at a time when charges of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh were being investigated in the Senate.
The leaked information appeared a while later when these three senators asked Kavanaughu questions.
“On Conservative websites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, it was reported that the IP address at which the source of these records related to the Waters Office was identified and the information of the Waters staff member was disclosed.
“These unjustified allegations are absolutely false and absolute lies,” Waters continued.
“A member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security have been affected by these fraudulent and false allegations shall in no way be responsible for the leaking of this information.
These false allegations are absolutely false and absolute lies.
The statement quickly received criticism on the Internet, including from a former White House spokesman, Ari Fleischer.
“This denial sounds angry,” Fleischer wrote.
“It says she doesn’t have enough self-control to be a member of Congress.
If someone is accused of things he has not done, he should not be angry.
He should not defend.
He should not question the defendant’s motives.
It should be calm and humble.
Fleischer seems to have tried to compare the reaction of Waters with the democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of looking too angry at Thursday's sitting.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is involved in the midterm election campaign to replace Waters, also said he was on Twitter.
“The truth is, if not a lie,” he wrote.
In a statement, Waters said its office had informed the authorities and law enforcement agencies concerned of these false accusations.
“We will make sure that the organisers are clarified,” she continued, “that they are legally responsible for all of their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all of my employees without exception.”
A review of the comedy “Jony Inglish Again” – a breathtaking parody of spies with Rowan Atkinson
It has become a tradition to look for Brexit hints in any British film. The same thing seems to be true of the resuscitation of the action comedy franchise “Jonis Inglišas” – “Jonis Inglišas” was launched in 2003 and returned to screens again in 2011 with the comedy “The Resurrection of John Inglišas”
Will this sarcastic car become a new opportunity for national exports?
Whatever the case, the incompetent Johnny Inglish has a second chance, with his wide eyes and his rubber face, of bringing unpleasant truths to the surface, since the name itself clearly indicates that this comedy work is intended for non-English-speaking regions of the cinematographer.
Of course, this stupid secret agent, who, despite claims of luxury, has acquired some of the qualities of Inspector Clouseau, a little bit of Mr. Byn's features and a little resemblance to that guy, hinted at which was used to create the theme of the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony of the drama Fire Carriage.
It is also somewhat based on the character of a traveler and a mysterious man who caused the chaos that Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ad.
There are a few beautiful moments in this latest Johnny Inglish movie.
I liked it when Johnny Inglish approached the helicopter, wearing a medieval suit and armor, and the blade rotor hit his helmet.
The comedic talent of Atkinson is obvious, but humor itself seems breathtaking and strangely excessive, especially when serious film brands such as 007 and “Mission is impossible – boldly inserts elements of comedy.
Humor is more for children than adults, and the adventures of Johnny Inglish, who didn’t believe me, don’t look as ingenious and peaceful as Atkinson’s silent jokes of playing Mr. Byne.
The most common issue at the moment is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has successfully invaded Britain’s ultra-secret spy network and revealed the identities of all British spies in the area, causing the agent’s outrage – the too insignificant role of Kevin Eldon.
This is the last drop in the cup of the prime minister, the pompous and angled character, who is already suffering from the stunning political unpopularity: Emma Thompson of Teresa May's depicting character squeezes out everything he can, but there is little good material in the scenario.
Wise counselors inform her that the identity of all her agents has been revealed and that she will have to look for people among the retired.
This means that I will have to turn to Johnny Inglish, currently a school director at some chic institution, but providing illegal lessons on how to work as a secret agent. Here were some good jokes when Inglish proposed a School of Rock-type Spy Academy.
It is sent back to Whithol to discuss the state of emergency and meets with its longtime general Bough, once again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man associated with a submarine commander, and Vicki Pepperdine, who plays a high-society girl, seems to be underutilized.
So Batman and Robin, who are able to confuse all affairs in Her Majesty’s secret ministry, are taking action again and meeting Olga Kurylenko’s fatal beautiful Ofelija Buletova.
The prime minister has a dangerous head-to-head charismatic billionaire who says he can solve the problem of British computers, i.e. the villain Jason Volt, who is played by Jake Lacy.
The Englishman and Bough begin their own odyssey: when they dress with waiters, they cause fire in a French restaurant, cause chaos in the luxury yacht of Volta, and Inglish begins a complete anarchy, trying to use the headphones of virtual reality to get acquainted with the interior of the house of Volta.
All the stops were clear to hold on to this last series, but no matter how kind or savage it is, it is all well-liked by children's television.
Quite mediocre.
How about Johnny Inglish's other films, I couldn't get rid of the idea: is the British film industry unable to give Rowan Atkinson a role that would certainly be worthy of his talent?
Labour party denies creating plan for British workers for four days a week but to pay for five days
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn plans to consider a radical plan that would allow the British to work four days a week, but to pay for five days.
The party said it wanted corporate leaders to share savings from the AI revolution, giving their employees one free day.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend and bring home the same amount of salary.
The source says that this idea is in line with the party’s economic agenda and plans to shift the country’s development in a favourable direction for workers.
The transition to four working days week was also welcomed by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
The Sunday Times said: “The review of political provisions is expected to be published by the end of the year.
This will not happen overnight, but the four-day week is in line with the party’s approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party is not the first to promote this idea, and the Green Party has also promised to do so in the four-day week of the 2017 general election campaign.
However, not the entire Labour Party supports this idea at the moment.
A Labour Party spokesman said: \"The four-day week is not party politics and it is not discussed in the party.
Shadow government spokesman John McDonnell took the opportunity to present his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy at a Labour Party conference last week.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from \"facial dictators\" and \"profit hunters\" in utilities.
Such plans by the shadow chancellor also mean that current shareholders of water companies may not recover their entire share, because when they see the injury done, the Labour Government can deduct something.
It also approved plans to involve employees in the company’s board of directors and set up equity funds to transfer 10% of the private sector’s capital to employees, and they could receive up to GBP 500 per annum dividends.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy answered 60 Minutes whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugho could change their opinion.
During the FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, the final vote on whether to refer him to the Supreme Court was postponed for at least a week, and the question arises as to whether the facts clarified by the Bureau of Inquiry could affect the opinion of some Republican senators so that they would not reject the judge.
In an interview on Sunday, 60 Minutes, co-rapporteur Scott Pelley asked Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether it could happen that the FBI would find out someone who would change their opinion.
Senator Kennedy seems to be taking a more liberal approach than his South Carolina colleague.
“Well, yes, of course,” said Kennedy.
\"As I said on my way to the meeting, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
When this happened, when these charges appeared, I called him and asked him, “Have you done this?”
He replied decisively, firmly, unequivocally –
So Graham's views seem to be unchanged.
\"I've decided on Brett Kavanaugh, it's a really shocking accusation,\" he says.
“For Dr. Ford, I don’t know what it was, but I know one thing: Brett denies it categorically,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“No one she calls can confirm that.
It has been 36 years.
I don't think anything new will come out.
What is the World Citizens' Festival and has it contributed in any way to poverty reduction?
This Saturday’s World Citizens’ Festival will be held in New York City, an annual music event with an impressive number of stars and an equally impressive goal to end global poverty.
For the seventh year in the Central Park’s Great Meadows, the World Citizens’ Festival will meet tens of thousands of people who will not only listen to such stars as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but will also spread the message about the real goal of the event – to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens' Festival was launched in 2012. It is a follow-up to the World Anti-Corruption Project – an international mediation group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you wanted to purchase a paid VIP ticket), the concert’s visitors had to perform various tasks or actions, such as volunteering activities, sending an email to the world leader, calling the phone or any other meaningful help to raise awareness of their goal of eliminating poverty.
However, do the citizens of the world succeed in achieving this goal? 12 years remain until the deadline set.
Will the idea of a reward for people in a free concert really convince them to insist and urge them to act? Maybe this is just another example of so-called clictivism, fictitious activism, people think that they will really change the situation by signing an online petition or posting a tweet.
According to the organizers of the World Citizens' Festival, since 2011 the movement has registered more than 19 million actions of its supporters to promote a wide range of goals.
They say that under pressure, world leaders have announced $37 billion in commitments and policies that will change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group identified 390 commitments and statements driven by the group’s actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or raised.
According to the group's calculation, the secured funds have already been directly affected by nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership between investors and investors to “help children grow up and reveal their full potential – with more than 4,700 Twitter messages from the world’s citizens, it promised to give Rwanda US dollars to help address the country’s nutritional failure.
“With the support of the UK government, supporters, governments and nations like you, citizens of the world, we can make social injustices such as nutritional failure a thing of the past,” said London’s London-based ambassador Tracey Ullman in April 2018.
The group also said that after receiving 5,000 appeals calling for improved nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funding for a project called Nutrition Power, which will bring nutritional interventions to 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the questions on our website, “Why do you think we can eradicate extreme poverty”
The citizens of the world respond: “This is a long and difficult road – sometimes we will stumble and experience failures.
But like the great movements for human rights and against apartheid, we will win because we are all stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd – Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe – are some of the performers who are taking part in this year’s event in New York.
Home Secretary Says US Can Use Navy Blocks to Prevent Russian Energy Exports
“If necessary, Washington can use the fleet to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, as well as markets in the Middle East,” said Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, according to Washington Examiner.
Zinke said Russia's participation in Syria, especially when it acts at the invitation of legitimate authorities, was a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I think Russia is meddling in the Middle East because it wants to regulate the energy sector, just as it does in Eastern Europe, in the southern part of Europe,” Zinke said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to resolve this issue.
\"The United States can do this through the fleet, can make sure the maritime routes are open and, if necessary, can carry out a blockade, make sure their energy does not reach the market,\" he said.
Zinke said this at an event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a not-for-profit group that called itself the voice of the US-energy consumers.
He then compared Washington’s methods with those applied to Russia and Iran and noted that they were essentially the same.
“The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is to find a more or less counterbalance that will change fuel,” he said, calling Russia a country whose entire economy depends solely on fossil fuels.
These statements came as part of the Trump administration's mission to increase its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe and to replace Russia, which offers European consumers a much cheaper opportunity.
Therefore, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the supposedly inappropriate Nord Stream 2-2 pipeline project that, according to Trump, made Berlin a prisoner of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that an 11 billion Nord Stream 2 – which will double the existing pipeline’s capacity to 110 billion cubic meters – is just an economic project.
The Kremlin said Washington’s fierce opposition to the project was purely economic, an example of unfair competition.
“I think we all agree that energy cannot be a means of pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with US Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position received a hostile reaction from Germany and reaffirmed its determination to continue the project.
The main German industrial organisation, the German Industrial Federation (BDI), called on the US not to interfere in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
\"I really oppose the third country's interference in our energy supply affairs,\" said Dieter Kempf, head of the German industrial federation (BDI), after the recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously consider raising her candidacy in 2020 presidential election
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would be serious about the presidential candidate after the midterm election.
During a meeting at the Hall of Holjoko in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider a candidate.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington to manage our failed government, they have to go to the top,” she said in the hall.
“After November 6, I will seriously consider whether to participate in the presidential elections.”
At a meeting at the city hall, Warren pranked President Donald Trump, saying he was leading the country in the wrong direction.
“I am very frightened by Donald Trump’s treatment of our democracy,” she said.
Warren openly criticizes Trump and his proposed Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet published on Friday, Warren said: “It is absolutely necessary to conduct an FBI investigation before the vote.”
But a poll released on Thursday showed that most voters in Warren’s own state think she shouldn’t stand for president in 2020.
According to a survey conducted by Suffolk University’s Center for Political Research and the Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of expected Massachusetts voters say the senator should not participate in elections.
Thirty-two percent support her candidacy.
The poll showed that former governor Devil Patrick received more support – 38 percent supported his candidacy and 48 percent opposed.
Others have been discussed about the name of the Democrat party, which was named after former vice-president Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden says he will make a formal decision in January, according to Associated Press.
At Donald Trump’s meeting, Sarah Palin talks about Traumatic Disorder of Track Palin
Track Palin, a 26-year-old who entered military service in September, spent a year in Iraq.
In the event of an incident of domestic violence on Monday night, he was arrested and charged.
“I see what my son is going through, what he is dealing with when he comes back to everyday life, so I understand other families who experience the consequences of the post-traumatic disorder, and some of the injuries of our soldiers that they are returning to,” she told the meeting of Donald Trump in Talsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a avoidable truth. She said that the son and other war veterans “are returning a little changed, they are returning to a more firm heart, they are returning to doubting whether they would respect what their comrades and pilots had given to their country.”
He was arrested on Monday in Vasilia, Alaska, charged with domestic violence and an attack on a woman, as well as charged with preventing reports of domestic violence with a gun and intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Vasily Police Department.
18 states and District of Columbia support opposition to new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the legal challenge of a new US policy that refuses to provide asylum to those fleeing from gang violence or domestic violence.
On Friday, 18 states in Washington, D.C. and representatives of the district submitted comments from Amicus Curiae to support the challenge of asylum seekers' policies, NBC News reported.
The applicant’s full name in the proceedings of Grace v Sessions, which the American Civil Liberties Union began against federal policy, is not disclosed.
She said her partner, and members of his criminal gang, had been violently against her, but US officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Grace-backed state lawyers described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which the United States receives a lot of asylum applications as states, struggling with persistent gang violence and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy repealed the Immigration Appeals Council’s 2014 decision allowing undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Columbia County Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy \"does not respect the national, federal and international laws in force for decades.\"
“Federal laws require decisions on asylum applications to be taken in the light of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such prohibition violates this principle,” said Amicus Curiae.
In this comment, lawyers also argue that policies that prohibit immigrants from entering the country are detrimental to the U.S. economy, and that immigrants are more likely to be engaged in business and “to provide the necessary employment services.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions in June ordered immigration judges to stop asylum for those fleeing domestic violence and victims of gang violence.
“Asylum is granted to those who leave their home country for persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion,” he said in a June 11 policy statement.
Asylum has never been intended to solve all problems (not all serious problems) that people face every day around the world.
With the double increase of the number of victims in Palu, the desperate search for the rest of the living remains.
The situation of the rest of the living is constantly deteriorating.
“The tension is very high,” says Risa Kusuma, 35, in the center of the evacuation of the city of Palu, calming his baby’s fever-free son.
“The speed continues to carry more and more bodies.
Lack of clean water
It has been observed that residents return to their destroyed homes, collect heavy water objects, try to save what they can find.
Hundreds of people have been injured and 7.5-point earthquake hospitals have been damaged.
Some of the injured, like Dwi Harry, who suffered from back and shoulder fractures, were placed outside at the Palu Military Hospital, where hospital patients were treated in the open air for repeated strokes.
His eyes are filled with tears when he tells him how he felt a severe earthquake in the hotel’s fifth floor room, where he stayed with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save others.
I seem to have lost my way through the ruins of the wall,” Harry said, adding that he had come with his family to attend the wedding.
“I heard my wife’s cry for help, and then silence.
I don’t know what happened to her and her daughter.
I hope they’re healthy.”
US ambassador accuses China of threatening propaganda
A week later, when the official Chinese newspaper distributed four pages of advertising in the US daily, praising the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to China Daily as a paid supplement to the most expensive Iowa newspaper, the Des Moines Register, and accused China of influencing the November 6 U.S. congressional elections, which China denies.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing is trying to influence U.S. elections marks a new phase of a growing Washington campaign to put pressure on China,” US officials told Reuters.
While it is common practice that foreign governments are distributing advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a growing trade war, and both sides are fighting tariffs on each other’s imports of goods.
According to Chinese and US experts, China's retaliatory tariffs were targeted at exporters from Iowa and similar states who supported the Trump Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China, a former long-term governor of Iowa and one of the biggest agricultural exporters to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
In an article published in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, Branstad said that China “is even more mocking when it started printing propaganda in our free press.”
“By spreading propaganda, the Chinese government used the freedom of speech and the press respected in America and ordered a paid promotional message, ‘Des Moines Register,’” he wrote.
“But in the local Beijing press kiosk, you won’t find each other’s opposing voices and you won’t create a real picture that reflects the different opinions that the Chinese people may have about the alarming economic trajectory of China, because the press is under the solid foot of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
Mr Branstad also added that “one of China’s most famous newspapers has escaped from its print offering, but he did not mention which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn: in the run-up to the mid-elections, Kavanaugh fiasko is deterred by Republican voter
While many Republican leaders remain loyal to the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has been charged with sexual harassment, the analyst warned it would face a negative response in the upcoming mid-term elections, especially from women.
The situation is extremely emotional, and many Republicans have already officially said they want to vote.
Such things can’t be taken back later,” Grant Reeher, professor at the University of Syracuse’s Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted whether Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute calls for FBI investigation would be enough to reassure angry voters.
\"Women will not forget what happened yesterday -- they will remember it both tomorrow and November,\" the Washington newspaper said Friday as senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted: “November is approaching – during a demonstration at the Senate lobby when Republicans controlling the judiciary decided to nominate Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Kzip reported.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will touch across borders,” said St Rothenberg, an unbiased political analyst at the news site.
People say she was so strong, and they're right.
But it could further strengthen positions, especially among undecided female voters in the suburbs and younger 18-29-year-old voters who, although they don’t like the president, often simply don’t vote.
Even before Ford made public statements when she detailed her allegations of sexual harassment against a candidate for the Supreme Court, analysts said that if Republicans confirmed the candidacy, it could cause outrage.
\"This has caused great confusion for the Republican Party,\" former chairman of the Republican National Committee Michael Steele said at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee or the final vote, not only about whether Kavanaugh will be appointed as a judge, but also about how Republicans controlled the situation and how Mr Ford treated it,” Guy Cecil told the news channel, “Priorities USA – director of the group that assists Democrats in the elections.
However, it seems that there is still a disagreement between Americans about what to believe after Kavanaugh and Ford's testimony, although she has a little bit of support.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents believe in Ford’s testimony, and 35 percent say they believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh had really or probably lied to the testimony, and only 30 percent thought the same about Ford.
Flake, the FBI is currently investigating charges against Ford and evidence from at least one other accused Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford swore to the Senate Courts Committee last week, saying Kavanaugh had attacked her while she was intoxicated when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed her his genitals at the party they attended while studying at Yale University in the 9th century.
Web inventor plans to set up a new internet to resist Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, a global network inventor, is developing a new startup to compete with Facebook and Google.
The latest project of this legendary inventor Inrupt is a company based on Berners-Lee open source platform Solid
“Solid” allows users to choose where their data is stored, as well as who and to which information they have access.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company – Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt’s goal was to conquer the world.
“We have to do this now,” he said about the startup.
This is a historic moment.
Solid is a technology-based application that allows people to create their own personal data online store (POD).
It may include lists, job lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal or work tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook and Spotify are available in the same browser at the same time.
The online store of personal data is unique in that only the user decides who and to which information can access.
This is what the company calls a person’s empowerment through data.
According to CEO John Bruce, Inrupt’s idea is to provide resources, processes, and skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
Currently, the company consists of T. Berners-Lee, J. Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several programmers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised applications using the tools on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team were not in talks with Facebook or Google about changes that would turn all business models upside down overnight.
“We are not asking for their permission.”
According to Berners-Lee, “The Inrupt mission is to provide a trading energy and an ecosystem that will help protect the durability and quality of a new Solid-based network.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet at Massachusetts University of Technology by setting up the Web Consortium.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had an influential opinion in the debate on Internet neutrality.
Even when working with Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I feel great optimism about this new web era,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vanne, Honored Priest of the Victorian Cross in World War I
On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of his hometown, he honored the only priest of the Anglican Church who was awarded the Victorian Cross as a fighter during the First World War.
Lt-Col. pastor Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918 during the Belenglize and Lukour attack.
Unfortunately, after four days the pastor was shot dead by a sniper, so he did not know that he was awarded the highest-ranking British army award.
At the parade in Radden, Northamptonshire, two grandchildren opened the memory stone.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vanne, said that the fact that the stone was revealed just 100 years after his grandfather won the award is “excellently symbolic.”
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, a lieutenant colonel led his battalion through the St. Kentucky Canal “in the face of a very thick fog, with heavy fire on guns and machine guns.”
Later, he rushed to the shooting line and, especially in a galantically, led the line forward, then one himself attacked the cannon and killed the three fighters of the regiment.
Lieutenant Colonel B. Vanna was shot dead by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vanne, 72, said that his grandfather’s actions were “some things that would never be equal, but at the same time a very inspiring thing.”
After a parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra, Michael and his brother Dr. James Vanne laid the crown.
Michel Vanne said he was honored to participate in the parade, adding: “The courage of a real hero is shown by the support that many people will give.”
MMA fans weren’t going to sleep all night to see Bellator 206 but had to be satisfied with Piggy Pepa.
Imagine: You don’t go to bed all night to see Bellator 206 but you don’t finally get to see the main sight.
There were 13 battles in San Jose, six of them on the main card and broadcast live in the UK all night during Channel 5-6.
At 6:00 p.m., with Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald preparing to fight, UK audiences were stunned by the film “Pepa Piglet” that interrupted the broadcast.
Some viewers, to put it mildly, were not impressed, because it was because of this struggle that they did not go to bed until the morning.
On Twitter, one of the fans called the replacement of the broadcast with a children's cartoon \"some sort of ill-fated joke\"
\"In accordance with the rules established by the government, at 6 o'clock in the morning, such content was not suitable, so it was necessary to turn on the program for children,\" said Dave Schwartz, chief marketing and communication vice president of Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
“Yes,” Pep said.
Bellator President Scott Cocker said that efforts would be made in the future to adjust the timetables according to audiences in the UK.
“When I think of repetition, it seems to me that we can probably do it,” Coker said.
\"But at that time it's 6 o'clock in the morning, Sunday, and we wouldn't be able to solve it by Sunday at our time, Monday at their time.
However, we are already working on this.
Believe me, after the change of broadcast, many messages have been exchanged, which were not all friendly.
We tried to correct the situation, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But it is not a question of power.
I can promise that this will not happen next time.
We will reduce the number of battles to five instead of six – as we usually do. We wanted to give fans more, but just failed.
This is a failed situation –
“Desert Island Discs: Thomas Daley felt ill because of his sexual orientation
Tom Daley, an Olympic jumper in the water, says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexual orientation, but this gave him the motivation to succeed.
24 The athlete said only at the primary school realized that it was not the same as everyone.
For the first time on Radio 4's Desert Island Discs by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights in public because he wanted to give hope to others.
He also said that when he became a father it was not so important to win the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the permanent host of this long-time show, has left her job for several months due to illness.
On Laverne’s first show, where guests were asked to imagine travelling to an uninhabited island, Daley said she felt inferior to everyone else because she was socially unacceptable to both boys and girls.
He said: “To this day, this feeling of weakness and cunning has been an incentive that has given me the strength to succeed.”
He said he wanted to prove that this was worth it so as not to disappoint the surrounding ones when they finally learned about his sexual orientation.
The winner of the two Olympic bronze medals became a high-level LGBT activist and took the opportunity to encourage more countries to decriminalize homosexuality by participating in this year’s British Commonwealth Games.
He said he started talking about it publicly because he thought he was lucky that he could live without any consequences, so he wanted to give that hope to others.
The three-time World Champion said he fell in love with a man, the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married a 20-year-old Oscar laureate last year, but said the age difference had never been a problem.
Delay said that when he survived so much when he was so young he was only 14 in his first Olympics, and three years later his father died of cancer, it was hard to meet someone of the same age, but experienced the same heights and lowliness.
When the couple became the parents of his son Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, Daley’s outlook had completely changed.
\"If you had asked me last year, I would have said it was the most important thing for me to win the gold medal,\" he said.
But, you know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
Robbie is my Olympic Gold Medal
His name is the same as that of his grandfather Robert, who died at the age of 40 in 2011 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Anto T. Daley, his father did not want to accept death, so one of his last questions was whether he had already bought tickets for the 2012 London Olympics that he was going to watch while sitting in the first row.
“I couldn’t tell him that he wouldn’t live for so long as he could sit in the first row,” Daley said.
“I held my hand behind when he stopped breathing, and only then did I finally admit that he was not inviolable,” Daley said.
A year later, he competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I just knew that I had dreamed of this all my life – to jump into the water watching local spectators at the Olympics – there was no better feeling,” he said.
It was also inspired by the choice of the first song for the show, Heather Small's \"Proud\", which responded to his feelings during the preparation of the Olympics and still pleasantly groaning his skin.
Desert Island Discs – per BBC Radio 4 – broadcast Sundays at 11.15 p.m. in British summer time.
Mickelson, who lost his form, spent Saturday Ryder on the bench
The American Phil Mickelson will have a record Sunday because he will be taking part in the Ryder Cup for the 47th time, but he will need to improve shape significantly to avoid becoming a failed anniversary.
Mickelson, who has been playing for the 12th time every two years, was put on a bench by Captain Jim Furyk in Saturday's four-day race.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as has often been the case in the United States, the five-time main winner spent part of the day in the support team, and the rest improved his technique in the field to correct the disruptive mistakes.
Even without being hit very directly at the height of his career, the 48th athlete is not an ideal player in the squares of Le Gold National, whose long stretch of rough grass is extremely unfavorable for inaccurate blows.
In addition, as if the square itself wasn’t frightening enough, in the ninth match on Sunday, Mickelson will be playing against British Open Tournament champion Francesco Molinari, who won all four matches this week along with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood.
If four-pointed Americans succeed in starting the 12-unit match, Mickelson’s match can become absolutely decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, but probably could not speak differently.
\"He perfectly understood the role he had in his life today, touched me through my back and hugging his hand saying he was ready to play tomorrow,\" Furyk said.
He has no lack of self-confidence.
He is on the list of the most glorious athletes, and he has given a lot to these teams both in the past and this week.
I didn’t think he was going to play two matches.
I imagined more, but that's what we did, so we decided we'd do it.
He wants to play, like everyone else.
On Sunday, Mickelson will improve Nick Fald's record and become the most Ryder- Cup match-star athlete.
It may mark the end of his Ryder Cup career, not equal to the heights of his personal records.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven equals, but Furyk says his presence has also brought intangible benefits to the team.
\"He's funny, sarcastic, witty, likes to laugh at people and is a great guy with whom it's fun to be in the team room,\" he said.
I think it was fun for younger players to compete with him this week too, it was good to watch it.
It brings a lot more than a game.
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a large majority can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that there is a strong emphasis on the final Ryder Cup matches that can easily turn into a tough fight.
The Danish athlete made his debut in 1997 in Valderama, where a team led by Captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead against the Americans, but crossed the finish line just as soon as the result was 141⁄2:131⁄2.
“We constantly remind ourselves that in Valderama we had a big lead; we had a big lead in Brooklyn where we lost, and also in Valderama where we won, but only barely,” said Bjorn, who watched the 2018 show’s victory at 5:3 on Friday and at 10:6 on Le Golf National Square.
So the story will show me and all the team members that it’s not over yet.
Tomorrow will need all the strength.
Go and do everything right.
As long as there are no points on the board, the game is over.
We have a goal – to try and win this prize – so we have to strive for it consistently.
I have always said I rely on the 12 players who are on our side, but we know very well what is on the other side – the best players in the world.
Satisfied with the performance of his players in the complex square, Bjorn added: “I would never want to get behind my eyes.
Tomorrow will be a very different matter for the hair.
Tomorrow, the most important thing is an individual game – it’s something else.
It’s great to play with your partner when everything’s going well, but when you’re alone in the field, the limits of your ability to play golf are being tested.
This idea needs to be put in place by players – tomorrow you will have to squeeze everything out of yourself.
Now I will have to stand out with my partner, and he will also have to push everything out of himself.
Unlike Bjorn, the opponent, Jim Furyk, hopes that his players will appear individually rather than as partners except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself experienced both sides of the surprises of the last day, because Brooklyn was on the winning team until Europe did not perform the miracle of Medina and turned them into losers.
“I remember every cursed word,” he said, asking how Captain Ben Crenshaw motivated his players to prepare for the last day in 1999.
Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but look for a quick start – the one you saw in Brooklyn and Medina.
When acceleration occurs in one direction, the middle match becomes very tense.
Accordingly, we have formed our team and we have released players in a way that we know... we are trying to create some kind of magic tomorrow...
Thomas will have the task of trying to fight a counter-off and fighting with Rory McIlroy in a top-level match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter leading Europeans.
“I chose these guys in this order because I think they’re going to win the whole game successfully,” Bjorn said of his choice for the team.
Delivery of a new German military ship delayed again
The latest German Navy frigate was due to start working in 2014 and replace the Cold War-era military ships, but local press reports say it will not be seen until at least next year due to increasing systems and high prices.
According to a spokesman for the military, quoted by Die Zeit, Rheinland-Pfalz, the main ship of the new Baden-Württemberg frigate class, is now delayed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was due to join the navy in 2014, but the fate of this ambitious project was eclipsed by the problems that had already been brought to bear.
Four Baden-Württemberg-class ships, commissioned by the Navy in 2007, will replace the ageing Bremen-class frigates.
It is believed that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a series of anti-plane and anti-ship missiles, and certain technologies of secrecy, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic footprints.
Another important feature is the longer maintenance intervals, which allow the newest frigates to sail far from home ports for up to two years.
However, according to Die Zeit, due to the endless delays of the most advanced technology, military ships, which are supposed to allow Germany to direct military power to overseas territories, will become obsolete until they are put into use.
The failed F125 frigate came under the headlines last year when the German navy formally refused to accept the ship and returned it to the Hamburg-based Blohm & Voss yard.
This is the first time the navy has returned the ship it has already delivered to the builder.
There is little known about the reasons for the return, but the German press mentions a number of major software and hardware defects that would have led the ship to believe in a military mission.
Software failures are particularly important as the Baden-Württemberg class ships will be operated by about 120 seafarers, which are half as small as the older Bremen class frigates.
In addition, the vessel has proved to be very heavy, which reduces its effectiveness and limits the ability of the navy to introduce various improvements in the future.
It is estimated that 7,000 tonnes of Rheinland-Pfalz are twice as heavy as the ships of a similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
The cost of the project as a whole – in addition to the perishable technical equipment, including crew training – is also gradually becoming a problem.
It has risen from an initial amount of €2.2 billion to a stunning $3.1 billion ($3.6 billion).
The latest frigate problems have become particularly significant following recent warnings that the power of the German navy is falling.
This year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament, admitted that the navy was “in fact missing suitable ships for use.”
The official said the problems had come together over time because old ships had already been written off, but there was no way to replace them.
He regretted that none of Baden-Württemberg's frigates could join the navy.
National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of Bats
A new study conducted in a Scottish Highlands Manor aims to reveal how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
The findings are expected to provide new knowledge of the behaviour of unique flying mammals and provide some guidance for future nature conservation activities.
“National Trust for Scotland,” he said, “scientists will observe in their research battered dwarfs, soprano batters, brown ears, and the water-blowing wind in the gardens of Wester Ross Inverev.
In certain areas of the territory special recorders will be arranged, allowing to track the activity of bats throughout the season.
The staff and volunteers of the National Health Service will also conduct mobile research with handheld detectors.
The analysis of all audio recordings by experts will determine the frequency of signals emitted by bats and one or another type of activity.
A map and report of residential areas will then be created to help shape a detailed picture of behavior across the entire landscape.
Rob Dewar, National Trust for Scotland (NTS) environmental adviser, hopes the results will reveal which residential areas are the most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help to identify the benefits of maintenance of residential areas, such as grassland creation, as well as how best to look after forested areas to be suitable for bats and other related species.
Over the past century, bat populations in Scotland and the United Kingdom have fallen.
They are threatened by construction and real estate development works that affect perils and destroy residential areas.
Wind power plants and lightning are also threatened, as are musgames, some chemicals used for the treatment of building materials, as well as hunting domestic cats.
Bats are actually not blind.
However, to catch the prey during night hunting, ears are more helpful than eyes.
The location of the insects or obstacles on the flight path shall be determined precisely by an intricate echolocation.
The NTS, which is responsible for over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, is particularly responsible for bats.
Here are ten trained experts who regularly conduct research, hatchery checks and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization even created the first and only bat reserve for Scotland in Damfries and the Threave Manor in Gaul, which is home to eight of the ten species of bats in Scotland.
David Thompson, the manager of the manor, says that the estate is ideal for them.
“We have a great place for bats in Three Manor,” he said.
We have old buildings, many mature trees and great areas to live in.
However, we still do not know much about bats, so work here and elsewhere will help to better understand what they need in order to thrive
He stresses the importance of checking the absence of bats before the start of the territory maintenance work, since the accidental destruction of one perineum can lead to the death of up to 400 females and pups, which can lead to the destruction of the entire local population.
Bats are protected and prohibited from killing, annoying or disrupting them, as well as from destroying their hatchery.
Scottish bat protection fund official Elisabeth Ferrell called on the public to contribute to the rescue of bats.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats and how many local species are doing, we don’t even know.”
Ronaldo rejects rape allegations – lawyers plan to go to court in German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the accusations against him a rape “false” and said that people, using his name, “seems to be famous.”
His lawyers are ready to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, who published charges.
Portugal and Juventus are accused of raped American Kathryn Mayor in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel said on Friday he paid $375,000 to keep the incident silent.
Speaking of 142 million followers on live Instagram hours after reports of charges, Ronaldo, 33, criticized reports and called them \"fake.\"
“No, no, no, no.
What they say today, lies, said five times, \"Ballon d'Or, the winner looking at the camera.\"
By using my name they want to be famous.
It's normal.
They want to be loud, to say my name is a part of my work.
“I’m a happy person, it’s all right,” he added with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for charges they have called “an unacceptable disclosure of allegations of private space”
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the athlete would seek compensation for \"moral damage, the amount of which would correspond to the significance of this violation - perhaps one of the most serious violations of a person's rights over the past few years.\"
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 at Palms Casino and Hotel Apartment in Las Vegas.
According to documents filed with the Nevada Clark County Court, after the meeting at the nightclub Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the athlete’s room, where he allegedly raped her by anal means.
Mayorga said that after the alleged incident, Ronaldo fell on his knees and told her that there was a “99 percent good person” who was betrayed by the rest of the “one percent” of his personality.
Ronaldo admitted to having had sex but claimed to have been contractual.
Mayorga also said she had applied to the police and her hospital injuries had been photographed, but she later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she “was afraid of retaliatory actions” and worried that she would be “publicly humiliated.”
A 34-year-old woman says she is now seeking to cancel the deal because she continues to feel traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the Tariam attack, Ronaldo was bepereined from Manchester-United to Madrid-Real Club, and this summer, after signing a contract worth EUR 100 million, joined the Italian giant Juventus.
“Brexit: The United Kingdom is forever sorry for the loss of car manufacturers
According to Business Secretary Greg Clark, the United Kingdom would “forever regret the loss of global automotive leadership after Brexit.”
He added that he was concerned about the statement by the Toyota unit in the UK to the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, production at the Burnaston plant near Derby would be suspended.
\"We need a deal,\" Clark said.
A Japanese carmaker said the death at the border would mean a loss of jobs without a deal.
The Burnaston factory, which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other European Union countries.
“In my opinion, if Britain suddenly leaves the European Union at the end of March, we will have to stop production in our factory,” said Toyota CEO Burnastone Marvin Cooke.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda-BMW-Jaguar and Land Rover, also voiced concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement and its consequences for international trade.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini plant after Brexit for a month.
Car manufacturers say the biggest concern is the threat posed by a no-deal supply chain.
Toyota’s production line works when needed, as custom-made car parts come from both UK and EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there may be disruptions at the border, according to the industry, which may result in delays in the delivery of details or lack of them.
Toyota said the Derbyshire plant could not hold more than one day of necessary supplies and production would stop.
According to Clark, the plan for the future relationship with the EU for Theresa May-Chequers \"is designed precisely to avoid such border checks.\"
“We need a deal. We want to have the best deal that I say would allow us not only to enjoy success today, but also to take advantage of this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today program.
“Not only Toyota but also other car manufacturers’ data show that continued access to a very successful supply chain system is essential.”
“Toyota could not say for what time production would be stopped, but warned that from a long-term perspective, additional costs would reduce the factory’s competitiveness and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallar, who has been at Burnaston plant for 24 years and is responsible for Unite trade union meetings, said that his trade union members are increasingly worried: “I say from experience that if these jobs are lost, they will never return again.”
The government spokesman said: “We have proposed a plan for future relations with the EU that is ambitious and credible.
According to the White House, a Trump meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again
“As he continues to fight for a candidate for Supreme Court judges, Donald Trump’s very important meeting with Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein may be postponed for another week,” the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special advisor Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia’s interference in the election, Trump’s relationship with Russia and the possible interference of the president with justice.
The question of whether Trump would forgive the deputy prosecutor general, thus threatening Mueller's independence, has sparked rumors in Washington for months.
This month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed carrying a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied this report.
However, with reports of his resignation, he went to the White House last Monday.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting with Trump, which was then held at the United Nations in New York, would take place on Thursday.
Trump said he did not want to forgive Rosenstein. Later, the meeting was postponed in order not to coincide with the meeting of the Senate Courts Committee, which witnessed both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to investigate Kavanaugh's allegations within a week, thus delaying the vote again at the plenary session of the Senate.
Trump spokeswoman Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox on Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “His date has not been set. It may happen this week, but given all the events related to the Supreme Court, it may be postponed for another week.
But we'll see. I always like to post news.
Some journalists would disagree with this statement: since September 10 Sanders has not held a White House press conference.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that press conferences are rarely held because they don’t like TV journalists who are looking for effects. True, he added: “I have to agree with the fact that they are seeking effects for viewers.”
He said that Trump was more likely to communicate with the press directly.
“The president answered the questions more often than any previous president,” she said, without giving any evidence, adding: “We have reviewed these statistics.”
According to Sanders, press conferences will be held, but “If the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it’s much better than talking to me.
We have often tried to do so, and you have seen that this has happened many times over the past few weeks.
Trump constantly answers questions by leaving the White House, attending public meetings or press conferences with honorable guests.
One person’s press conferences are rare.
A free and sometimes strange appearance of the president against journalists this week in New York probably explained why.
Health Minister of the Scottish NST wrote to EU staff on Brexit concerns
Health Minister to Scottish NST wrote a letter to EU staff expressing the country’s gratitude and willingness to stay after Brexit
Scottish MP Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to cover the costs of applications for permanent resident status for EU citizens working in the public services sector entrusted to it.
Freeman wrote in a letter: “Summer UK-EU exit negotiations continued and are approaching the expected solutions this autumn.
But the UK government has also begun to prepare for a possible scenario without a deal.
I know you are very worried now.
That is why I wanted to repeat how I appreciate the contribution of all the employees – no matter what their nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and elsewhere bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the healthcare system and benefit our serviced patients and communities.
Scotland is really your home and we really want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie emergency operation in head injury
On Saturday, at the 31:27 Vanderbilt Commodores, the team lost a head injury fighter named Tennessee State Tigers, an emergency operation carried out by Christion Abercrombie, Tennessee journalist Mike Organ reported.
“Tennessee State, chief coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury had taken place just before the break.
“He came to the side line and just fell down there,” Reed said.
Trainers and doctors at the side line Abercrombie gave oxygen to breathe, then laid on the stretchers and sent for further research.
“Tennessee State, official Chris Harris of Nashville, WSMV, said Abercrombie’s operation at the Vanderbilt Medical Center was over.
Harris added that “there is no information yet about the type and extent of the injury, and Tennessee State is trying to determine when it happened.
Abercrombie, an official sportsman, has moved from Illinois to Tennessee State for the first season.
Before leaving the game, he took five balls back on Saturday, and the total number of balls he took back reached 18 during the season.
Foreign buyers buying real estate in the UK will have to pay higher stamp duty
According to newtorial plans, foreign buyers buying real estate in the UK will have to pay a higher stamp duty, and the additional money received will be used to help the homeless
This step will reduce the risk posed by the successful Corbyn campaign to attract young voters
UK Taxpayers will be taxed with increased stamp duty
The Ministry of Finance hopes that it will be able to raise up to £120 million a year and will help the homeless.
Theresa May announces that foreign buyers buying real estate in the UK are expected to be charged a higher rate of stamp duty and use extra money to help homeless people
In order to ensure more affordable housing and targeting people with high incomes, it is expected that this step will reduce the risk posed by the successful Jeremy Corbyn campaign to attract young voters.
The increased stamp duty will be levied on UK taxpayers and businesses and the additional money received will be allocated to promote the Government’s campaign against homelessness.
An additional charge, which is paid alongside the current stamp duty, including higher rates introduced two years ago for purchasing second-hand homes or homes for rent, can be up to three per cent.
The finance ministry hopes this step will allow you to raise up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of the newly built real estate in London is purchased by non-UK residents, which makes prices rise and makes it harder for buyers buying their first home to do so.
Many foreign buyers spend most of their time outside the country, so many wealthy districts of the country and especially the capital have become ghost cities.
The new strategy came just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a tax cut to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of supporting high real estate prices by buying up the land quickly but not using it, and urged May to address the shame of Britain’s housing supply by giving up affordable house allowances.
Corbyn has announced several eye-catching proposed housing reforms, including the control of rental prices and the ban on landing in the absence of fault.
In addition, he wants more power to build new houses to give municipal councils.
May said: “Last year I said that as a prime minister, I would try to return the British dream – for every new generation, life must be better.
This means that we need to fix our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives.
However, it is not fair that people who do not live in the UK and businesses established abroad can buy homes as easily as hard-working British citizens can.
For many people, the dream of housing has become almost impossible, and the threat of homelessness humiliation is still too real.
Jack Ross: “My ultimate goal is to lead the Scottish team.”
“Sunderland CEO Jack Ross says his ultimate goal is to ever become a Scottish team leader.
The 42-year-old Scots enjoy the challenge of revitalizing the North-East club, which is currently in third place in the first league and three points behind the first-place club.
Last season St Mirren took him back to the Scottish Championship, this summer he moved to Stadium of Light.
As a player, I wanted to play for my country.
I came to Team B and it all ended, Ross told the BBC’s Scotland’s Sportsound.
“But when I was a kid, I grew up in Hamden Stadium with my dad watching a lot of Scottish matches, and that always attracted me back.
This will only happen if I manage the club successfully.
Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Royus Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio were led by Ross-Sunderland.
Formerly rejecting the Barnsley and Ipswich Town proposals, the former Alloa Athletic CEO said he was not worried about starting to work after such well-known leaders at such a big club.
“My success will now be judged by the answer to the question “Can I return this club to Premier League?”
According to the structure and conditions, the club undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League, which he said.
“It’s not an easy task to take it there, but I’ll probably just bring the club back to the league, and I think I’ve worked here successfully.”
Ross's leadership career lasts only three years. Before that, he worked as head assistant at Dumbarton Club and replaced the Hearts coaches for 15 months.
He later helped to recover to the third division, the Alloa – and St Mirren – club, which was threatened to fall, turned the next season into the championship winners.
Ross says he’s now more satisfied than ever felt during his career as a player at Clyde’s Hartlepool’s Falkirk’s St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“This change was probably radical,” he recalls about leadership.
“I sincerely believed that it was better to lead than to play.
It sounds strange, because I was lucky, I made a lot of money and I was happy with the satisfactory results.
But playing can be difficult.
You have to deal with a lot of problems every week.
And now it’s not easy – work stress and tension, but I feel leadership is exactly what I need.
I have always wanted to lead, and now I am doing it. I have always felt like I am in my sleds, but leadership gives me the greatest satisfaction.

Studies have found that the best time for pints of beer was at 5.30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer heat wave has increased the income of the poor British beermakers, but has made it even more difficult for the restaurant networks to bear the burden.
The figures showed that sales of beer and bar groups increased by 2.7 percent in July, but in restaurants, revenue fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the CGA, a business consulting firm that prepared the data, said: “The never-ending sunshine and longer than expected, the participation of England in the world championship meant that in July similar trends continued as in June, when beer income increased 2.8 percent. True, restaurants suffered even more than before.
In June, sales in restaurants fell by 1.8 percent, and in July, the situation became even worse.
The main revenues from beer and bars were undoubtedly the best, and the trade in beer grew stronger than in restaurants.
Although not as strongly as restaurant businesses, the sunshine also hit the main income from food trade beer.
It seems that people just wanted to go out to drink.
In well-groomed beer and bars, sales of drinks increased by 6.6 percent this month, and sales of food fell by 3 percent.
Paul Newman of the leisure and fertility industry analysis firm RSM said: “These results continue the trend seen since the end of April.
In the case of catering establishments, the main factors continue to be the weather and the impact of major social and sporting events.
So it's no wonder that restaurant groups continue to be in trouble. True, a drop in sales of 4.8 percent over many years will be particularly painful, as it will contribute to the continued cost-related pressure.
Most of the revenues from food trading for businesses could not come at a worse time during the long hot summer. Time will show whether the milder temperatures in August will give the necessary rest.
The overall increase in sales in beer and restaurants, including newly opened locations, was 2.7 per cent in July and reflected the slowdown in the development of the networks belonging to brands.
For the UK beer, bars and restaurants sector, and recognised by its guidelines, the Coffer Peach Tracker sector’s sales monitoring tool collects and analyses operational data from 47 operating groups with a total turnover of over £9 billion.
One in five children have social media accounts hidden from their parents
The study found that one in five children – some just 11 years old – has social media accounts hidden from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students found that fake Insta pages are growing
The news heightened fear that sexual content would be published
Twenty percent of students say they have to show their parent a basic account
One in five children – some just 11 years old – create secret social media accounts and hide them from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students found that the number of fake Insta pages is growing rapidly – a link to the Instagram photo sharing website
The news heightened fear that sexual content would be published
Twenty percent of students said they use a censored basic account to show their parents, but they also have secret accounts.
One mother, who accidentally found a secret site for her 13-year-old daughter, found out that the teen's insistence was: \"Reject me.\"
A study by Digital Awareness UK and the Independent School Directors' Conference (MDK) found that 40% of 11-18 year olds have two accounts, and half of those students found that they were hiding accounts.
MDK CEO Mike Buchanan said: “The fact that so many teenagers give up the temptation to create virtual spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them is worrying.”
Eilidha Doyle will be the voice of athletes at the Scottish Sports Council
Eilidha Doyle was elected as a consultant at the overall annual meeting of the governing body of the Scottish Sports Council.
Doyle is Scotland's most award-winning athlete and chairwoman. Ian Beattie described this move as an excellent occasion that allows sport-leader people to benefit from the many experiences she has gained at international level over the past decade.
“Eilidha has earned great respect throughout the Scottish, UK and world sports community and we have no doubt that its inclusion in the Scottish Council will bring great benefits to Scottish sport,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I want to serve as a voice of athletes and I hope that I will really contribute and help lead sport in Scotland.”
A 200- and 400-meter match at the 1996 Atlanta Games and a total of four Olympic gold medals, now appearing as a permanent BBC expert, were unable to walk after a short-term attack of ischemia.
He tweeted: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said that only time will tell if and to what extent I will recover.
It was necessary to work until exhaustion, but I completely recovered, I learned to walk again and do agility exercises today!
Thank you for your message of encouragement.
Breast-feeding advertising that compares mothers to cows has received different ratings online
The company producing breast milk pumps received different opinions about its advertising, in which nursing mothers are compared with dairy cows.
In order to mark the start of trade in a product described as the world’s first silent portable breast lift, Elvie, a technology company dedicated to consumers, released an inspired advertisement for an ironic music video. It aims to demonstrate the freedom that the new breast-feeding mother brings.
In the carnival full of hay, four true mothers danced according to an audio recording, for example, the following words: “Yes, I pray for myself, but there is no tail to see – and “If you don’t notice, here is not a udder, here is my breasts.”
The Appendix continues: “Get him out, pull him out, feed his babies, pull him out, pray my beautiful ones.”
However, advertising posted on Facebook caused an online dispute.
The 77,000-time video, which received hundreds of comments, has been answered in different ways by viewers. Many have said that it looks at the horrors of the dairy industry through their fingers.
“The use of cows to promote this product is a very poor solution.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, only their newborns are taken away from them after a few days,” wrote one woman.
“Elvie” breast milking is inconspicuously placed in a feeding bra (“Elvie” / “Mother”
Another commented: “It is understandable that it is traumatizing both the mother and the newborn.
But why not use them for advertising that delivers breast milk to mothers, from which babies are not taken away
Another added: “Advertisement is a complete misunderstanding.”
Another commentator defended the advertisement – one woman admitted that she had “very fun”
“I think the idea is genius.
I would buy it if I was still feeding it.
When I cut my milk, I felt like a cow.
Advertising is a bit crazy, but I accepted it as what it is.
This product is a genius,” wrote one.
Another commented: “This fun advertisement is for mothers who pull their milk off (often in workplaces or toilets) and feel like cows.
Its purpose is not to drink or condemn the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, a group of women revealed that all danced with imperceptible milkthugs installed in the bras.
The idea behind the campaign is based on an insight that many breast-breaking women claim to feel like cows.
However, Elvie’s milkcup does not emit any sound, has no wires or tubes, and has an inconspicuous capacity in the feeding bra, allowing women to move freely, keep babies, or even leave their homes when they remove milk.
Anna Balarin, a partner and executive director of creativity, commented: “Elvie’s dairy is a revolutionary product that deserves to start selling it boldly and provocatively.
When we compared nursing women with dairy cows, we wanted to pay attention to the milk-breaking process and to all the challenges it poses, while show us with fun and as much as possible the incredible sense of freedom that the new milk-batch will bring.
“Elvie is not the first time that a barbecue has been placed on the headlines of the press.
During London’s fashion week, designer Marta Jakubowski’s collection, the mother of two children demonstrated on the podium using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp near the Texas border
The number of people crossing the border has remained largely unchanged during the month, but the number of children of detained migrants has increased significantly, partly because the strict rhetoric and policies of the Trump administration have made it harder for them to live with their guardians.
Traditionally, most caregivers themselves were immigrants without documents and were afraid that applying for child care risked staying in the country.
As the federal government announced in June that potential guardians and other adult members of their families would have to provide fingerprints and share these data with immigration authorities, the risk further increased.
Last week, Chief Immigration and Customs Officer Matthew Albence told Congress that dozens of people had been detained by the institution for the custody of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not been tried before.
\"Almost 80 percent of these people live illegally in the country, whether their guardians or their family members, and most of them are foreign criminals.
That is why we will continue to pursue these individuals,” Albence said.
According to shelter workers, in order to consider cases of children more quickly, officials introduced new rules, according to which some children must appear in court within a month of arrest, and not within 60 days, as was customary before.
Many of the applicants for legal status against the immigration judge will try to defend themselves by using a conference video call instead of being present in person.
Recognised persons who are not eligible for assistance will be deported quickly.
According to the asylum workers and the reports received from the system in recent months, the longer children are detained, the more likely they are to become restless or depressed, which can lead to outbreaks of violence or attempts to escape.
Defenders argue that this is even more worrying in large institutions such as the Tornil shelter: because of the size, there is an increase in the likelihood of not seeing signs that the child is suffering.
They added that moving children to a tent town without giving them enough time to prepare them emotionally or say goodbye to friends can deepen many of the injuries they have already experienced.
Syria orders US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem invited Syrian refugees to return home even though the war has been going on for eight years.
Moualem, who also served as Deputy Prime Minister, said foreign forces under the pretext of counter-terrorism were illegal on Syrian soil and would be treated accordingly.
\"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions,\" he told the assembly.
Moualem claimed that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have left their homes, the war on terrorism is almost over.
He said Damascus will not cease to fight this sacred struggle until we destroy terrorist groups and any illegally staying aliens in all Syrian territories.
There are about 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria who mainly train and advise Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 land troops in the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions for their return were good, while some Western countries were accused of spreading unjustified fears that deter refugees from returning.
“We have contacted the international community and humanitarian organisations to help them return,” he said.
They politicize what should be a purely humanitarian problem.
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will receive reconstruction aid only when Assad and the opposition reach a political agreement and end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib in the last large rebel fortress created conditions for faster progress in political negotiations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on a province of three million people.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had clear deadlines and hoped that military action would be directed towards jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra-Front associated with Al-Qaeda, which would be destroyed.
The UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to convene the first meetings of a committee made up of members of the government and opposition to prepare a post-war Syrian constitution and prepare the ground for elections.
Moualem set out the conditions under which the Syrian government would participate in the committee – the group’s work should be limited to reviewing the articles of the current constitution and warned against interference.
Why will Trump be elected for a second term?
According to this logic, Trump would be elected in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers probably expect, his presidency would end with impeachment and scandal.
This would certainly be the most dramatic end to the presidency ever!
There are no signs of audience fatigue so far.
Since the best time of broadcasting in 2014, CNN's ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million and MSNBC nearly triple to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million top-time viewers, with the number growing from 1.7 million four years ago, while MSNBC’s The Rachel Maddow Show ranks first in cable television rankings with up to 3.5 million viewers in the main evenings.
“It’s a fire that attracts people because we don’t understand something,” says Neal Baer, a producer of ABC’s “Descedent” series, about the secretary of the Cabinet who becomes president after the collapse of the Congressional Palace.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedic writer and author of “Only fun parts and some unpleasant truths about how to secretly get to Hollywood Boys’ Club,” has another theory.
She remembers her trip to Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he would vote for Trump.
“Why,” she asked.
“He said, ‘He makes me laugh,’” Scovell said.
Chaos is valuable because it makes you happy.
Of course, unlike other TV shows, the scenes coming from Washington can lead to Roe v. Wade’s future, the possibility of uniting immigrants’ families and the state of the global economy.
Non-viewing is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
However, it’s more than necessary to be an informed citizen when you realize that you’ve been watching a group of experts discuss how Bob Woodward uses sensitive data for his book Fear, Paul Manafort shows a $15,000 jacket that costs $15,000 (the thickest clothed with pride,” wrote The Washington Post, and what the shocking description of Storm Daniels Trump’s anatomy means.
At least I'll never look at Super Mario again.
“His actions remind us of the reality show, because every night he throws you something out of the world about the changing characters of Trump’s show and the daily twists of the story (the delay in conflict with N.F.L. or the hangover to Kim Jong-un) says Wheelhouse Entertainment, CEO and Pawn Stars creator Brent Montgomery.
You can't miss a single series, otherwise you'll fall behind.
When I contacted Fleiss this week, outside of his home on the northern coast of Kauai, there was 27 degrees of heat and the sun was shining, but he sat inside and, recording CNN, watched MSNBC.
He could not get rid of himself – certainly not when Brett Kavanaughu had to stand before the Senate Court Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hung on the hair.
“I remember when we once created those crazy shows, people said, “This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Fleiss said.
“I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right.”

Money pouring out of the midst of the midterm election to the House of Representatives
It was no surprise that the reorganization of the congressional districts, which ended with two House members trying to win the same position, caused money to flood Pennsylvania’s 17th district.
In March, the recently re-arranged suburban district of Pittsburgh added Democratic House Member Conor Lamb, who won his seat in a special election in another district last spring.
The Lamb competes with another member of the House of Representatives, Republican Keith Rothfus, currently representing the previous District 12 of Pennsylvania, a large part of which overlaps with the new District 17.
In January, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled that, in violation of the Constitution, the old districts were falsified in favor of the Republicans.
During the election in the new district of 17, the financial institutions of the main parties – the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCK) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRKK) – are clashing over the campaign’s finance.
Lamb became famous in Pennsylvania when a small majority in the 18th Congressional District won the widely watched special elections in March.
For more than a decade, Republicans took the place, and President Donald Trump won 20 points in the county.
Politicians have given Democrats some advantage.
The United States is considering punishing El Salvador for its support for China, but then calming down
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, but had generally not received a negative response from Washington.
In June 2017, Trump took part in a warm meeting with Panaman President Juan Carlos Varela and had a hotel in Panama before his partners left the Trump Organization.
“The authorities of the state department of Taiwan have decided to withdraw heads of American diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama,” Heather Nauert, the department’s spokeswoman, said in a statement earlier this month.
But sanctions are being considered only for El Salvador, which received US aid worth around $140 million in 2017, as well as for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including a reduction in financial assistance and visa restrictions for individuals, would have been painful for the country of Central America with high unemployment and murder rates.
In the margins of internal meetings, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, following a similar meeting last year, seen as an important step forward in order to prevent migrants who are drawing to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made clear to those who wanted the conference to take place, and in principle ended any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
“In order to demonstrate the importance of the administration, Vice President Mike Pence is now on the list of speakers at a conference scheduled for mid-October,” said diplomats.
And three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, without reporting any charges or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman declined to comment on the details of the debate that three American officials, including two diplomats, had told Bolton, and agreed to discuss internal considerations only if their anonymity was preserved.
Their stories are confirmed by an analyst close to the administration, who has also spoken if his anonymity is preserved.

Further, it is inevitable that special counsel Robert Mueller’s report on the possible disruption of Trump’s justice – his very strong evidence is now available in public archives.
In addition, Mueller is asking his investigation whether the Trump campaign has not been carried out in secret in cooperation with Russia that has harmed our elections.
If Congress were to move into other hands, Trump would have to take responsibility at the same time as he is preparing to re-enact the voters, and perhaps finally the Commission of Officials.
There is a lot of -- if not -- and I do not say that the end of Trump is inevitable, just as it is in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic will have to choose, and these choices will determine whether the fight will continue for a long time.
In 1938 German officials were ready to overthrow Hitler, but it was only necessary for the West to oppose him and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We lost our way and missed the opportunity to prevent later slaughtering for several years.
The story revolves around such fundamental turning points – then an inexhaustible democratic march is accelerated or paused.
Now the Americans are at a few points of such a turning point.
What will we do if Trump forgives Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein, the man on whom Mueller's investigation is destined?
Rosenstein’s problems began when the newspaper reported that last year an official had proposed a secret recording of the president and was considering his suitability for office.
Rosenstein says “The Times” is inaccurate.
“How will we react if the new FBI investigation by Brett Kavanaugh proves to be incomplete or incorrect, or if, despite persuasive accusations of sexual abuse and false testimony, the candidate is appointed to the Supreme Court?
And finally, will we vote for Congress in the midterm elections, which will force Trump to take responsibility?
If we don’t pass these tests, then democracy is in danger of a long winter.
But because of the lesson I learned in Prague, I believe we will keep them.
My mother was a Czechoslovakia Jew, who was taken to Osvencim by the same Nazi regime, once based in a house where I lived as an ambassador.
She survived, immigrated to America, and after 60 years I was sent to ignite the Sabbath candles on a table with a swastika.

Graham Dorrans of Rangers waiting optimistically for a clash with Rapid Vienna
On Thursday, Rangers-Rapid Vienna will accept the idea that if they were able to win against Austrians, they could find themselves in a strong position to leave the G-group after a spectacular match with Villarreal earlier this month in Spain.
Due to the middle of the road injury, the player Graham Dorrans could only appear this season for the first time in a 2:2 race with Villarreal, but he hopes that the Rangers can use this result as a springboard for more important goals.
“This was a good result for us because Villarreal is a great team,” said the 31-year-old player.
“We started playing with the belief that we would achieve something, and we ended up achieving something.
At the end of the day, we might have been more fit, but overall, the competition was not bad.
They probably played better in the first half, and we got up in the second one and we turned out to be a better team.
There will be another major European League on Thursday.
I hope we can get three points. The game will be tough, because in the last race their score was excellent. But I have no doubt that with the support of the spectators we can jump forward and achieve a good result.
Last year was really hard – and what happened to my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is a good mood.
The team is good and the guys are really excited; workouts are great.
I hope that we will now be able to jump forward, forget last season and play successfully.
Because of this fear of pension savings, a woman suffers insomnia
Even though the survey participants had a clear idea of what kind of care they would like to have, few talked about it with their family.
About half of the respondents to the Nationwide survey said they had talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to the kids about it.
“People want them to be taken care of by a family member, but don’t try to talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, the vice president of the life insurance company at Nationwide.
Here's where we have to start.
Talk to your spouse and children. If you do not communicate your wishes in advance, you will not prepare your family to take care of you.
Discuss with your advisor and family where and what care you would like to receive, as these factors may be important to predict costs.
A financial advisor can also help you come up with a way to pay for these expenses.
You can choose to pay these costs through a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a mixed cash-value life insurance policy, or by insuring your assets for as long as you have the money.
Prepare legal documents. Prevent legal disputes by allowing documents to be protected.
Make sure you have a health authority. Assign a trusted person who will take care of your medical care and ensure that professionals will respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also, think about the power to take care of your finances.
You should choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and make sure your accounts are paid if you become inefficient.
Imagine that your elderly father or mother needs emergency medical care and takes him or her to a hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
To be ready, write down these details in the plan.

In Ilfrakum, a man shot several times by a pneumatic rifle
After spending the evening in the city, the man who went home was shot several times by a pneumatic gun.
He was shot in the chest, abdomen, and arm for forty years by Ilphracum in the Oxford Grauv district of Devon.
At around 02.30 a.m., the English summertime shooting was described by officials as a random act.
The victim did not see the attacker.
Injuries do not threaten his life, and the police ask for the help of witnesses.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
“At least 384 people were killed when a powerful earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday,” officials say.
As a result of the destruction of communications, emergency services officials were unable to obtain any data from the Dongala Regency, a north of the Palu-based area near the epicenter of the 7.5-point earthquake.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated from Palu in the event of a disaster.
Here are some of the most important facts about the island of Sulawesi in Palu and Dongale.
In 2017, Palu, which has about 379 800 inhabitants, is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, founded on the narrow west coast of Sulawesi Island at the end of the Gulf.
When the earthquake struck and the tsunami struck, the city celebrated its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a regent, stretched along the coast of more than 300 km (180 miles) in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
In 2017, about 299 200 inhabitants lived in Regency, a smaller administrative region than a province.
Fishing and farming are the main pillars of the central economy of the province of Sulawesi, especially of the coastal region of Dongala.
In the province, nickel mining is also important, indeed, concentrated mainly on the Moroval on the other side of the Sulawesi coast.
According to Indonesia’s disaster reduction agencies, Palu and Dongala have suffered multiple injuries in the past century.
In 1938, the tsunami in Dongala killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, a tsunami struck western Dongala and killed nine people.
Indonesia, on a seismically active Pacific fire ring, is constantly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the most important earthquakes and tsunamis that have taken place in recent years.
On December 26, 2004, a severe earthquake on the west coast of the province of Aceh in Indonesia caused a tsunami in northern Sumatra that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
At the end of March 2005 and at the beginning of April, several strong earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people were killed near Nias Island.
In 2006, a 6.8-point quake struck the southernmost populated Indonesian island of Java and caused a tsunami that hit the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
In 2009, a 7.6-point earthquake struck the area near the western capital of Sumatra, Padang.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
In 2010, a 7.5-point quake struck one of the Mentavai islands near Sumatra and caused a tsunami with waves up to 10 meters, which wiped dozens of villages and killed some 300 people.
In 2016, due to the mild earthquake in Aceh, the regentity of Pidya Jay was devastated and panicked, as people remembered how everything was shattered after the terrible 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people were killed by demolished buildings.
In 2018, strong earthquakes shocked Indonesian tourists on the heavily visited island of Lombok and killed more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists temporarily stuck on the coast.
Sarah Palin's eldest son has been detained for charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the son of the chief governor and vice-president of Alaska, Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of attack.
A report by Alaska police on Saturday said that the 29-year-old Palin of Vasilia was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, hindering the reporting of domestic violence and resistance.
According to a police report, when a acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took the phone from her.
According to KTUU, Palais was returned to the custody of Mat-Su pre-trial detention and released for a $500 deposit.
\"On Saturday, he appeared in court, where he said he was absolutely innocent when asked to justify himself,\" the network said.
Palin is charged with three A-class offences, which means it can be charged with a fine of up to $250,000 per year.
He is charged with class B offences, a criminal day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that Palin has been charged.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father Todd Palin.
His mother Sarah Palin called the police and reported a suspected attack.
The case is currently pending by the Alaskan Veterans Court.
The incident involved charges of home attacks in January 2016, hindering the reporting of the crime of domestic violence and the possession of a weapon while intoxicated.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin received criticism from veteran groups when her son’s cruel behavior was linked to a post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his service in Iraq.
Tsunami earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of people killed
At least 384 people were killed on Friday after a tsunami hit on the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia.
The 7.5-point earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not working. The number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near the central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
In social media, videos are shared that show the moment of tsunami strike.
The tsunami struck the coast after hundreds of people had gathered for a beach celebration in Palu.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death penalty for New York terrorist attack suspect
In New York, federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, suspected of a terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people, a rare sentence that has not been committed in this state since 1953.
It is suspected that on October 31, thirty-year-old Saipov rented a truck from Home Depot and carried out an attack on the bicycle path along the western highway in Lower Manhattan, which was driving along the road, was laying pedestrians and cyclists.
According to a report in southern New York County on the intention to seek the death penalty, prosecutors would have to prove that Saipov deliberately killed eight victims and deliberately caused serious bodily injuries.
According to the court document, both of these indictments may be sentenced to death.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov, a federal jury with jury swore, issued a 22-point indictment, including eight charges of murder related to extortion (usually against federal prosecutors in organised crime cases) and charges of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
Prosecutors say the attack was very well planned and premeditated, and the way Saipov executed it called it disgusting, cruel and immoral.
\"The actions of Sayfull Habibullavicius Saipov injured, affected and loved ones lost the following family members and friends: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erly, Hernan Ferruch, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damiano Pagnucco,\" the statement said.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
The last case involving the death penalty was heard in the South District of New York a decade ago.
Khalid Barnes was sentenced to death for killing two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last executed in 1953 in a federal court case against spouses Julius and Ethele Rosenberg when they were convicted two years ago of plotting to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The two Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov from Uzbekistan did not regret his conduct either immediately after the attack or a few months later.
Police said he told investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov revealed to officials that the attack was inspired by the videos of the Islamic State (ISIS) that he watched on his phone.
Police said he also asked the hospital to hang the flag of the Islamic State.
He did not acknowledge his guilt on 22 counts.
David Patton, one of Saipov's federal state-funded defenders, said they were obviously disappointed with the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, not to admit guilt and to be imprisoned to life without the possibility of being released, will only prolong the trauma of these events to all the persons involved,” Patton said.
The defense team has previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tori MP says NIGEL FARAGE AS must be responsible for Brexit negotiations
At today’s protest, Nigel Farage vowed to mobilize the nation’s army.
The former UKIP leader said politicians should feel the heat of Eurosceptics, and one of Theresa May's MPs suggested that he lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservatory House Member Peter Bone told demonstrators in Birmingham that the UK would have left now if Brexit’s secretary had been Farage.
But the difficulties that May faces in trying to unite the divided ranks of supporters have been revealed by the EU-based tors that joined the city's separate protest against Brexit.
It is difficult for the prime minister to carry out a compromise plan agreed in Chequers when it is attacked by Brexit supporters, opponents and the EU.
The allies insisted that it should try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite its hostile reaction and force Eurosceptics and Labour Party to choose its package or chaos.
Bonus told Solihale at Leave Means Leave that he wanted to destroy the Chequers plan.
He argued that Farage was to be an equal partner and should have been given the responsibility to negotiate with Brussels.
“If he had led us, we would have left the EU already,” he said.
He added: \"I will fight for Brexit, but we must reject Chequers' plan.\"
Expressing our opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in the world wars to obey others.
We want to adopt our own laws in our country.
“Bone has denied hints that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely false.”
\"Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkins also participated in demonstrations and told reporters: \"I'm just saying, Prime Minister, hear people.
The Chequers plan is unpopular among the general public and the opposition will not vote for it. It is unpopular and among our party members and activists who go to the streets and, most importantly, vote for us.
Give up the Chequers Plan and start listening
In a critical statement to May, she added: “The prime ministers keep their posts as they keep their promises.”
Farage said politicians should be forced to feel heat if they issue a 2016 referendum decision.
\"Now it's a matter of trust between us, the nation and our political class,\" he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, so we’re here today to tell them we’re not going to let us get away with doing that.”
Addressing an enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to force our political class, which almost betrayed Brexit, to feel the heat.
We mobilize the army of the nation that brought us the victory of Brexit, and we will not stop until we become independent, self-governing and proud of the United Kingdom.
O’Brexit opponents marched on Birmingham’s streets before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
When the band formed this weekend, a group of activists waved posters against Brexit.
Labour's Lord Adonis abhorred the Conservatives over the security problems they suffered as a result of the party's app when the conference began.
“These are people who say they can install IT systems and all the technologies needed for Canada plus borders without friction and free trade without borders with Ireland,” he said.
“It’s a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he added.
Warren plans to seriously consider participating in presidential elections
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would seriously consider taking part in the presidential election after the November election.
“Boston Globe” said the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a meeting with the public in the West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who is constantly criticizing President Donald Trump, is taking part in the November re-elections in which GOP state spokesman Geoff Diehl, one of the leaders of the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
It was believed that she could compete with Trump in 2020.
Since Trump became president, the Saturday afternoon event in Holjok was her 36th meeting with voters in the format of a public meeting with the public.
One of the participants asked if she was planning to take part in the presidential elections.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington and repair the broken government, and it must be led by women.
Arrested suspect in LSU Simso shooting case
Baton Rouge police in Louisiana on Saturday said they had arrested a suspect accused of shooting LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
At 11 a.m., at a press conference, the Baton Rugby Police Department said Dyteon Simpson, 20, had been detained.
Police released Friday's shooting video and asked to help identify the man they saw.
Twenty-year-old Sims was shot and died near the southern campus early Friday.
Police chief Murphy Paul told media Saturday that Wayde Sims had been shot in the head and died of injuries.
Wayde would defend his friend and Simpson would shoot him.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene of the crime, had a gun and shot at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was detained and was arrested at the East Baton Rouge District Police Department.
The 198-inch pre-late student, Sims, grew up in Baton Ruže, played 32 games last season, 10 of which started in the start-up five, spent an average of 17.4 minutes on the pitch, scored 5.6 points and rebounded 2.9 balls.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches World Champion title when team orders him to win Sebastian Vettel
When Walter Bott defeated Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it immediately became clear that the Mercedes team’s instructions in the race would be crucial.
After starting the race from the first place, Bott was well-started and, defending his position in the first two turns, barely left in Hamilton’s trouble, prompting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel first went to a two-frame garage, left Hamilton, and he returned to the race in the tail of a group, so it was fateful.
“Mercedes went to a two-way garage and returned to the track behind Vettel, but Hamilton came forward after barely reaching the end of the contact, when Ferrari’s driver, after a double maneuver to keep his position in the third turn, reluctantly freed the inner side of the track.
On his 21st birthday, Max Verstappen began from the end of the race, but he was on 7th at the end of the first round.
He was the fastest part of the race because he was driving without changing tires to be as fast as possible in the finish, overtaking Kim Raikkonen and finishing fourth.
Finally, in the 44 wheel, he entered the two-frame garage, but in the remaining eight wheels, he failed to increase the pace and Raikkonen crossed the finish line by the fourth.
“It was a tough day for the Valter, because he was doing well all weekend, and when he was asked to miss me, he acted like a real gentleman.
The team did a great job and won two first places,” Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump slammed Senator Dianne Feinstein at a meeting with people on Saturday because he persistently denies leaking Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh is accused of sexual abuse.
Speaking in West Virginia, the president did not directly name the testimony given to Ford to the Senate's legal committee, but said what was happening in the Senate showed that people were wicked, obscene, and unjust.
“What may have happened and is actually happening in recent days in the Senate when you see anger, when you see that people are evil, wicked, obscene, and unjust,” he said.
“When you see official statements and leaks, and then you say, ‘Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't do that --
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you leaked?
Do you remember her answer to the question, has the document been leaked?
I'm sure not.
I didn't leak \"
Well, wait a minute.
Whether we've leaked...no, we haven't leaked,\" he added, depicting the senator.
In July, Feinstein received a letter detailing Ford's charges against Kavanaughu, which had been leaked earlier in September, but Feinstein denied that the letter had been leaked from her office.
According to The Hill-Feinstein Committee, “I did not hide the accusations of Dr. Ford and I did not leak her story.”
“She asked me to keep it secret, and I did as she asked.”
He said at a meeting with the people on Saturday night: “You know, it was really bad body language.
It may not have leaked, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen.
As he continued to defend a candidate for Supreme Court judges accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president said the Democrats had used the accusations for their own benefit.
\"They are determined to regain power by any appropriate means.
You see the decency, the decency; they don’t care what they hurt or have to pass in order to gain power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5:3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer won two goals in a match with Dandi’s Giants club.
“Dundee Stars has made up for Friday’s defeat in the Elite League, Belfast’s Giants, and won Saturday’s response game Dandi’s score at 5:3.
“Giants were early in their turn when Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauviller scored two goals.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie were on a par with Dwyer’s return to Giants.
Francois Bouchard of Dandi’s team had a score, but later two Lukas Lundvaldas Nielsen goals secured victory.
Adam Keefe’s men suffered the third defeat this season in the Elite League, before winning and winning Dandi’s club on Friday night in Belfast 2:1.
It was the fourth team meeting this season, three previous matches won the Giants.
Dwyer scored the first goal at the fourth minute (3.35) after Kendall McFaullo's handover, and four minutes later Beauviller doubled the lead after David Rutherford's handover.
In a difficult-to-be match, Sullivan returned the arena's hosts to the game with a goal of 13:10, and after the handover of Matt Marquardt, Cownie’s score was equalized at 15:16.
Dwyer took care that Giants would go out on the first break on the first day, and at the end of the first half he scored his second night goal.
With a quantitative lead, the square hosts regrouped and Bouchard rebalanced the score at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen in the first match at the end of the second half of the game, and established victory by winning the fifth goal of the team in the middle of the last half.
“Giants – who have already lost four of the last five matches, will meet Milton Keynes at home next Friday.
Flight manager killed to help hundreds of plane passengers escape from the earthquake
Indonesia's air traffic leader has been declared a hero when he died while helping a plane with several hundred passengers to safely take off.
More than 800 people were killed and many were considered missing after a severe earthquake that caused the tsunami on the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The area was further shaken by strong repeated underground strikes and many people trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
While his colleagues fled to save his life, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position at the heavily-changing management tower in the city of Palu at Mutiara Sis Al-Jufri Airport.
He remained in his workplace to assist the 6321-flight Batik Air plane, which was already on the runway at the time, to take off safely.
Then when he thought the flight control tower was falling, he jumped out of it.
He later died in the hospital.
According to Australian ABC News, Indonesia’s air navigation spokesman Yohannes Sirait said his decision could save hundreds of lives.
We flew him by helicopter from Kalimantan to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, this morning we lost it before the helicopter reached Pal.
“This is a very painful message for us,” he added.
The government fears that the number of deaths could rise to thousands as the country’s disaster relief agency reports that cities in the sky, Sigio and Boutong are hard to reach.
“The number of victims is expected to increase as many victims are still under the ruins and cannot be reached,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Up to six meters high, the city of Palu was destroyed and a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and supplies supplies.
Risa Kusuma-Sky News, a 35-year-old mother, said: “Earth cars bring victims every minute.
There is a lack of clean water.
Self-service shops are being robbed everywhere.
Janis Gelfandas CNN, head of Indonesia's International Red Cross, said: \"The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help survivors, but we do not know what we will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but the situation may get worse.
Indonesian President Jok Widod arrived in Palu on Sunday and said: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready to report to CNN?
Earlier this year, more than 550 people were killed in earthquakes in Lombok.
An aircraft crash in Micronesia: “Air Niugini says now that one person is missing when a plane crashes into the lagoon
The airline that conducted the flight, which ended in a plane crash in the Pacific lagoon owned by Micronesia, now says one person is missing, although it has previously said that all 47 passengers and crew members have been rescued from the sinking plane.
In a statement, Air Niugin said they had no knowledge of a passenger’s husband on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find a man.
The airlines did not respond immediately to requests for more information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew when the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuk Island Airport.
Officials said Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday, all in a stable condition.
It remains unclear why the accident occurred and what was the exact sequence of events.
The airline and US Navy reported that the plane landed in a lagoon without reaching the runway.
Some witnesses believe the plane didn’t land on the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane fell from very low.
“It was very good,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others managed to get to the emergency exits on a plane that was sinking and flooded to the waist.
He said flight attendants were panicked and screamed, and he himself suffered a mild head injury.
The U.S. Navy said their sailors were also helping to rescue people on board an inflatable boat before the plane crashed to a depth of about 30 metres.
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people were killed in plane crashes registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but none of them belonged to Air Niugini.
An analyst set out the sequence of events during the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor’s office described the facts in Saturday’s retrial of a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett witnessed for several hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used cell phone records to connect the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of death.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chamber on the evening of her death, contrary to previous statements.
When data showed his cell phone was with Chambers while he said he was with a friend Michael Sanford, police went to question Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford said he had not been in his city on that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellle was telling the truth, saying he was in a Sanford truck that night, Sanford said he was “lied because his truck was in Nashville.”
Another coincidence was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks after she died.
Cell phone records show that they knew each other for a week.
Rowlet said that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
“He has taken her out of his life,” Hale said.
It is expected that the defense will begin to teach its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he believed the case would be referred to the jury later on the same day.
The High Breed: Who is the conscious hip hop?
Hiphop's trio wants to change the negative attitude towards this genre, spreading positive messages with his music.
“The High Breed of Bristol claims that the hip hop has distanced itself from the roots of political messages and draws attention to social problems.
They want to return to the origins of the hip hop and again popularize the conscious hip hop.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently reborn in UK works like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black girl?
New York babysitter sued a couple after being fired for 'racist' messages
A New York babysitter sued a couple for dismissal on grounds of discrimination after receiving a false address message from a mother complaining that she was “another black woman.”
The couple denies being racists and calls the action “violence”
The mother of two, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, is saddened to learn that Giselle Maurice is black when she arrived on her first working day in 2016.
“NEEEEE, ONE BLACK,” Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to his husband.
She was not sent to her husband twice, but to Maurice.
According to the New York Post, who understood that Plasco-Flaxman had done an inexpensive job and fired Mr Maurice, claiming that the former nanny, who was an African-American, had done a bad job and hoped to receive a Filipino instead.
Maurice was paid for one working day and was sent home by Uber.
Maurice is now suing a couple for forgiveness and seeking to pay as much as $350 a day for half a year’s life and work at a client’s home, for which she was initially hired without a contract.
\"I want to show them that such things cannot be done,\" she said on Friday, adding: \"I know this is discrimination.\"
The couple turned back to the accused of racism by denying it and claimed that it was reasonable to dismiss Maurice from work because they feared that they would not be able to trust her after offending her.
“My wife sent her what she didn’t want to say.
She is not a racist.
We're not racists,\" Male Joel Plasc said, \"Post.\"
“Would you trust your children to someone who was disrespectful, even though it was a mistake?”
My newborn baby?
I don't think \"
Plasz said that his wife had had a baby just two months ago and was “in a very difficult situation.”
Are you going to judge for this?
This is not a very nice behavior,” added an investment banking specialist.
While the trial was pending, the media hastened to condemn a couple on social media, criticizing their behavior and logic.
New letter reveals Paddington publishers fear that readers will not understand the talking bear
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, said of the letter: “It’s hard to feel in another place reading the book for the first time before it was released.
Now it’s very interesting to know what we know about Paddington’s tremendous success.
Saying that her father, who worked as a BBC operator before finding inspiration for writing a book for children about a plush bear, would not have been too upset if his job had been rejected, added that the 60th anniversary of the book’s release after his father’s death had been pleasant and sad at the same time.
Speaking about Paddington, who she described as “a very important member of the family,” she added that her father was quietly proud of his success.
“He was a pretty calm man and he didn’t like to be drunk,” she said.
“Because Paddington was so similar to him, he felt like having a child who achieved something: proud of him, although it’s not really your job.
I think he appreciated Paddington’s success story.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always gave merit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dead and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
Her daughter was taken to a hospital in Nice Louis Pasteuro 2, where doctors were unable to save her life.
“Nad has always called and said that the condition is really bad and is not expected to survive,” Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I received a call from Nado, who called to say that she had two minutes to live and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I said goodbye.
I told her, \"Tashi, dear, I love you very much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
Doctors give medications that supported her heartbeat, slowly finished working and left the body.
She died a little earlier and it was the end of everything.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing that it was happening.
I couldn’t fight, cry or cry because I was in an environment surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep it in myself...
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who is now saddened by her dead daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers who did not realize what a difficult test she needed to overcome.
“No one knew,” she said.
“My head was down and my tears were down all the time.
It is difficult to explain why, but it was on the plane that I felt great pity for Nada.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Embarrassing Women's Cards to Prevent Suicide on Bridges
Two women who have lost their loved ones are trying to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys on the Wales Bridge distribute cards with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he was depressed and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel like I have to feel every day,” she said.
Davis, 45, said her son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said that his smile lit the room.
But he quit his job before he died because he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his suicide brother.
Davis said: \"I am constantly afraid that a chain reaction may occur.\"
Davis created a postcard, “so that people would know that there are people around you who can be contacted and talked about, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t sit in silence, you have to talk.
Humphreys, Davies' long-time friend, lost his 15-year-old partner, Mark, who left his life shortly after his mother died.
“He didn’t say he was depressed, depressed, and didn’t complain,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we saw his changed attitude.
At Christmas, the situation was absolutely bad: when the children rolled out their gifts, he did not look in their eyes and did not react in any way -
She said that his death was a huge trauma for them, but they had to overcome it: \"In the family, it left a void.
It breaks our heart.
But we all have to live and fight.

FBI opens investigation, Brett Kavanaugh’s future hangs on the hair
I thought if we could actually get something he asked for -- a limited-time and scale investigation -- maybe we would bring some unity,\" Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee was \"in a firm stand.
Why did Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to open an investigation?
Their contradiction is determined only by time.
Only five weeks before the midterm elections, which will take place on November 6, and if Republicans are expected to turn out to be poor, their efforts to elect the desired person to the highest court in the country will be greatly weakened.
George W. Bush called the senators in an effort to convince them to support Mr Kavanaugh, who worked for Bush in the White House and met his wife Ashley, a former Bush personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI reports?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr Kavanaugh can get 50 votes in the Senate to allow Vice President Mike Pence to break ties and approve him to the Supreme Court.
With Kim coming to power, North Korea's number of deserts has fallen.
South Korea’s lawmaker said the number of North Korean deserters to South Korea had fallen when Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Unification Ministry, said that 1,227 deserters were identified last year, compared to 2,706 deserts in 2011.
Park said the main factors were tougher border controls between North Korea and China and increased human smuggling prices.
Pyongyang did not make any public comments.
Many North Korean desertors eventually offer South Korean citizenship.
Seoul said more than 30,000 North Koreans had crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many fled across China, which has the longest border with North Korea and which is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between both Koreas.
China considers deserters as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcefully returns them to their homeland.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are still technically in war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang, where talks on the abolition of nuclear weapons were blocked.
This followed a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June in Singapore, when both agreed in principle to make the Korean peninsula a nuclear-free zone.
On Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the United States of not changing its sanctions.
\"If there is no trust in the United States, we will not be able to trust our national security, and under no circumstances will we unilaterally disarm the first,\" Ri said at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Britta Kavanaugh “mysterical” and claims that he is not fit to serve in the Supreme Court
The House’s minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, called the Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh “mysterical,” saying he was not fit to serve at the Supreme Court for his temperament.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview at the Texas Tribune festival in Austin on Saturday.
\"I can't just think that if a woman did, she would be hysterical,\" Pelosi said in a statement to the Senate Court Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied charges of sexual abuse against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford while both were still teenagers.
During his introductory speech on family and high school times, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes crying or crying.
He has also absolutely condemned the former Democrats in the committee who accused him of “grotesque and coordinated destruction of reputation,” supposedly organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's evidence proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court because she had revealed her biased attitude towards the Democrats.
“I think he disqualified himself with his statements and with the attack of the Clinton and Democratic Party,” she said.
Asked whether Kavanaugh would seek to remove if his candidacy were confirmed and the Democrats received a majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi objected.
“I’ll say that if he’s lying to Congress or the FBI, he’s not fit to hold office not only in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he works now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the District Court of Appeals of Colombia.
Pelosi said she was concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible decisions on the Accessible Health Act or the Roe v Wade case because he was considered a conservative judge.
During the approval meetings, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether certain decisions of the Supreme Court would be revoked.
\"Now is not the time to say hysterically, biasedly, as a judge: \"How wonderful it is,\" Pelosi said.
The Power Women Should Use
It’s a legitimate criticism – eventually a month and even a year of anger that she can’t express without tears.
“When we get angry, we cry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“It doesn’t seem unusual to me, but to you.”
She continued: “I was very helped by one woman, the head of a company, who told me that she was also crying when she was angry, but developed a certain method: angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to: “You may think I’m sad because I cry.
In fact, I'm angry --
And she was just crying further.
It seemed like a genius to me.
Tears are considered an acceptable expression of anger, in part because they are generally misunderstood.
One of my most striking memories is from one of the first jobs in the office, where the men worked most and where I once started crying for unspeakable anger. Then I was behind the hanger, an older woman, a harsh leader, who was always a little scared, and stretched into the stairwell.
“Never let them see you crying,” he told me.
They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad, so they’ll be happy to beat you.
A member of the Democratic Party Congress from Colorado Patricia Schroeder worked with Gary Hart during his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught on board the ship Monkey Business (aphorism, meaning lightly spent time) and withdrew his candidacy, deeply disappointed Schroeder decided that there was no reason why he could not stand for president himself.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me after 30 years laughing.
There were seven other candidates at the time, so there was no need for another.
Someone called me “Snowhole with seven dwarfs.”
With the late launch of the campaign, there was little time left to raise funds, so she swore she would not announce her candidacy until she raised $2 million.
It was an uneven fight.
She noticed that some supporters who donated $1,000 to men were spending only $250.
“Maybe they thought I was getting a discount,” she said.
Speaking in a speech that announced that she was starting a formal campaign, she was so embarrassed by emotions – thanksgiving, a system of disappointment that made it extremely difficult to raise funds and reach voters directly, not representatives, and anger for sexism – that she was crying.
“You would have thought I had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalled.
You would have thought I was supported by the Kleenex Wipes business.
I remember thinking what would be written in my tomb.
“She was crying,”
What the U.S. and China Can Do for Beijing
The first frosts in the U.S.-China trade war were curated, and although the battle is still far from over, experts say the discord may eventually be beneficial to Beijing.
US President Donald Trump issued a first warning this year that he had taxed China’s main exports, including solar cells, steel and aluminium.
The biggest opposition came this week when new tariffs came into force for goods worth $200 billion (£150 billion), i.e. half of China’s exports to the US would be taxed.
Beijing responded at the same time to all the measures, with the latest decision imposing a five to ten percent tariff on American goods with a total value of $60 billion.
China has vowed to fight US teeth for its teeth, and the world’s second-largest market does not seem to be going down in the near future.
Washington would only ease sanctions if China complied with demands, but it would be too difficult for Chinese President Xi Jinping to bow publicly to the US.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its party properly, the difficulties of the trade war with the US could eventually have a positive impact on China as they reduce the interdependence of these markets.
“The fact that a sudden political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that would make the economies of both countries worse is actually much more dangerous than the observers have so far acknowledged,” said Abigail Grace, an employee of the Asian New American Security Center.
Syrian Foreign Minister says country ready to accept return refugees
Syria says it is ready for a voluntary return of refugees and asks for help in the reconstruction of a country that has been destroyed by more than seven years of war.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the conditions in the country were improving.
\"The progress in combating terrorism has made the situation on the territory much more stable and secure,\" he said.
The authorities continue their efforts to restore areas destroyed by terrorists and restore normal conditions.
All conditions have already been created for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they have been forced to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions against everyday life and prosperity.
According to UN estimates, Syria has left around 5.5 million Syrians since the start of the war in 2011.
Six million people in the country still need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would gladly accept help to rebuild the country.
However, he also stressed that the country would not accept conditional support or assistance from countries supporting the uprising.
Europe has won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team, which reached the final score of 16.5:10.5, won the 2018 Ryder Cup at the Le Golf National in Paris, France.
The United States has already lost for the sixth time in a row in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup on the continent since 1993.
Europe regained its crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored 14.5 points, which was enough to defeat the United States.
The US star Phil Mickelson, who had a lot of success throughout the tournament, launched a blow from the starting ground right into the water in the 3rd day of the 16-day pit against Francesco Molinari.
Italian player F. Molinari scored in all rounds and became one of the four players who achieved a score of 5-0-0 since 1979, when the tournament gained its current form.
American Jordan Spieth 5:4 was defeated by the lowest-rated European team player Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson 2:1 lost to Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup tournament.
The 8th Ryder tournament veteran, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the most successful European player of all time, earning 25.5 career points.
“I rarely cry, but I can’t control myself today.
It was a difficult year.
I am very grateful to Mr. Thomas for having chosen me and believed in me.
I am very happy and very happy that we have returned the cup.
It all depends on the team and I’m glad I could help,” said Garcia after the European victory.
He hands the staff over to his compatriot John Ram, who won the US golf legend Tiger Woods in Sunday's unit game 2:1.
“I’m incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods – I grew up watching him play,” Rahm, 23, said.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now owns 13-21-3 Ryder, a career record for the Cup.
This is a strange statistics for one of the best players of all time who won the 14 biggest prizes and landed only at Jack Nickaus.
The U.S. team failed to hit the mowing lawn all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showed a high-level game throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk said, “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning there was a moment when we started putting pressure on Europeans.
We were fighting.
I've got a hat against Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will regroup, I will work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
I have to bend my head.
Our opponents were superiors.
“Red Flood News. Concentrations in Painelas, Manati and Sarasota are decreasing
A recent report by the Florida Commission for Fish and Wildlife (FWC) found that the total concentration of the “red flood” in the Gulf of Tampa is decreasing.
According to FWC, more fragmentary flowering has been observed in the districts of Painelas, Manati, Sarasota, Charlotte and Colliers, suggesting that the concentration is decreasing.
\"Red Flood - blooming covers about 130 miles of coast from the north of Pinelas to the southern districts of Li.
Flowering areas can be found about 10 miles from the coast of Hillsboro, but less than last week.
\"The red flood has also been observed in Pasco County.
