Young doctor strike: calls for new protests
Representatives of new doctors ask their trade unions to enter into a dispute on the new treaty.
The Committee for Young Doctors (JAC) of the British Medical Association (LMA) intends to ask the Council to support wider protests at the beginning of September.
According to JAK, ministers have failed to dispel their doubts about the contract.
In July, the young doctors and medical students rejected the contract offered by LMA.
A total of 58% of all members who took part in the vote voted against the Treaty.
On Twitter, on Thursday evening, Ellen McKort, a member of the JAK Council, points out that the government continues to remain silent on this issue and has therefore rejected the offer of the contract.
She said: \"As a result of the vote by the JAC, the proposal for a contract has been completely rejected and the decision has been taken to request a new formal discussion to discuss the most important issues.
In response to government silence, JAK formally requested a meeting with the LMA Board to authorise the establishment of new contracts, which would enter into force in September.
As a result of the dispute, young doctors took part in six strikes, including for the first time in the history of NHS.
Following a vote rejecting the contractual conditions proposed by the LMA, which was recommended by the BMA, the representative of the new doctors of the LMA, Dr. Johans Malawi, resigned.
Before meeting with 54 000 young doctors and medical students, he had told BMA members that the offer was good and would be accepted.
After the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt informed that the contract would be concluded with English medicine.
Russia and Turkey: Distinguished Alliance?
A gesture that brought an end to the crisis.
The Russian and Turkish leaders met on Tuesday to rock and announce the end of the eight-month name and economic sanctions war.
However, when Vladimir Putin greeted the Turkish leader in St. Petersburg’s castle, it seemed that the partnership was more needed in Ankara.
Both of them, however, rocked.
Vladimir Putin's smile looked artificial and did not cause warm emotions, even taking into account his usual restraint.
On the other hand, Tajjip Erdogan named Putin five times at least as his “lovable friend ” to present a meeting.
I've had a number of troubles.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only improve to pre-crisis levels, but would be stronger.
The next day, a newspaper reported that Erdogan was acting as if nothing had happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm causes conflicting feelings.
However, the wind from Putin suggests that the Russian leader has forgotten nothing.
The first thing he mentioned in his speech was a Russian aircraft hit on the Syrian border.
At that time Moscow was a sharp reaction.
Putin accused Ankara of bringing the dune into Moscow’s back.
This was even more painful given that it came from a friend.
Restoring true trust will be very difficult, perhaps impossible.
As of November, Russia's public position has changed.
For several months, government - controlled television spread aggressive insults to Ankara.
Suddenly, the Turks seemed to be the fault of everything.
The most serious was the accusation that Erdogan's own family had made profits from the illegal trade of oil with the State-controlled Syrian part of Islam.
Of course, he denied it.
However, the main message of the St. Petersburg meeting was that it was time to forget the past.
After all, this meeting was held only because Putin received President Erdogan's apology.
Russia could see it as a kind of victory.
The benefits of Ankara’s peace settlement are obvious.
First, Erdogan needs all possible friends after the failed coup last month in which he was tried to get down.
The countless terrorist attacks have also shaken his positions.
There are also economic motives.
The Russian sanctions have caused severe losses, in particular the ban on charters, which generally provide an influx of millions of Russian tourists each year in Turkish resorts.
The number of tourists decreased by almost 90%.
Russia's tour operators and charter companies are also eased to breathe when regular flights are restored.
They look forward to resting in the middle of the Mediterranean season.
Already this week, the country's TV expects a fall in fruit and vegetables prices as imports of Turkish fruit and vegetables will be renewed.
According to the local newspaper Vedemati: “The tourists, the tomatoes for us,
However, the visit also had other political motives on the Moscow side.
Ankara is angry with the West for, in their opinion, the weak response to the coup attempt.
All can also be seen with the lengthy accession negotiations and the Putin intervention, which is glad to take advantage of the situation that Turkey has alienated from the West.
The Russian leader undoubtedly got additional points in the eyes of Ankara, expressing his support for its elected government after the coup attempt.
Note that Moscow understands this well because it is deeply rooted in the fear of the regime in the country.
The summit that took place in this luxurious seaside castle gave Russia and Turkey the opportunity to present how one analyst named it. Two out of the outskirts of the West unite forces.
However, despite the unity demonstrated by the public, there are still significant differences of opinion between the two countries.
The main differences affect Syria, where Russia presents itself as a peacemaker, but in fact Russia and Turkey support the opposite parties.
After more than three hours of the initial talks, without wishing to disclose information, the two presidents announced at the press conference that they had not discussed the matter.
The President of Turkey carefully avoided questions about the disagreements between the two countries, while President Putin wanted to highlight them.
There is no clear consensus on how both countries can find a common language on the Syrian issue.
However, after months of unveiled hateful relations and potential disasters, when Turkey hits a Russian battle plane, the situation has improved, as both leaders have at least resumed negotiations.
Scottish King Bank will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland
The brand SKB will continue to play a role as the Executive Director of the bank.
Outside Scotland SKB will no longer be available.
Ross Makevans tells the BBC channel in Scotland that the SKB brand was associated with bank ambitions on a global scale.
It has abandoned these ambitions because eight years ago the bank almost went bankrupt and needed financial assistance.
Meanwhile, the branding experts have used the SKB brand to protect other consumer financial brands.
The Bank received millions of pounds from international sports sponsors, from the Six Nations Regbius to the Wimbledon Tennis champion Andy Murray.
However, it is now decided to put forward other national brands.
Scottish King Banaka will be available to Scottish customers, but it will not be initialized.
In England and Wales all SKB references, outside the main office and official stock exchange lists, will be replaced by the name NatWest.
The Ulster Bank is already being used in Ireland and Northern Ireland.
Smaller private financial brands such as Cutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank will now also be noted.
Makevan was interviewed on the trip with customers and employees on the Invernesshire.
He told the BBC Scottish Canal: “The SKB will become our investor brand and employees, because now we become more branded as a bank...
In time, the bank itself became a global brand and SKB became a global brand.
Now I say that we no longer have global ambitions, we have local ambitions.
Each of these brands will represent something unique in its industry and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
SKB has already announced that Six Nations will not sponsor and will engage various brands in sports sponsorship.
“The time has come for us to become a brand bank, because we have long asked ourselves how to become a better bank for our clients, says the Executive Director.
Three years ago it would have been very cynical if we announced that we would become a great bank to our customers and develop these brands.
However, thanks to hard work and focusing on the needs of our customers, not our own, we have obviously made major changes.
We can revitalise these brands, so I think it's the right time.
Frankie Detori won 3000th victory, acquiring first place in the New Harbor with horse Predice
Decorae the Champagne by winning his 3000th victory twice finalizing the first race in New York.
Friday jockey Frankie Detore won his 3,000th victory in Britain's history, gaining the first place in New York.
He achieved this by winning the second victory in these races, which took place in his home city, by driving a predication trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey, who has achieved such a result in horsepoint races.
He has joined Sir Gordon Richards, Dougas Smith, Lester Pigot, Pete Eder and Willie Karson.
Three - time champion Jockey Detori, who previously won the horse Ghayyar, said: “It’s something special.
I'm very moved because my family is here.
I'm very glad that it happened in New York, because I've been living here for 30 years.
This is not a big race, this is not a Royal Ascosta, but an ordinary Friday evening with 20,000 people.
I feel light and very grateful.
After winning the Detori and Prediletion are expected with lashes and smooths.
Two jockeys have reached this record in race with obstacles - champion Richard Johnson and career end 20-time champion Sir Antonio McCoy, who set up several records in his career, earning more than 4300 wins.
Lester Pigot, the nine-timed ber with a winner, won 4493 wins during his career.
Frankie is one of the best jokes of modern times and is not a surprise that he has succeeded, which only a few are able to achieve.
He is stylish and strong, but his tactics make him different from the other jockeys.
He is a fantastic racing representative, his enthusiasm and harizma years attracts fans of this sport.
A few weeks ago, in Epsoma's race, I told Frankie that he would have won some 6,000 wins if he did not only participate in the weekend and the big race.
Seriously, however, it is a real joy that Frankie has won the UK race regularly for 30 years.
He is a happy man who is great at the British race, and he is an outstanding jockey.
Frank Detori noted this achievement with his own brand - flying break.
From the finish of the wind speed to the flying leap, Frankie Detori has been the face of British horse racing for twenty years.
This has been a journey of adventure.
He has won countless big races, including the famous 1996 - The Great Seven in Ascosta, and has survived the flight accident and disqualified for the use of preparations.
Three years ago he had difficulty returning after six months of disqualifying, but he demonstrated his strength by challenging those who questioned him, returning in their best form.
And he could take part in the race for another time - Denor has previously said that he would be willing to continue with the race until at least 50 years of age.
Russian President Putin opens administration Sergey Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly released the Head of Administration Sergey Ivanov.
Ivan has been in the circle of Putin’s closest people for many years.
Currently, a 63-year-old politician has been appointed as a special representative in the field of nature and transport.
According to the President's statement, Putin – decided to release Ivanov from the duties of Head of the Russian President's Administration – without mentioning the reason.
Mr Anton Vaino has been appointed to replace Ivanov, who has been his deputy since 2012.
My 44-year-old Vaino has been a diplomat.
Vaino was born in 1972 in Tallinn, Estonia, graduated from the prestigious Moscow National Institute of International Relations (MVSAI) and later worked in the Tokyo Embassy.
He later headed the President's minutes and the administration of government staff, as reported by the Russian website.
After his appointment, he said to Putin: “Thank you for your trust.
In my opinion, the main work of the administration is to support you in your duties as President of the State by drafting laws and controlling the implementation of your decisions.
Putin told Russian broadcasting company that Ivanov himself wanted to leave office and recommended that Vaino be his substitute.
Are smiles sure?
This move has been confused by Moscow.
Sergey Ivanov is an old and close ally of Vladimir Putin and, like Putin, worked at the Soviet Security Service.
He was one of the most influential men in Russia.
At the state television session, both men announced that Ivanov resigned on his own initiative.
But despite camera smiles, this explanation rarely comes to light, especially before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the outcome of the fight for power?
No one knows that.
However, the official statement that the man who was considered to be a potential president suddenly wanted to become the head of Russian environmental policy is treated with a great deal of skepticism.
In the notes published on the Chair’s website, Ivanov says to Putin: “It is a fact that at the beginning of 2012 I ask you to entrust me with this difficult position, even a problematic position, for four years.
It turns out that I had been in this post for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
Former Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and former staff of the KGB's State Security Service, as he did in Putin's capacity.
By the late 1990 ’ s, Putin led the Federal Security Service, a successor of the KGB, and Ivan took up the post of his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivano among the five most trusted people.
Putin was considered a potential Russian presidential candidate at the end of the second term, since the transfer of Putin to the third term would be anti-constitutional.
But then another close ally of Putin, Dmitri Medvedev, became president.
Putin became Prime Minister, and after three and a half years he returned to the President.
An enigma of fish in a garden town of Banfas
A man from Banfa asks for help to clarify the conditions under which a species appeared in his garden in Banfa.
Kevin Bain thinks that 75 fish could be sandfish, which has ended up with a water room.
Mr. Beina, who lives about 50 feet [500 m] from the sea, published a fish video on Periscope, hoping that someone might know how these 5 cm [5 cm] large fish came into his garden.
Cross of Queensferija: The bridge is now connected to Faifa.
Currently, the 1,35 billion worth of projects are due to be completed in May 2017.
The engineers have connected the northern part of the Queensferija junction with the viaduct, which means that the bridge is now connected to Faifa.
The first of the four connecting parts is completed, which means that the bridge’s construction is approaching its end.
The Faiff bridge is built 600 meters long and weighs 30 000 tons.
It consists of 10 000 tonnes of steel, 20 000 tonnes of concrete and 46 support cables.
Currently, the GBP 1.35 billion project worth it is planned to be completed in May 2017.
Economic Secretary Keit Brown came to the construction site today and was one of the first to climb on the bridge.
He said: “This is a symbolic and historic moment in construction of the Queensfer bridge.
In this project we see an unparalleled engineering solution where only more than 30 000 tonnes of cement and steel were used in the construction of this part.
Despite the huge weight and size of the bridge, connecting the bridge and viaducts is an extremely delicate process that requires enormous precision.
In general, more than 79% of the bridge deck has already been built and the last link to connect the bridge to Rosti will be covered today, which means that all parts of the bridge are ready to be installed.
Michael Martin, director of the fourth bridge connection project, says: “The first link is a very important point in building any bridge.
In this fantastic project, the first link demonstrates the top-class engineering construction.
After the last stage of the road and its connection with the support of the northern tower, we were left to connect the northern part of the road to the ground or viaduct.
This was done by moving the part of the viaductus of the northern semi-couple of 700 millimetres southward.
It was a huge and at the same time very delicate surgery.
Huge, because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighed about 6000 tons and had to be pulled at about 3%.
The delicate, because the tolerance in both directions that the team was working with was just a few millimetres.
Fortunately, everything worked well.
Simon Bailes acquires gold gymnastics for women.
Forget the tension.
Forget the worry.
Simon Bailes doesn't bother it.
Dynamic jumps.
Effortlessly exercises on a log.
Imposed on the floor.
It's totally unblemished.
And finally, the Olympic champion.
On Thursday, a 19 - year - old American gymnasium won a gold medal, fully demonstrating the difference between itself and the rest of the world on the Olympic stage.
Her total score of 62,198 was superior to the silver medal and her team member Alija Raismane and the bronze medal won the result of the Russian sportsman Alija Mustafin.
On Thursday, the U.S. athlete Simona Bails conducted a training on log sports in the individual multilateral finals for women in the 2016 summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Baila became the fourth American in a row, who gained the title of the multi-swine champion and the fifth best gymnastics, gradually strengthening her reputation as the best gymnastics of her generation and perhaps the best gymnastics in history.
When the final result was announced, she came out of tears, because the long journey to this moment was over.
This achievement rank him next to such unparalleled athletes as Michael Felipe, who raised his sport on another level.
Baila has been a leader in her sport for the last three years, winning 15 medals in World Championships, including 10 gold medals, completing such outstanding, precise and ambitious exercises combinations that Mary Lu Reton, the 1984 Olympic champion, called him the best gymnastics she ever saw.
She was the last test in Brazil, where she had to meet with expectations placed on her rather than on other athletes.
She would be disappointed if she returned to her home in Spring, Texas without gold medals.
The U.S. athletes Simon Bails (left) and Alija Raismane are surrounded by the individual multi-sex exercise exercise of gold and silver medals for women in the 2016 summer Olympics Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which took place on Thursday.
The first gold medal in Bails got on Tuesday, making a special random coordinator for Martha Karolji's return party.
Although Baila claims that, on her long journey to the tops of the Slav, there was nothing to do with this, it is not true.
Part of her performance in free motions, which includes her special acrobatics transition, is accompanied by Latin music that would fit perfectly on the street next to the Rio Olympics Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
A girl who was adopted by her grandparents, when she was still a baby, discovered by the coach Amy Burmann’s mother on a tour to a gym where the beers of Bourman were held, has now become a force to be taken into account.
She has not lost in multiple competitions since the summer of 2013 and the victories series can continue as long as Bailes wants to.
Although the two rotations of Mustafin were managed a little, it was just an illusion.
Balance log and free movement - part of the competition where Bails will defend his champion title, is still in front.
She came to the forefront with a score of 15.433 on the log and strengthened the control with a result of 15.933 in free movement
Rismane gently hung her while they were waiting for results that were only formality and she came out of joy in tears when she realized the dream she had ever written in her notebook.
The result was a small abomination of four - year - old events when she shared the third place with Mustafin. However, she lost her fight for the bronze medal.
This time, a 22 - year - old team of captains, called “the Grandma, ” came under the decisive leadership of the Americans.
After a performance in free movements that dispelled doubts about her return, she could devote her air to the crowd of kisses.
In the meantime, the 19 - year - old Bailes Viral Twitter record r published this week, now has a completely different meaning.
Mahay Brown, 6 years old, survives a fire in Philadelphia.
The police report that the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, pointing out that it is already the second six-year-old who was shot in Philadelphia this week.
Grandparents of the child at the CBS Philadelphia News Channel confirmed that this is Mahay Brown.
Grandparents say that Brown was shot several times, including in the circus, the foot, the hand, and the abdomen, but was still conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
His grandmother Delores Melendeza says to the television: “His little body was simply oscillated by bears...
I can't believe it.
The boy is in critical position in the hospital and has already passed several operations.
The family informs him that he is going to recover.
He had to start in the first class at primary school.
Brown is one of the four people shot in the city of Jermantun.
Three men were also shot: two men 29 years old and one 32 year old man.
The Canal CSS Philadelphia reports that one of the 29-year-old men is in a critical position, but the other two are in a stable position.
The channel tells you that the child was found in the front seat of a car near the age of 29 in critical condition.
The other two victims were not in the car, and the police were investigating whether one of them was an attacker.
The investigator told the CFS Philly that several shooters were likely involved in the trial.
At the point of the event, weapons belonging to various weapons were found.
It seems to have been a long fireman.
Cuffs have been found on both sides of the pedestrian harness.
“So it looks like there have been several armed shooters who actively took part in the fire, ” says Philly, police captain Antony Ginaldi.
The damage also occurred to several homes and cars.
No one has yet been detained and police are reported to check surveillance camera records.
On Tuesday, a broken bullet hit a 6 - year - old girl in her hand while she played in front of her home in the district of Vestouklein.
She gradually recovers, but the police are still looking for the guilty.
Why do we need Simon, Gabija and Laurija?
I call it Women's Olympic Lighthouse Team a year for a number of reasons.
First of all, I've been to all the summer Olympics since 1984, and the U.S. team has never been so good.
Secondly, the team has three lighthouses, Simona Bails, Gabija Douglas and Laurija Hernandez, which inspire many new origin girls.
People can be proud that this team also includes Alija Raismane, who is Jewish and Madison Cociana, a Catholic.
Finally, this team truly represents America.
It has also strengthened the participation of black and Latin American athletes in this sport.
For the past four years, the best exerciseer is an African - born American.
Last year Simon and Gaby took 1st and 2nd places.
These are impressive results.
During previous Olympics, Gabija Duglas was surprisingly the Olympic champion, and America was able to rejoice.
Now the world has seen incredible exercises carried out by the threefold champion Simon Bails, Douglas and Laurija Hernandez, performing unprecedented but mastery exercises.
On Thursday, Simon became the fourth American in a row, which has gained a gold medal for individual multiple women.
Aly Rasmanne, a member of her team, won a silver medal.
We have seen the best that this sport can give, but in the rest of the country the situation during the exercise hours is completely different.
Simona, Gabija, and Laurija entered the Olympic sample just like Alice and Medison.
They are “The Olympic Fifth,” because the next Olympic exercise team will have only four athletes, and this is the last year of coach Martha Karola.
In fact, gymnastics is expensive sports. Gymnasiums are mostly trained by private track clubs, and are supported by parents who pay for workouts, premises, travels, uniforms, hotels (threeners, athletes and their families) and other expenses.
Most of these vulnerable clubs are located in areas that can afford this sport.
In these clubs, athletes remove all their workouts, and it is a costly and long-lasting contribution to the light-touch families.
Amy Bourman - Simon Baila and Maggie Hainya - Laurija Hernandez's coach has been training their athletes since both girls began to work with ease.
We must provide young girls inspired by Simona, Gabija and Laurija with cheaper exercise opportunities.
I was founded 20 years ago.
My organization is located in Harlem, and we offer more than 15 000 young people (mainly black and Spanish origin) exercise, free of charge or at a low price. We have also trained national and international champions.
In September, we will discover a branch in Detroit, my home town, to provide local youth with an opportunity to get to know this great sport.
Mildity develops strength, flexibleness and body coordination, as well as teaches hard work, discipline and aspiration.
This combination provides a long life with good health and success, both at school and at work.
This team will inspire thousands of young girls to train in relief and this is fantastic.
Working with this sport is very important, especially for young girls.
This is a very exciting time.
Thanks to Simona, Alija, Gabija and Madison for their excellent demonstration of the “Mother Force, ” winning the gold medals of the Olympic Games and motivationing countless new, different origins of girls to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
After Jeremy's rejection of Hunt's offer, young doctors plan to expand more strikes.
Ministers hoped to put an end to the dispute by reaching an agreement on changes to the agreement with representatives of the British Medical Association, but this was rejected by 58 per cent of the 37 000 young doctors who took part in the vote.
In July, Hunt announced its intention to conclude a contract stating that the NHS is in a precarious situation and that further delays would only harm employees and patients.
The first new doctors have already signed a new contract which provides for changes to nighttime working conditions and on weekends to improve working conditions during non-standard working hours.
Last night, Dr Elena Macourta, representative of the new doctors in the BMA, said that young doctors still had serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially that it would exacerbate the labour crisis and do not provide for a level playing field for all doctors.
Eight weeks to the time when the first group of new doctors will sign a new agreement, so progress has been made, as there is not much time left.
The efforts made by the BMA to resolve the problem by negotiation have been faced with the government's unwillingness to engage and sometimes with complete silence.
This happened despite the fact that just last month, Jeremy Hunt said that his door was always open.
Jeremy Hunt must act immediately , stop acting and cooperate with new doctors.
If he does not, the young doctors are ready for new protests.
During the last strike, more than 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits took place at the end of April, while nurses and counsellors tried to replace doctors who had gone to pick up.
Ministers hoped to put an end to the dispute by reaching an agreement on changes to the agreement with representatives of the British Medical Association.
BMA wants to raise the rate for work at weekends for 54 000 new doctors to whom the new contracts would apply.
The Employment Executive Director of the NHS, Daniel Mortimer, invited young doctors to stay on strike.
Mr Mortique explains that the strike does not solve anything, but only increases the pressure on the affected workers and worrys, creates stress and delays for patients, carers and their families.
For the last two months, we have spoken to the new doctor's committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and other institutions, have responded positively to their questions on guardians and rapporteurs.
Employers expect active cooperation on other important issues, such as placement of workers, flexible training, additional training for those returning after career interruption, training costs, mutual recognition of training programmes, drop-outs and gender pay inequalities in medicine - it is clear that employers, the English Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Health are keen to implement the agreements concluded with the BME in November, February and May.
A daily dose of 2 pounds may reduce the risk of heart attack.
Thousands of patients with a history of heart attack could be treated with a daily dose of 2 pounds as official representatives recommend that they be given more to people and for longer periods.
The anti-refractory medicine, Ticagrilor, reduces the risk of heart attack in people with heart disease.
This medicine is already prescribed for 12 months after the heart attack, reducing the risk of recurrent heart attack.
The NHS represented NICE is recommended for use 4 years after the heart attack to further reduce the risk of heart attack in people with cardiovascular problems.
However, it is recommended that the NHS at present is administered 4 years after the heart attack to further reduce the cardiovascular risk.
Each year some 140,000 people in England experience a heart attack, and a quarter of them experience a recurrent heart attack or stroke.
Heart and stroke are caused by the accumulation of fat in the heart wall, causing blockages.
If the obstruction ruptures, it can cause a clot, blocking the flow of blood to the heart and causing a heart attack.
If the clot separates from the blood vessel wall, it can move further into the bloodstream and block the blood’s access to the brain, causing a heart attack.
Heart attack has increased the risk of recurrent heart attack.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca, which is marketed under the name of Brilique, reduces the risk of developing clots.
The new NICE guidelines, published today, are recommended for people to take 90 mg of Ticagrelor for 12 months and for 3 more years at 60 mg twice daily with aspirin.
Caroline Longson, Health Technology Director at NICE, explains: “Despite the availability of drugs to prevent heart attack, more than a quarter of people with heart attack experience another heart attack or stroke, often with serious consequences.
Fear of repeated heart attack can have a negative impact on the quality of life of a person.
Evidence suggests that the combination of Ticagrelor and aspirin effectively reduces the risk of recurrent heart attack and heart attack in individuals who have experienced it.
When recommending treatment with Ticagrelor on a preliminary basis, we are glad that we can extend the treatment opportunities to thousands of people who benefit from it.
Taking into account limited information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor, in particular the risk of bleeding when taking this medicine for more than three years, the draft guidance does not recommend the use longer than this period.
The political Korean culture contributes to fraud in Muslim communities during elections
According to a management report, Lutfur Rahman, former mayor of Tauerhamlet, was dismissed in connection with corruption.
The government report reveals that the political corrective culture has led to large-scale fraud in Muslim communities.
Former Minister of Government, Sir Eriks Pickles, criticises the police, electoral overseers and city councils for ignoring the signs of fraud in the election process, because “fearing of ethnic and religious interests...
The former community secretary, who has now become the leader of the anti-corruption organisation, says that the intimidation of voters for religious reasons is so widespread that the police should be allowed to place guards at election stations to protect the frightened voters.
He also recommends that voters should present proof of identity when voting to prove their true identity.
At present, voters should only indicate their name and address.
He even recommends that the finger of the voters who voted with a special ink be marked in order to avoid double voting.
Rapporteurs should also provide more protection, says Sir Eriks.
He felt that the press should have greater access to Council documents and decisions taken by informal committees and working groups.
He says: “It is not only a burden to prevent fraud in elections, but also to protect the local government from a wider culture of corruption and fraud, which goes hand in hand with it.
The report was commissioned after a scandal in the town of Tauerhamlet.
Last year, the Special Election Court decided to abolish Lutfur Rahman, the Mayor of the City, because of corrupt and illegal activities.
The Court found that Rahman was a cynical distortion of his Muslim community’s religious viewpoint and silenced his critics by indicting them in racism and Islamophobia.
“Rahman led his election campaign with the assumption that the religious responsibility of believers is to vote for him ”
About 300 votes were false or questionable because one person had voted several times.
Sir Eriks also points out that there are signs of fraud across the country.
He pointed out that there was a particularly worrying fact of post-voting fraud, where senior members of Muslim communities forced others to vote for their desired candidates.
Sir Eriks recommended a series of measures to improve the electoral system, including the presentation of personal identification documents, to clarify the identity of the person.
His report states: “The evidence shows that vulnerable members of ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, are being forced to vote in favour of senior candidates of communities, particularly in Bangladesh and the Pakistani communities.
\"There are concerns that the district authorities do not pay attention to these problems because of political correctness, as they could prejudice ethnic and religious interests.\"
Sir Eriks set out 50 recommendations on how to improve the electoral system, which also includes a ban on political activists working with votes cast by post in order to prevent the collection of votes.
The report, which is being examined by Tereza Meja, also calls for a more thorough verification of registrations to prevent electoral roll-out of immigration fraud and benefits.
Consider the possibility of requiring voters to produce an identity document before voting.
Tick the fingers of the voters who voted with special ink to prevent double voting.
To systematically verify the nationality of persons to make sure that the person has the right to vote.
Set three-year limits for requests for automatic postal voting.
To prevent political campaign members and activists from working with votes cast by post and electoral envelope voting by post.
Ensure that the police have the power to place security at electoral sites.
Make changes to the law in order to facilitate the prosecution of persons for intimidation in accordance with the 1983 Human Rights Act.
Prohibition of photographing in polling stations.
Only use English (except Wales) in electoral districts.
Reinforce training to ensure that voters go to elections in caves alone.
Sir Eriks strongly criticises the Metropolis police, stating that no accusations have been made in the Tauerhamlet case.
He says: “Loftur Rahman and his representative were disqualified from the courts for their corruption and fraud-related activities.
He was convincingly found guilty of the standard of criminal law evidence on the basis of irrefutable evidence.
He also criticises the inefficient check-up of the city council voters – the voters’ registration stations.
Sir Eriks points out: “The judicial decision last year is a call for alarm.
Our country is known as the homeland of parliament, but the alarming and covert spread of electoral fraud and the instigation of institutions that fraud does not threaten this good reputation.

The commentator of the CBC Olympic Games apologises for his comment that the Chinese swimmer is ‘ending as a pig’.
Byron McDonald's analysis of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhas finish fourth place in 4x200 m free-style stylus for women, caused a suffocational storm in the CBC viewers.
The Canadian channel CBC was forced to apologize, because one of its commentators commented that when a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer came out of the race that he died alone, and that he ended up as a pig
The commenter Bairon McDonald thought his microphone had been turned off when a 4x200 m free-style stafe for women at the end of the final round set out his personal opinion.
McDonald, who was included in the CBC commentor team to give comments on life, said: “This little fourteen-year-old from China is unable to keep up with...
“As she sank more, she came out of the race that she died and died like a pig...
Thank you very much.
The result of the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhana in the second stage was 1:57.79, which is 1.61 seconds slower than the result of the Canadian Teilore Ruck, allowing the Canadians to reach China.
The viewers across Canada immediately responded via the Internet because they were shocked by hearing such a tone of expression and expressions.
Emmet McFharlain wrote on Twitter: “Is the direct commentator of the CBC just saying that a 14-year-old swimmer from China end up like a pig?
Idiot did not realize that they were still in the immediate air.
Ai Yanha from China 4x200m in freestyle final for women was named the little fourteen-year-old Chinese who had no--
Critics against Byron McDonald came into force quickly because many requested explanations.
Twitter users could not believe in the sensitive comments made by Byron McDonald.
Twitter user Sarah Paradise wrote: “Oh, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and because of you, we all sound like a racer. #Alright.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who was conducting the CBC live service at the time, apologised for McDonald’s comments, saying: “We apologise that the comment about the result of swimming was made in the immediate air:
It was a failure to choose words and it is a pity for us that this happened.
CBC apologised to more than 90 people who had responded to this comment by Twitter.
McDonald's colleague Scott Russell had to apologize to him.
Then the CBC copied an apology to more than 90 Twitter users who complained about McDonald's comment.
The channel also quickly published an apology and a statement.
We are deeply sorry that such comments were made and came into the immediate ether.
Yesterday we reacted immediately and apologise to all live viewers and followers in social media.
For the sake of clarity, it should be noted that Byron's comments were made on the swimmer's performance rather than addressed to her personally.
But they were in any case unprofessional and unsuccessfully chosen expressions and Byron repentably regretted what happened.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald personally apologised in the direct ether and tried to explain that he did not think his comment would be seen as a personal attack.
He said: “I would like to use a moment to apologize for a comment I made yesterday at a women’s free-style competition.
I'm talking about the swimmer's performance, not about him personally.
I mean, I didn't mean to be disrespectful, and I'm really sorry that happened.
Primark buyers are shocked by a woman who carelessly takes up underwear in the middle of the shop.
Buyers felt uncomfortable when a woman began to dress up to wear panties in the middle of the shop.
In further worsening of the situation, she held them to make sure that she was attached to her and then pulled off, putting her panties back into the shelf of the store.
She continued looking for clothes at Folketon Bouverie Place shopping center store and took four more panties.
Primark shop Bouverie Place in the shopping centre in Folketon – a place where she held her underwear and then placed it back in her shelf.
A two - child mother, Jenny Davidson, said that after wearing a underwear, an unknown woman put on her clothes and left the store without buying anything.
She points out that people could not believe their eyes.
While standing in the middle of the shop, she took up her shelf’s underpants, took her socks and trousers, and measured them out there.
She did not even try to find a more discreet place to measure them, she simply held them right there.
Everyone looked like she pulled the panties and obviously didn't like them, because she just put them back on her shelf.
She took three more panties until she decided that none of them likes them and left the store.
He didn’t seem worried about watching or thinking about someone who would buy the clothes she held up.
Ms. Davidson (33 years) from Kent says: “The idea is that someone will buy clothes that has been held by another person and that have not been washed away.
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Miss Davidsone adds: “I assume that the store’s staff took these clothes out of the store’s shelves after her leaving - which is also acceptable.
I can't imagine buying a new underwear and learning that another woman had used them and hadn't washed them away.
Primark’s representative indicated that Primark is known for an incident occurring on Tuesday, 9 August.
The specific clothes have been removed from the store shelves.
How to protect yourself from firearms by using Krav Maga
The world is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer.
To find out how to protect ourselves in close distance from attackers by firearms, we discussed the great master of Krav Mags from New York Ron Mizraki.
Whether you are attacked by the front or by the back, this video shows how to protect yourself and gain upper hand over the attacker.
The hammers indicate if the attacker is attacking from the back side, then first it is necessary to turn to clearly see the attacker and avoid a shot at the path.
Then the weapon must grasp between its front hand and shoulder and blow into the opponent's face with its free elbow.
Then after that, the knees along the circus are followed, and while the attacker is stiffened by pain, he needs to take his gun away, he has to hit his face with his jaw, and he has to step aside, continuing to turn his gun against him.
If the attacker comes from the front, the situation is similar: a shotgun's trajectory must be avoided, a weapon must be caught and it is lashed so that the evilman cannot shoot.
At the same time, put pressure on the weapon and blow the opponent in his breasts and finally take his gun off and step aside to focus on him.
Sounds complicated?
Watch the video to see exactly how the Muzzy does it.
Remember, though, if you're not the master of Crav Mag, then it's safer to give your money to the robber.
The Wandese family devastates Saltash Cornwall's social home and is thrown on the street.
The Wandes family is laid out from the place of residence for the terrorisation of neighbors, causing damage to the social home of 50,000 pounds.
Tanja Skeldona and her partner Shon Trebilkos were only misplaced from the property of Saltaša Kornvolas because several complaints were lodged about them.
When they were forced out of property, shocked representatives of the housing service found that the property was completely demolished.
There were holes in floors and walls, waste and graffiti were everywhere.
The family is now alienated from property and is likely to live in a private property.
According to Donna Makevoja, the housing manager of Cornwall, there is a concern that it will not be possible to restore the dwelling.
She says that people living here were extremely difficult and she felt that people could not live there.
In this case, several factors need to be assessed, as there will be no future good reputation for this property in Cornwall.
This family is famous and their name is well known.
A couple had three sons who periodically stayed in property, and the police say that their terror was manifest in violence, street platooning, scaring the local population, drug abuse, drug sales, and loud screaming and humiliation.
In June 47 - year - old Skelldone, whose name was the property, was punished for antisocial behaviour.
Wasted waste was found in several demolished home rooms.
In a home where drugs may be first marketed, several flooring boards have also been chosen.
Neighbors say that they have been on the street regularly and are permanently called police.
Cornwall's Housing Service put them out of property forced to leave the house for 11 weeks on a voluntary basis.
The desperate neighbors were very happy about eviction, for their lives were an absolute hell.
One said: “They were not cared for by other people ”
We lived next to them 20 years, it's always been crazy.
I can't believe how often we've seen the police here.
We couldn't lie down this morning.
We wake up because it was so quiet here - we haven't used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, it's gonna be wonderful here.
Adam Fitzpatrik, who is the Neighbourhood Protection Officer of Cornwall Housing, said that the family did not cooperate with local security authorities.
The family lived here for 20 years and has been regularly called police here.
Various old and unusable objects were found in the home - raised garden.
He also said: “It’s a pity that tenants did not show any responsibility for their behaviour, for extortion from the house is always the last step to be considered by Cornwall Housing Service.
This was a very difficult case because their actions were extreme and their neighbors were very difficult to follow.
I appreciate the work that my entire team, Devon and Cornwall police and the members of the team, who were courageous and who worked together with us to provide the necessary information.
I hope that this event will make life easier for neighbors and will show that antisocial behaviour is not acceptable.
Fitzpatrik said that all three sons were living here in different periods of time, but all were about 20 years old.
A dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the rooms after laying.
Staff will now have to clean the waste pile left in the house.
In 2014 the police house carried out a search and found over 70 grams of marijuana, scales, supplies and 1700 pounds in cash.
The sculpture is only found to be guilty in the storage of Class B drugs with a view to their distribution.
She insisted that the money was intended for a monument to her son, Lee Scheldon, who died in a car crash in 2013.
After disposal, it has become known that they are currently renting some private property in Plimuta.
Many walls of the house had graffiti drawn.
The police report that they will continue to place tenants in violation of their rental agreements.
The police representative of Devon and Cornwall Angela Krav points out that this eviction is a clear warning to other tenants who continue to violate the rules.
She also said: “This is a warning for those who believe that they can behave as they wish and that they will have no consequences.
The Déton and Kronvol police are not acceptable for criminal and anti-social behaviour, and the police will continue to work with our partners to protect local communities.

Cannes mayors have banned burkini on bathing beaches.
The mayor of the southern village of Cannes in France has prohibited the wear of burkini bathing costumes on the beaches of this city, which almost completely covers the woman’s body and very resembles the hydro-suit, on Thursday announced local officials.
David Linary, mayor of the Cannes, has ordered that “access to beaches and swimming be prohibited for anyone who does not have a swimmer that respects good customs and secularism, as a basic principle of the French Republic.
“The generalplace dress, which shows the extreme risk of religious affiliation at a time when France and the places of worship are the target of terrorist attacks, may pose a risk of disorder of public order (spaming, clashes, etc.) that needs to be avoided, as stated in the order.
“We are talking not about the ban on wearing a religious symbol on the beach, but about the exceptional clothing associated with trust in terrorist movements, which in war with us - explained the municipal service manager Tjer Miguls.
He added that the burkini swimmers on the Cannes beach had not been seen since July 28, when Linārs, a member of the right central party, the Republican, signed the order and entered into force.

On July 14, 85 people were killed in the terrorist attacks organised in Nice in the nearby resort town of Cannes.
On 26 July, two attackers who had sworn their trust in the Islamic State were brutally murdered by priests in the church in northwest France.

President who stayed in the shadows: Gustav Zemgale - 145.
On Friday, August 12, 145 years have passed since the second President of Latvia Gustavs Zemgals was born.
Zemgale proclaimed Latvia, but unprofitable has remained in the shadow of the well described first President of Latvia Jānis Čakste and last president Karl Ulmanis of the pre-war period.
None of our countrymen have been so much defending democracy and the rule of law as Zemgale, the book dedicated to Gustav Zemgall ten years ago writes Arnolds Auzins.
In conversation with the portal \"Delfi\" Auzins emphasises that Zemgale is one of the rare politicians in high positions who have had a sense of humor.
The rest of them are stiff, always very correct.
He taught nothing like that, in modern times, it could be like Raimonds Vējonis.
\"He was close to the people,\" says Auzins.
Modern politicians are poorly aware of history, they referred to Kārli Ulmanis as the good leader, but few people know how disgust he has been.
At government meetings, the only person to whom he had not yelled was General Balodis.
Even if he was kind and smiling in the pictures, by nature he was histological.
“Zemgal leaves the opposite impression of his sense of humor and democracy, ” says Auzins.
Aivars Strangs, professor at the Faculty of History and Philosophy of the University of Latvia, agrees with Zemgal’s assessment as a calm and balanced stateman.
He also noted that Zemgale had given respect to minorities, and he regularly invited the Jewish representatives to the presidential palace.
“It was not a common practice at that time, after the Zemgale Presidency Albert Kviesis took over the tradition, says a historian.
He was such a quiet and weighed man who had long been asked to become president.
He wasn't looking for it himself, he doesn't go hungry.
He also regarded himself quite critically, because he did not know French, but he felt that the President should understand it.
“The basics of French were taught in the framework of the president’s visit by Strangs.
Zemgale was not allowed to be allowed to stand as a candidate again, but he did not really like high positions.
In any case, he is a very respected personality in the history of Latvia, already before he reached the presidential castle was in serious position - he was a highly demanded notary.
Zemgale also headed the famous Zemgal cashier at Suvorova Street 3, where the society of savers and savers was located, in which practically the state of Latvia was created in the negotiations of the government.
He was always progressive.
There was not a great deal of respect for Ulmanis, but he was not publicly opposed.
“In private negotiations, it has been said that he does not really like Ulmanis, ” says Strang.
Lived a peaceful life, there is no suspicion of illegality or corruption.
How does Zemgale remember today?
It is a shame, but for a large part, he only associates with a street in Riga.
He was an absolute democrat, and the beliefs were central.
“There was no severe shock at all at her time, as he could be associated with a truly stable Presidency, called Strang.
During the Presidency of Gustav Zemgale, between 1927 and 1930, Latvia's country visit to Sweden, which indirectly meant full recognition in the neighbouring country during that time and integration into the Northern European democratic nation family, took place.
On May 28, 1929, Zemgale arrived at a state visit to Stockholm.
The reply of King of Sweden Gustav V to Latvia was received on June 29, 1929.
The second President of Latvia was born in 1871, but he died forever in January 1939.
Simple ways to help a child cope with anger attacks.
I often find that the anger of a child, the onset of fury, is a mistake and an abnormal occurrence of anger.
When a child openly shows his anger - we don't know how to react, “Econet – says psychologist Jekaterina Kessa.
A specialist encourages a small conversation about these natural and human feelings - anger and anger that each of us periodically experiences.
Aggression - it is already a physical activity directed against another person, and it usually appears when you feel angry.
When we adults are angry, upset - we usually know what is happening to us and how to deal with it.
We can express our anger and anger in ourselves: express, suppress, hide, keep in ourselves, tell our friends or other relatives about it, we can angryly snuff a sofa, smoke a cigarette (it is not the best way to cryllative anger!), walk in the shower, hit with a bullet on the table and do other things that we do not usually do.
We do not turn our aggression towards others, because we know various other ways of dealing with these emotions.
Children, when they are angry, do not understand what is happening to them, how to name them, and how to live with them.
They can say, \"Go away, you're a fool, a bad mom, \"I don't see you, I don't care with you -- and very rare when you can say, \"I'm angry with you.\"
Children live literally, they are located right here, at this point, they are spontaneous and truly present in their senses, and often are also found in the captives of various emotions.
It is very important that parents do not prevent a child from expressing feelings, including anger, from being ashamed and not looking, but on the contrary - from helping the child.
Do you need a pause in your relationship?
A long working day in which everything hasn't happened as you would like, or just a bad mood - there are so many reasons why you'd like for a moment, a day or even a longer one - to turn off from all over the world.
Is it possible to infuse the relationship for a moment and breathe a little breath?
Or does it show that each of the partners is on their way to life?
Mr President, in his opinion, she is divided into different ages.
John (23) is brief and concise: “In my view, if you need a breakup, you will not be with the real person.
Meanwhile, Edward (30) has discovered a scheme that may be helpful to someone.
If you feel that your partner is starting to fall into your nerves for every little detail, then it's definitely the right time to look at other hunting fields to see if you miss him, or especially don't think about him or even want to see him again.
So the answer is - yes, holding a pause can help save time and understand how important you have the other side.
Casper (29) reveals his theory.
I think that relations should be kept in touch with one another every day, because if you spend time with the people 24 hours a day, seven days a week, then the disputes are inevitable.
They are caused by the fact that you notice every detail that the other does, and it starts to fall on the nerves.
People are beginning to offend each other, especially if there is nothing more to talk about, just what you have done in the day.
My personal experience makes me think that, so I have not endured relations for more than a few months.
If you think about being better elsewhere or with someone else -- then why is this woman with whom you're with deserve someone who might think that it's not good enough and that there's a paradise field behind the mountains?
Thinking is already a little treason.
If not, no.
“I have, so it’s a little reprehensible for those who don’t have to say Edmunds (46).
Karl (33) has almost no view at all.
I think everybody needs a moment to cool down.
You cannot look at each other for a moment, all the time, in the morning until evening, and rejoice in the lasting love of one another.
Get up!
There are so many things - friends, work, parties.
It's all the time.
Of course, for a friend or wife, but if both can keep it in balance between family life and the rest of the world, it can live to the edge of the grave.
That's it.
Mārtiņš (27) says: “It is important or not to say, may or may not take a pause, but one is clear: there is no end to the proposed relationship, there is something missing.
If this question is raised, then it has to be borne in mind that there will be some change in the near future - for the right or for the bad - it depends on itself.
I think while you're young and crazy, you've got to do it all the time, but when things are still serious and the relationships go into a different phase, you can't talk about rest.
But you decide to spend all your life together!
“If you can’t withstand each other’s society now and one time you need some coolness, then what happens when you’re pensioners commenting on how passing cats nauud or argue about what day the garden should be grown better – explains Kristaps (19).
All the names of the lords have been changed.
With his thrilling and thrilling personality Rozentāls, the first of them raised interest in fine arts in the Latvian people.
\"In this sense, he was the first love of the Latvian people, which as such will remain unforgettable for life – so he wrote Roman Suta about the old master of Latvian painting.
Also in 2016, discovering the extensive retrospective exhibition of an old master in the main building of the Latvian National Museum of Art, it is clear that Rozentāls is the first love of Latvian art.
The exhibition was opened on 12 August, but already from 13 August it is open for visitors and will be open until 30 October.
The Latvian National Museum of Art with a wide retrospective rehearsal in the newly held Great Exhibition Hall honors painter Janis Rozentāls (1866-1916), whose one hundred fifty birthday is included internationally in the UNESCO calendar of celebrations.
The retrospective exhibition, which includes more than 150 works, is one of the central events of Janis Rozentāle's anniversary programme.
Most of the works were made from a collection of Latvian National Museum of Art, which convincingly represents the main stages and genres of classical creative activity, stylistic change and technique.
In addition, exhibits from the Aksel Gallena-Kallela Museum, the Museum of Writing and Music, Liepaja Museum, Tukums Museum and several private collections in Latvia and Finland have been used.

The U.S. business scenes in his interpretation have got perverted the glossy of sophisticated photosession and horror of the film.
In fact, a very provocative work on the fineness and banal vulgarity is hard to draw between the European art house film and the area of the Hollywood genreic product.
The film with Vigo Mortensen highlights the question whether the conceptually chosen life models of parents (ecologicality, vegetarianism, alternativeism and exclusion from consumer society's embarrassment and values) bring blessings or destructiveity to their children.

Of course, sharks are doing it just like attacking beautiful girls - it was a swimmer in the jaws, in this case, a brave surfer, represented by Blake Lavaly.
Her work demanded her fundamental heroism.
This survival solnumour can be compared to James Frank's performance demonstration in the 127-hour film and Ryan Reynolds' game in the film Dr.
Perhaps the main role is also played by artist Mila Kunis, whose transformations from the sampler to the maker of the creative resident and almost family value seem only to be created by the completely desperate fantasy of Hollywood scenarioists.
More than 2,000 civilians have been arrested in Syria by an Islamic country.
On Friday, the terrorist group’s Islamic fighters, fleeing from Menbia, the Syrian Aleppo Province, captured some 2,000 civilians used as a shield, reported the US-supported Kurd and Arab Alliance and Observers.

Koļegova refuses to stand as head of SRS.
Head of State Environmental Service Inga Koļegova decided to withdraw his candidacy for the post of Director General of the State Revenue Service (VID), LETA informed the Agency at the Ministry of Finance.
Koļegova points out that the discussion of her candidature has led to contradictions between the ruling coalition parties.
The real reasons for the discussions seem to be related to the obvious but, more often, invisible interests of politicians, and they have nothing to do with the assessment of my professional capacity.
It is also unacceptable for me to stress that I have already been an applicant for the head of the SRS.
If her candidacy were confirmed in the government, it seems clear that this would not be a convincing vote and would not allow for the full work and the necessary changes in the SRS, feeling the support of the whole government.
Without it, it would not be possible to conclude the work of Koļegova.
“I have emphasised publicly that I do not want to be politically dependent, but at the moment, all my candidates process is too politicised – explained by the official.
“Thanks for the trust and support I have shown, it is a experience that I appreciate as a benefit of – writes to Reizniece-Ozoli Koļegova in her application.
Unity stated on Wednesday that during the meeting with Koļegovs there were significant contradictions – among the explanations of the candidate and the information available in the public registers about the cost of dividends of SIA Pallogs, because the publicly available decisions of the meeting of Pallogues provide for no distribution of profit.
Currently, Deputy Director-General Dace Pelek fulfils the duties of Head of ENVIRONMENT.
In Livona the police are involved in rescue of two children left without supervision, informs the State Police Department of Latgale Region.
A report on unattended calves with infants was received on Friday at 7 a.m.
They were at Livani’s former store building.
The two little girls were handed over immediately to provide medical help.

Over a short hour, the law enforcement clarified the possible location of the parents of the children and went there.
When the women arrived at the home of the civil man, the police found that the woman was sleeping because of her strong drinking.
After an initial note on the evening of the previous day in 1992, the woman was visiting her drinking friend.
The woman decided to leave her children at the shop at home after a joint meeting, under conditions that were not yet clear.
The police immediately informed the barren court, which will also decide on the future fate of the children.
The Freeport of Riga has implemented all the recommendations of the SAC regarding the project of the Russian island.
The Freeport Authority of Riga has implemented all five recommendations of the State Audit Office (GC) regarding the development of the project Infrastructure in Krievų island for the transfer of port activities from the city centre, the portal Diera.lv informed the company.
Approval of the project is planned for the next board meeting of the Freeport of Riga.
In order to implement the recommendations in line with the opinion of the SC, when preparing the documentation necessary for the implementation of the recommendations, the Riga Freeport Authority was also guided by the findings of the legal and operational audit carried out by the international auditor in the Freeport of Riga administration and the recommendations made to improve the management of the project during the next phase of the project.
Information on the implementation of the recommendations has also been sent to the SC today.
Despite the fact that the Riga Freeport Authority disagrees with the opinion prepared by the SAC on the effectiveness of the Russian island project, we are very responsible for the implementation of the project and the donor - the European Commission (EC).
I would like to emphasise that all planned construction works within the framework of the project have been fully completed within the time limits and in the amount planned.
\"In order to prove to all those involved in the implementation of the project, including the EC, the VK and also the public authorities, that the main objective of the freeport is to successfully implement the project, we have fully implemented all the recommendations of the VK regarding project management and monitoring issues, according to Sanita Cairo, project manager of the Russian island.
The long-term action plan for monitoring and monitoring the achievement of the project objective was complemented with the main planned actions of the parties concerned and the required decision deadlines, the definition of meetings and regular reports and their deadlines, the planned tools for monitoring the construction process, as well as the definition of the most significant border points.
The approved action plan to achieve the project objective by 31 December 2018, in line with the recommendations of the SC, has been complemented with enforcement monitoring activities, thus reinforcing the control of the remaining parties involved in the implementation of the project by the Freeport of Riga.
A project management plan has been developed to improve project management and mitigate potential risks, defining the project management areas and identifying the developed documents that provide a control and monitoring mechanism for each of them.
Project capacity building is a project management structure scheme which reflects the planned structure of the project management team, staff qualifications and functions.
In order to improve communication between the Freeport of Riga administration and the parties involved in the project, a communication plan has been developed between the interested parties which, in addition to the parties identified in the project action plan, defines the successful completion of the project by the interested parties, principles, types and frequency of information exchange.
On the other hand, in order to improve control over the use of financial resources, it will be necessary to justify in more detail the need for a service contract or a start-up contract and the rule of law.
Within the framework of the project, a port infrastructure compatible with world standards has been built in Russian island - four new deep-water quay, railway ports, as well as engineering communications.
The works co-financed by the Cohesion Fund have been completed and put into operation at the end of the year, achieving the financial savings of EUR 10.6 million.

Slovakia is holding the presidency of the EU until January.
German researchers discuss the number of victims of the Berlin Wall.
According to new studies, the number of deaths by the Communists in the former East German border could be much higher than previously believed, but doubts about the true number of victims remain.
According to data transmitted to the public on Wednesday by the Berlin Wall Museum Checkpoint Charlie, between 1945 and 1989 at the border with the Western allies and later Western German Communist authorities murdered 1841 people who tried to leave their controlled territory.
The Museum has been investigating deaths related to the border for years and every time the number of victims is adjusted.
This year, 11 more deaths were added to the list, including the inclusion of six-year-old boys who were dragged to the family in western Germany through the then Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
The Soviet deserter is also among the new victims of the Berlin Wall.
“The final damage caused by the double evil of communism and socialism has not yet been fully documented by the museum director Alexander Hildebrant.
\"Our task is to ensure that the graves of those who died in an attempt to escape from a Communist controlled country are maintained and not lost, as highlighted in the Hildebrant Communiqué.
However, other researchers have already questioned the new figures.
“The figure of 1841 is unconvincing. In an interview with Süddeutsche Zeitung, Johen Stat, expert in East German history of the University of Berlin, says.
He and other researchers from the Free University of Berlin are currently reviewing the suspected deaths at the border, and they have only been able to confirm 260 cases.
In the past, researchers estimate that only a 138 people were murdered by Communists at the Berlin Wall.
In view of those who have died in trying to escape the Baltic Sea or move to the West through the territory of neighbouring countries, the State estimates that the number of victims could reach about a thousand.
However, this remains significantly less than 1841.
One of the different causes of the number of victims could be different methodologies.
Checkpoint Charlie Museum also lists all cases of suicide by East German border guards, whether they were directly related to their service.
The museum also accounts for cases of death other than direct violence.
“If elders between 70 and 80 years of age died of heart attack, this must be the consequences of murderous boundaries, ” says Hildebrant.
However, Satan is convinced that a distinction must be made between the old folks who may have died as a result of their experience and those whose death was caused by prolonged waiting in hot weather on the bus at the border.
Irrespective of the record of its victims, it is not easy because the Communist East German authorities did not collect such statistics, and researchers should find out the documents in various scattered archives, says Statto.
However, the Satan Group has recently produced new documents and could therefore present an estimate of the number of new victims in the near future.
President of the LPF Mr. Rio went with a trainer's accreditation; that is a surprise.
In recent days, the infamous President of the Latvian Swimming Federation (LPF) Kaspars Mr. Rio de Janeiro came with a trainer's accreditation at the Olympic Games, but he feels surprised about it himself.
On Wednesday, the extensive oscillation followed the statements made by Aļona Ribakov’s coach German Jacukovsky, who found that at the last moment he decided to go to Rio de Janeiro to Sir while the coach was staying home.
Initially the list of drivers was approved by swimmers Aļona Ribakova and Uvis Kalniņš, coaches Jacukovsky and Dave Kolins, as well as president of the Federation, Mr Mr.
Five participants applied for the Latvian Swimming Federation Olympic Games, and Aldon Vrubļevskis claimed that Germans would be looking for tickets before he left.
\"However, apparently for objective reasons, he did not say to Mr when he felt that this had no effect on the outcome of Ribakova.
At the request of the Federation, Uvja’s coach undertook to help her.
Mr President, who himself is a member of the LOK Executive Committee, strongly criticised the work of the LOK for devoting blame to the Olympic sport supervisory organisation.
In my opinion, it is unethical to approve five persons at the LOK Executive Committee and not to bring one of them.
“I don’t know why there was enough room for the Flying Federation, ” Mr. said that the work of the Federation and its presidents has not been evaluated in society, reminding me that the president of the Federations is not paid.
Mr also criticised Jaculovsky himself, stating that before the London Olympics, when Riberakova had not been approved among the participants, he complained to the International Water Sport Federation (FINA) and invited Latvia not to send any athletes.
Sir, he could not tell you why he had a trainer's accreditation in the Olympic Games, and he probably had to come to Jacukovsky.
“I was applied as president of the Federation, but, for unknown reasons, received a trainer’s accreditation and now I’m nowhere to get inside.
The situation changed daily and the number of accreditations available changed.
Until the last moment, I think Germany will, because I didn't have any other information.
According to the information provided by the agency LETA, a few days before Ribakova she had a conversation with the eye Poni and her swimmer with tears in her eyes, but the president of LPF himself said that she had a everyday conversation with a desire to look forward to athletes before the start.
The Minister recalled that the LPF is supervising five sports channels that are part of the Olympic programme, and four of them provide training for children in Latvia as well.
The president of the Federation said that issues of collapsing are very important in Latvia, and he also talked about such programmes while Rio de Janeiro is almost two weeks away.
He praised the work of the Federation and said that in 2018 Latvia could solve the World Cup stage.
There is no vacation in Rio de Janeiro, I'm working here, spending my time and trying to implement four-year programmes.
There'll be 600 000 little salmon in there.
During the JSC Latvenergo's programme for the recovery of fish resources this week, in the Daugava near Mangalsala, there is taking place the purchase of salmon and straw juveniles, and this year more than 600 000 annual salmon and juveniles grown in fish farms at the Bior Tomes and Doles scientific institutes.
LETA informed the Latvian agency that the introduction of fish will continue for the following months as well: every year, 6 300 000 juveniles and larvae of different species are introduced into the water bodies of the Daugava basin.
In spring and summer 2016, the pike and negīju purs will be released, in June - bright, in July - one summer salmon, in August and in September - zandarti and vimbas.
Maris Kuņickis, Director of Latvenergo Production, told that concerns about the environment are one of the cornerstones of the sustainable development of Latvenergo Group.
“In the conservation and propagation of fish resources, every activity focuses on environmentally friendly actions, in close cooperation with the scientific institute Bior, both the growth and the introduction of juveniles in the Daugava basin and other activities,” Kunickis pointed out.
This year, more than 600 000 young salmon and tumble salmon will be released in the grim of Daugava.
For the second year, the juvenile fish are marked by cutting down the fatty tissue before it is introduced.
Today, the cargo contains 25 000 young salmon with an average weight of 31.3 grams.
Each year, scientificly based species consist of small fish and larvae in Daugava and its water bodies.
Reproduction of fish resources in Daugava and its basin water bodies is carried out by Bior in accordance with the laws and regulations on the basis of an examination of the damage caused by the economic activity of Latvenergo and on the basis of a conclusion as to what compensatory measures should be taken to ensure the diversity of fish resources.
On the other hand, the State Environmental Service shall, on the basis of the said expertise, take a decision on the extent and nature of the compensation.
The annual compensation amount for Latvenergo in the programme for the recovery of fish resources is 1 035 000 euro.
In the spring of 2016 Latvenergo, in collaboration with the association “We fish, for the fifth year there is a 400 artificial fish spawning nest in Daugava near Kaibala and Ikšķile.
Cooperation with the association in promoting the natural spawning of fish is an additional initiative supported by Latvenergo within the framework of the programme for the recovery of fish resources.
The placement of artificial spawning nests in a water storage site is an important measure that contributes to the protection and reproduction of fish resources in the Daugava.

Reids claims if Klinton is elected to the office of President, she will appoint Garland as a judge of the Supreme Court.
The leader of the Senate Party of Democrats, Harry Reids, is convinced that if she becomes President, she will appoint Merika Garland as the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.
The Republic of the Senate party has blocked the approval of Garland since March when President Obama nominated him.
The majority leader, Mitch Maconnel, told him that the next President would choose who will replace Antonin Skalia, the current Supreme Court judge.
On Thursday during his conference, Reid announced that it is sure that Garland will be chosen by Clinton.
The Reida spoke later that he had not personally talked about this subject with Clinton and that it was only speculation.
He praised Garland and said that Klinton’s team would not want to “screw a boat ” with a different choice.
Garland is the chief judge of the Appeal Court in the area of Colombia in the United States.

He also said that Trump was not suitable for the work of the President.

Greenland shark is the longest-lived backbone - video overview
Scientists claim that Greenland shark has the longest life span of all vertebrates on our planet.
Shark researcher Julius Nealens says that a long - lived record belongs to a woman who is between 272 and 512 years old and five feet [5 m] long.
The French court rejects the request for the demolishment of the jungle shops in the refugee camp.
The French court rejected the request made at Calé by the authorities to dismantle dozens of self - created shops and restaurants in the jungle camp where thousands of refugees live.
At the hearing in Kale this week, the authorities pointed out that the state would have to dismantle 72 self-established shops, where people selling various goods, such as cigarettes and energy drinks, offer hairdressing services, tea 50 cents (40p) and simple meals for some euro-self-made restaurants.
The Prefect Office held that these self-established enterprises had to be demolished because they formed a shadow economy and did not pay taxes, as well as creating fire and sanitary risks.
The humanitarian group's representatives have explained to the court that these small enterprises are essential, since the government and the food provided by the support groups do not provide for camp requirements in which the number of residents continues to grow.
They also pointed out that self-established shops and restaurants often offer free shelter and food for those who need it most.
The Lille Court ruled that there is no legal basis to expel people who have created 72 self-established shops, but it understands the concerns of the Kale Prefect.
The judge Jean-Fransu Molla said that food, coffee and restaurants play a bigger role than just providing food to people living in “excellently small conditions” –
He pointed out that these places were peaceful places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places at risk of demolition is Jungle Book Kids camp, which provides more than 200 free meals per day, English and French, and provides asylum advice to hundreds of vulnerable minors with no follow-up.
More than 170,000 people have signed petitions for the protection of the children's cafe.
The letter from the Guardian states that the liquidation of the café would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old.
On Friday, two charitable organisations, \"Help for Refugees\" and \"L'Auberge des Miigants\", reported that the number of people living in the jungle camp had risen to 9000 people, the highest since the rapid influx of migrants in summer.
The UK acquires silver regbija-7 series in battle, when the Fijian state unit masterfully wins gold.
The impressive performance of the British sample was at the end of the 7th series on Thursday when, in the exciting finish, the State Unit of Rio Fiji, in the stadium Deodoro, convincingly destroyed them with a result 43:7.
Fiji demonstrated a masterclass in the management of the ball, playing a ball with a foot, supporting the game and brutal force, fighting gold - the first Olympic medal in its history.
The British team was proud of its success in the first Olympic regba-7 tournament in which they won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The hard fight at the semi-finals, where Boxing team suffered a defeat with a score of 7:5 days in the first half of the day, may have played for the UK final.
But in any case, Fiji's team is in its best form at the moment to win the 15 men's team as well.
Although unlikely, some consolation to Britain could be the fact that at least one of the bikes got a gold medal. It is Fiji's random main coach Ben Ryan - former English coach from Wimbledon.
It was an exciting adventure for Britain.
Eight years ago, under the leadership of Ryan, they lost all the games in regbija-7 series stage in Adelaide.
This time they lost only one game.
Sakāve is painful, but growth is amazing.
Fiji proudly started a match, eliminating the British power methods of joy.
Captain Thomas Miquelam and his fellows were in touch with several racing buses and World Series champions led by 5:0 when Osea Kolinisau got the first ground.
In the last four minutes, too, Jerry Tuwa further increased his weight by spreading the ground on the right wing.
The result is 12:0 and the British team did not even really touch the ball.
Michelle’s excellent power did not allow the former Leon Nakarava to gain three points, but this had only a small impact on Fiji’s results.
Games in the seventh minute Jass Veremula got ground in the right corner, strengthening the excess over Great Britain to 17:0.
After overplay, Nakarov further increased the excess and had remained more than a minute before... the end of the first half of the time.
Vatemo Ravouvou avoided some merciless British powers and crossed over the line to gain points.
Landing provided a result at 29:0.
Fiji seemed to be born to play regba-7 match while British people were only learning.
In fact, it is also true.
The British team made a fundamental change in half time, excavating Fiji's player line... full of four minutes, which was good after the first half time, until Joshua Tuisova, after a fantastic team match, got a few more points for Fiji's team.
Dan Norton got points for the British team by making the ground in the left corner and achieving a score of 36:7, but the game was already lost, while the fans of the South Sea islanders sang, excavated flags and dance tribines.
No wonder of Fiji’s joyful attitude.
Mata William made Fiji win another sweeter with one more ground in the end of the game.
In the end of the game, Fiji was able to start celebrating, but the British were able to sit in the grass after defeat.
In the first half of the day, the semi-finals Fiji won Japan with a score of 20:5, while the British were above South Africa, where in a very strong battle both teams were caught on the ground and the South Africans lost only a few points.
In the first half of the year, Kyle Brown put the Books under the leadership of his teams, but in the second half, Dan Norton crossed the line with a glowing skill and brought the ball between the posts, ensuring the British victory.
Markus Watson, brother of England’s regbabija-15 team player Antonijah, provided the team with a victory and another silver medal at the end of the game.
The fight against cancer has inspired the victory of Helena Glover and Heteri Stanning in rowing competitions.
It will be the most emotional gold medal in these competitions, and it already makes a lot.
From the first to the last cancer, the golden moment of Helen Glover and Heteres Stanninga was of special importance on the Estacio da Lagoa track.
Although there are only two athletes in the boat, they accompanied Robin Williams' echo, which inspired her to get up to the second Olympic gold medals in the rowing women, becoming the first women in British sports history who have achieved such success.
They were undoubtedly dominated because for the 39th time they won an unsurpassed, unprecedented victory.
The two wonderful athletes with a swan elegance slip across the water surface, do not fully reflect this triumph.
There is a whole team behind each row of gold medals that are working hard to keep athletes improving their performance and making the greatest contribution to their success, who did not know 30 months ago if he would experience this day because he was found to have cancer.
According to him, it disappeared as quickly as it appeared.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of those that can be operated and it happened.
If not, it would spread throughout the body.
And the situation would become uncontrollable.
It changes your vision a little bit.
William’s cancer was detected in December 2013.
This trio was successful in launching the recovery procedure in early 2014 and in reducing the duration of the interruption to the minimum if it can be said so.
I needed income, so I needed to recover quickly.
It stimulated recovery.
I was in the hospital and I went 6, 10, and even 15 metres long distance, although the doctor said that I would have enough of a few steps.
It all started.
Airing itself is a challenge, but this time it was even greater.
After winning, the first thought immediately was about Williams, who was very worried all morning and in the excitement of speaking more than usual.
Stanning, who served as the Royal Artillery Unit in Afghanistan, said: “This was an emotionally heavy week, but it means a lot to me.
It just confirms how much that means to us and how much I, Helen and Robin, have worked.
The three years spent with Helen and Robin have been great.
Without Robin we would not have achieved anything, so huge thanks to him, he is the best coach in the world.
I can't imagine a better training mate or a better coach.
Helena Glover and Hetere Stanninga have not lost any race during the five years.
The pair reaches the huge speed the competitors can't compete with.
Even in the last 500 meters, when teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to come closer, the excess over Stanning and Glover was too high.
We felt every moment.
Helen shouted: “Keep your rhythm, keep your rhythm.
It is really important not to lose focus.
We had a good start, but at the same time we did not have high expectations.
On that day we had no intention of overturning the records, but just to break down well and win the race and we did it.
A couple of years of rest will decide what to do.
The next month will be the wedding of Glover and television adventurer Steve Bashar.
So far, she just wants to enjoy a moment.
I didn't mean to say that this was my last race.
That would have been too much pressure.
In London, I needed about six months to see that I was the Olympic champion.
That was a new experience, and I was very nervous.
This time it took about four minutes.
She said: “The feeling is fantastic...

The head of Koļegovu SRS will - move to the last head of the service
According to him, now Prime Minister Maris Kučinskim (Union of Farmers and Rural Farmers) and Minister of Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola (Union of Farmers) are already “of principle important – to approve Koļegov, a candidate nominated by the Minister of Finance, who is the head of the SRS.
Rajevskis estimates that both Kučinski and Reizniece-Ozoli in this government, the approval of the SRS manager is the first great decision – which can affect their future as politicians.
If the position is now to be changed in the choice of the head of office in the SRS, then it will have a negative impact on their expectations in the public administration.
The agenda of the next week's meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers includes the issue of the transfer of the head of the VVD to the SRS Director-General, as evidenced by the government's agenda.
Mr Reizniece-Ozola, Finance Minister, directed to the post of Head of Koļegov VIV, after Inara Pēterson withdrew from the management of the service and when the competition to the post of Director General SRS ended without result.
On Thursday, August 11, Dace Pelēka performer in the interview of Latvian Radio allowed her to stand for the position of manager if she were offered to stand for the position of manager, she could agree.
The Minister of Finance even later admitted that he was not currently considering other candidates for the post of head of the SRS.
Raivis Dzintars, Head of the Saeima Group of the National Association, also admitted that NA continues to support the SIC command of Koļegov.
In Spain, the failure to create a government is at risk of reducing the deficit.
A month ago, on 12 July, the European Commission (EC) concluded that Spain and Portugal had not taken sufficient measures to reduce their deficit to 3% of GDP required for the euro area.
The estimates show that, despite the austerity measures taken, the Portuguese deficit was 4.4% of GDP at the end of last year and 5.1% in Spain.
However, the European Commission decided not to impose economic sanctions on both countries, while at the same time setting fiscal targets for the near future.
One of the reasons why the EC did not yet introduce sanctions against these two countries is the growing Euroscepticism in many of the countries of the European Union.
Additional sanctions would only increase such a negative mood.
The critics point out, though, that the EC's decisions are inconsistent, from the outset, by agreeing on common rules and failing to apply them in practice.
Thus, for example, President of the German Bundesbank, Jens Vüdmann, pointed out that Europe was losing its trust in itself in this way, creating the perception in the population that the European Union rules were advisable and not binding.
The EC has now proposed and all Member States have approved an extension of the deadline for the deficit to the end of this year for Portugal and for Spain by 2018.
The European Commission promises to check the progress made by both countries in the coming months, while pointing out that both Spain and Portugal must be prepared to introduce additional austerity measures if circumstances so require.
Initial projections show that the objective set for Portugal could be achieved at the set time and that the budget deficit could fall to 2.5% of gross domestic product this year.
This means that, as part of the Stability Programme, the government of this country must implement austerity measures of 0.2% of GDP this year.
These measures should be included in the budget for this year, with an additional focus on the control of the costs of purchasing goods and services.
In the case of Spain, the situation is much more complex.
This year the budget deficit should be reduced to 4.6%, next year to 3.1% and to 2.2% of GDP in 2018.
In addition, consolidation measures should amount to 0.5% of GDP annually over the next two years.
The fact that, for eight months now, the Spanish political parties have failed to agree on the creation of a government is making it particularly difficult to achieve these goals, and the possibility that Spain may have to hold early parliamentary elections for the third time a year is increasing.
However, opinion polls show that the political picture of the third elections in the country would not change significantly.
The most popular party is still a party led by the current Prime Minister Mariano Rahoi, who wants less than 33% of the votes once again.
Only the socialists have developed their popularity a little, while the popularity of the party Podemos, or the party against austerity, as well as Ciudadnos, or the citizens, has decreased slightly.
The People's Party wants to get a socialist and Ciudadan to get involved in the government this month, otherwise it will not succeed in mid-October to adopt and submit to the European Commission for approval a draft budget for 2017.
As a representative of the Parliamentary Group of the People's Party, Rafael Hernando, has announced, if the government fails and the parliamentary elections are still to be held for the third time, Spain will become a whole of Europe.
Cleanness of beaches in the Gulf of Riga is critical.
In a five - year survey of the beaches, activists have concluded that the number of waste found is, unfortunately, increasing each year, and the majority of the visitors to bathing areas are responsible here.
The most contaminated bathing sites are located in Riga.
The idea of the capital city explains that bathing areas are clean every day, but it is very difficult to fight against dirty visitors.
Moreover, land-based waste can be flushed in water during rains, causing significant damage to its quality.
Apart from Liepaja beach and certain places in Kurzeme, the cleaning of beaches elsewhere in Latvia is critical.
This is what volunteers have distributed this week to my sea campaign.
As the five-year road along the Gulf of Riga, activists concluded that the population's waste per hundred meters has grown.
Unfortunately, this assessment of criticality has entered this year.
“We see that this will be a year when the number of waste on the beach of 100 meters can probably even exceed 200 units,” says the expeditions “My Sea, representative Jānis Ulme.
The Latvian Radio was called, he was on the Tūja beach, where he will continue his voluntary walk along the Gulf of Riga.
This year even daylight bulbs that are left in the mint’s sand had to be collected by activists among various municipal waste and panic remains.
The participant and organizer of the trip Ulme says that it is the people who are to blame for the pollution.
“The main source is the beach’s own visitors, since more than half of the total waste is plastic, various waste materials, starting with bags, plastic pieces that are already in the process of degradation, can no longer be identified, and we can no longer identify them, and weeds, bottles, corks, say Ulme.
There are also bathing sites in Riga among the dirty beaches.
For example, almost 800 pieces of waste were collected on average in Daugavpils every 100 meters, which is critical.
The organisers of the campaign also explain that there are also bandages and warning or warning signs not everywhere.
\"The average figures for all three bathing areas of Riga together - Daugavgrīva, Evening Balls and Olders - unfortunately turn out to be large and far beyond the desired or goal, which Latvia is supposed to move forward, to reduce the number of waste units to 135 units by 2020.
Cleaning of bathing sites in Riga takes place every day, during the hot summer days even twice, explains the representative of the City Council Uģis Jūrkis.
However, the struggle with dirty visitors is rather difficult.
We are returning to the issue of the culture of these people.
“For those who eat, drink alcohol, smoke and do all the things they cannot, even special signs do not work,” says Vidikis.
Therefore, Vidkis invites visitors to report pollutants to the police as well.
The police can be called, they can be safe to point out these violations and thus to fight everyone.
Some new warnings may be imposed, but as I said, it is unlikely that this will radically change the situation.
“Like everyone together, we just have to approach and be intolerant to such wrongdoers, he emphasises.
Meanwhile, measurements of water quality have been made this summer for the fourth time by the Health Inspectorate, which can ban official bathing sites.
This year, like other years, the quality of water is good and satisfactory everywhere.
At the moment, the situation is that in all 56 bathing sites the quality of water has always been good and there are no restrictions on swimming.
“For the last time we take the analysis at the end of August, ” says the expert of the inspection on environmental health, Normunds Kadiķis.
During heavy rains, waste on land may be rinsed with water.
This, in turn, may affect its quality, and the environmental specialist shall be indicated.
Rotations in the Russian elite continue - change of head of Putin administration.
Lost his own job?
Vladimir Putin announced to the Russian media that Sergey Ivanov wanted to leave this post himself and will continue to be the President's special representative for nature protection, environment and transport.
In notification of the changes, Putin gave the following words to Ivanov before TV cameras: “We work together with you and you for many years and do it successfully.
I am pleased with how you carry out your duties.
I remember well our agreement not to use you in this post of Presidential Administration for more than four years.
That is why I understand your desire to change the field of activity.
And I hope that you will also make full use of your knowledge and experience in the new post.
However, it is stressed that the President's administration is a very important position and it made Ivan one of the most influential people in the country.
Given that the elections of the State Council are expected to take place in Russia next month, the rumours eliminated that this step was related to the fight for power in the Russian political elite.
Ivanov was also called a potential president of Putin's alternative, so the claim that he himself wanted to be a President's representative in the field of nature and transport cast doubt.
According to the archives of Lsm.lv, Ivanov is the General Assembly of the KGB and the Federal Security Service.
Ivanov was an old and close associate of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He started his activities in October 1975, where he met Putin.
Later, Putin became the head of the Federal Security Service, Ivanov became his deputy.
On the other hand, the first Russian President, Boris Yeltsin, was designated to be the Secretary of the Russian Security Council at the end of the reign.
In 2000, after Putin came to power, the information security doctrine, developed by Ivanova, was confirmed, which included the revitalisation of state censorship mechanisms in Russia.
In 2001, Sergey Ivanov became the Minister of Defence of Russia, but already in 2005 he was Deputy Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov and was responsible for the development of Russian defence companies and arms exports.
Now, after leaving the Head of the President's Administration, Ivanov will also remain on the Russian National Security Council, where the new Head of the President's Administration, Vaino, will also work.
Wino comes from the family of the Soviet party in the elite.
The position of the Head of the President's Administration, Vaino, is recommended by Ivanov himself.
Anton Edwardovich and I have been known for a long time.
Still from the time you led our work in the government.
And for the last almost five years, we have met practically every day.
“So I’m sure, after all his professional and personal qualities, he’s ready for this job, ” said Ivanov.
Areno comes from a family belonging to the elite of the Soviet Party.
His grandfather Karl took high positions in the Estonian Communist Party, including her first secretary for 10 years until 1988.
The Internet edition Meduza, a reference to the book Estonia’s self-determination and independence, writes that at the end of the 1980s Karl Vaino asked Moscow to give permission to use force against demonstrators.
However, he was refused and lost in office shortly.
Shortly thereafter, Vaino has moved to Moscow.
Anton Vaino has graduated the Moscow Institute of International Relations and manages Japanese.
However, he has left the diplomatic service to work in the administration of the President's minutes.
It has already been said that Russia's last unsavory has been shocked by the suspension of several high-ranking officials and even arrests, including the replacement of several district governors and federal representatives.
According to politicians, President Putin rearranges the ruling elite before the 2018 elections.
One of the main features is that representatives of force structures are increasingly present at the top positions.
Also judo fighter Nikiforenko loses his first fight in the Olympic Games.
This was a battle in the first round, and the Latvian judo fighter has finished his participation in the Olympic Games, finalizing in 17th place.
Coach Oleg Baskin acknowledged Latvian Television that Nikiforenko had had very little hope, and that was already clear before the race.
He also revealed that he had suffered a shoulder injury.
Significantly, Nikiforenko had to enter a different weight category than usual - namely, in weight category up to 100 kilograms - in order to get to the Olympic Way.
Azerbaijan’s canton was more severe than 25 pounds [25 kg].
It has already been said that Jevgenij Borodavko fought in weight categories of up to 100 pounds [100 kg] against Rjunosuki for two and a half minutes, until the enemy succeeded in a pure victorious ejection.
As a result, Latvia has finished the judo competition in Rio.
Dreams disappear in Rio sand.
On Thursday, Jūdist Jevgenij Borodevko entered.
Yes, he had a more titled opponent, but an ambitious man can at times surprise him.
He didn't.
Artūras Nikiforenko’s mission was even more complex, because experience was smaller and the opponent was also respectable.
The result is similar, although he stayed on a tattoo for almost one and a half minutes longer than in Borodavko.
Unfortunately, the Latvian judyists have recently suffered the greatest loss of ambition.
Since the leadership of the Federation, Gunārs Širsons and his financial stand Vladimir Šestakovs left Latvia, Aleksandrs Jackevičs, no longer happens – Golden Score – the development of the jute goes down a downward curve.
Jackevich, who advises the Jediists of Kazakhstan, and Vsevold Zelon is not able to see the heirs.
But if you don't raise it, you won't.
And that's the prerogative of the Federation.
Therefore, as from another galaxy-Rite panorama, the promise of the President of the Latvian Judo Federation to win the medals by Rio was heard.
Flight far from reality.
In the evening we looked forward to the beach volleyball May Samoilov/Smaid - Evandru/Pedru Solberg.
Intriga, as a group, losers in the game ended.
Although the Latvian duet had a small derogation - could lose, but with no more than four points in two sets.
The tension was still grown in the long previous game.
No one wanted to die - this feeling over the windy card turned over the entire purse.
The dive wind created additional complications for players.
At first it seemed to be our more comprehensive ally.
But he wasn't.
Against the Latvian duet to play here was quite simple.
Serve so much to Samoilov and wait for him to break.
Kanada would break up against Cuba at the end of his first son and at the beginning of the third, because the load was not funny.
At that time, the rod could have been used to fishing because of the little work, but when it was, it was done in honor.
Samoilov and the Brazilians could be defeated in two faces, for the first took the lead at 16:15, but for 16 the lost point limit remained.
But it could also be lost by 0:2, because the second sixth deficit was -4, but also thanks to the wind, it succeeded in winning.
The third had already flowed through the Evandrs cellar.
The chain was built - unconvinced service, the second hand often flies too close to the network and Samoilov remained very low for a performance attack.
If a foreign Samoilov was a cube, he was more successful this time, and he would be unprofessional with only Sasha.
The Creilla also made a mistake, and quite symbolicly, that the last block of the ball tripled directly on him.
The team is down.
This time definitely lacked success - in the third place only two Evandrus attacks nearly flew out of the card, but the ball did hit the line.
Two travels were next to the line.
The contentious episodes also made a video decision in favour of opponents.
If Evandr used serves in the first two games, they were very productive.
All went together to lose on the tab.
Now the causes of the failure need to be calmly analysed.
Maybe you should have lived like many next to the stadium, not together with a delegation in the Olympic village.
Two and a half hours went on the road.
Perhaps a bit of self-confidence was given by a series of seven semi-finals.
Maybe Klagenfurt didn't have to play, but rather come here and acclimatize.
Maybe there was a mistake with finding a top sports grounds.
So far, more questions than answers.
It's over for our two guys.
The dream of medals is over.
What's next?
There are still some World Cup tournaments left, and Jurmala-Masters-
Samoilov and I have never been friends or friends in life because of the very differences in personality.
But that is not necessary either.
When you have a dream of Olympic medals, you might think of divorce, because it will be found not only in yourself but also in your partner.
Distinguishing is not difficult, but it will be much more difficult to find a worthy partner in Latvia.
Both brothers are playing beech, but John and Tom have already tried and divorced, while Mikhail Samoil Samoil is still too green to start conquering the world's peaks.
You can try Harald Reggio, Alexander Solovey, Edgar Toču, back to Martin Plaviņa, but it will not be better than this option, which confirmed itself at the World Cup stages more than once.
The Copacabana sand didn't smile to them this time.
That's it.
Of course, consideration should also be given to the fact that beach volleyball is becoming more popular, that new couples enter circulation, and only the rare size is less than two meters.
This does not yet guarantee success, but is an essential argument in the fight for victory.
We don't stay any longer.
Both athletes and journalists have the opportunity to stay in the places offered by game operators, as well as to choose their own.
The U.S. basketball team lives on a cruise ship, and some tennisists do not stay in the Olympic village.
Also a part of the beach volleyball has found a hotel in Koakabane.
This time, prices for rather modest accommodation offered to journalists were greatly exaggerated.
Therefore, the choice fell to the rent of the apartment.
The risk is that sometimes it may be inconvenient from a logistics point of view.
This time the risk is justified.
Together with Vladimir Vladimirovich rent apartments on the border with Koakabana and Ipanema.
Beach at 200 meters, bikini arena half an hour's walk.
The district is pretty sure, because the bed of the favela, but the loss of alertness must not be found here.
Vladimir Vladimirovič is not what he imagines at once, but the professional sports journalist in Russian media Vladimir Ivanov.
P.S. It looks like another dream of medals was dreamed on Friday morning.
During the 100 meter race and high climb, Laura Ikauniece-Admidiņa left her personal record.
But there are already five disciplines.
After a 10-year break, Porgis and Bessa sound in Liepaja.
Opera “Porgy and Bess” in Latvia was the first experience in 1973 at the Latvian National Opera.
Since then, the internationally recognised masterpiece has not been once again led.
That is why the organisers of the Cēsu Art Festival and Liepaja Art Forum decided in close cooperation to give the audience the opportunity to enjoy George Gēršvina's masterpiece.
“It is a great pleasure that after ten years of break, when the last time Liepaja was able to enjoy the performance, this wonderful version of the opera concert hall by George Gēršvina-Porgi and Besa is enjoyed by us at the new, newly-covered concert hall, “Big amber”, says the concert hall “Big amber – head Baiba Bože.
Opera \"Porgy and Bess\" is a bright story of love, volatility, passion, as well as domestic tragedies and simple daily joys, expressed in musical language.
It reflects the African American vitality, music, and rhythm.
It is this lack of political correctness in this opera, this tolerance exclusion makes it so alive.
“And yes, this love story is extremely powerful, extremely beautiful and, in some way, really deep, says director Viesturs Kairišas.
What I like most, - listening to or playing this opera, there are always stops - famous melodies, famous motifs, but these transitions from one kind to another, lighting one personality or another's personality, or choirs or orchestras.
“It’s the most exciting, this construction – opera is appreciated by opera “Porgis and Bessa, music director and conductor Andris Poga for the concert.
The visitors to the operation agree that this is a grand event.
They have great joy to hear this world famous Guschvin opera.
Happy you can feel the breath of the world in Liepaja.
“The performance professional – the opera is appreciated by visitor Edgars Lamas.
The concert was special because for the first time the orchestra played an orchestra and the opera concert was held for the first time at the new concert hall.
The square at the building of the Museum of Art could be named after Janis Rozentāls.
The Vice President of Riga Andris Ameriks during the opening of the Rozenthal anniversary exhibition told us that in the future, the museum's own address may not be the square of 10a Krišjānis Valdemāra iela, but Janis Rozentāls's square.
Museum director Māra Lāce acknowledged that re-registration of the address would create a heavy bureaucratic burden, but in general this idea is welcomed and therefore agreed with the local government proposal.
The city of Riga has put a kind of foundation to this idea in 1936, creating a monument of Burkardas Dzins to Janis Rozentāls who stands near the museum.
The museum director Wilhelm Purvitis was one of the initiators for the creation of this monument.
In this way, this further action could be purely logical.
I have a little conscience all the time - but Wilhelm Purveitis, where are we going to put his name?
\"But if you, Mr. America, you promise to think about it,\" said Lāce.
It is reported that the National Museum of Art's building, after major reconstruction and modernisation, officially opened its doors this May.
This week, the VEF Culture Palace will finally start reconstruction.
About €11 million will be renewed by SIA “Velve”
It is planned to renovate several rooms of the castle, including two audiences, as well as to adapt the building to people with reduced mobility.
Riga City Council intends to attract money from the European Union funds of six million euros, however, the director of the Property Department of Riga City Council Oļegs Burovs admits that the project is not yet fully clear as European funds.
\"Even though the political will to launch the repairs of the VEF Culture Castle by attracting European Structural Funds is, we are waiting months for a decision, real action from officials of the Ministry of Finance, money will be given or not, says Burov.
Last December, we were told that everything depended on Brussels.
Two weeks ago, the Ministry of Finance received a letter from the European Commission that it was up to you to decide that Brussels was not taking a decision here.
At the moment we see that another circle of discussions is being formed again, well, then we will see what we can expect in the coming days.
“I must say that Riga City Council is sure that this process will be started and completed within the deadlines – says Burovs.
It has already been reported that more than a year ago, in March 2015, VEF Culture Palace collectively held a show of entrance before the renovations of the building to be expected.
Although a year has passed, the renovation of the building has still not started and the work of the team has continued in inappropriate circumstances.
In strategy of the Property Department of Riga City Council, the renovation of the VEF Culture Castle has been divided into seemingly independent reconstruction works, where each will ensure the implementation of different functions of the castle.
The first is to increase the accessibility of the VEF Culture Palace and the improvement of the surrounding area.
It is intended to arrange the surroundings and engineering communications, as well as restore the building façade.
Second - improving the supply of the services of the VEF Culture Palace.
It plans restoration of interior, walls and ceilings of the building, improvement of studio of stage and sound recordings, as well as arrange internal engineering communications of the building.
Third - improving the working conditions of creative amateur collectives, which includes plans to improve workshop equipment, space heating and ventilation systems.
Before the Līvs – the legendary band of 40th anniversary can be found in the exhibition in Liepaja.
The exhibition will show various “Līvās” characterizing objects - photographs arranged on the time line to reflect the group’s activities from the beginning until 2010, when the group’s activities are announced.
At the same time, the participants’ stage costumes, musical instruments, awards and concert recordings will be shown, as well as other things not yet seen to the wider public, which reflected the creative activity of the group Live.
The exhibition will be supplemented with objects from Liepaja Museum's collection.
The visual presentation of the exhibition was created in cooperation with the fashion artist and painter Elita Patmalienė.
Musicians who were associated with the group Livs and their relatives also responded to the call and shared both objects and memories.
“Līvu – earlier search is taking place in 1972, when a vocal instrumental ensemble was created at Liepaja Culture House, led by Juris Pavetols.
Ensemble has participated in the festival «Liepājas amber» in 1972 and 1974, as well as city and Republic shows.
A fateful meeting took place in 1976 when Juris Patītols met Ēriks Ķģelis and founded a group in Metalurgs Culture Palace, inviting him to join Ingrid Gūtmanis, Andris Kruzins and Jānis Grodumu.
Over the years, the composition of the group has not taken place once.
The participants have joined, others have gone their way, some have returned.
However, the most important thing is that the desire to show that Latvian rock music is able to live and exist remains stable.
“What to see was not lacking – jeansosties, mates, and barbers, these boys were quite different from the stereotype of the usual delicacy singer – the music viewer, Clās Vāvere, says about the group.
In addition to the above-mentioned musicians there have been outstanding musicians such as Igo, Vilnis Krieviņš, Modris Šterns, Valdis Štarks, Laimis Rācēkavas, Laimis Puzbarnieks, Ainars Virga, Aivars Brīze, Guntars Mucenieks, Dainis Virga, Tomass Kleins and many others.

For the first time in 8 months, Bulgaria has seen inflation.
In July, Bulgarian national statistics showed 1% of monthly inflation.
It is the highest indicator since 2012 and the first indicator above zero since October of last year when it was positive (0.2%).
Average annual inflation after PCI, in the last 12 months (August 2015-July 2016), compared to the previous year, was -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 was 101.9% compared to the previous year and average monthly inflation was 1.0%.
Since the start of the year, inflation has been -0.2% in July 2016 compared to December 2015) and annual inflation in July 2016 -0.2% compared to July 2015.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016 there was an increase in prices for the following groups of consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); entertainment and cultural events (6.3%); hotels and restaurants (1.2%); domestic goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell for clothing and footwear (2.2%); household appliances, household appliances and regular house cleaning (0.5%); health (0.1%).

Zbigniew Stankevich: Now is the time, and the truth is raised.
In an interview with the Latvian Catholic Church Archbishop metropolitanist Zbigniew Stankevičius, the Independent stresses that if we want to gain strength in life, the Gospel message should be placed in its centre.
For the power of truth is greater than the darkness of evil.
Many are already on the way to the Most Holy Virgin Mary worship at Aglona.
What message will believers receive there this year?
In recent years, the desire to lead the chief church service at Aglona has been expressed by Pope Nunzie.
The main message, therefore, is in his hands.
The fact that the Cross's way is led by Bishop Jānis Bulis is also about some sort of tradition.
He will also make his own message.
I run the festival service the previous day.
Last year, I focused on Pope Francisco Encyclics, Laudato sis, and brought up the common house, the theme of Earth in the context of Latvia.
This year... Of course, I'm watching what's happening in the world, and I'm trying to respond to it in my address.
My approach coincides with the church's suggestion that the Gospel message should be placed in the center of life.
It must be shown that the Gospel responds to the most painful problems of human life and gives him inspiration for the way forward.
Then it speaks to people.
But in the debate in Cēsis, you said that “the whole person should return to an understanding...
What do you understand?
Does this mean that a person is turning away from the church’s message?
And does the church have such a resource of return today?
The capital of India was surrounded by a man dying on the road.
In India's capital, nobody seemed to know that a man dying on the side of the road is dying - he had an hour lying on the side of the road and was still robbed, informs the BBC.
A man who was identified as Matibules reportedly drived the Ricky in the day, but worked at night as a guard.
5:30 a.m., he went home on the road when he was hit by a light car.
The record of the surveillance cameras shows that the driver would get out of the car to look at the victim, and then he left.
An hour later, when no one seemed to know about the bleeding man, he was robbed by a garner.
About 90 minutes after the incident, the police arrived and the victim hospitalized where the injuries died.
With reference to the position of the Director General of the State Revenue Service (VID), Inga Koļegova, Head of the State Environmental Service, has rescued the government from falling, a Associated Professor of the Faculty of Social Sciences of the University of Latvia Ojārs Skudra is considered.
An explanation by Kosovo of the withdrawal of the candidature in relation to the conflict in the ruling coalition is to be attributed to the fact that she has prevented the government from falling.
In a conversation with the agency LETA, he said that it was hard for him to imagine that he would support the candidacy of Kosovo at a government meeting next week, United States.
Hence, if the United Nations were to vote against the ministers, but Koļegov was still approved as such, it would lead to a government demise.
The expert also considers that prior to the announcement of the nomination, Koļegova has consulted both the Minister of Finance Dan Reizniece-Ozolas and Prime Minister Maris Kučinski.
At the same time, it is also a concessions to the United States, which stood firm against her candidacy.
In predicting whether a suitable candidate could be found through a competition, Skudra acknowledged that there were two options: either a compromise figure will be selected, or the institution will continue to run the Dace Pelēka as the executive director-general.
At the same time, he points out that, if the Minister of Finance has so far stated that another candidacy has not been examined, it is a hint to Greyy that it cannot participate in the contest.
LETA has already stated that the head of the State Environmental Service, Koļegova, has decided to withdraw his candidacy for the post of Director General of the SRS.
The Government suspended the approval of Kosovo as Director-General of the MED for Tuesday as a reason for its objections.
Following the Government's decision to postpone the decision to postpone the decision, Koļegova confirmed that it was still ready to become the head of the SRS.
However, later her thoughts changed - in her application Friday to the Minister of Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola, she pointed out that she withdrew her consent to transfer to the head of the SRS position and that she was not an easy choice.
The press secretary of Prime Minister Mara Kučinska to the agency Andrejs Vaivars explained that a new competition will be held for the vacant post of the SRS Director General.
An accident involving a police car took place in the centre of Riga.
A road traffic accident involving a state police car occurred in the centre of Riga this afternoon.
The police car with turned on sound and light signals has rushed to the top of the call until the intersection of Krišjānis Barona and Dzirnavu Street with another car.
The police explain the circumstances, but the initial information indicates that the other driver has not missed the police car.
There was a woman who suffered the accident.
This year the number of inhabitants in Riga has fallen
At the beginning of this year there were 638 784 inhabitants in Riga, which is 0.34% less than in 2015, when 641 000 inhabitants were officially registered in the capital, the agency LETA was informed by the Central Statistical Office (CSB).
In terms of the population, the capital of Latvia stands 30th place between the capitals of the European Union (EU) and the large cities with a population of over one million.
According to data from the EU Statistical Office, Eurostat, there is the highest proportion of women in Riga - the capital of Latvia is convincingly the first place among the major cities of Europe, with 127 women per 100 men.
All three capitals of the Baltic States have the highest proportion of women in major European cities: 123 in Vilnius, 121 women per 100 men in Tallinn.
A warning pictogram shall be placed at the LNMM.
In the coming days, warning signs - pictograms will be placed at the National Museum of Art of Latvia (LNMM), LETA, representative of the Property Department of Riga City Council, Baiba Gailīte told the agency.
The damage caused by skateboards’ activities has now been successfully closed in the museum’s glasshouse.
In the coming days, an alarm pictogram will be placed at it.
It will tell people that the surface can be slippery rain, snow, cars should not travel through it, as well as bikes, rollers, and skateboards.
Ušakovs also wrote about this social network, which said that no safety risks would be caused, but that it would not be possible to look like non-curised and skateboarded.
Holidays for children and parents in Riga are new playgrounds for children.
This summer the municipality of Riga installed two new playgrounds in the city, Kipsala and Čiekurkalns, which are already available for children.
A large, multifunctional toy ship with various climbing elements, bridges, games, rubies and slides is installed on the beach of Ķīpsala.
The play area is intended for children of all ages.
The field also includes swings and various balancing elements.
The fantasy world provides small sailors with a spot on the banks of Daugava with a view to the port of passengers and cruise ships visible there.
On the other hand, a playing house, trampoline, step track, balance bridge, swings, play bombs and other elements of play, as well as a gymnastics area with rounds of force and coordination training, co-ordinates etc. are built in the playground.
The rubber cover is covered under the area in different colours.
To the playground from the street is a new, colorful pavement.
The trees reveal a reconstructed section of the road.
The Minister of Transport Uldis Augulis, the management of SJSC Latvian National Roads (LVC), as well as representatives of the construction companies SIA “Binders” and municipalities today opened the Russian border of the reconstructed main road (Grebņeva) -Rēzekne-Daugavpils-Lithuanian border (Medumi) (A13) from Medums to the Lithuanian border (156,-163,05 km).
Roads are a national business card, especially border roads, so special satisfaction is to discover a reconstructed section on the border with our southern neighbours.
This is another example of the fact that the situation on national major roads is improving thanks to the co-financing of European Union funds.
“As the forecasts show, the funds available to roads during this programming period will be learned already in 2018, and we have to think about how to continue maintaining the most heavily loaded roads in very good quality, and also to ensure citizens' mobility in all regions of Latvia without funding from the European Union – by turning the symbolic tape stressed by Uldis Augulis.
The Minister of Transport also pointed out that the proposals made by traffic experts on sustainable financing of the roads of Latvia in the near future will be presented to the government.
During the construction phase from Medums to the Lithuanian border (156.4-163,05. km) Bender started last year and this year they continued after the technological break.
The costs of reconstruction are €13.5 million (including VAT) and the project was co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
“The reconstructed road has been fully refurbished and repair works will be started next year from Medumi to Daugavpils itself, thus the whole road from the Lithuanian border to Daugavpils will be arranged – the Chairman of the Board of LVC Jānis Lange informed.
The country's main roads are most heavily burdened, and by 2018, we intend to get all the country's main roads in good condition.
The next task will be to maintain them of good quality, providing timely maintenance and replacing asphalt surfaces every 7-9 years.
“This will, of course, require appropriate funding, and all travelers look forward to the proposals made by the expert group to regularise the road financing system,” noted Lange.
Within the framework of the project arranged road connections and lighting in the Honey Centre.
Significant ground works have been carried out: in four stages large-scale dewatering and large-scale excavation and submersible works, smoothed longitudinal profile of the road, which so far was very uneven.
Also public transport stops have been restored and the turnaround area for public transport has been refurbished.
In the past, the road had insufficient carrier capacity, and the terrain was not transparent due to the mountain valleys, as well as the old road was common terrain.
In the next construction season, the road section from Daugavpils city border is scheduled to be refurbished (144,80-156,40 km).
This year LVC plans to carry out different types of works on more than 1 100 km of national road.
Information on all repairs planned on the road network is available on the LVC website www.lvcli.lv this year.
“In order to achieve the desired weight reduction results, the right choice of food combinations – recognized by Lithuanian dietologist Laura Romeraite-Kuklieriene is very important.
It is also easy to do during the summer season when our gardens grow fresh fruits, berries, and vegetables.
A balanced combination of nutritional products can not only help to reduce excess weight, but also purposefully promote various body processes.
Macaroni and vinegar are a successful combination because it provides a lasting taste and helps fight fat.
The studies published in the European Clinical Nutrition Journal have shown that the vinegar has a beneficial effect on blood glucose levels and helps us feel the tongue.
The cayenne pepper and protein-rich food, such as poultry or protein cocktail, creates not only a sense of sata, but also reduces the desire for meals to come.
This combination of food can also increase calorie burn after a meal up to 35%.
Research has shown that cayenne pepper can help to get rid of fat in the abdomen.
Eggs contain the metabolic enhancer-choline, while paprika is a good source of vitamin C.
Taking a sufficient amount of this nutrient can reduce cortisol levels, leading to a build-up of fat around the middle of the body.
The oat flaked butter, with the added fresh berries, is another delicious meal and fat-burning meal for breakfast, worth to be included in your menu.
Oat flakes and berries contain fibers, which, according to Canadian scientists' findings, control the sense of gel - appetite stimulating hormone - and thus hunger.
In addition, berries contain polyphenols, which are aids in weight reduction, and do not allow fat formation.
Vegetables and proteins are also able to accomplish miracles in weight reduction.
The combination can make you feel satine.
The vegetables contain water and fibers, so they contribute to the feeling of satain.
At the same time, proteins slow down the digestive process and give the diet a longer period of time.
For lunch you can eat chicken with salads or prepare a protein cocktail from the finished mixture and enjoy it with your favorite vegetables.
Avoid some combinations of products.
Fruits have sugars - monosaccharides or disaccharides - compounds of one or two molecules.
On the other hand, starch in gardens is polysaccharide.
The fruits break down mechanically into the stomach, while chemically they do not break down until they reach the third or fourth degree of digestive process that takes place in the gut.
The starch breaks down into three different stages, which start already in the mouth.
It is therefore essential not to eat the sweet meal immediately after a meal.
When eating fresh food after a meal, it is blocked in the stomach with other foods, where it is not chemically digested and starts to rot.
Don’t eat bread, potatoes, peas, bananas, date or other carbohydrates with lemons, lime, oranges, grapefruit, pineapples or other acidic fruits.
The enzyme ptialine, which is found in saliva, works only in an alkaline environment.
Fruitic acids inhibit not only the digestation of carbohydrates but also contribute to their fermentation.
Do not eat eggs and meat, nuts and meat, cheese and eggs or cheeses and nuts, meat and milk, eggs and milk or nuts and milk and similar combinations of protein-rich products in one meal.
Processing requires a variety of digestive juices, each of them with different strengths, features and timing to come into the stomach.
Water, honeymelone, moussemelone, and other melons should always be eaten separately from other foods.
Melons are not digested if they are in the stomach with other foods.
Fat in combination with protein-rich products.
Fat makes up a successful combination with starch, but the same cannot be said about fat and proteins - fat prevents protein digesting.
Proteins can be combined with very small amounts of fat.
If a large amount of protein-containing products are consumed, avoid using fat altogether.
This also applies to stunning - it is not recommended to combine large amounts of nuts (contains proteins) with a healthy avocado (contains fat).
This combination inhibits effective weight management.
How to prepare better?
“Food preparation, thermal treatment leads to significant nutrient loss – about 15% to 55% of the products’ initial nutrient composition – says dietologist.
In most cases nutrients go into loss by cooking foods in water.
However, the nutritional value of some foods increases when cooked directly.
It is recommended that the liquid remaining after vegetable cooking be used for soup preparation - in this case, do not lose the nutrients remaining in the water and can be eaten later.
It is recommended to prepare the vegetables, including by evaporation.
Thermal treatment significantly increases the bioavailability of lycopene in tomato products.
The amount of lycopene is increased by 25% when tomatoes reach 30 minutes.
The heat treatment also significantly increases the bioavailability of betacarotene found in red, yellow and orange plants such as tomatoes, carrots, sweet potatoes and spinach.
The heat treatment of eggs and meat removes the natural properties of proteins present in them, making them more digestable.
Similarly, thermal treatment of meat and eggs makes the iron and other minerals contained in these products easier to absorb in the body.
It should also be borne in mind that the freezing of the products may reduce the vitamin C content from 10% to 90%, but the freezing of the fibre does not affect it.
Beans in combination with tomatoes may increase the intake of iron in the body, which in turn ensures better brain and muscle function.
Our body hosts up to 33% less non-bleeding iron present in plant products such as beans, leaf greens, cereal products than bloody iron found in animal products such as beef, fish and chicken.
You can significantly increase the absorption of non-blooding iron in your body by using foods containing non-blooding iron with vitamin C sources such as oranges, tomatoes and berries.
Vitamin C helps to change the non-blooding iron so that our body absorbs it more easily.
Iron is needed for the production of haemoglobin that provides oxygen in the muscles and brain.
To get the maximum benefit from salads, add healthy fats such as olives or linseed oil to them.
When preparing the sandwiches with salmon, add to vitamin D rich salmon or sardines an additive yogurt, which is a good source of calcium.
Vitamin D increases the amount of calcium absorbed in the gut and plays an important role in the formation of bone.
Oats (as well as other whole grain products) together with vitamin C sources such as strawberries, trout, raspberries and other fruits or berries help stabilise cholesterol levels and avoid obstruction of the arteries.
Snapchat-Anime – the effect is criticised for Asian warring
Snapchat’s representatives say that this filter has inspired the animation, but some commentators claim it is racistly insensitive.
With this lens effect, Snapchat lets 150 million users daily in a rather absurd manner change reality and play with their identity.
You can turn yourself into an pineapple, a dog or an image that would fit in the painting of Roja Lihštenstein.
Lens are vague, image-distorting instruments that generate more than 30 million modified selfsales per day.
Any error shall rapidly become apparent to the public.
The effects of Snapchat lens have been criticised before, receiving accusations that the application promotes too blackish or light facial skin tones as a standard of perfect beauty.
This week, new lens effects were published, allowing users to create division eyes, dissipation teeth and round cheeks, and some critics described it as a racist Asian cartoon – the yellow face.
The same question was raised as to whether such contradictions did not indicate that the company had greater problems with diversity.
News and the public trouble flared up on Wednesday when the publications \"The Verge\" and \"Mothboard\" told us that the lens effects had been removed from the application.
The company explained that the aim of the lens was to depict the images of Anime, not to hang on people of Asian origin.
However, these effects reflected the painful stereotypes of those who experienced racism.
Others categorized the parable of Anime.
The picture record of American art students Greissa Sparapani Twitter received a lot of resonance. In her e-mail she says that the lens's effects were offensive and uncomfortable, not to say more.
She added that it was difficult not to notice the obvious similarities between Asian cartoons and lens effects.
This suggests that the lens effect is not just a yellow face, but a yellow face in terms of racism.
Snapchat is not the only company that falls into these cultural traps.
American culture is also involved in the endless fight for diversity and inclusion, ranging from company meetings to Hollywood and devices we use every day.
And Snapchat, a large audience of young people who represent different races, unlike older people, is more sensitive to such things.
If Snapchat’s lenses create an image that offends users, then “they don’t notice these things today, ” Katie Jou, 25 years old, expressed her response on Thursday.
On Thursday, the company’s “Medium” product manager, Jou, deletes its Snapchat app and advised others to do likewise.
In her article “Medium, ” and her phone interview, she explained that in her opinion, the problems associated with race arise because of Snapchat’s employment policy, which does not sufficiently support racial diversity.
Jou was criticised by the company’s management, which consists mainly of white men and then concluded its article with a reference #DeleteSnapchat.
“It means that there is no racial diversity in the company, so such decisions are allowed. Is there some people from other races working in the company, but they do not take a position that is safe and convenient to express their opinion, says the Chinese American Joe.
Others share her view, while Snapchat did not respond to her complaint.
The company does not disclose how many different races represent the employees, indicating that it is a private company.
Snapchat refused to discuss the origin of its employees, but its representative found that the company had set off a staff member who would focus on also representing racial minorities that were not widely represented and would promote integration into the company.
On the other hand, Jou will not renew his Snapchat account by saying: “I mean if they really need more users like us to understand that it is not right.
The Congress Chamber declares that military officials have distorted reports on the Islamic State.
In a note published on Thursday, the Congress Chamber notes that the U.S. Central Command has amended the reports by depicting the war against the Islamic country in Iraq and Syria that is much more optimistic than it is.
The analysts of the Central Command Intelligence Service express their general dissatisfience with the interim report of the Task Force Team established by the Committee on Armed Forces, the Intelligence Committee and the Defence Financing Sub-Committee, indicating that their leadership controlled reports on American success in the fight against the Islamic State.
The Central Command, known as Centcom, is a military base in Tampere, Florida, which oversees US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The latest news on this report is that intelligence reports, approved by the Centcom leaders, reflect the US fight against terrorism more positive than is the case. The facts were regularly distorted, reflecting better achievements than other intelligence analyses have shown.
Ken Calverts, a representative of the Republic of California, says: “Centcom’s actions are unacceptable: our soldiers are those who suffer if our policy-makers receive false reports,”
The Centcom management errors can be found under the top management of the organisation.
This 10-page report reflects in detail the ongoing challenges in the presentation and analysis of the Central Command of the American efforts to prepare the Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
Although this does not provide irrefutable evidence that older officials of the Obama administration would have distorted their reports, it shows that the management of Centcom has put some pressure on analysts to illustrate the more optimistic view of the threats posed by the Islamic State (also known as ISIS or ISIL).
The report indicates that in the first half of 2015 the press releases, statements and reports of the Central Government represented the situation in a much more positive light to Congress than it was in fact.
For example, Centcom's representatives publicly announced that Mosulas's recovery operation could start already in April or May 2015.
Mosula is Iraq's second largest city, which is still under the control of the Islamic State.
Mike Pompeo, a representative of the Republic of Kansas Party, reports: “The investigation over the last few months clearly confirms this:
Between mid-2014 and mid-2015, central officials of the U.S. Central Authority modified their reports, depicting the threat of ISIS to Iraq weaker than it was in fact.
The Republican Party set up a working group to find out that analysts are concerned that information on the Islamic country is being distorted.
As the investigation continues, the report published on Thursday will follow new findings in this case.
The General Inspection of the Ministry of Defence shall investigate Centcom's intelligence activities.
On Thursday, members of the Democratic Party of the Intelligence Committee made their own report in which they agree with certain conclusions of the Working Party of the Republic of Lithuania.
In his report, Centcom too restricted the preparation of intelligence assessments in relation to ISIS and Iraq's Security Forces from 2014 to 2015.
Mr. Schiff explains that this process –stopped the dissemination of information – deteriorated the ethics of the work of analysts and - spread false facts –
But the members of Shif and the Democratic Party added that there is no evidence that the White House has put pressure on the Centcom analysts to produce reports, according to a pre-defined or political position.
The Daily Best published the preliminary results of the convention investigation on Thursday.
In August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon General Inspection had opened an investigation into complaints from the analysts of Centcom.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evan announced that the Pentagon would not comment on the convention report until the investigation continues.
He also added that experts sometimes interpret complex data in different ways, and the Ministry of Defence and intelligence administration are calling for a constructive dialogue on vitally important issues of national security.
The investigation is not limited to the question of whether the American-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is successful (a claim made by an increasing number of representatives from the Ministry of Defence).
But last year's accusations call into question whether President Obama can fully rely on reports from the Central Authority on military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and other hotspots.
Critics regarding Islamic intelligence remind us of more than ten years of events when the Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hūger published a study saying that George W. Bush's administration initiated Afghanistan's war, thinking too little about its possible consequences.
Hogger played an important role in the opening of the Islamic State's intelligence issue.
Last year, the official representatives reported that the Hūkper team discovered that, contrary to public reports, air flights to Islamic National Oil Plants had not significantly deteriorated the financial situation of a terrorist group because they had built temporary factories to sell oil on the black market.
The Times reported in September that this discovery did not go beyond the central management walls.
Commander of Centcom General Lois Austin III at that time received severe criticism, as many lawmakers believed that the war reports described the situation too positively.
In April, General Austin took a vacation and General Joseph L. Votel came to his place.
The U.S. due to the British women's field hockey wins the United States, thus winning the fourth win in a row.
Day after victory over Japan with score 6:1, Thursday, Katie Bama won the first two gates for the U.S. women's field hockey team, when Americans defeated the Indian team with a score of 3:0.
Five gate gains in two games are an unforgettable achievement, but a 27 - year - old Bama said that she could not remember if this was the case.
She said: “I have no idea...
I'm not from those people who read their gates.
But she knows that the American result of the Olympic Games is 4:0, which gives them in their group undistinct Britain, which on Thursday after winning over Japan with the result of 2:0 remained unwinned.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday to play the last match in the first round games.
Both teams are already qualified for a quarter and the game will only determine which team will take the first place in the six teams group and which second.
The winner of the first prize will avoid a meeting with the strong Dutch sample, the leader of the second group.
Although Saturday's game would not develop, Americans have already called a surprise storm, four years ago, entering London's last place among 12 teams.
Bama was also on the team
She grew up in Blūbel, a field hockey bat she first took in her hands at the age of 3 (their older twin sisters were already working with this sport in Dressel) and joined the national team when she was 16 years old, becoming a sample of younger players in history.
She was not in the 2008 Olympic Games because she did not get to the final.
But 2012 was a failure for her and her team.
The following year, English Craig Parham was appointed as a random coach and everything changed to the right side.
Bama referred to it as ‘cultural, mental and physical change’
We did not invest as much as we did now in London.
We have changed everything.
During Thursdays, Bama discovered the result by removing the gates in the first half of the day with the back throw from the close distance.
India started the game without winning in its account, but their selection was very bright and kept to a minimal score 0:1 until the end of the third period, when Bama repeatedly won the gate.
She entered the ball in the opposite zone on the left side of the square, then noticed to be on the middle of the square and sent the ball to the enemy gate, with the Americans led by 2:0.
In the middle of the fourth period, Melissa Gonzales got another gate.
This was the first U.S. gateway Jackie Briga dry game, each of the first three games playing with one gate.
She's stuck.
And so is Bama.
“We are going very well now,” said Paham, but as well, will show the game on Saturday.
The most depressing meal is the “Saint meal”
In March 1933, Franklin Delano Ruzvelt, President-in-Office, sat in the oval room shortly after his election to have a meal.
President Roosevelt was tasted by such fine culinary delicacies as goose liver paste, or fuagre, and the soup of Maryland’s turtles.
But that day his meal was much more modest: stuffed egg tomatoes in sauce, potato thicker and dessert - plumpod.
Jane Ziegelmane says: “This is a way of working together with people who were very difficult to cook.
Her husband, André Kou, adds: “It is also a message to the Americans, how to eat...
The couple from Brooklyn Heights are food historians.
The last book of Kou, The Garden Sautation, describes the Chinese cuisine in America, while Ziegelmane describes the life through the food of the rental house in the East lower part of Manhattan.
Their new joint meal, published by Harper on Tuesday, is a story of American food during the Great Depression.
Having demonstrated some solidarity in the culinary world, they kept the meal together by the reporter Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a simple lunch at the district of Flateron, when depression began in 1929.
Mrs. Ziegelmane, 54 years old, ordered a sandwich with rendered cheese and hot olives, while the 57-year-old Kou commissioned salads for turkeys, potato pruners and vegetables.
When the reporter ordered the counterfeit bunny, the couple admitted that his choice was very appropriate to talk about the time of the Great Depression .
Mrs. Ziegelmane said that the counterfeit bunny was very popular.
There was a peanut hare, a liver hare, and a bean hare.
They were made from basic ingredients and other ingredients that enriched the meal.
Imagine how it is - eat as many peanuts to be at lunch.
Mr. Kou was naked.
“It seemed safe that the belly was full of lead, ” he added.
During the predepression years, the American lunch table resembled Swedish tables, especially in rural areas.
Women were prepared to eat their men and breakfast, lunch and dinner were served freshly prepared cookies.
During World War I, the Americans directly sent food to Europeans. “The hot meal ” describes how the Americans adapted to the conditions when America was suddenly no longer a land of abundance.
“At the time, the food became the focus of the American people in daily life, ” says Mr. Kou, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write exactly on this subject.
The new budget's diets became just as important: unknown meals, such as the counterfeit bunny and scents, were “a great way to use surpluses, ” said Mrs. Ziegelmane, because the chefs could hide the unattractive ingredients under creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruits.
Meat, which for years was the main ingredient of American meals, now became an extremely rare luxury product.
At a time when the number of calories and nutritional value of food was more important than taste, new unseen objects were born.
In an ancient chef, Mrs. Ziegelmane found a recipe for making onions filled with peanut butter.
Mr Kou adds: “It was not a popular addition to the dinner table.
Ms Ziegelmane stressed: \"It was surreally --
Groundnut butter and fried onion are not compatible.
Many homemade recipes applied to difficult times.
Household economists like Louis Stanley, who was head of the Federal Household Economics Office from 1923 to 1943, were determined by the state eating habits that were not experienced before and after the Great Depression.
When they published articles and recipes in newspapers and magazines, they recommended householders to become economics and accept challenges such as to turn the pasta and carrot mix into a delicious meal.
“Sorry Malta – is a sweet home for historical tastes.
Particularly interesting is the government’s attitude towards hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Huver, who can eat a cake.
Although he publicly spoke about his simple childhood and meals in Aioa, he actually ate as a fine millionaire he had become.
Mr Kou says: “She liked European cuisine, such as fish with cucumber sauce.
He ate an almost yellow guest room, wearing a lunch jacket.
He was completely alienated from reality.
President Roosevelt would have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleonor, had not recommended him to set an example with his eating habits.
The book reports that Ruzvelt set off a housekeeper who did not teach him how to cook, so the White House became the place where one of the worst dishes in Washington, but also the worst food prepared, was served.
Once the country’s economy recovered, most of the cooking signatures of the era of depression disappeared.
But we continue to pay attention to the fact that there is a high level of calories and nutrition, as well as to how science can be applied to culinary science, Mrs Ziegelmane added.
The couple say that when they wrote the book, they gained a greater understanding of Mrs. Ziegelmane's mother's eating habits, for example, why she was unable to throw away her food.
“She was really afraid to throw out her food,” said Mr. Cou.
Mrs. Ziegelmane said: “She actually hurt people...
One day, there was an incident with windmills.
After we had eaten in the district of Eisenberg, the couple of writers pulled out of the bag a dessert that was made in the house, a plum pudding that President Ruzvelt used to eat at lunch.
“It is a plumpopotamus, ” said Mrs Ziegelmane, adding that at the time it was common to give a chic name to modest dishes.
It does not contain foam, only dried plums, some flour, sugar, water and cannula.
Everyone put the spoon in a brown massage on the plates.
Surprisingly, it wasn't that bad.
Mr. Kou ate some more foums.
Listening to an experienced - Economist, he told his wife:
Gilead will receive reimbursement for legal expenses in the fight against Merck for the hepatitis C patent
The regional judge has decided that ‘Gilead Sciences Inc.’ is entitled to reimbursement of the costs of the legal services it has paid in the case of the reduction of the hepatitis C patent against the pharmaceutical company ‘Merck & Co Inc’
In June, Gilead was justified in the case of a GBP 200 million fine for two Merck patents that threatened it with the success of Sovaldi and Harvoni pills, when the US federal judge found violations in Merck’s activities, such as a lie after taking the oath and other non-ethical activities.
In the course of the proceedings on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Bet Labson Frymen pointed out that Gilead had the right to claim compensation for the legal costs it had incurred in defending the case.
Merck is trying to acquire a position on the market against Gilead, which dominates the market with a new generation of hepatitis C medicines, which is effective in 90% of liver disease.
The case was already initiated in 2013, when Gilead and Merck appealed to each other in an attempt to obtain ownership of the newly developed active component, sofosbuvir, which is the main component of Gilead’s medicine.
The US-supported forces claim that they have taken over control of Manbuja’s city from the Islamic State.
The US-supported forces have taken over the full territory of Manbuja in the northern part of the town of Manbuja, along the Turkish border, and the last Islamic State soldiers have left the city, notified the group representative on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDS) are currently cleaning up a city from the last enemy fighters who have not yet left the city.
They have released more than 2,000 hostage-killers who were arrested by the fighters, said Reuters news agency Sharfan Darvish of the SDS-allied Manbuja Military Council.
“At present, the city is under full control of us and we carry out a search for fighters, who informed the Reuters agency.
In 2015, the client's income reached 10.75 million dollars and the couple paid 34.2 per cent of the federal tax rate.
On Friday, Hillary Clinton published the 2015 tax return, which shows that the presidential candidate and her husband of the Democratic Party have earned 10.75 million dollars in that year and have paid respectively a federal tax rate of 34.2 per cent.
In 2015, Klinton has donated USD 1 million, mostly to its Clinton Charity Organization. Former President Bill Clinton has earned about $ 5.3 million by making a contribution as a spyman and the former Secretary of the State has earned a profit of $3 million from his book on his work at the State Department, published in collaboration with “Simon & Schuster –”
The ally of the Clinton elections - the senator of the state of Virginia, Tim Keins, and his wife, Anna Holtone, have published their tax return for the last 10 years.
In 2015, they paid a federal tax rate of 20,3 per cent.
“Hilaria Clinton and Tim Keys continue to set new standards of financial transparency; in their communication, Janifera Palmieri, partner of the Klinton campaign, said.
On the other hand, Donald Trump is hiding behind various excuses and reservations so that there is no need to fulfill his promises to disclose his tax information.
Publicising tax information paid is a practice for US presidential candidates, but it is not required by law.
The New York businessman Trumps and his lawyers mention the audit of the State Revenue Service as a reason to do not disclose tax information.
“Your turn,” said Ian Sam, the campaign partner of Klinton, about the tax information of the candidate for the Democratic Party on Twitter.
On Thursday, Trump’s special advisor, Michael Kohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to disclose tax information before the audits were completed.
Tramp critics, including Presidential candidate Mits Romnis and other Republicans of the Republic 2012 claim that his refusal raises questions about his real estate size, donations and other commitments of his business, including commitments with Russia.
Clinton poured oil into fire on Friday with a video that requires several influential Republicers to make their tax information public.
She returned to this issue again during the economic speech in Michigan on Thursday.
She announced to the crowd: “He refuses to do what the other presidential candidates have done for several decades...
“Politico, says that in 1990, Trump has paid very little or no tax during two years, and on Friday, New York Times, the author of the business column said that many accountants and lawyers believe that nothing has changed.
Federal tax rates are an important issue in these presidential elections.
The client, in support of the proposal by the billioner Varen Bafet, promotes the idea that anyone who earns more than $1 million a year must pay tax of at least 30%.
This proposal is also supported by President Obama.
Last week in Clinton’s speech in Omaha, Nebraska, where he’s also a «Berkshire Hathaway» conglomerate, Bafet invited Trampo to exchange tax declarations.
The Bafet said that he was also audited by the Revenue Service and that Trump was afraid of voters rather than tax authorities.
The Klinton campaign has made public tax information available until 2007.
Clintons now live in Chapakwa, New York and have paid an average federal tax rate of around 32 per cent between 2007 and 2014 and a total tax rate of around 40,5 per cent.
The 2015 tax account shows that unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income is wages.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund, from which Klinton received $1109,000 in dividends.

Jewish film director criticizes the hotel in Berlin for keying Israel's remote conversations at a request - RT News
The Jewish French film director brought up the storm in social media, when he found that “Kempinski Bristol – Israel’s remote conversation code is not available at the Berlin Hotel. The hotel’s employees base this on the Arab customer request.
Claude Lancman, director of the Holocaust, did not hide his disappointment with the hotel of Berlin-Kempinski Bristol and addressed an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his recent visit, Lancman tried to find the Israeli far-speaker code on the hotel list.
However, this country was not listed with countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible that in 2016 Israel, Berlin, the new capital of Germany, has been hijacked and destroyed?
They write Lancman.
Instead of Kempinski Bristol, the hotel offers you to call the country through the centre of its calls.
The director requested an explanation from the hotel staff.
Lancman writes that the reply he received was shocked
The hotel administrator explained that “this was the decision of the management of a conscious hotel ”
The reason why the code was removed was even more contented by the film director.
“The biggest part of the guests are Arabs and they asked for an Israeli code to be extinguished, ” Lancman quotes the hotel employee’s explanation.
Suddeutsche Zeitung reports that the Ambassador of Israel to Germany, Jakov Hada-Handelsman, described this case as a “great shame”
We are surprised and shocked about this incident.
The same thing is a big shame in itself.
And the fact that it has happened in Germany is precisely that there is even more humiliation in this hotel network.
No explanatory notes are required.
The official stated: “We hope that the hotel will draw the right conclusions.
This event also received fairly broad resonances on the Internet, where people called it a scandal.
Others believe that “Kempinski – the hotel is simply for the Arab customers.
Another entry said: “Do not be ashamed, ” indicating that the hotel is located on the street of Kurfurstendamm next to the synagogue.
The publication Der Spiegel tells us that the hotel itself has quickly rejected all the accusations, declaring that all of this is a misunderstanding, and apologised to Lancman.
“We have not received a direct order from Israel to remove Israel from the list of national numbers, ” says Suddeutsche Zeitung, a representative of Kempinski.
And add that the code is added again to the list.
Police use rubber bullets and tear gas against protesting Brazilian students.
The student and police conflict took place on Thursday in the city of São Toméan in Brazil, where the students gathered in a demonstration against reforms of the government education system.
The police used rubber balls and tear gas against students.
Problems began when the law enforcement tried to drive out students, which led the police to use rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to show their displeasure with the reforms of the education system.
The proposal of Governor of São Paulo Geraldo Alckmin is to close almost 100 public schools, while 300 000 students will be transferred to other schools to save money.
Some demonstrators drew graffiti on the walls with messages against the interim president Michael Temer.
This protest took place only a few days after the previous protest, when the students gathered in demonstrations with the aim of expressing their support for Dilmai Rousef, who was voted on by the senate.
Scott Kelum Skyner finish the first to bring the United Kingdom gold medals to cycling
Kelum Skiner from Scotland finish the first male biking team in the race at Rio cycling last night. The British team guarded its champion title which it won in 2012 in London.
The 23-year-old sportsman from Glasgow played an important role in these competitions, making the proud legendary Scottish Sergey Chris Hoy and landing the victory for the favorites of New Zealand.
Four years ago, Britain won an amazing victory when Hoi won five of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they also repeated it at the London World Championship, although Hoy had already finished his sports career.
The challenges were in the phase between Beijing and London’s Olympics, as an experienced startman, Jamie Stafu, had to be replaced.
They did it at the last minute.
When Hoi went out, he tried to fill his place with Kian Emadi and Matt Krampton.
The British coaches had hope for Skyner, seeing him as a potential he later proved.
Hinde, Kinny - champions, who started four years ago with Hoy and Skyner, who set up a record of Olympic qualifications, but the race was a better start for New Zealand's team
However, the British trio got gold medals.
In his circle, Coney was the leader, and Skyner guarded his leadership.
The change in strategy played an important role in the victory, as Hinde was driving with greater gear to allow Kenya and Skyner in particular to drive faster.
Hoy watched the race as a representative of BBC and caught the eyes of Skyner, Kenya, and Hindes when they climbed to the courtesa.
The 23 - year - old glasshouse said: “It was an inexpressible honour,
I do my best to defend my name.
In the finals, we put the Olympic record and won the World champions.
It was just incredible.
There's no better victory.
After winning together with Kenya and Hoy at the 2012 Olympic Games in London, Hinde confessed that the intentional fell on the track after the unsuccessful start.
Later, he rebutted this comment, and British competitors were not able to prove the contrary.
This time, though, was not such an incident.
Hinde commented: “The British Wars brought back to mind London...
Over the last 3 months, we have become a united team.
We have lost so many World Championships, so the victory in the Olympics was really special.
One medal in the race to a country that got seven out of ten gold medals for cycling in Beijing and London.
If this achievement is a team progress indicator over the last five months, then the next five days will be very exciting.
Given the result of Kenya, he could really repeat Hoy’s success by obtaining three Olympic gold medals.
For Kenya, this would mean six battles of gold and one medal of silver. In addition, Kenny was also born on 23 March (seeing that it is the sacred date of the Britishs, since Steve Regreiv, Mo Farah and Roger Banister were also born on that day).
Hoy was also born on that date.
Kenya's next race is a sprint, which starts today and will continue for the next three days.
A 28 - year - old sportsman in Bolton said: “I’m just enjoying it right now.
Team travel is always the best.
Because then you can win with your teammates.
To be honest, there's a little lonely to win.
Hinde said: “If he would get two more gold medals, he would have to turn the troops into a round, ” he said.
That day, it was the only fight for medals, but they were not the only good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Viggins, Ed Clency, Steve Burk and Ovein Doul showed the fastest qualification time for four kilometres.
Their time was 3:51.943
The world record that was installed in London in 2012 is 3:51.659.
The first round and finals will take place today in the second half of the day, where Vigins will certainly be the center of attention.
Yesterday before his qualification trip, he had disagreements with the Commissioner when the judges called him to measure his height.
During a woman trip that will continue and conclude today, Laura Trota, Joan Rovsela Shanda, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald from Milan set a new record time of 4:13.260.
The British delegation hopes that the British cycling team, hoping. will win medals in the middle of the Olympic game.
Remembering the outstanding and unprecedented performance in Beijing and London, Rio is all expecting the same achievements as well.
Meanwhile, he went behind different scenes, following accusations of sexuality and violation of dignity, technical director Shane Saton resigned, and Hoy and Victoria Bendletton complete their career.
However, starting with the first cycling races, it seems that the UK will, as always, reach its highest level at the right time.
The future of the portland boiler is becoming uncertain as an end to an ambitious contract.
The future of the aluminium mines and hundreds of its employees in Portland, Victoria, has become unclear, as its main customer has announced the suspension of cooperation by the energy company.
This Communication is based on the plans of the Victorian Government to stop subsidising an energy company, which is vital for the company to continue to work.
The 20-year grant will be terminated in November.
As a result, more than 2000 jobs in the Alkoa Portland plant are at risk.
Up to 2,000 jobs, both direct and indirect, could be at risk.
Furthermore, it will also have unpredictable side effects, as the melting house consumes about 10 percent of the electricity from Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the “Point Henry – a boiler that led to a break in the coal power plant.
The mine of Alkoa Portland works for losses and can be closed.
These events have led to speculation over several years on the rise of the value of Australian dollar and on the cost of production of the factory.
The factory's energy supplier AGL, who supplies energy from its own – Loy Yang A – power stations in Latroubes Ieleja, says that the other three owners are likely to terminate their contracts too.
Most of the power plants are owned by the Alcoa Joint Undertaking and Alumia Joint Undertaking, in addition to the companies owned by China-CITIC- and Japan-Marubeni Corp-holding companies.
\"AGL – hopes to continue the operation of the Portland plant, which would mean a further energy storage facility,\" said its representative.
\"AGL – said that the contracts are so-called \"risk restrictive agreements\" which are due to enter into force as of November 2016.
The contracts are valid for a period of 12 months and will therefore remain in force until 2017.
“AGL – plans to receive revenues from these contracts also in the 2017 fiscal year,” said the company representative.
The potential impact on profitability from the fiscal year 2018 is limited by favourable market forecasts for future wholesale electricity prices.
\"AGL\" claims that it has already calculated losses of USD 187 million in its forecasts, with the agreement that these contracts will be terminated.
‘Alcoa’ states that the decision to terminate the contracts will not affect the ability of Alcoa to continue its operation or to supply it with energy.
U.S. company reports that in 2010 it concluded an agreement with “Loy Yang” for 20 years, but it will stop in November. The company does not provide any explanation why it will cease its cooperation.
The analysts have expressed concern about the possible closure of the Portland bakery in Victoria, as well as the closure of the Tomago plant near New York, due to the weak economy of the sector.
“AGL – Executive Director Steven Mikelson said last week that according to analysts estimates, Portland uses 600 megawatts and Tomago 900 megawatts of energy during the year.
If the two plants were to leave the energy market, the demand for energy would be significantly reduced.
And that would not be good at all.
The Community legal centre rejects 160 000 people each year.
Every year more than 160,000 people are rejected, and budget cuts could make the situation worse.
Three out of five people in Queensland - mainly pensioners, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those who have no means to combat illegal dumping - are denied free legal assistance and representation.
The Community's legal centre, which is already under pressure, warns that reducing funding will only make the situation worse.
As of June next year, these legal centres will receive 30% less funding than before.
James Farrell, director of the legal centre in Queensland, said that the latest National Legal Centres Association report tells us that currently thousands of people in need are denied legal aid.
Mister Farrell pointed out that if this decision were not abolished, the situation would become worse.
He also says: “The legal centre in Queensland is constantly receiving insufficient funding, which means that thousands of people in need are refused assistance.
People trying to end violent relations, people with deep debts, families experiencing divorce, workers who are unfairly released - all these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they are not getting the necessary help.
As of June 2017, the federal government will reduce its funding by 30 percent, which means that several thousands more in Queensland will have to deal with its difficult legal problems without aid.
We call on the prosecutor-general and Queensland Senator George Brandis to stop the cuts immediately so that people in need of legal aid can get it.
Last year, the government opened its plans to raise the level of legal aid up to the national average.
Now is the time to focus on the needs of local communities and their customers and the government of Palazčuk to invest in this important area.
The Donald Trump campaign was brought to justice by a firearm extorted by one of the employees
New York: The organisers of the Donald Trump campaign have been brought to court because they have not done so by informing them that their North Carolina's operations manager has turned the firearm into a staffman when they drive a car in February.
This incident was described in a court claim lodged on Wednesday by Vincent Bordi, a former programmer of the campaign.
Bordti said that he had waited months for this case to be examined internally, but he realized that it would not happen.
Leader Earl Phillips drew a gun, put his fingerstick on the guide, and turned his stubble against Vincent’s knees, Bordeaux claims in her complaint.
He also claims that when complaints were submitted to the local and regional authorities, Bordeaux learned that at least four more people had experienced the same.
“The weapons don’t have to be shot to cause damage, ” says Bordeaux in her complaint.
Just two days before this case is presented, the candidate for the Republican Party for the President's post was the scandal, telling people that “the people of the second Amendment, i.e. arms owners and enthusiasts, could act in the event of a wish to win his rival, Hilaria Klinton, and his elected judges.
Trump's representatives announced that the media had pulled out his words from the context, and he has never threatened anyone to violence.
The coordination with its request would like to recover compensation from the campaign organisers for neglecting supervision, but from Philips - for attack, use of illegal weapon and creating emotional stress.
Trumpa's representative Hoopa Hixa did not provide comments immediately.
You haven't been able to contact Phillips.
WCCB - the local news agency in Charlotte reports that Philip has recently abandoned the campaign.
Nor has he been able to call his consultancy firm – Innovative Consultation Services –

New tradition - parish and sports festival in Ķūļciems.
Saturday at Kūļciems, the people gathered for the first time to attend the parish and sports festivals.
This time, after ten years of celebration, it was decided that the lake would no longer be present.
A new page has now been redrafted.
The day started with sports competitions.
This time, the race was not traditional and too serious, for for example, the dart was to be dropped into a sleeping target, the boot was flying, the man's left hand cast, the bombings, there were no Olympics at all.
However, each participant was able to show how strong, courageous, squealing and accomplice he was.
After sports games, everyone gathered in the open-air estrada, where the parish celebration began.
In the meantime, the “children’s corner ” also worked.
The new one, which could also become a tradition, was a show of cars, including both tractors and motorcycles.
Everyone was addressed by Inga Kadikie-Skadiņa, the management director of Kūļciems parish administration, who longed for a nice rest and dry time, rain did rain, but it could not interfere much.
The festival continued with the greeting of the younger population of Kūļciems.
It is indeed good that the parish has expanded with five girls and one boy.
The performances of the amateur art group from the region of Engure - the viewers liked the performances of the senior dance group Rudens rhythms – the performers of the dances of different nations – Redas – and the young dancer Zelta pearls.
And it's okay that there was a slip on the wet stage.
Of course, local folks and visitors were delighted by the famous duo of actors Jānis Jarāns and Dainis Porgants, who were once again Mildiņa Nabiņa and Skaidīte Kraniņa, as well as the attractive wives of Berzciems from the fishermen's farm «Dieniņas –

Britain must maintain the Olympic spirit and expand Hithrov.
Hithrow will not only promote prosperity and growth in local regions and London, but also throughout the country.
This, in my opinion, makes Hithrov very attractive, as we did in 2012 in London, where we invested enormously in order for all regions of the country to benefit from the Olympic Games.
Stratford and Implementinga got a lot from the Olympic Games.
And we will do this again, providing local people and businesses with business opportunities near Hetrov.
For local communities alone, we will create 10 000 new business opportunities, 40 000 new jobs and finally put an end to youth unemployment in the vicinity of Hithrow.
As in the 2012 London Olympics, there will also be people who believe this challenge is too big and that the expansion of Hithrov is too ambitious.
At that time, people said that Britain would never prepare for the Olympics at the time and that it would be a global failure.
Skeptics made a mistake in 2012 and, in the case of Hethrow, they will not be right either.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Hithrov has so far overcome everything.
Like the Olympics, Hithrov is an infrastructure project that will benefit the entire society, not individuals alone.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs, economic growth of 211 billion, creating the soil for both employment and experience at this airport and throughout the UK.
Hetrov has an excellent team that has created an infrastructure investment programme worth 11 billion, which is included in the term and budget starting with terminal 5 which has been called the best airport terminal in the world for five years and ending with terminal 2 which has been built between the two more intensive runways in the world.
Now they are ready to set up a third runway, which will be financed by private investment of GBP 16 billion.
The 2012 London Olympics were a great success, and I am sure this will also be the enlargement of Hithrov.
It is time to revive the Olympic spirit and expand Hithrov, ensuring the future of our trade and creating a new employment environment that Britain could be proud of.
Lord Paul Deiton is a member of the Board of Hetrov and former Secretary of Commercial Affairs of the Ministry of Economics.
In Switzerland, a woman goes to the highway to commit suicide.
In the middle of the night, he landed on the highway.
The police are trying to find witnesses to an accident when she was travelling over a number of cars on the high road on Thursday morning.
The accident took place Thursday shortly after midnight on the A1 road near Canton, Morge, in the town of Vo.
The Canton police report says that when a woman desperately wanted to commit suicide, she had learned about the darkness of the road, where several cars drove him.
A clear attempt to kill himself, a victim, a 49 - year - old Swiss, was made by several cars, including a truck.
She died at the scene.
Several of the showsers involved have already provided evidence, while others involved have not yet been identified, says the police, who are calling on the drivers and witnesses of the accident to respond.
Criminal investigations have also been initiated in the case, which is a logical step in this case, and a lawyer Gilles Hofsteller told Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it is not yet known whether any of the drivers involved will be punished.
Was it possible to avoid a clash?
Hofsteller adds: “This will be clarified by the prosecutor...
Two similar cases that have occurred over the past 5 years show that none of the drivers will be held accountable.
In both cases, the pedestrian had gone to the highway in the middle of the night, so it was decided that drivers could not predict that a pedestrian would be on the highway at night.
Last year, a policeman was right to be put to death after she was bereaved in August 2014, when a man who was on the A1 road near Payerne at the middle of the night.
The Court found that the 22 - year - old victim was drunk and noticed to be on the road.
The Court concluded that the policeman, who was on the road to the accident site, was travelling in an appropriate way and the judge acknowledged that the sleeping man on the road was “a completely unpredictable and exceptional occurrence...
Anyone who has information about the accident on Thursday near Morge is invited to contact the police by phone 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 44 44.
The signatures are collected on the Internet for the organisation of a new Head of the ENI competition.
Signature collection on the Petition portal Avaaz.org has been launched for the organisation of a new competition for the post of Head of the State Revenue Service (VID).
The petition addressed to the Ministers of the National Association (NA) and the Greens/Agricultural Union (ZZS) indicates that the public wants a transparent and professional process of nomination of officials.
Petition was created on August 10, and it is currently signed by 55 people.
The appointment process of Chief Executive Officers of the ENI, Inga Koļegov, is opaque and non-professional.
It recalls the best functional traditions of the Soviet Union.
It discredits public administration and, once again, compels the public to despair in government and politicians.
“A competition with clear criteria is needed, against which all candidates must be evaluated, with the text of the petition.
Its author Jānis B. has pointed out that the company is not aware of the criteria of appointment chosen by Koļegova.
Nor is it clear what the candidates' intention to work in SRS is clear.
The petition states that the State Registry should create a new, open competition, which actively addresses professional candidates, attracts staffing specialists and offers adequate remuneration.
The Minister of Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola officially nominated the Head of the SRS of Koļegov last week to approve him in his new post at the government, but all the Ministers of the Unity voted against, so the question of the week was postponed.
Samoilov: If we lost, then I played bad.
The beach volleyballists Alexander Samoilov and Jānis Šmēdiņš hoped for a prize in Rio de Janeiro's Olympics, but without it there is no difference between the place to conclude the competition, after leaving the tournament Samoilovs.
One of the world's most powerful beach volleyball pairs on Thursday's sub-groups in the final and decisive game with 1-2 (16:21, 22:20, 7:15) lost the Brazilians Evandr Gonsalveš Oliver and Pedru Solberg Salgada, concluding their participation in the four-year most important sports forum.
In three subgroups Latvian athletes won one victory, but the same ratio was also two pairs.
The ratio of small points between three couples was then calculated, which was the most negative Latvian duet after the convincing loss suffered in this May.
“We were in charge in our first place, but from 16:15 we stayed at 16 points.
I don't even know how we stayed in the rest of the set.
It can't play.
After that, in the second sixth, everything was fine and the set top managed to break the game, and it had to be a good foundation for the third one as well.
It was similar to the beginning, but after we swapped the parties, the result grew to only one team.
We had too many mistakes in the attack.
In the subgroup, all teams were similar, in almost every match there were three faces, so small points were important.
“You used to play similar things, not to give 3-4 points several times in a row,” said the sportsman.
We knew Evandr could serve.
“In the first six we met with it, we took 1-2 points into the second, and in the third, a game went to +4 already.
We tried to show the best game.
I don't know. I don't think so.
The overall situation before the match was taken, but it was known that as many small points as possible were needed.
“If we lost, I played bad, ” said Samoilov.
We had a good service from Evands, and with it, we had a pretty good job, but the third was opening a service to him and making an attack.
I made a lot of mistakes in taking in the Pedru service, but it was to be dealt with.
In contrast to the previous match, Samoilov told us that today the athletes were not nervous.
“We went, we played, we also had protection, but we needed better service to be welcomed.
«They played well, and at the end they came to the «hurrah» --
Before the tournament, we immediately said that the drawer was the more inconvenient it could have been.
We also had the prospect of fighting for the first place, but we did not even leave the group.
\"All of us were waiting for the medal, and we too, but then there are no more differences - either 25th place or 4th place,\" said Samoilov, who predicted that the duet would continue to play together in the future.
I think that there will be no question and we will continue to play together, because this is just one tournament.
Samoilov Rio de Janeiro had a third Olympic career since in 2008 he started with Martin Plaviv, but four years ago he played with Ruslan Sorokin in London.
Meanwhile, this was the second start of Olympics.
“Latvenergo” follows the process of opening up the gas market also from the position of a potential trader.
The state energy company Latvenergo follows the process of opening the gas market from the position of both the consumer and potential trader, said Ivita Bidere, the press secretary of the company.
The decision on whether Latvenergo will join the gas market as a trader in the future will determine how the gas market model and the regulatory framework will be --
\"We are therefore actively involved in drafting and commenting legislation, and we are submitting our proposals,\" said Bidere.
The Agency BNS has already written that the Ministry of Economics (EM) in cooperation with the Public Service Regulatory Commission and the energy company Latvijas Gāze has developed draft regulations of the Cabinet of Ministers on the marketing and use of natural gas – which will change the existing principles of the natural gas market, providing the right to freely choose the natural gas trader from 3 April 2017 onwards.
In the context of the new regulation of the natural gas market, the aim of the EM is to make the process of trading natural gas as simple and user-friendly as possible.
Therefore, the most efficient and user-friendly service solution was chosen – the central model of the trader – where all activities related to customer service are provided by the trader - one contract, one invoice and one information and customer service location, leaving the technical issues of the distribution system operator in terms of the natural gas distribution system.
A similar solution is currently being implemented in the electricity market.
We recall that the gradual opening of the market is expected for household customers - even after 3 April 2017 those household customers who do not want to choose another natural gas trader will be able to continue to receive natural gas from an existing trader at a regulated price, thus becoming related users.
“In this case, the obligation to supply natural gas to related customers at a regulated price has been imposed on a public trader – informed the Ministry.
Economic operators, on the other hand, will have to choose the natural gas trader to conclude the contract for the sale of natural gas.
Until the contract for the sale of natural gas has been concluded for a certain period, the natural gas trader will ensure the sale of natural gas at a fixed price.

Minister: next week it is planned to judge on the increase in remuneration of the Director General of the SRS.
The Minister of Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola plans next week to talk with Prime Minister Maris Kučinski (ZZS) and the partners of the government coalition about increasing the remuneration of the Director General of the State Revenue Service (VID).
Reizniece-Ozola pointed out to journalists on Friday that the issue of an increase in the remuneration of the SRS Director-General should be addressed urgently in order to make this position more attractive for potential re-tenderers.
Next week, too, we were going to talk about changing the conditions of the competition.
The Minister also stressed that she did not think about a specific candidate to be asked for a vacant position.
At the same time, Reizniece-Ozola expressed the view that Inga Koļegova, Head of State Environmental Service, would have been a good Chief Executive Director of SRS.
On the other hand, as regards the current Chief Executive of the SRS, Dace Peylio, who expressed readiness to qualify for that post, the Minister reiterated the view that the new SRS Director-General should be from the outside and should not come from the SRS body.
She also stressed that she was waiting for the Saeima to return to leave, in order to push forward as soon as possible the amendments to the legislation necessary for the reorganisation of the SRS.
The Agency BNS has already informed that the Minister for Finance of Inga Koļegova, Head of State Environmental Service, Dana Reizniece-Ozoli (ZZS), has submitted an application in which he withdrew his candidacy for the post of Director General of the SRS.
In her application, she said that it was not an easy choice, but during the last two weeks her relatives have been under severe emotional pressure, though they have not done any depreciable acts by law.
Koļegova also noted that the discussion of her candidacy had led to contradictions between the ruling coalition parties, which was also unacceptable.
Ināra Pētersons, former SRS Director General, reportedly left office at the end of June.
Oil prices continue to rise; exchange indices in the USA and Europe and in the US dollar are growing.
World oil prices on Friday morning are continuing to rise, with positive investor moods influenced by statements by the Saudi Arabian Minister of Oil Affairs, which amplify the expectation that major oil-beneficiaries will be taking action at the OPEC meeting in September to stabilise the global oil market.
The three major US exchange indices reached record levels on Thursday, which have not been observed since 1999.
The main positive factor in the market was the rise in the price of oil and the strong financial performance of several large companies.
The rise in oil prices and strong financial indicators for several companies on Thursday was also a cause of the rise in European stock exchange indices.
The value of the US dollar on Thursday rose against the euro, against the British pound and against the Japanese yen.
On September, the price of crude oil of the WTI brand on the stock exchange in New York rose by 1.78 dollars to 43.49 dollars per barrel.
“Brent – brand crude oil price for deliveries on the London stock exchange increased by 1,99 dollars - to 46,04 dollars per barrel.
The turnover of the conservative producer Blue Lion falls by 33.8% last year.
The turnover of the Conservative Blue Lion producer was EUR 4,202 million last year, which is 33.8% less than the year before, while the loss of the company fell 5,7 times - to EUR 904,7 thousand - is shown in the annual financial report published by Lursoft.
According to the management report of the company, in 2015 the company worked with losses for a number of reasons, including the lack of permanent working capital due to the withdrawal from the Baltic market by the withdrawal of previously existing credit line, and leaving the Zilo Lagoon on concluded contracts without being able to execute them.
Consequently, the company did not have sufficient funds to purchase cheaper raw materials in large volumes and obtain a volume discount.
The withdrawal of the relevant bank from the Latvian market also prevented the company from implementing European Union structural funds support projects that would have allowed the factory to purchase new production equipment and upgrade the infrastructure.
Similarly, the financial creators of the company in the past year had a negative impact on the rise in raw material prices and on the customer’s unwillingness to pay more for the goods produced by the company.
“Only in the second half of July 2016 customers acknowledged price changes and were ready to purchase products at the new – highest prices – according to the company’s management.
Also in 2015 “Blue Lion” started talking with potential investors, including the valuation of the company’s movable and immovable property.
The investors have already been to the largest creditor of the company-Unicred Leasing, where the parties have met and discussed possible investment plans.
At the same time, the implementation of the restructuring and optimisation plan launched in 2014 and 2015 was positively influenced by the company's activities and development.
This plan included improving and optimising technological processes to achieve higher production productivity and capacity.
“It only purchased several equipment that provides more production speed,” said the company’s management.
“The blue spouse – management notes that the equipment purchased in 2016 will allow the company’s factory to carry out orders that were not possible until now.
The first production lot to be manufactured on this equipment will be ready in August.
As the intention protocols for sales of the product have already been signed, all produced will be sold according to the intention protocols.
The new product will increase its turnover by about 300 thousand euros per month, according to the management of the company.
In August 2016, the company also plans to sign a cooperation agreement on fish supplies to Iraq.
\"Blue lagoon – in 2016 has sent the first experimental container to Israel, expanded the market to Cyprus and this year in September will sign a cooperation agreement with a new supermarket chain in the United States.
As a result of all the above measures, the company plans to increase its turnover.
In 2014, the Blue Lion worked with a turnover of 6,347 million euros and a loss of 5,113 million euros.
“Blue spouse” was founded in 1997 and has a share capital of €1.56 million.
The company is owned by two Latvian individuals - Mihailam Kaidanov (89.11%) and Igor Širšona (10.89%).
Welcome to the museum's 15th anniversary Zar Leander and press conference.
Riga can be viewed as the beginning of the career and inspiration city of Sara Leander, the lovable cinema diva.
The visit of Zaras Lendere to Ruth, a Swedish ambassador to Latvia, seemed fatal in 1924, because she was the woman of Zaras Leander, who she tried to dance on the theatre stage in Riga.
Perhaps the accidental embarrassment in Riga, became the fateful turning point of Zara’s creative journey towards the world fame.
Riga Sara Leandre was associated with warm memories, and she hoped to come to Riga in a guest show, but unfortunately, these expectations were not meant to be fulfilled because the Second World War began.
Using the form of the show, this meeting will be possible at Riga Festival 2016 and a great Ieva Kerēvica will appear in the role of Zaras Leander.
There are wide-ranging traffic restrictions in the area of Aglona.
In order to ensure the safety of the participants of the Most Holy Virgin Mary Heaven reception festival, from August 12 at 17.00 to August 15 at 18.00, road transit traffic on several national roads in the area of Aglona will be closed and informed by SJSC Latvian National Roads.
These restrictions will not apply to Aglona participants or public transport.
It should be noted that on the P62 Krāslava-Preili-Madona road, from Kraslava to Krāslava station (0.80-4.00 km) construction works are taking place and the construction site of Aglona can only be crossed by public transport and pedestrians.
For other road users traffic will be ensured along the touring road - the scheme in the attached file.
Traditionally, there is a large number of visitors to these festivals, including the pilgrims.
Therefore, drivers need to be particularly careful, as in the various road routes towards Aglona there will be an intense pedestrian movement.
We invite drivers to be aware of the traffic restrictions introduced, to follow the arrangements of the traffic organisation, as well as of the longer time spent on travel.
The water temperature in all water bodies slipped below +20 degrees.
The drop in water temperature continues with the cool weather, and currently in all rivers and lakes, as well as in the sea, it is below +20 degrees, according to the data of the Latvian Centre for Environment, Geology and Meteorology.
The sea has cooled to +16.+18 degrees, the wind of the Gulf of Riga on the west coast has moved to +13 degrees, and in Paradise, to +9 degrees.

The insurer pays compensation to the passengers of the air carrier cancelled at the airport on Wednesday.
If Insurance paid a travel insurance fee to a family on Wednesday 10 August at Riga Airport, the cancelled airline, for which it was necessary to give up the planned music festival visit.
On 11 August, If Insurance from a client, an application for reimbursement was received.
The family planned to go to the music festival in Belgium, but because of the air carriers cancelled at the airport on Wednesday it was impossible to calculate the customer's remuneration for the accommodation reservation, which could no longer be cancelled, as well as the purchase of the festival tickets EUR 204.
On the other hand, the customers have promised to pay the airline the money they spent on plane tickets.
If Insurance of all travel insurance payments is paid out on average 15 % of travel costs for suspension or cancellation.
“In such cases, expenses are reimbursed for purchase, return or exchange of tickets, as well as for reservation of accommodation,” says Dagnia Rutka, the head of the insurance risk insurance person insurance product.
As we know, on the evening of 10 August, a private aircraft stopped at Riga Airport due to technical problems of the runway, so several departing flights were cancelled and several incoming flights had to be diverted to other airports.
Because of the repair of the village, the man is placed on a broken ceiling and forced to leave his house.
On the 4th studio of the LTV program, Dmitri Saidjashev, whose neighbor has started to repair his apartment, and since then, Dmitri from the ceiling cares for settlement and is not sure that it is safe to stay in the apartment.
The problem is that my neighbors carried out an arbitrary construction and that my apartment has damaged the ceiling.
Then I inform the Riga Construction Board, the house manager and other organizations.
The Construction Board said that we are not an operational service and we have no expert.
“The owner of a lawyer must enter the Latvian Engineers Union, and there will be an expert from there.
The invited expert came, recorded the situation and admitted that the cover was in a unsatisfactory state.
But months have passed since the first Dmitry's application in the construction board, and by the beginning of this week, no one was able to answer whether the location of the apartment was life threatening.
The Construction Board said this is legislation, wait if you are not satisfied, write to everyone in a row.
“It was written to the Riga City Council, but they sent the house manager, then the house manager is back to the construction board, and then there is a deadlock.
After reviewing the entire pile of paper, it is clear that the construction work has been stopped, although you may hear that someone is working there.
The apartment owner, who carries out repairs, must carry out an examination within a further two months and must remedy all these defects within six months.
An independent expert has drawn up his opinion, but the construction board considers it incomplete and superficial.
The expert has not indicated whether the metal grid in this fixed construction has been affected, so it is not certain that the owner of the lower apartment is in danger.
“This is why we have requested further clarification from this expert,” says Ilze Žūka, representative of Riga City Construction Board.
Despite the ban on any repairs in the upper apartment, it is still heard from there that construction continues.
The penalties for construction without a permit are between 70 and 700 euros, but in this case the penalty may be much worse.
While the expert's opinion is expected, the construction board has decided that both apartments must not be exploited - in which the construction works are carried out, and in Dmitry's apartment.
“This is the case in the practice of the construction board when, because of its ignorance or simply unwillingness, the residents may have endangered not only the owner of their property but also the owner of the lower property, as a result of which this owner cannot exploit his property – says the representative of the construction board.
Now Dmitry wants to look for another place to live with relatives, friends, hotel or to rent another apartment.
But he can try to recover the damage from his neighbor’s civil procedure, which can take a lot of time.
Because of arbitrary construction, it is now prohibited to stay in both apartments until the builder gives his conclusion, and it may have to wait for even three weeks.
The damage caused will have to be borne by the owner of the apartment where repairs have taken place.
The owner of this apartment is threatened with imprisonment for a period of up to six months because of the lack of regard given by the construction board.

The conversion of the former Ķemeri sanatorium into five-star hotels will cost €22 million.
The conversion of former Ķemeri sanatorium into a five-star hotel by Park Hotel Ķemeri will cost 22 million euros, LETA tells the agency’s representative Gita Gelve, the manager of the future hotel.
The hotel is the first stage of reconstruction of the former sanatorium of Ķemeri.
The second stage will be a wellness- or well-being clinic scheduled to be opened in 2022, while the opening of the hotel is scheduled for May 2018.
Gelve notes that the exact costs of the clinic are not yet known at present.
However, she points out that it will be found in the polyclinical building of the former Kemeri resort, which has an area of about 12,000 square meters.
The clinic will be located on three floors.
“The Park Hotel Ķemeris and the owner of the planned clinic are the international fund “G Capital Europe” that invests in European assets.
“G Capital Europe – the owners of a number of investors who invest in this fund, says Gelve.
As said earlier, G Capital Europe, CEO George Jones, is planning to invest between EUR 12 and 15 million in the polyclinic design of the former resort, with a total investment of over EUR 30 million.
It has already been announced that in renovating the cultural-historical park in more than 42 hectares, connecting roads and street sections, building an interactive natural tourism object, improvement of the territory and parking on Emila Dūdiņa Street, which will contribute to the socio-economic development of Jurmala city and increase the number of tourists, Jurmala City Council plans to attract EUR 14.5 million from the European Union funds, co-financed by three to four million euros.
Design works are planned for mid-2017, but works and arrangement works will start in the autumn of next year.
As reported earlier, the historic sanatorium-Ķemeri is planned to build a five-star hotel, Park Hotel Ķemeri, and “wellness” or wellness clinic.
However, the reconstruction lasted.
The 2010 annual report also stated that Ominasis – in regular communication with hotel operator Kempinski – continued to provide daily technical control at the sanatorium Ķemeri – and that the reconstruction of the future hotel Ķemeri – was expected to be completed already in 2011 and that the preparatory work on the opening of the chain of Kempinski was immediately launched.
In October 2014, the readiness to buy the insolvent “Ominasis Latvia” property held by Ķemeri sanatorium at the auction was confirmed by “Park Hotel Ķemeri” but a month later the auction was recognised as not having happened because the winner had not paid for the purchase within the set time.
The sale price was determined on the basis of the starting price of the last tender, i.e. EUR 2.86 million.
As the agency LETA informed Ieva Aile, a representative of the city council, the municipality, by signing a protocol, that with co-financing support from the European Union structural funds, the infrastructure will be re-established by the historical Ķemeri park, created interactive nature tourism sites, clean roads and parking places.

Former NATO commander Bridlov's e-mail was broken by Russian hacker.
Hackers who broke the computers of the National Committee of Democrats (DNC) in the United States may have carried out several other cyber attacks, also broken the e-mail of the former NATO European Force Philip Bridlov and the Open Society Server of George Soros, the business news agency “Bloomberg” reported on Thursday
Hackers published their acquired information on the «DCLeaks.com» website.
The Brudlov correspondence and information on the work of the Soros Institute were also placed there.
The hackers have been available on the Institute's computers for a whole year.
According to Bloomberg, news of these cyber attacks were carried out by hackers related to Russian services who broke DNC's e-mails.
The Wall Street Journal, in turn, reports that the US President Baraka Obama's administration is currently dealing with the issue of imposing new sanctions on Russia in response to the DNC computer charges.
In order to impose sanctions, the administration will have to make a formal cyber attack against the servers of the Democratic Party of Russia or the hackers supported by the Russian authorities.
As reported, the WikiLeaks web site published in July around 20,000 emails from the DNC computer system and it is clear that the leaders of the Democratic Party have tried to harm the campaign of the Vermont Senator Children Sanders, who was a candidate for Hilary Klintone, who had been the candidate for the campaign to fight against the start of Democrats in presidential elections.
According to the US press sources, the Federal Investigation Office, which carries out investigations into democratic servers, as well as other US specs, considers that Russia's connection with the cyber attack is beyond doubt.
Macartney: The Beatles was threatened by the presence of Joko Ono
Paul Macartney acknowledged that the presence of Yoko Ono caused a sense of danger to the legendary group The Beatles.
A 74-year-old rock star is now maintaining a good relationship with the widow of the late John Lenon, but she frightened at the recording studio when she visited the group, as Ono was the only woman among the group members, George Harison, Ringo Stara, Lenon and Macartney.
When the singer asked about both relationships, he replied to the Rolling Stone: “It’s really good.
We were in danger at that time.
While we recorded, she was sitting on the boosters.
This could not be tolerated by most of the group.
We managed it, but it was not very successful because we were very tense.
We weren't sexists, but girls usually didn't attend a recording studio, they let us work.
When John began to meet Yoko, she did not sit in the control room, but in the middle of our four.
The author of the Green Submaline also admitted that she had regular contacts with the former Ringo group member, and at any time confirms her study ‘Apple’ work plans, but in any other way, the ‘Beatles’ has finished working.
Asked if he still meets another member of the legendary band living with him, Macartney told the magazine Rolling Stone: “Never
We meet at social events and parties.
But I don’t attend meetings, but I feel a little isolated from it.
I left Apple during my difficult divorce.
Instead, I sent John Eastman to the meetings and said: “Tell me what everyone says because I can’t suffer sitting at that table.
It was too painful to see our pet die.
The company is now working in such a way that I just listen to all the records.
I am part of the approval process.
NASA Climate Model: Venera has ever been an residential planet
Based on the latest NASA climate models, Veera has once been an residential planet.
Researchers of the NASA Godard Space Research Institute have developed a model to explore the history of Venezuela through tools and algorithms that are also used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether or not the atmosphere of Venera, with a hot, no water-free surface and almost exclusively carbon-free atmosphere, had some conditions similar to the Earth.
Scientists have mentioned before that the slow rate of rotation of Venezuela is due to a dense atmosphere.
Recent simulations, however, show that we had a plan, that is, a slow turn to the Earth.
The model also looks at the former topography of Veneras.
There were more dry areas on the planet than on the planet, but there were enough water and geographical diversity to prevent life and evaporation.
In the early times of Veera, the sun was 30 percent brighter.
In the simulation of the GISS model, the Venetian rotation pattern reveals that the bright part of the day on it lasts 2 months, explained GISS scientist Antony Del Genio in the press release.
This process warms the planet’s surface and causes a rain that forms thick layers of clouds that act as a umbrella to protect the planet from the heat of the sun.
The result is a moderate climate temperature, which is actually a few degrees lower than the earth’s temperature today.
The model depicts the history of Venezuela, which is similar to the theory of evolution developed by scientists in their hypotheses.
Despite the fact that it was once inhabited, Vänera had been exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet rays for several billions of years.
Its oceans were evaporated, and ultraviolet rays burned the spirits.
As the water completely evaporated, the couples remained just a thin atmosphere of carbon dioxide with deadly greenhouse gas - Venera, as we know today.
Researchers published the results of the new Venetian climate model in the journal “Geophysical Research Letters –
Patrick Roy resigns from Avalanche’s trainer
On Thursday, Patrik Roy, a trainer and vice president of the hockey operation, submitted a prayer, pointing out the insufficient impact of the team's decision-making process.
The Vice President and General of Colorado, Joe Sakiks, confirmed this message and informed him that the club would immediately start looking for a new coach.
“For the last three years, I have been energetic, enthusiastic and purposefully performing my duties as a principal trainer and as the Vice President of the Choke of the Colorado Club, ” says a statement from the 50-year-old Roy.
During this summer, I have thought a lot about how I could improve my team performance in order to give it the flexibility it needs and achieve a higher level of performance.
To achieve this, the visions of the chief trainer and vice president of the hockey operations must be fully consistent with those of the organisation.
He must also have the opportunity to influence decisions relating to team performance.
At present, these conditions are not met.
Saycik, who hired Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
Saying that Patrick informed him of his decision today.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organization and want him the best of it in the future.
In his first season with Avalanche, a team in 2013-2014, Roy was declared the best coach in the League and received the Jack Adams Prize.
He helped the club reach 112 points and the first place in the Central Division, but in the first round of the exclusion games Colorado team won the Minnesota hockeyi. Since then, the club has not had access to the exclusion games for two years.
“Avalanche” concluded the 2015-2016 season with a result of 39-39-4, leaving five points behind “Wild” teams without obtaining a second special invitation from the organisers of the Western Conference.
Hall gatekeeper Roy won four Stanley Cups in his career, two with Montreal-Canadene, and two with Avalanche-
Workers on the North Sea Oil Platform resume conversations and strikes
The workers' strikes on the North Sea oil platforms have been rewarded, as both parties in the dispute resume negotiations and are told by the negotiators.
Periodically, the Wood Group is engaged in strikes on the North Sea Oil Platforms, which are owned by \"Royal Dutch Shell\"
The joint statement states that the \"Wood Group\" and \"United States\" and \"RRT\" trade unions agreed to resume negotiations on the resolution of the dispute.
Over the coming weeks, a number of full-day meetings are scheduled to begin at the beginning of next week with the aim of re-examination of problematic issues.
The trade unions have said that their recent measures, organised after more than 25 years of interruption, are against the planned 30% cut in wages.
Due to negative market pressures, Wood Group has reduced salaries to North Sea workers by 9 percent this year.
Already in 2014, the company reduced the salaries of land workers by 10 percent.
The company explains that additional wage cuts would allow the company to survive the decline in the market.
Shell, for its part, has already reduced salaries to thousands of people and announced plans to stop oil and natural gas in 10 countries in order to optimise its work in preparing for a large-scale merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of falling oil prices, and the UK's decision to leave the European Union is all the more complicated.
At the beginning of the week, the Scottish Member Dave Anderson met workers' representatives to discuss one of the most important issues: the plans for strikes in the North Sea.
He said the North Sea is vital for the region's economy.
He explained in his report that the North Sea and the country as a whole need an economy that benefits all but not individuals.
In 2016, the new North Sea projects are expected to invest almost $1,4 billion, compared to $7 billion invested over the last five years.
Kepler measures the speed of the beam of the stars in the Fleeing Star.
The latest Kepler Telescope mission has helped astronomers to compile the most complete catalogue about the speed of star rotation in the Pleajade Star.
The new data helps astronomers to understand why stars turn to different speeds in this star, as well as how the speed of star rotation can be attributed to the formation of planets.
“We hope that when we compare our results with other stars, we will get more information about the relationship between the mass, age and the history of the star, even its solar system, in the news release Pasadena Caltech Infrasarkano Process and the analytical center scientist Luis Rebula.
The flat star is 445 light years away from the Earth.
Many stars in this constellation are just beginning to grow, reaching about 125 million years of age.
They shall be rotated at the maximum speed.
These growing stars emit a large amount of star wind at the maximum speed.
When winds reach the star magnetic field, they stop the stars.
As the stars grow older, their rate of rotation decreases.
Kepler measures the rate of rotation of each star by determining the time between the occurrence of a recognized star area such as a solar spot.
The latest navigation rate catalogue suggests that larger stars turn slower than smaller stars.
The Rebula compares the stars with the dancers, the larger the height of the dancers perform the pyramids slower than the small height of the dancers.
The results tell us that the Plejede-ballet shows that slowly rotating objects are larger and more massive, while faster rotating objects are very small stars.
Thanks to its proximity, the Fleege Star serves as an excellent space laboratory where you can compare the star characteristics with the speed of rotation.
The results tell us that the Fleader Star helps to create theoretical models for the rotation of stars in both directions for older and younger stars.
We still need to learn a lot how, when and why the speed of star rotation is slowing down and about the complete stopping process.
The Rebul and his colleagues presented in detail the analysis of the Fleeing Stars' Speed in three new publications, which will be published shortly in the Astronomy Journal.
