Assembly members (AMs) are worried about being perceived as a mum.
Some members of the Assembly are concerned by the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament – Member of the Wales Parliament).
This is due to plans to change the name of the assembly to “Welsh Parliament” (Welsa Parliament).
The whole political spectrum of AM is worried that it can make them a laughing object.
One Labour Party AM explained that their group was concerned by the words ‘Twp’ and ‘Pwp’.
For non-Welsa readers: for Wales, ‘twp’ means ‘unity’, but ‘pwp’ means ‘kat’
Parties Plaid AM indicated that none of the groups was satisfied and that alternatives had been proposed.
The representative of the Conservative Party of Wales admitted that their group was ready to consider the change of name, but added that \"MWP - very similar to that of Muppet - which means -
In this context, it should be borne in mind that the Hebrew letter -w - is being spoken in a similar way to the capital of Yorkshire -
The Assembly panel, which is currently working on a change in the title of the draft law, informed: “The final decision on what terms will be used to designate the members of the Assembly, of course, must be taken by the members of the assembly themselves.
The 2017 Act of the Government of Wales granted to the Wales Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation, which received broad support for changing the name of the assembly to the Wales Parliament.
As regards the title of AM, the Commission preferred the Welsh Parliamentary Member (Welsh Parliament Member – WMP), but the MWP received the highest support for the public consultation.
The AM explicitly recommends alternative options, but the fight for an agreement can be a headache to Ellin Jones, the Assembly Spicker, who is expected to present a draft law on the changes in the coming weeks.
The draft amending law will also include other changes to the work of the assembly, including the laws on the disqualification of AM and the structure of committees.
The AM final vote on how they will be called will take place once the legislation has been discussed.
Macedonians go to vote in referendum on change of name
The voters will vote on Sunday whether their country's name will be changed to \"The Republic of Northern Macedonia -\"
The people's vote was organised to resolve the decades of disagreements with neighbouring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the northern neighbour gives an impression of claims on its territory and has on several occasions objected to Macedonia's request to be accepted by the EU and NATO.
The President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, one of the opponents of the plebiscitis, declared that he ignored the vote.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is simply a thing that needs to be done to join the EU and NATO.
The Church of St. Martins calls to silence the Church of Harlem for existence.
“As I’ve talked to the elderly people, they used to be at every corner of the bar and church, ” says Mr. Adams.
“There are no more now –
He admits that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
“People are socializing today in other ways, ” he said.
“There are no more nearby living rooms visited regularly by people.
Speaking even to the gods, he is worried that the money that he receives from the sale of property will end earlier than the leaders hope. And sooner or later they will have returned to the beginning.
He added that it would be possible to replace the apartment buildings with apartment properties that will accommodate people who will not help the rest of the temples around them.
“The vast majority of people who will buy apartments in these buildings will be white, ” he explained, “and this brings the church closer to the day when it will be closed forever, because most of the people who will come into these properties are unlikely to become members of these churches.
Both churches were built by a white congregation before Harlem became a black metropolis, a community of Metropolitan in 1870, and St. Martins 10 years later.
The original white - methoded congregation abandoned its building in the 1930 ’ s.
The building was taken over by a black congregation that worshipped God right next to it.
The black congregation of St. Martins’ Church took over his blessing during John Howard Johnson. He was at 125th Street, in the main shopping street at Harlem, led a boycott of workers retailers who had refused to recruit or provide promotion.
In 1939 the building was seriously damaged by fire, but as members of the congregation of Father Johnson planned to rebuild the building, they ordered a call game.
His blessing was David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson, and his successor in St. Martin’s congregation, proudly called the ringing game, for the calls of poor people.
The expert who played this call game in July used other words: “A treasure of culture” and “an indispensable historical instrument”
Experts Tifany Ng from Michigan University added that it was the first call game in the world played by a black musician Dionisio A. Lind who moved 18 years ago to a bigger bell game at the Riversaid Church.
Mr Merriweather said that the St. Martin's congregation did not replace him.
The events of the last few months around the Church of St. Martins were reflected in the mixed relations between architects and contractors, some of whom were attracted to the secular authority and others by the episcopical diocese of the church.
In July, the early leaders of the congregation wrote to the diocese, fearing that the diocese would try to pass on the costs to the board, even though the council had not been involved in hiring the architects and contractors sent to the diocese.
Some in the congregation complained of a lack of transparency in the diocese.
Shark wound 13-year-old lobster in the fishing area
On Saturday in California, a 13-year-old boy was attacked and injured by lobsters. It was the first day of the lobster season, the services.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m., near the beach of Beacon's Beach in the city of Encinita.
Chad Hammel informed KSWB-TV Sandjego that he and his friends on Saturday morning were nuri for about half an hour, when he heard that the boy was called for help, and then he and the group got out of the water to help him withdraw the boy.
Hammel explained that at first he thought that it was simply a gratifying of the lobster he had caught, but then he realized that the boy was screaming.
My Saxo
The whole bone of his key was broken, ” said Hammel, who immediately noticed it when he got to the boy.
“I scream that everyone casts water, ” Hammel adds, “There is a shark in the water.
By air, the boy was sent to Sandjego, a child in Rayy, where his condition was considered critical.
The attacked shark is not known.
The rescue chief Larry Giles informed the media that a few weeks before the shark was observed in the area, but it was found not to be a dangerous species for humans.
He added that the victim had suffered the upper part of the torso.
Officials for the purpose of the investigation time and safety were closed for 48 hours in the city of Ponto Beach in Casablad, until Swami's (Swami's) Ensinita (Encitas) for the city.
Jail pointed out that more than 135 shark species are present in this area, but most are not considered dangerous.
“Sanesbury’s – plans to print into the UK beauty industry market
“Sanesbury’s” is going to attack “Boots” and “Debenhams” with a pool of store style shelves and trained salesmen.
As part of a significant investment in the UK's 2,8 billion pound beauty market, which continues to grow, although fashion goods and household items are decreasing, 11 shops in the country will try bigger shelves of beauty products, and if everything goes well, there will be more stores next year.
In the beauty industry, money is invested when supermarkets are looking for opportunities to use the shelves they used for TVs, microwave ovens and household goods.
\"Sanesbury's\" informed me that I would double my offer in beauty to up to 3000 products, including brands such as \"Revlon\" – \"Essie\" – \"Tweezerman\" – and, for the first time, \"Dr. PawPaw \"
Existing lines from \"L'Oreal--Maymalline- and \"Burt's Bees\" will also receive more space with branded areas like those in \"Boots\" shops.
The supermarket also re-markets its ‘Boutique’, a decorative cosmetic line, with the vast majority of products being vegan-friendly, increasingly demanded by young customers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop, its wholesaler, tried the concession in two Sainsbury stores, the first of which was opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second will be opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and small food purchases every day at local shops mean that supermarkets need to invest more to convince people to visit.
“Sanesbury’s, Executive Director Mike Coupe, has said that retail outlets will become more and more similar to supermarkets, as the chain of shops is trying to deal with discount shops – Aldi – and Lidl – offering a wider range of services, but without food.
“Sanesbury’s – has been located in “Argos – trading sites in hundreds of stores and has opened several “Habitat” since he bought both chains two years ago, which is claimed to have improved the sales of the goods and made them more profitable.
The supermarket’s previous attempt to improve its beauty and pharmaceutical departments ended with defeat.
“Sanesbury’s, a joint venture with “Boots”, tried in the early 2000s, but the union collapsed after a dispute, how to distribute income from pharmacy shops in supermarkets.
The new strategy develops after Sansbury, which 3 years ago sold its 281 store to the owner of the major pharmaceutical business Celesio--Lloyds Pharmacy-chain, for GBP 125 million.
According to this plan, \"Lloyds\" will be able to complement the assortment with a wide range of exclusive skin care products, including \"Roche-Posay-un-Vichy\" in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, a commercial director, said: “In order to improve the consumer’s environment, we changed the look and impression of the shelves of our beauty products.
We have also invested the funds of specially trained colleagues who will always be prepared to make a recommendation.
Our brand range has been designed to meet all needs, but an attractive environment with a convenient location means that we are now a charming goal on our way to beauty, a goal that challenges shopping habits so far.
Peter Jones-nicity is full, after Holly Willoubby refuses a GBP 11 million deal
“Dragon Den, Peter Jones star, took away the fury. After the TV programme manager Holly Willoughby refused to sell 11 million pounds with his lifestyle to pay attention to his new contracts with Marks and Spencer, and ITV.
Vilouby has no time to devote his homewear and accessories to the “Truly” brand
The pair business was compared with the Gwyth Paltrow brand of Goop-
“This Morning, a 37-year-old programme manager, used Instagram to announce she was going away.
Holly Vilouby has left, Dragon Den, a star of Peter Jones, out of their profitable lifestyle brand business at the last moment, to pay full attention to their new huge contracts with Marks & Septemberer and ITV.
Sources of information say that Jones was “blankful ”: when a TV gold girl was tighted down on Tuesday at his business empire's residence in Marlow, Buckinghamshire announced that her new contracts worth up to £1.5 million mean that she no longer had time to devote to their homewear and accessories brand “Truly-1”
The company was compared with the Goop brand of Guineta Platrov and, according to a hint, it will double the increase in Vilouby’s wealth, estimated at GBP 11 million.
When Viloubia (37) used Instagram to announce that he left the Trily - Jones away from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
According to the source of information, “Truly ” was the most important priority of Holly.
This should have become her long-term future, dedicated to the next decade.
Her decision to withdraw surprised all involved unprepared.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday: everything was so close to the start.
The warehouse in the center of Marlow is full of ready-to-sale goods:
The experts believe that the “This Morning” manager, who is one of the most financially profitable stars, can pay away millions of money to the company, as a lot of money has been invested in various products, from pillows and candles to clothing and goods for the house, and will delay their placing on the market even more.
And that can mean the end of a long friendship.
Three children’s mother, Vilouby, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have maintained close contact with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for 10 years.
Viloubia-Truly, together with Kepa, was established in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined in March as Chairman.
Both couples spend their holiday together, and Jones owns 40 % of the shares in Boldvina TV production company.
Vilouby has to become the Ambassador of the M&S brand, and she will replace Ant McPartlin as the head of ITV-I'm A Celebry.
A source close to Jones yesterday stated: “We don’t want to comment on his business-
A serious conversation -- and then we fell in love --
He spoke of criticisms that will be received from news companies about a comment that some may find to be “unsubstantiated to the President ” and about his favourable attitude towards the leader of North Korea.
Why is the President of the Republic as much as he has refused?
Trump said in his fine-knowledge dictator's voice.
\"I did not give up
He pointed out that Kim had shown interest in meeting one more time after Trump’s initial meeting in June was acknowledged as a great step towards North Korea’s denuclearisation in Singapore.
But the negotiations on denuclearisation have stopped.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, one of North Korea’s main diplomats, Ri Yong Ho, informed world leaders in the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see the U.S. response, to North Korea’s initial steps towards disarmament.
Instead, he pointed out that the US continues to be subject to sanctions aimed at maintaining tensions.
Tramp was much more optimistic.
“We have a great relationship with North Korea, ” he said.
“We were going to fight North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
We now have this wonderful relationship
He said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim had produced positive results: halting missile testing, helping prisoners to free themselves, and returning the rest of the American soldiers home.
He also defended his extraordinary approach to relations with Kim.
“There is a simple impression of the President, but instead of standing out for 10,000 people trying to get into this area, we have 200, here,” said Trump, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
The tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed the island, killing hundreds of people
After the Lomboka earthquake, foreign non-governmental organisations, for example, were told that their assistance was not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombardas were displaced, national disaster situations were not declared, but are needed to trigger foreign aid.
\"Unfortunately, in many cases, they made it very clear that they did not ask for international assistance, so it is a certain problem.
Although “Save your children with a group to travel to Pala, it is still unclear whether foreign workers will be allowed to work there.
The representative of the National Disaster Agency, Mr Sutopo, explained that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palau to see if international agencies could contribute to helping.
Given that earthquakes occur regularly in Indonesia, the country is still extremely negative in nature.
Although the cunami of shelters have been established in Aceh, this is rarely seen along other shores.
The fact that Pala was not alerted by the tsunami, though the warning was valid, is likely also affected by the death of the people.
Even in the most favourable times, movement between the many islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The ship-distributed hospital in Lombarda to treat the victims of the earthquake now goes to Palau, but it will take at least three days to reach the victims of the new plague.
President Joko Widododo has made the infrastructure that has been destroyed by Indonesia a central point in his election campaign, and he has allocated large amounts to roads and railways.
However, the lack of resources has shocked the Jockian administration and is expected to be re-election next year.
In addition, he has to struggle with the protracted problem of tensions between the sects of Indonesia, where the Muslim majority have accepted one of the conservative forms of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands driven out of their homes, while Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets using matchhunts, bows, arrows, and other primitive weapons.

Kromvel's statue in Parliament is becoming the most recent scandal of rewrite of history
It would be ethically justified in view of the Taliban's similar activities that led to so many monuments of English culture and religion being destroyed by his fanatical Puritan followers.
However, Mr. Crick’s initiative was described by the Kromwell Society as “the clumsy, and the attempt to rewrite history. ”
John Goldsmith, president of the Kromwell Society, said: “In view of the current debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Kromvel outside the Palace of Westminster will also become a goal.
Kromvel himself did not command, nor did he implement, the destruction of the Scriptures during the wars of British citizens.
The wrong Kromvel may be sacrificed because of his ancestor centuries earlier, Thomas’s actions.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s beautiful picture of Kromwell’s position in the 19th century is part of the historiography as a person, which many believe is still worthy of praise.
Mr Goldsmith informed the Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell was probably more than today at the end of the 19th century, and he was seen as an advocate of parliament against external pressure, which, of course, was a monarchy in his case.
Historic discussions continue as to whether it really is a completely rich picture of the theme.
It is clear that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century established the future of our nation, and Kromwell is, as such, a recognized person representing one of the parts of the separation at the time.
His achievement as a protector of the Lord is worthy of praise and mention
Pig-slaughter to death ruins the farmer in China
According to information, in the local media, the pig market in south-west China attacked and killed a farmer.
He was found dead in an inverted artery, everything in one blood at a pighouse in a market in the province of Yuizhou, in the province of Guizhou, in Liupanshou, reported on Sunday to “South China Morning Post ”
The pigs are ready to inject the vaccine into the pig basin in Xining on 30 May 2005 in the province of China (Quinghai).
He and his cousin are reportedly coming from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, his cousin found a man dead and found that the door of the nearby pighouse was open.
He said that a large male with blood on his mouth was in the pig shed.
According to information, the judicial investigation confirmed that 550 pounds (~249 kg) the heavy lawn had broken the farmer.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and maimed, ” said my cousin, “only his name Wu is mentioned, ” writes Guiyang Evening News.
The safety camera material showed how Juan entered the market on Thursday at about 4.40 p.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal who killed Juan did not belong to him or to his cousin.
The market manager informed the Evening News that the lawn was turned on to prevent it from attacking others while the police collected evidence instead of the event.
According to information, Juan's family and market management discusses compensation for his death.
Despite the rare nature of these events, other human attacks on pigs are known.
In 2016, the pig attacked a woman and a man on their farm in Massachusetts, resulting in critical injuries.
Ten years ago, 650 pounds (~295 kg) in the heavy pig in Wales kept the farmer forced to the tractor until the animal was afraid of his wife.
After the farmers in Oregon at the end of 2012, his pig, a farmer in Manitoba-CBC News, explained that the pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of the blood can act as a pistol shot.
\"They're just playable.
They like to inflect, they're very curious... they don't want you to hurt.
You just have to show them enough respect, he said.
The conclusion of Orkana Rose brings extensive and powerful things to the southwest U.S.
As predicted, the orcan Rosa will weaken as it passes across the coldest waters on the north coast of Mexico.
However, in the next few days, Rose will bring floodwaters to the north and southwest of Mexico.
At five o’clock in the afternoon (after the Eastern North American time) the wind of Rose reached 143 km/h (85 miles per hour) corresponding to the order of Category 1 and the point was 620 km (385 miles) southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rose is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the low-pressure area, moving eastward to the east coast of the United States, is forming above the Pacific. The roses with the tropical wind power approaching the Basij California Peninsula, will begin Monday to start the mass of moisture deep from the tropical strip to the north-west of the United States.
Rose in the Monday part of Mexico will bring up to 10 inches (~25.4 cm) rain.
Then tropical moisture, interacting with the approaching low pressure margin, will form a wide area of strong rain in the South West in the coming days.
The rains (~2.6-2.2 cm) will cause dangerous sudden floods, mud currents and possibly landslides in the desert.
The moisture will cause heavy rain from the tropical strip, which will reach between 2 and 3 inches (~5.1 to 4.6 cm) per hour, especially in the southern and Arizona parts of Nevada.
In some southwest, especially in most Arizona, rain is expected up to 24 inches (~5.2 – 3.1 cm).
Suddenly, floods with a rapid deterioration of the state due to the spread of tropical rain are possible.
It is very unpopular to go into the desert because of the threat of tropical rain.
Strong rain canyons can be converted into rapid rivers, but the storms will bring local red winds and sand storms.
As the low pressure came near, it would bring local heavy things to parts of the coastline of southern California.
Rains are possible, which together will exceed half an inch (~1.3 cm), leading to small mud flows and slippery roads.
This will be the region's first rainwater in the wet season.
Arizona will start to approach late Sunday and early Monday before the rain takes over the larger territory late Mondays and early Tuesdays.
Strong rain will spread on Tuesday in the Four-Sights region (DR Colorado, DA Juta, NA Arizona and DR New Mexico) and will last all Wednesday.
In October, there is a potential for intense temperature fluctuations throughout the United States, since the Arctic is in decline, but the tropicals are still relatively warm.
This sometimes leads to dramatic changes in temperature over a short distance.
This is an example of dramatic temperature differences on Sunday in the central part of the United States.
The difference between the temperature of the city of Kansas, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and the temperature of Senluis, and De Moines, in Aiowa, differing by almost 20 degrees.
The next days will try to develop and expand lasting summer heat.
Most of the US central and eastern parts of the beginning of October are expected to be warm, reaching temperatures of 80 or more degrees (after Farenheit; ~27 degrees Celsius) in large areas from the southern plains to the northeast.
The temperature in New York City on Tuesday could reach 80 degrees (after Farenheit; ~27 degrees Celsius), which would have exceeded the average by about 10 degrees.
Our long-term climate forecasts show a high probability that in the first half of October the temperature in the east of the US is going to exceed average.
More than 20 million people were watching the Breta Kaveno case
More than 20 million people on Thursday six television channels were watched with passion, as evidenced by Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the candidate of the Supreme Court, who accused Kaveno of sexual harassment, which, as a woman claims, took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political consensus of Jeff Flake, organised by Arizona Senator, on the fact that FBI will investigate the accusations for a week, continued.
Forda informed the Board of Justice of the Senate that she is absolutely convinced that Kaveno had a drink around him and tried to wear clothes during the high school party.
Kaveno irresistibly showed that he was absolutely sure that this was not the case.
According to the Nielsen report, 20.4% of people watched it all on Friday.
The companies CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel – and MSNBC registered medium-sized audience interest.
Data on other broadcasters, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, which demonstrated this was not immediately available.
And “Nielsen, ” usually comes up with problems when it comes to reading people who are watching in the offices.
In order to get a better picture, this number of viewers corresponds to the number of shutdown games or “Oscar” ceremony watchers.
“Fox News Channel, whose commentators were determined to support the appointment of Kaveno, was the largest audience, with an average of 5,69 million full-day hearings, informed Nielsen about
ABC was the second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS attracted 3.1 million, 2.94 million NBC – 2.94 million, MSNBC – 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million – informed Nielsen –
The interest remained high after hearing.
Flake was the central figure of the Friday drama.
After the moderate republican team had published a statement that he would vote for the appointment of Kaveno, the senator noticed CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning, when he, accompanied by a suffocating cry, tried to get to the hearing of the Committee on Justice by means of a lift.
In live CNN, he stood for several minutes in a stained eye, as a dreaded one.
“I stand here, right in front of you,” said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told that “This belongs to power, while so many women are powerless...
Fleik explained that his team had made a statement and informed him that he had something else to say during the committee hearing before the elevator door closed.
Cable networks and the broadcasters reflected what was happening in live broadcasts several hours later, when the Committee on Justice was about to vote in favour of the nomination of Kaveno for a vote in the Senate.
However, Flake claimed that he would only do so if he knew that the FBI would deal with the accusations made against the candidate next week by a minority of Democrats.
Fleuka was partially convinced by the conversations with his friend C.E. Pastor of Democrats Chris Coon.
After negotiations with Koons and several more senators, Fleik made his decision.
The choice of Fleika was significant because it was clear that Republicans would not have a vote to approve Kaveno without an investigation.
President Trumps has commissioned the FBI to investigate the accusation against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Maya accuses critics of political competitions in the context of Brexita
In an interview with Prime Minister Tereza Meja, the Sunday Times, accused people who criticise her plan to leave the European Union of a future of British politics and the destruction of national interests.
The British Prime Minister Tereza Meja is attending the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, next to an interview with him on the first page of the paper, the former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Boris Johnson, continues to attack her Breksita's plan for future relations with the European Union, the so-called Chequers plan, stressing that the proposal for the United Kingdom and the EU to use each other's tariffs is absolutely absurd.

Diteon Simpson, aged 20, was arrested and arrested as accused of second grade murder, informed the Baton Rouge police station.
The officials produced a video showing Sams' clash with Simpson, and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during his fight.
WAFB, a subsidiary of the CBSS, reports that police glasses were found at the site of the crime and that Simponi blood was found on them.
After a examination of Simponi, the police informed him that he had recognized Wade's shooting.
According to a lawyer, he was charged with $350,000 in security.
A team of the East Baton Rouge Parish court medical expert in Eastern Baton Rouge issued a provisional conclusion on Friday, which states that death was caused by a shot in the head that struck the neck.
The department thanked the Police Search Team of the State of Louisiana, the Stata Police Criminalist Laboratory, the Police of the University of South and the residents of the territory for their help in the investigation leading to arrest.
Joe Alleva, the director of sports at LSU, thanked the law enforcement over the area for their diligence and work on behalf of justice.
Sams was 20.
6 ft(~1,98 m) long attacker grew in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played basketball LSU.
In the last season he won, on average, 5.6 points in the game and 2.6 points in the coming balls.
On Friday morning, the LSU basketball coach Will Wade announced that the team had been “set up and performed on the death of Wade.
“This is what people always worry about, ” said Wade.
Volcano bursts over Mehiko
The ash raised from the Pocatepetla volcano has reached the southern vicinity of the capital of Mexico.
After an activity was observed in the crater and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded within 24 hours, the National Disaster Prevention Centre on Saturday warned Mexicans that they should not approach the volcano.

Police conflict with Catalonian separatists before the anniversary of the vote of independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the confrontation of independence-supporting protesters with the public order police and when thousands joined the demonstrations of opponents to celebrate the first anniversary of the polarising vote on separation in Catalonia.
A group of disguised supporters, delayed by the public order police, buried them with eggs and irrigated them to powder, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets that would normally be full of tourists.
The disagreements got out later, and the police used stacks to prevent them.
Several-hour groups of supporters of independence were involved in the confrontation with unitary protesters, who said: \"Unforgive and forgive Spain\"
Fourteen people were provided with medical help during protests, reports local newspapers.
One year after the referendum of 1 October, which Madrid declared illegal, but which was praised by the Catholics, the idea of independence in the area taken over remains very stressful.
The voters strongly expressed their independence, despite the low voter activity and those against separation, the majority of the votes were boycotting.
According to Catalonia's officials, nearly 1000 people were injured last year, when the police tried to stop voting at election posts throughout the region and broke out violent clashes.
The independent groups had been negativity on Friday night to prevent demonstrations in support of the state police.
The demonstration took place, but the demonstrators were forced to choose a different path.
Narkis Termes, 68-year-old electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, admitted that he no longer hopes that Catalonia would gain independence.
\"Last year, we experienced one of our best clear experiences.
I saw my parents ’ eyes full of tears over being allowed to vote, but now everything has stopped, he said.
Although the parties supporting the independence of Catalonia won the regional elections last year with a small but significant victory, these parties have fought to maintain their course this year, because several of the most well-known leaders have either emigration or arrested and await their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declarations of independence.
The 42-year-old engineer, Hoan Puig, who filmed the phone in support of the protest police, said that the conflict was curated by politicians on both sides.
“The tension is increasing, ” he said.
On Saturday, one of the nine Roman leaders of Catalonia, Uriol Junqueras, who since last year was in detention to a court, announced that he would stand as candidates for the elections to the European Parliament next year.
\"Careing in the European elections is the best way to expose the regressivity of democratic values and the repression that the Spanish Government has brought against us,\" he said.

Prior to this, the European League adopted the Vienna-Rapid on Thursday-Ranger
Meanwhile, Livingston – extended his series to six games without loss on the Division, and Kenny Miller, the chief coach, has still not tasted the defeat since last month.
“Livingston – not used against dull guests
The Holt team had to be led long before they got the names.
Scott Robinson broke out, but delayed his attempt at the gate, the attempt of Alan Lithgow after slipping his legs to prevent the Craig Halkett blow with his head above the gate line was unsuccessful.
The residents allowed the Rangers to play in their front of them, knowing that they would be able to stop guests at the planned locations.
And that's exactly how the crucial gates came up.
“Rangers, used a free touch, and Livingston, joined the corridor, Declan Gallagher and Robinson to provide the Menga, which hit and caught the gates from the middle of the zone.
At this stage, the Rangers managed the ball, but the protection of the guests proved to be irritable and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not particularly hindered.
This continued during the second half of the year, although Alfredo Morelos made Kelly rescue gates.
Scott Pitman’s attempt was interrupted by “Ranger, the integrity of the goalkeeper Alan McGregor, and Litgov lost his gate in a combination of Livingston.
In the Livingston zone, central bombs continued to emerge, and two calls for punishment were rejected after Halket fighting for the ball with the replacement Glenn Middleton and playing hand.
‘Fenomenal’ “Livingston” performance analysis
Scottish BBC Alsdair Lamont on Tony Maþi Arena
Phenomenal-Livingston, performance and result.
Each of them was excellent, continuing to outgrow the hope, improving the performance.
Their game style and personalities have practically not changed since the return to the highest eschelon, but great praise is deserved by Holt for the way he has joined the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great, maintaining first-hand organizational protection, while Menga made sure Connor Goldson and Joe Warrall always remain vigilant.
However, the Ranger lacked inspiration.
No matter how good they were at times under Gerard’s authority, they were far from these standards.
Their last ball was bored, only once they broke into the part of the host area, and it is essentially an invitation to the Awake!

Arizona is rarely suffering from tropical depression, but this is probably what will happen early in the week to come, when the orcian Rose, with the remaining force, moves across the desert southwest, creating a risk of a sudden flood.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued warnings on sudden floods on Monday and Tuesday to the western part of Arizona, to the southern and eastern part of Nevada, to the south-eastern part of California and to Yutai, including Feenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Soltleixi.
Rose's Tuesday is expected to move right over Phoenix when you arrive late Monday.
The National Meteorological Service at Fėniks Twitter record pointed out that since 1950, only “ten tropical cyclones kept tropical storms or depression in a radius of 200 miles (320 km) from Fēniks!
Katrina (1967) was an orcans of the AZ of 40 miles (65 km)
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 2-3 inches (~5.08-2.2 cm) rain, reaching 6 inches (15.24 cm) in some places.
The other south-western desert areas, including the central part of the Clinsh Mountains and the Great Basin, may receive between 1 and 2 inches (~2.54 – 1.08 cm) and reach 4 inches (~10.2 cm) at individual locations.
For those not at risk of sudden flooding, the rain in Rose can become a blessing because of the drought in the region.
Although flooding may be a very serious concern, some rain will probably be good because south-west is currently suffering from drought.
According to Drought Monitor, slightly over 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, which is the second higher category, reported by Weather.com.

Hundreds of people killed in the earthquake in Indonesia, and it is clear that the number of victims is rising
On Saturday, officials reported that at least 384 people were killed, many simply washed when giant waves tripled against the shores after a strong earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulavesi.
On Friday, hundreds of people were gathered at the festival at Palu on the beach, when high waves (18 ft) tripled against the shores of a chair, washing many into death and destroying everything that was on their way.
The tsunami broke out after a strong earthquake of 7.5 logs.
“When the threat arose yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not flee immediately, and they became victims, ” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, representative of the Indian Disaster Reduction Agency in Jakarta.
“The tsunami did not come on its own, it brought cars, logs and buildings, it glided everything on the ground, ” Nugoro said, adding that the tsunami had crossed the sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 mph).
“Many people climb into trees to save and survive, ” he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palau.
Photographs taken by Catholic agencies show many destroyed homes and shops, deformed and demolished bridges, and water-encouraged mosque.
After the twilights of the coastal city continued to shake on Saturday.
The earthquake series was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application, in the BPPT Communication, stressed that Friday’s massive earthquakes contained about 200 energy transfers in excess of the atom energy dumped by Hirosim during World War 2.
The location of the city in long, at the end of a narrow bay, is likely to reinforce the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho’s damage was described as “wide, ” and reported that thousands of houses, hospitals, shops, and hotels had collapsed.
He said that the bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under collapsed ruins, adding that 540 were injured and 29 were lost.
Nugroho acknowledged that the number and destruction of victims could be greater along the coastline of 300 km (190 miles) north of Pala, in an area named Dongala, close to the epicenter of the earthquake.
“ Communications were completely destroyed, no information was received from Dongal, ” informed Nugroho.
More than 300 000 people live there, reports the Red Cross, adding that its staff and volunteers go to the affected regions.
“It is a tragedy, but everything could be even worse, ” the organisation informed.
On Saturday, the Agency was widely criticised for not informing that the tsunami had struck Pala, although officials claimed that the waves arrived at the time of the announcement of the alert.
The video distributed over the social networks shows that a man on the top floor is desperately calling people to the bottom of the street to be able to approach a tsunami.
Within minutes, the water wall strokes to the shore by flushing the buildings and machines.
The news agency Reuter was unable to confirm immediately whether the material was real.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a serious loss of power supply, which turned off the communication Pala, making it difficult for officials to coordinate the rescue efforts.
Officials reported that the army had begun sending cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuists still need food and other items for the first time.
The city airport is only open to aid measures and will remain closed until October.
President Jock Widododo's evacuation centres, Pola, planned to visit them on Sunday.
Indonesia’s tsunami has more than 800 victims.
This is very bad.
Mr. Doseba said that \"World Vision - employees who successfully reached the town of Palu from Donggala, and now to be housed in the office yard, passed the scenes of destruction on their way.
“They told us that they saw many houses that were destroyed, ” he explained.
This is very bad.
Even when the relief teams were determined to organize assistance for the victims of the disaster, some complained that foreign aid workers were not allowed to go to Pala with great experience.
According to the Indonesian legislation, financing, resources and personnel of the overseas organisations will only be allowed if the disaster area is declared as a national disaster area.
This has not yet happened.
“It is still a disaster at provincial level, ” said Aulia Arriani, representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government declares, “OK, it is a national disaster, ” we will be able to accept international assistance, but this status has not yet been established.
When Pella arrived the second night after Friday earthquakes and tsunamis, friends and family members of the still unreinforced people continued to hope that their loved ones would become wonders that would make life more gloomy during natural disasters.
A small boy was pulled out from the runoff on Saturday.
On Sunday, the rescuers delivered the woman, who was pressed under the ruins for two days, next to the body of her mother.
Gendon Subandon, a team of Indonesian national paraaglapers, was prepared by two of the unimaginable paragliders of Asian games that took place this month before Indonesia.
Others from Roa Roa, trapped, including Mr Mandagi, were their students.
“As an experienced satellite, ” he said, “you’re teaching emotions in a burden.
Mr Gendon remembered that after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa, who had been on the satellite team, he desperately sent for hours - WhatsApp - reports to those who took part in the beach festival.
However, his reports resulted in only one gray mark, not two blue marks.
\"I said it meant that the reports didn't reach the addressee,\" he said.

The elected Mexican President promises not to use the army against the civilian population
The elected Mexican President, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, promised never to use the military force against the civilian population at a time when the 50th anniversary of the bloody refund for students is approaching.
Lopes Obrador promised that he would never use the army to suppress the Mexican people.
The army unit shot a peaceful demonstration on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements spread across Latin America.
Lopes Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to students and opening up more public universities.
He said that unemployment and a lack of educational opportunities attract young people into criminal gangs.
US should double funding for artificial intelligence
As China is becoming more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount of research in this field, explained by the investor and intellectual intelligence practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google.
Comments were made after various U.S. government bodies making announcements on artificial intelligence, although the U.S.A. as a whole lacks a strategy on artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China started its plan last year: its goal is to become the main country in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
“A two-year budget for artificial intelligence research will be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind the United States, and a further cardinal transformation in the field of artificial intelligence is expected, ” said Lee.
In an interview at CNBC this week, Lee told us that doubling funding could double the possibility of the next achievement in the field of artificial intelligence taking place in the United States.
Lī, whose book The AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order is “The Executive Director of the Creative Intelligence: China, the Silicon Valley and the World’s New Order,” this month published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, who has invested in one of the most significant artificial intelligence companies in China, Facebook+”.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked to create a system of artificial intelligence that would surpass the best American-Othello-1 (Reversi) player, but later on he was a leading employee of Microsoft Research and the president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lie admitted the previous technology competition organised by the US Government, such as “Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge ” and asked when the next one would be prepared to identify people with ideas for the future.
\"Scientists in the United States often have to work very hard to get government grants, a picture of Lee.
“ China is not attracting leading scientists, but the big companies, ” he explained.
“Facebook ” Google and other technology companies have in recent years hired university torturers for their work on artificial intelligence.
Li added that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to improve its intellectual property achievements.
\"I believe that the green cards should automatically be awarded to people with a doctorate of philosophy in the field of artificial intelligence,\" he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese Council of State published its plan for the development of the future generation of artificial intelligence.
He explained that the National Natural Sciences Foundation of China provides funding to people in academic institutions, similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations providing money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
This year, earlier, the US Ministry of Defence (U.S. Defence Department) established a single centre of joint artificial intelligence, which is intended to bring together partners from industrial and academic circles, and Baltis Nams announced the establishment of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month, the DARPA (Central Research and Development Organisation of the Ministry of Defence of the United States of America) announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called \"AI Next\"
The National Science Foundation, on the other hand, invests more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation aimed at establishing the National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has been in operation for several months.
Macedonians voting in referendum on the change of name
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country to the Northern Macedonian republic by taking a step that would prevent decades of disputes with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's requests for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, emphasises that its northern neighbourhood is showing claims on its territory and has imposed veto Macedonia's admission to NATO and the EU.
Both governments concluded an agreement in June, which was based on the proposed new name, but nationalists in the opposition insist that changes would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Ivanov has said that I will not vote in a referendum, and the campaign with call for boycotting has raised concerns whether the voter engagement will reach at least 50% of what is required for the referendum to be declared valid.
The report's newsletter asks: \"Are you in favour of membership of NATO and the EU by concluding an agreement with Greece -
Supporters for the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying on the way to Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the collapse of Yugoslavia, to become an organisation such as the EU and NATO.
“I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia to live freely, at the European Union's side, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said Skopje, Oliver Georgijevska, 79 years old.
Although not legally binding, a sufficient number of MEPs have announced that they will take into account the outcome of the vote, which will become decisive.
In order to change the name, Parliament will need a 2/3 majority.
The National Electoral Commission informed that no irregularities were reported by one afternoon.
However, the activity was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in previous parliamentary elections, in which 66 percent of registered voters voted.
“I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said 62-year-old Josie Tanevski, voter in the capital Skopje.
On 30 September 2018, the Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zajev, his wife, Zorica, and their son Dushko, contributed to the referendum in Macedonia on the change of name that would open the way to NATO and the European Union in Strumica (Strumica) in Macedonia.
In front of Parliament, Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old (Vladimir Kavardarkov), prepared a small sight and arranged chairs near the tents that had been placed by those who boycotted the referendums.
“We are NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our head rather than through the doors of our servants, ” said Kawadarkov.
“We are a small country, but we have a place of self-respect.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China or Russia, and become part of European-Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zayev claims that membership of NATO will launch the necessary investments in Macedonia, where unemployment exceeds 20 percent.
“I believe that the majority will give a voice for, the more than 80-15 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO,” said Zayev for the vote.
He said that the result was yes, that our future would be confirmed.
The survey published by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research last Monday shows that 30-43 percent of the votes cast in the referendum are less than the required activity.
Another survey carried out by the Macedonian Tolma TV found that 57 percent of the votes cast on Sunday were going to take part in the vote.
70 percent of them replied that they would vote in favour.
For a referendum to be successful, voters must be 50 per cent and another vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first serious blow to the Western-oriented government, which came to power last May.

Hmm, what's this about?
No, hmm, wait! It was really bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party is no longer prepared for diversity.
It is intolerant to the open
It was not surprising that “Montum, the activists in my local party wanted me to be subject to censorship.
After all, I am in the last row until now in the Labour Party's Parliamentary Members, who were informed that he was not desirable, all this because we did not hide our views.
My fellow Parliament, Joan Ryan, did the same because she was determined to stand up to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship movement criticised me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of an economically responsible policy, of national security, of Europe, ironically, but these were issues where Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The Communication on the Labour Commissioner's meeting in the eastern part of Nottingham on Friday states that: “We want meetings to be inclusive and productive:
Most of the meetings that took place during the career of my eight local Labour MEPs were exactly the same.
Unfortunately, in many meetings in today’s world, there is another and a promise of a more lenient, lenient policy that has long since been forgotten.
It has become clearer that the Labour Party does not want to hold different views, and any view is assessed depending on whether it is acceptable for the party's leadership.
It began shortly after Jeremy became a leader: colleagues I think our political views are similar began to expect me to turn to 180 degrees and accept the views that I otherwise would never have accepted, whether it be national security or a single EU market.
When I speak publicly, and I do not really care about what I say, the survey of social networks is following, calling for a ban on candidates in the next elections, condemning the centre’s policy, claiming that I have no place in the Labour Party.
And that's not just my experience.
Indeed, I know that I have a lot more luck than some of my colleagues, because the comments against me are usually political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who are faced with the straits of sexist and racist insults every day, but never try to escape.
One of the most unsatisfactory aspects of this political era is how normal use has become.
Jeremy Corbin last week announced that the Labour Party should develop a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer an organisation that is prepared for diversity of opinion and with every expression of distrust or change of rules of selection, the party will be narrowed.
Over the last two years, I have often been encouraged to avoid walking, thinking about what I am talking about, and then “all of me will be fine. ”
But not so I decided to engage in politics.
Since I joined Labourmen 32 years ago as a student in response to the negligence of the Tehran government, which had literally led my integrated school class to collapse, I set the challenge of fighting for better public services for those most in need, both in the role of a local council member and in the role of the government minister.
I have never concealed my political views, nor in previous elections.
There was no reason to doubt my policy stance in the East of Nottingham and in areas where I did not agree with the existing government.
For those who pushed the proposal on Friday, I can only say that, when the country is determined to move to Brexit to the detriment of households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
In essence, however, the only thing I want to say is not that of Nottingham-Montum, but for my constituents, whether they are leiborist members: I am proud to be able to serve you, and I promise that there is no threat of denying candidates or reminders that no one is indispensable in politics, will stop me from acting as I think it is best for all of you.

(Ayr – 38 – 17 – Melrose): Unsatisfied – Ayr – reaches the highest line in the table
The last two attempts may have cut the final result to some extent, but there is no doubt that Air deserves to triumph in this amazingly exciting match of Scotland's championship today.
Now they're at the top of the table, the only unspeaked team from ten.
After all, it was their great protection, as well as the much better use of opportunities that led the hosts, and the coach Peter Murchie has every reason to be satisfied.
“We have been tested in all our games and are still not defeated, so I have to rejoice, ” he said.
“Melrose – Robin Christie: “All the respect they used to be better for themselves than we did for them.
The Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt by Frasier Climo was made by Ayr, but the yellow card would give up to Captain Rory Hughes, where Warriors, changed the numbers on the game, and Jason Baggot caught an unrealized ball.
Klimo increased Ayr – his fine leadership, right at the end of the half - time period, and implemented his solo attempt, and then Ayr - rested at between 17 and 5.
But “Melrose ” started with a good game for half, and Patrick Anderson’s attempt, implemented by Begots, reduced the retardation to 5 points.
Then a lasting break took place, because Ruaridh Knott suffered a severe trauma and was taken away from the field to the Nation, but when the game resumed, Ayr, moved rapidly ahead when Stafford McDowall made an attempt that was carried out by Klimo.
“Ayr – the existing captain, Blair Macpherson, then received a yellow card and again, after intense pressure, “Melrose ” used a protruding player, an attempt by Bruce Colvine, which was not realized.
However, the owners turned out, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card to cross Klimo without a bomb, from the penalty corridor, McFerson carried out a tachdaun-Ayr-mall at the back.
Klimo performed the ball, just as before, almost from its own resumption after Kayle Rowe was intercepted in the fifth attempt by David Armstrong and sent the flag player Gregor Henry to the hands of his master.
“Still Game: Star seems to plan a new career in restaurant business
Still Game, a star in Ford Kierran, seems to be planning to engage in hospitality business because he found himself called a director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays in the popular BBC show by Jack Jarvis, which he forms and participates in with his ancient partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duet has announced that the next nine season will be the last show, and Kürnman obviously plans his life after Craiglang.
According to official information, he is the Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although “Scottish Sun ” source indicated that Kürnan intended to engage in Glasgow’s “restaurant” business.
“The sea belongs to us: Bolivia trapped on land hopes that the court will open its way to the Pacific Ocean.
The sailors are patrolling the land in Flott’s Stabbit Lapas.
Public buildings have raised blue ocean flags.
Fleet-based ships from Lake Titicak are demolished with a motto: “We have a right to sea.
Recovery is our responsibility
In Bolivia trapped on land, Chile is still alive in the bloody conflict of the 19th century on the resource-loss line, just as it is very long to sail back into the Pacific Ocean.
This hope may have been the highest since several decades since Bolivia is awaiting the judgment of the International Court of Justice on 1 October following an examination of the five-year period.
“Bolevia develops, is united in its spirit and calm, and, of course, with positive expectations, ” stated Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Catholics will be watching the International Court of Justice judgment on big screens throughout the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will decide in favour of Bolivia that, after decades of negotiation, Chile is obliged to discuss the allocation of sovereign seawards to Bolivia.
The Harizmatic President of Local Origin of Bolivia, Evo Morales, awaited by the controversial fight for the election next year, is also very interested in the day-to-day judgment.
“We are near to regain the Pacific Ocean, ” he rejoiced at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that a court judgment in favour of Bolivia is unlikely and, if adopted, no major change is expected.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no power to grant Chilean territory, and its representatives have argued that they will not determine the possible outcome of the negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice is rendered in no way six months after the final hearing indicates that the case was not complex, explains Paz Zárate, an international regulatory expert from Chile.
And the last four years of Bolivian affairs have not moved forward, but, quite the contrary, have been held back.
“The feeling of sea access has been acquired by the existing Bolivian administration, ” said Zarate.
Morales ’ military rhetoric has dampened the rest of the good, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will once continue the negotiations, but after this it will be very difficult to maintain the discussion.
Both countries have not exchanged envoys since 1962.
The Bolivian representative in The Hague, former President Edward Rodríguez Veltzé, disagreed that the court ruled unusually quickly.
Monday Bolivia will bring an “emergency opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile, ” and an opportunity to“ put an end to the 139 - year conflicts that both sides will gain, ” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, used the sea as political cops.
\"Bolevy will never waive her right of access to the Pacific Ocean,\" he added.
“This decision is an opportunity to take steps to overcome the past.
North Korea will refuse nuclear weapons only when it can trust the United States
Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea Ri Jong Ho (Ri Yong Ho), said that his people would never first destroy their nuclear weapons if they could not trust Washington.
Mr Ri spoke on Saturday at the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He called on the United States to fulfil the promises made during the meeting of the leaders of both countries in Singapore.
His comments came at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seemed to be ready to resume the diplomatic measures that arrived on the impoverishment of the nuclear war, more than three months after Singapore's meeting with the North Korean leader, Kim Chenn.
Ri claims that they are “fantasias ” to hope that the US has still not abolished sanctions and will not wish to declare the end of the Korean war, ever appearing on the knees of North Korea.
Washington is cautious as regards consent to the declaration before Phenjana takes significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
However, many are sceptical about whether Phenjana really wants to abandon the armament that the country probably considers to be the only way to guarantee its own safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Phenjan next month to prepare next Kim's meeting with Trampa.
Paris Fashion Show presents the latest massive headset on your way to the nearest High Street
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely block the sun, then you are in the right place.
The designers Valentino and Thomas Browne presented the viewers with a row of absurd, huge head-to-head items in the 2019 Spring/Summer season collection, which jumped to the style background of Paris Fashion Week.
Significantly non-practical hats have been washed out this summer by «Instagram» and these designers have sent their stunting achievements for fashion demonstration.
Valentine's most outstanding product was a beautiful beige hat decorated with a colored, wide edge, with its heads irrigated.
There were gems, a magic hat, and even pineapples among the massive accessories, but they have not been developed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also showed a strange selection of masks just before Halloween.
Many of the colored masks were enslaved by lips, and they were more suitable for Hanibal Lecter than for the high fashion.
One of the formations reminded of the dive of breathing minds, a tube and glasses, while another resembled a melted conus of ice cream.
And if you want to continue with a massive fashion, then the right time comes.
Style observers believe that huge augusts are possible on the way to you near High Street.
The large hats immediately became popular after the appearance of “La Bomba ” – the straw hats with two feet (~60 cm) wide edges seem to have worn everything from Rianne to Emily Ratajkowski.
The status of a very impractical hat as a cult, on all social networks, led to another major work on the tongue: the straw beach bag, almost as large as the fashion that was wearing it in a swimming suit.
Red and yellow raffia bag, decorated with raffia barks and equipped with a white skin handle, took a special place in “Jacquemus’ La Riviera” – the 2019 spring/summer season collection at the Paris Modes Week.
Luce Armitage explained to FEMAIL: “I expect large hats and beach bags to appear in central street shops the next summer, because the designer has left such an impression that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for huge-sized accessories...
John Edwards: Language knowledge is vital to the world’s citizens
Scotlandn independent schools have an excellent reputation for education institutions and have preserved it in 2018, once again with outstanding exam results, which are further reinforced by individual and collective achievements in sport, art music and other societal events.
The aim of this school, which has 30 000 students in Scotland and represents Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), is to ensure the best level for their students and their parents.
Independent schools have set targets for preparing their students for further and higher education, their career choices and their lives as world citizens.
As an education sector that can develop and implement special school programs, we see that modern languages are still a popular and desirable subject in our schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak a language that he understands, it remains in his consciousness.
If you speak his mother tongue, it stays in his heart.
This is a convincing reminder that we cannot simply rely on English when we want to build relations and gain trust from other countries.
In the light of the recent exam results of this year, we can see that the languages are at the top of the League table with the highest number of exams passed in independent schools.
The highest sign A reached a total of 68 percent of students who taught foreign languages.
Scott The Council of Independent Schools for 74 schools shows that 72 percent of the students received the highest mark A in Chinese, and the same mark was given to 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent of those who learned French and 63 percent of those who learned Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills for children and young people in the future.
Language as a subject of choice is now evaluated in independent school programs as the subjects of the science-technology-engineering and mathematics group.
A 2014 survey by the British Employment and Skills Commission revealed that 17 percent of employers reported a lack of language skills as a reason for being unable to fill vacancies.
As a result, language skills are becoming increasingly mandatory to prepare young people for their future careers.
As language skills increase, these skills play a key role in a globalised world.
Regardless of their career, learning a foreign language will bring real benefits in the future from such long-term skills.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically improve the competitiveness of several language practitioners.
According to a 2013 study by YouGov, in which more than 4,000 adults participated in the UK, 75 percent did not require foreign languages enough to keep the conversation open, but French was the only language spoken by a two-digit number of people, 15 percent.
That is why it is important for children of today to contribute to language teaching.
Several languages, especially in the language skills of developing countries, will provide children with better opportunities for meaningful work.
School in Scotland differs from one language point of view.
Some schools will focus more on modern languages, while others will teach languages, such as Chinese and Japanese, which are considered the most important for the future of Britain, in line with plans for 2020.
Whatever your child is interested in, independent schools will always be able to choose from several languages, and teachers will be specialists in the field.
Scottish independent schools have committed themselves to providing a language environment that prepares their children and will provide them with the skills necessary to achieve the success no matter what the future is.
At present, in the global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still vital to the future of the country, so this fact must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be regarded as ‘international communication skills’.
Independent schools will continue to offer Scottish youth this choice, diversity and excellence.
Il faut bien le faire (It has to be done).
John Edwards is Director of Scott Independent Schools Council

Fanai has finally waited for Lebron’s first game as part of Los Angeles-Lakers.
“Lakers, trainer Luke Walton, announced that James would play on Sunday before the opening of the pre-season game against Denver-Nuggets- Sandjego.

Time of the Trump's home in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump today begins his series in Vieling, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five bodies planned by Trampl next week, including stopping at friendly places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Since the vote on his choice to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court has been suspended, the aim of Trump is to obtain support in the forthcoming interim elections, because there is a risk that the Republicans will lose control in Congress in November after the transfer of votes to the Supreme Court.
What will Trump's home in West Virginia be held today and how can you watch it online?
The camp is planned for seven evenings in Vīling, West Virginia, after ET today, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can watch Trumpet in West Virginia online on YouTube.
Tramps is likely to speak about this week's hearing in the case of the Supreme Court candidate Breta Kaveno, who has made accusations of sexual crimes of stress, and the vote of the Senate is expected to post approval for the week while the FBI will investigate.
But the main goal of this house is to help improve the situation of the Republicans expected in November.
Hence President Trump's campaign shows that the five-hectare mission next week is to activate volunteers and supporters while Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority that they own in the Senate and the House of Representatives, according to the Reuters.
“Congress control of his agenda is so important that the President will visit the state as much as possible, as we start a working season of the campaign, ” said the representative of the Trump campaign who did not want to reveal his name.
This evening’s home, which is planned – Wesbanco Arena – will attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and will be reflected in the Pittsburgh media – says West Virginia Metro News –
Saturday will be the second time in the last month, when Trump will visit West Virginia, the state in which he won over 40 percent in 2016.
Tramps is trying to help West Virginia Senator candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind according to surveys.
“It is not a good sign for the President to come to help improve his results in polls,” said Simon Haeder, professor of political science at West Virginia University.
Radio Cup 2018: The USA has demonstrated its determination to fight to maintain high expectations for Sundays singles
After three sessions, in one word, on Wednesday afternoon's game-foursome, the exact format could have been exactly what this Raider Cup needs.
Sporters love to talk about success fluctuations, and that really believes, especially in competitions like these.
So, which side do they think is a success now?
“They were led by six points, but now by four, because I think it means, in a way, that success has turned to us, ” said Jordan Spieth when he went.
Europe, of course, has priority because it is in the chair with 4 points, but another 12 will be played out.
The score explained that the Americans believe that the wind blows their sails and they have reason for optimism, of course, also in the person of Spīta and Justina Thomas, who played together all day long, and each one can boast at three points out of four.
The hit has been destroying from the first hit, to the lawn, and is the example of a winner.
Those Gutullary victories became increasingly louder when his round continued, a decisive blow in the pit was made to achieve four times the same number of beats when he and Thomas had fallen by two beats after two.
His blow in the pit that reached their victory in 15, was perceived with a similar cry, of them, for his conviction that the American team had not yet been ejected.
“You really have to do deep, and you have to worry about your match, ” Spita said.
This is all that remains for these players.
18 holes to succeed.
The only players who have gained more points in the last two days than Spita and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who will undoubtedly enter the history of this Raider cup.
The strange but attractive couple of Europe is behind four points and will not be able to harm.
Moliwood was the only couple living on Saturday afternoon without a bogie, but they also avoided the bogies on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the nine last holes on Friday morning.
This course and the way their energy flows to this crazy crowd and reconvinces that they are players to win on Sunday, and Flitwood with Molinari will be the most popular players who can provide a potential European victory when the sun will pass over – Le Golf National –
Preferably both at the same time in different pits.
However, it was premature to talk about the European triumph.
Babba Watson and Webbb Simpson were soon met with this morning's hero-fourballs in the format Serhio Garcia, who played together with Alex Noren.
Boggie and the two double fronts brought the Spaniards and the Swedish Tschees in nine, and they were not even close to escape from it.
On Sunday, however, there is no one to help with this.
The games-fourball - and-foursome - are as exciting as they are around the couple's interaction, watching the advice they give, and not, and how the strategy can change the situation instantly.
Europe has played better as a team so far, and long ago the last day is in command, but this competition, in a freesome, format, showed that the US team is determined to fight, many of which, especially the Stateside, have had doubts.
On the last day of the Rayder Cup, the European team was led by 10-6
The final days of the European team Raider Cup will begin under the pleasant leadership of the Saturdays-fourbal and Foursome competition with 10-6 against the United States.
The inspired couple, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, led by two victories of Tiger Woods, who was working hard on the list of points – Le Golf National – to four.
Thomas Bjorn's European team to maintain the trophy lost by Hazeltine two years ago dominated over an imprecise American team in the morning match-fourballs format, and the result of the series became 3-1.
The United States more vigorously resisted 'foursomes', a form of defeating two wallets, but failed to eliminate the deficit.
Jim Furyk's team needs 8 points on Sunday 12 single games to save the trophy.
Flitwood is the first European first year, which got four points in a row with Molinar, called Mollywood-Molliwood, after a sensational weekend, is just the second couple of Rayder's cup in history, which got four points in the first four May.
With the help of Patrick Reed, they then played the tired Wood and the American newcomer Brian Dechambeau with even more embarrassing results 5&4.
Woods, who won two games on Saturday, showed a great game, but he has lost 19 of the 29 match-fourballs-un-foursomes in formats, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose rested before morning matches, fourballs returned to partner Henrik Stanson’s Foursomes, in order to defeat with 2 & 1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who take their first and second place in the world’s ranking.
Europe was not able to achieve its full potential, although the day in the south-west of Paris was a pleasant and bloated wind.
The three-time most prestigious golf competition winner Jordanns Spitas and Justin Thomas set a benchmark for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They extorted 2/1 against John Rahm and Ian Poulter in a four-fourball format, and returned later to defeat Polter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3-foursomes, after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of Rayder Cup has the team played 4 point of the deficit in one game, but, as owners, Faryk's team is enough only with undissolved results to save the trophy.
After being in the second place for two days, it seems that the Sunday attack will be problematic.
North Korea announced that in no case would you disabling unilaterally without trust
On Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea informed the United Nations that the continuation of sanctions would deepen its lack of confidence in the United States, and North Korea in this situation will in no case unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons.
Ri Jongs Ho (Ri Yong Ho) informed the annual General Assembly of the world organisation that North Korea had taken “significant steps of good will last year, such as the cessation of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of nuclear weapons and the promise to never spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
\"However, we do not see an adequate US response,\" he said.
\"Unless there is any confidence in the United States, there will be no faith in the security of our country, and under such circumstances we will not unilaterally disarm the first people:
Although Ri repeated well-known North Korea's objections to the denuclearisation of the anti-nuclearisation of Washington, which led Korea to be rewarded for its gradual steps, his statement left an impression because it did not automatically reject unilateral denuclearisation, as Phenjana had done before.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Chenun and Donald Trump, who was in his first position, the President of the United States, and the leader of North Korea, at a meeting in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work to achieve the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula, while Trump promised to guarantee the safety of North Korea.
North Korea has tried to officially put an end to the Korean War 1950-53, but the United States have declared that Phenjana must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also not accepted the call to facilitate serious international sanctions against North Korea.
\"The U.S. insists that \"denuclearisation must first and then increase the level of pressure from sanctions to achieve the goal of power, even opposing the declaration of the end of war,\" said Ri.
\"The idea that sanctions could force us on our knees is empty fantasies, which the people who do not know about us.
However, the problem is that maintaining sanctions only deepens our untrust...
Ri was not talking about the intentions regarding the other Kim's meeting once with Trampa, which the U.S. leader had especially mentioned when speaking to the United Nations this week.
In his speech, the minister specifically highlighted three meetings with the South Korean leader Mone Jae-in over the last five months and added: “If the other side of the denuclearisation issue were South Korea, not the United States, the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula would not have been such a deadlock.
However, Ri’s tone of speech was dramatically different from last year’s when he announced at the UN General Assembly that North Korea’s rocketling to the continental part of the U.S. is inevitable after “The Evil President, Tramp, called Kim a “missile man, a suicide mission. ”
This year, at the United Nations, Trump, who was threatened with a complete extermination of North Korea last year, praised Kim for his courage to take steps towards disarmament, but stressed that there was still much to be done, and sanctions had to be maintained until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Tramp announced that he had not planned a specific time, stressing that “it was not important whether it would take two years, three years or five months...
China and Russia stress that the UN Security Council should reward Phenjan for its achievements.
However, the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: “The implementation of the Council of Security sanctions must continue vigorously, avoiding errors until a definitive and convincing denuclearisation -
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up its sanctions since 2006, trying to remove funding from the Phenjan nuclear- and ballistic-weapon programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the meetings of the United Nations General Assembly, and then informed him that he would visit Phenjan again the next month to prepare a second meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea this year three times, but the last trip was not successful.
He left Phenjan in July, making progress, but in a few hours, North Korea accused him of “eligible demands ”
The North Korea meeting with Mun in this month committed to dismantling the arms landfill and also the nuclear complex if the USA took appropriate action.
According to him, Kim had told him that “the appropriate measures - which North Korea wants to see - are the security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and the steps taken to normalize relations with Washington.
Researchers at Harvard University will learn the subject of enough rest
A new subject at Harvard University this year has managed to make students sleep more, and it is an attempt to turn to the most popular brutalist culture, which includes a caffeine-filled study through nights.
One teacher found that students of the best university in the world often do not even have basic knowledge of how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, sleep medical professor at Harvard Medical School, as well as a specialist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, developed a subject that he believed to be the first subject of such a type of study in the United States.
The inspiration to create a new subject arose after he spoke about the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
“At the end, a girl came up to me and asked, “Why is this only when I'm in the last course?
She found that no one had ever explained to her how much sleep was important.
This year's first-time learning subject provides students with basic information on how good sleep habits contribute to achievements in learning and sport, as well as improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, and the Executive Director of the University’s Health Services, informed that the university decided to introduce a training course after learning that students had been suffering from a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The long hour training process includes a series of interactive tasks.
One part is an image of collective doors, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how performance in sport is influenced by lack of sleep and the importance of sleeping routines.
In another part, students are informed of how long-term sleeplessness may increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
Then the student town map with interactive icons invites participants to reflect on their daily routine.
“We know that this will not change students’ behaviour at once.
But we believe that they have the right to know. Just as you have the right to know how the cigarette smoking will affect your health, Professor Čeisler added.
He said that a culture that is proud of the ability to study all night still exists, adding that modern technology and growing pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation became a growing problem.
He explained that enough quality sleep provision should be the secret weapon of students to combat stress, anxiety, and anxiety, and even to prevent weight gain because sleep shortages turn the brain into fasting mode, making it constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Čeisler to develop the subject after having participated in one of the professor’s lectures last year in Harvard’s first year.
He said that the subject had opened his eyes and inspired him to make the course available to the entire student town.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask students who acquire post-graduate education, to learn a similar programme before going to enjoy competition.
Professor Čeisler recommends that students not only install the simulator for a time when they will rise, but also when they go to sleep, as well as to keep in mind how blue light is harmful to people, emitted by electronic screens and LED lamps, as it can disrupt daily rhythms by difficulty in falling asleep.
“Livingston 1 - 0 – Rangers: Men's gate is overturned by the men of Gerards
“Ranger – one more scorn game in guests, when Dolly Menga hit Steven Gerrard siege team decided 1 – 0 for losing a loss to “Livingston”
\"Ibrox – the team expected to win the first victory since February 4:1 on the triumph of St Johnstone, but Gerry Holt's team provided Gerard with his second loss in 18 games, since he became the manager of the club, and his team is located 8 points away from the Scottish Championship leader, Hearts.
The menga took the ball to the gate seven minutes before the end of the half - time, and the “Ranger ” did not look like a lack of inspiration after trying to smooth the result.
‘Ranger, falls to the sixth place and Livingston, climbs to the third and exceeds it by the difference in gates’ only.
And “Rangers, ” may be another problem, as a judge’s assistant, Calum Spence, needed medical help because of a head injury apparently caused by an end - to - end object.
Gerard made eight changes to his team, which quickly left behind the Ayr, reaching the Betfred, the semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same Livingston, 11 players who took Hearts, one point last week, and he would be happy to see his well-educated team oppressed opponents in each episode.
It is possible that “Ranger, ” more often managed the ball, but “Livingston, ” better used what they did.
They had to get the gate two minutes after the first hand of Menga sent Scott Pittman to the Allan McGregor gate, but the center player missed his big chance.
Then, a far-reaching free touch of Keaghan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his partner protected Alan Lithgow’s ability to fly the ball only far beyond the rear posts.
“Ranger, took control, but it seemed that playing in the last third was hoped, not believed.
Of course, Alfredo Morelos believed that he had to do a fine blow in 15 minutes, after he had come into contact with Steven Lawless, but the judge, Steven Thomson, rejected the call from Columbus.
“Ranger, carried out only two beats in the first half, but the ex-Ibrox gatekeeper Liam Kelly did not stand so hard, nor the head-to-head contact of Lassana Coulibaly, nor the modest conclusion of Ovi Ejaria’s attack.
Although Livingston, a 34 - minute game might have changed, no one can deny that they deserved it already for their own efforts.
“Ranger, once again, was not dealing with a long combination of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept the balance and chose the Isle for a simple final.
In a break, Jarard changed Kulibali by Rain Kent, and it almost immediately affected the game, because the half guard sent the ball to Moreellos, but the impressive Kelley from his line immediately hurried to block.
However, “Livingston ” continued to make guests play the same thing as they like, when Litgov and Halket hit one spirit after another.
The team of Holt could have continued the leadership at the final stage, but McGregor played well by stopping Jacobs before Litgov took a shot with his head from the corner.
“Ranger, a substitute for Glenn Middleton, requested another fine blow in late games after Jacob’s encounter, but Tomson ignored his demand.
Almanah: Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now the page from our Sunday Morning - almanaha: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today... one day in Germany was born Johannes Wilhelm - Hans - Geiger, who grew up as a physicist.
The Geiger developed a method of measuring and measuring radioactivity, as a result, at the end of the day, was a device known as the Geiger meter.
The Gaedar counter, who took his place in science, has also taken his place in pop culture, for example, in the 1950 Film Bells of Coronado (Coronado Call), where the main roles were played by external, unconvincing cowboy scientists Rogers and Deals Evans:
Male:-Who, by the iodine, has it
Roger: “This is the Guier's counter used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can hear the atoms that are released because of their radioactivity.
Evans: “Surely, it’s a mouthpiece.
“Hans! Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention named after him continues to live.
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system – see – bad cells
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to see the evil cells and kill them
As part of the vaccine treatment, teach the immune system to recognise the bad cells
When using this method, the patient is given cells of the immune system that are converted to the laboratory
They could then «see» the protein characteristic of many cancers and be injected back into the body
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with various types of malignancies.
A woman who was treated with a vaccine that teaches her immune system to recognise bad cells had experienced her ovarian cancer disappearing for more than 18 months.
The method involves getting from a patient’s immune system cell, converting it into a laboratory that can ‘see’ for HER2 proteins that are characteristic of several tumours, and then injecting it back into the body.
U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, Professor Jay Berzofsky said: “Our results show us that we have a very promising vaccine.
HER2 – promotes the growth of a number of malignancies, including breast, ovarian, lung, and rectum cancers, explained Professor Berzovskis.
A similar approach when the patient receives immune cells, which have been associated with one type of leukemia – attacking cancer cells.
Kanie Vests, after his visit to the SNL, dressed in the maGA hat, attacked critics of Trump.

They laughed me!

The wedding had recently been invited to replace the singer Ariana Grande, who had been killed by a friend rapper Max Miller a few days ago.
It was a song that he performed in a Champagne’s bottle.

In the conversation with “The Sunday Times Culture – Kits explained that in his opinion, he was ‘a problem’ and asked how to deal with a toxic man in the shadows of #MeToo.
Another, who recently married his Tranche Game, a partner, Rose Leslie, also aged 31 years, acknowledged the importance of this problem for him.
“I was not able to think about the mistakes we’ve made in men right now, ” he said.
“What we teach young men in terms of this problem, when they grow in view of the present problem,”
Others believe that television with their very male characters may be partially responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity.
He continued: “What is inherited, but what is being taught?
What is taught in TV and on the streets, which makes young boys feel that they need to be perceived as men?

HIV/Aids: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials report that more than 820 000 people are affected in the country.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases were the result of sexual intercourse, suggesting changes.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly as a result of some of China’s infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has fallen to almost zero, and Chinese health officials were informed at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
From one year on, however, the number of people living in China with HIV and AIDS has increased to 100,000.
The transmission of HIV to sexual relations is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality in China was decriminalised in 1997, but it is said that discrimination against LGBT people is common.
Taking into account national conservative values, it is estimated that between 70 and 90% of men who have had sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many cases of sexually transmitted diseases are the result of underprotected sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised general availability of HIV medicines as part of its response to the problem.
Maxina Voters denies that the employee washed the data of the Republican Senators, strongly resists dangerous lies, and the theory of conspiracy.
On Saturday, the US Chamber of Representatives, Maxine Waters, denied the allegations that her staff had published personal information from three American Republican senators on the Wikipedia Legislators’ pages.
The democratist in Los Angeles insisted that the claims are distributed by “the right hand of the universe and the Internet sites. ”
“Dear, lie, and even more despised lies, ” said Waterers in her statement on Twitter.
The following information is reported to include address and telephone numbers of the place of residence, owned by the U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hitch from Yuut.
Online information appeared on Thursday, it was published by an unknown person from Congress, at the time when the group of the Senate was heard about the allegations of Breta Kaveno against the Supreme Court in sexual mistreatment.
The runoff occurred some time after three senators had interviewed Kaveno.
The conservative websites such as “Gateway Pundit” and “RedState” reported that the origin of the records was linked to the Waters Office and disclosed information about the staff of the Waters Service, Hils.
“This unwarranted statement is totally false and lying, being insisted on by Waters.
\"My staff member whose identity, personal information and security are compromised because of this fraudulent and false claim, is not liable in any way for any leakage of information.
This unwarranted statement is completely false and lying in its entirety.
Ari Fleischer’s announcement soon gave rise to criticism online, including criticism by the former Secretary of the White House Press Ari Fleischer.
“This is an angry denial, ” wrote Fleiser.
“It leads to the conclusion that her temperament does not correspond to the Congress member.
When a person is accused of what he has not done, he must not be angry.
He must not be friendly.
He may not speak out on the motives of the accused.
He must be calm and calm.
Fleiser's role was to compare Waters' reaction to the democratic fall of the judge Kaveno, who was accused of being too angry about the reaction during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a candidate for the Republican candidate for the loss of Voters’s chair in interim elections, also expressed his views on Twitter.
“It’s great if it’s true, ” he wrote.
In her statement, Waters informed that her office had warned responsible officials and law enforcement bodies about these fraudulent claims.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators will be revealed, ” she continued, “and that they will be declared legally responsible for all their work, which is destructive and dangerous for any of my staff.
\"Jonius English 3 - Note: Rovan Atkinson's half-wheeled performance on spy films
It has become a routine to look for an association with Brexite in each new film with a British flavour, and this seems to apply also to this one that has revived, the comedy Frenchs of John English who showed it, which began in 2003 with John England, and was reborn in 2011 with J.K.
Is the toothgull clean up for itself, for how obviously hopeless we are, there is a new export opportunity for our nation?
In any case, John England, who is not competent, has the right to create a mile after the second resuscitation of his name, more than anything else indicates that he is a broad-ranging comical character, developed in areas where consumers do not speak English.
He is, of course, the silly secret agent who, in spite of his strange claims on adorable precision, is a little Cluz, a little Mr. Bin, and a little guy who plays one noti-Chariot of Fire-themed music at the 2012 Olympic Games ceremony in London.
He is also based on a traveler and an international, inconceivable character once portrayed by Atkinson in his forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials where he left chaos on his way.
The latest Johnangley adventure has at least one or two nice moments.
I liked the place Johnny Anglis goes to the helicopter in the medieval armor of armor, and the propeller's blades for a moment fell against his helmet.
The ability of Atkinson to visually create a comical impression is well visible, but humor is quite weak and strangely superficial, especially because «seriously» cinema brands, like «007» and «Unlikely mission» use comedy as one of the ingredients with confidence.
Humor creates the impression that it's dedicated to children rather than adults, and I think Johnny Anglis's absurd fate is not as creative and purposeful as Atkinson's mosque tricks in Bina's skin.
As usual, everything is based on the fact that Britain has got into a serious basket.
Cyberhakker has broken into the UK's super secret spy web network, revealing the identity of all British agents in this area, the displeasing of an active agent, the regrettable role of Kevin Eldon.
It is the last straw for the Prime Minister, for the poppies and for a person who has already lost full political popularity: Emma Tomson is doing something that he can do with the partially similar character of Terez Maya, but there is not much in the scenario to work with.
Her intelligence advisors report that since all active spies have entered the public, she will have to invite someone who has already retired.
And this man is the inexperienced Johnny England, who now works as a teacher at a subtle institution, and obediently teaches how to work as a secret agent (a strange joke), because English offers to learn a spy profession from the very foundations.
Coal is brought back to the extraordinary meeting of Whitehall and is combined with its former many victims' assistants Bo, also played this time by Ben Miller.
Bo is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, a fun figure that becomes important only at the end of the film, a role in which Vicki Pepperdine is not fully used.
And so Bentman and Robin have come back to serve in the secret service of His Highness and meet the beautiful lady of Ophak Kurylenko, Ophalia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime ministers have been dangerously deceived by the Harizmatic Technology billioner, the evil Jason Volt, whose image is Jack Ley (Jake Lacy), and he is claiming to be able to solve the British computer chair.
England and Bo are starting their wildly fun odysace: masking the outants, they fire a fine French restaurant; they create a fascinating clandestine breath in the boat of Volta luxury; and Anglis causes absolute chaos, trying to use virtual realities on the head display to get to know the interior of the Volta building.
It does everything possible for the end, but as attractive and crazy as the film, it contains a lot of children’s television elements.
A lot of moderate elements.
Like other Johnny Anglis's movies, I can't wonder if the British film industry could not give Rovan Atkinson a role to fully exploit his talent.
Labour Party denies plans to work four days a week and receives a salary for five days
Jeremy Corbyn The Labour Party is going to discuss a radical plan, under which the British will work four days a week and receive a salary of five.
It is reported that the party wants company leaders to give the workers savings through the brain revolution, giving them another holiday.
In this case, employees will be able to enjoy the three-day weekend while receiving the same wage as before.
Sources tell us that the idea – responsible – of party agendas for the economy, and plans to change the economy to the benefit of workers.
The transition to a four-day working week has been supported by the Trade Union Congress, which considers it an opportunity for workers to benefit from the economic change.
One of the senior representatives of the Labour Party informed The Sunday Times: “It is expected that policy changes will be announced by the end of this year.
\"It will not happen one day, but the four-day working week is an idea that is in line with the party's objective of balancing the economy in favour of workers and the Party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised to introduce a four-day working week already in its general election campaign in 2017.
However, the Labour Party as such does not support this hunger at the moment.
The representative of the Labour Party informed: “The four-day working week is not part of the party’s policy, and the party does not consider it.
Jean McDonnell, Minister of the House of Shadows, used the Labour Conference last week to give a circle to his vision of the social revolution economy.
Mr McDonela explained that he was determined to withdraw the power of directors and the speculators of public services companies.
The Minister for Shadows also plans that the average shareholders in the water companies may not recover their entire package because the Labour Government could make a settlement due to injustice.
He also approved plans to include employees on the boards of companies and to create exclusive Property Funds (Ownership Funds) so that 10% of the private sector company's capital could be allocated to employees who would receive up to 500 pounds a year in dividends.
Lindsey Grem and John Kennedy replied to the 60 Minutes, or an investigation into the FBI in the Kaveno case could change their views
The investigation of the FBI against the accusation brought by the judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question whether the findings of the office could lead to a Republican senator withdrawing its support.
During the interview on Sunday, the 60 Minute programme, the correspondent Scott Pelley questioned Republican Senators Jean Kennedy and Lindsey Graham as to whether the FBI could discover something that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy left a more open human impression than his South Carolina colleague.
“Yes, of course, ” replied Kennedy.
\"I said on the hearing, I said I had spoken to a judge in Kaveno.
I called him after the charge became known and asked: “Do you do it?
He was determined, direct, and unambiguous:
The Grem's vote, however, seems to be stoned.
“I’ve made a decision on Bret Kaveno, and there will be a disastrous accusation, ” he said.
“Dr. Forda, I don’t know what happened, but I know this,” said Grem, adding, “Christine Blasey Ford.
\"And none of her names were able to confirm it.
The 36-year-old event.
I don’t think any changes are expected.
What is the World Citizens Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the World Citizens' Festival will take place in New York, an annual music event with an impressive number of stars and a mission that is just as impressive: to reduce poverty in the world.
This is the seventh year of the festival, which will bring together tens of thousands of people from Central Park, not only to enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson, relative Kardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of the event, which is the end of poverty by 2030.
The Global Ciszen Festival, launched in 2012, is a project launched by the International Protection Group on the Global Pointy Project, which hopes to put an end to poverty by attracting more and more people who are actively fighting for poverty.
To get a free ticket to this event (unless there was a desire to pay for the VIP ticket), the concert visitors had to perform a number of tasks or activities – such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a telephone call or any other important activity to raise awareness of the end of poverty.
But how successful has the Global Ciszen movement been, with the 12 years remaining to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of awarding a free concert a good way to convince people to act, or is there just another so-called “sliciousness” – a situation where people really think they can influence something by signing an online petition or sending Twitter messages?
Global Ciszen states that since 2011, it has registered over 19 million activities, among its supporters, in an effort to achieve different goals.
It reports that these actions have helped world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion, affecting the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group referred to 390 commitments and declarations resulting from its activities for which at least USD 10 billion has already been paid or financed.
The group estimates that the funds have had a direct impact to date on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include \"The Power of Nutrition\" – a partnership between investors and executives established in the United Kingdom, which is committed to helping children grow up fully - by promising Rwanda with 35 million US dollars to help put an end to their underage after having received over 4,700 Twitter messages from the world's citizens.
“With the support of the United Kingdom Government, donors, other governments and citizens of the world, we can leave the absence of social injustice in the history of living, ” said the crowd of the April 2018 concert in London, “The Power of Nutrition, representative of Tracey Ullman.
The group also stated that, after more than 5000 measures had been introduced, the UK Government had announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which would give 5 million women and children a diet.
Answering one of the frequently asked questions on our website: “What you think we can end extreme poverty”
“ Global citizen ” commented: “It will be a long and long way from where we will immediately knock on and suffer from failure.
But, just as the great civil rights and anti-apartee movements have done before us, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who will take part in this year's event in New York under the leadership of Deborr-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use the Navy of War - Block - to prevent Russian energy exports - claims the Minister of the Interior
“If necessary, Washington can use its own fleet to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including the Middle East, as quoted by the US Minister of Interior, Ryan Zinke.
Zinke claimed that Russia's activities in Syria, especially where it operates under a legitimate government call, are an excuse for exploring new energy markets.
\"I think that the reason why it is located in the Middle East is that it wants to supply energy just as it does in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe,\" he said.
And the official thinks there are ways and means to deal with it.
\"The States of the United States can, through their fleet of war, make sure that the waterways are open and, if necessary, block them so that Russia cannot bring its energy into the market,\" he said.
Zinke approached the public who had come to an event organised by the Energy Consumers Alliance, a non-profit-making organisation called the voice of the consumer of energy in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to resolving the situation in Russia and Iran, pointing out that they were actually the same.
“The economic feasibility of Iran and Russia is more or less fuel use and substitution,” he said, referring at the same time to Russia as a country whose economy depends mainly on fossil fuels.
It is claimed that the Trump administration is promoting the exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, thereby replacing Russia with much cheaper options for consumers in Europe.
For this reason, Trump Administration officials and U.S. President Donald Trump himself are trying to convince Germany to leave the \"unsuited\" – the Nord Stream 2-1 gas leads a project that would make Berlin dependent on Moscow after Trampa's words.
Moscow has repeatedly emphasised that a North Stream 2-5 gas pipeline worth USD 11 billion, doubling the capacity of existing gas to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
According to the Court, the D.C.C. is simply based on economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
\"In my opinion, we agree that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should have the option of choosing a supplier,\" said Russian Minister of Energy Aleksandr Novak after the September meeting in Moscow with the US Minister of Energy Rick Pery.
The US has expressed its negative attitude towards Germany, which has reaffirmed its involvement in the project.
The leading German industry organisation, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), has called on the US to refrain from engaging in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I feel a big problem if a third country interferes with our energy supply, ” said Dieter Kempf, the head of the German Industrial Federation (BDI) after a recent meeting between the German Chancellor Angel Merkeli and the Russian president Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Vorena will give serious consideration to his candidacy in the Presidential elections 2020
On Saturday, Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Vorena announced that she was seriously considering standing for the President after the mid-term elections.
During the meeting in Holioka, Massachusetts, Waren confirmed that he was considering standing as President.
“It is high time that there are women in Washington who, in turn, have an incomplete government, which also means women’s presidents, is reflected in the newspaper “The Hill ”
“After November 6, I will carefully consider my candidacy at the election of the US President, ”
At the meeting of the Council, Waren referred to President Donald Trump, claiming that he was “leaving the country in the wrong direction ”
“I’m worried, as far as my heart is concerned, what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy,” she said.
Vorena has openly criticised Trampa and his chosen candidate for the Supreme Court, Bret Kaveno.
Friday Twitter's report Vorena said: \"Of course, before the elections, the FBI's investigation is needed:
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren's supporters do not think that she should stand as a candidate in the 2020 elections.
According to the results of the Soston Globe survey of the University of Sufolk, fifty-eight percent of potential voters of Massachusetts claimed that the senator should not stand in elections.
Thirty-two per cent supported such a decision.
The results of the survey showed that the former Governor, Denval Patrick, received greater support, receiving 38 per cent for election candidates and 48 per cent against.
In addition to possible candidates in the elections in 2020, names of high-profile democratic party actors, such as the former Vice President Joe Baiden and the Senator of Vermont, Little Sanders, appear.
The news agency “Associated Press” informed that Baiden has committed himself to making an official decision before January.
Sara Peilina quotes Treka Peilina at the PTSS Donald Trump's home
Trek Peilin (26) spent a year in Iraq after the conscription in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and accused of domestic violence.
“To whom my own son goes through after his return, I can relate to other families facing the consequences of the PTSS and some vulnerability to which our soldiers return, ” she told the public at Donald Trampa’s home in Tulls, Oklahoma.

18 States, Colombia region is facing a challenge for a new asylum policy
Eighteen States and the Colombian region support the legal challenge of a new US policy that bans asylum for victims of gangs or domestic violence.
The 18th Member State and the Colombian region presented a short outline of the case to the counsellor in Friday Washington in support of the asylum seeker’s obstacles faced by this policy.
The full name of the applicant in the Grace v. Session opened by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She claimed that her partner, and his sons of a member of the violent gang, had abused her, but US officials rejected her request for asylum on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The Stata lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, as countries where gangs and domestic violence are common.
The new US asylum policy changed the decision of the Immigrant Appeal Council of 2014, which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
On Friday, the Prosecutor General of the Region of Colombia, Karl Rachine announced that the new policy – the national, federal and international laws introduced by the State, the State – by the State, the Federal Laws and the International Laws
“The Federal Law stipulates that all asylum requests are dealt with on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the claim in question, and this obstacle violates this principle,” said the brief statement of the court counsel.
The lawyer also stated in his statement that a policy that prevents immigrants from entering the country is detrimental to the US economy, as these immigrants are likely to become entrepreneurs and provide the necessary labour:
In June, Prosecutor General Jeff Sessions appealed to the immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims of domestic violence and abuse of gangs.
“The concept is available to those who abandon their homeland because of persecution or fear associated with their race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, ” he said in his communication on politics of 11 June.
Asylum has never been designed to solve all the problems, even the serious problems, that people face every day throughout the world.
Sliding rescue efforts in Palau, the fallen number doubled in the search for survivors
For the survivors, the situation has become more severe.
“The situation is very tense, ” said 35-year-old Riez Kusuma, comforting his feversome baby at the evacuation center of the destroyed Palu city.
“For a minute, the Rapid Medical Service brings new victims.
Clean water is a deficit.
The inhabitants were visible when they returned to their destroyed homes and overflowed water to save everything that was found.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals that had suffered from the violent earthquake of 7.5 Magnids were overflowing.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Harris, who had broken spine and shoulder, lay outside of the Palau Army hospital, where patients were taken out of care because of the persistent strong after-screws.
The tears fell in his eyes, remembering that the powerful earthquake began to shake the number of the hotel in the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
\"There was no time to save.
I think I was pushed into wall ruins, the news agency-Associated Press, said Harry, pointing out that his family had arrived in the city for the purpose of his wedding.
“I heard my wife call for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her or my baby.
I hope they're safe.
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of their intimidation attempts through propaganda
Week after the official Chinese newspaper came out with a four-page ad, emphasising the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China daily, the US ambassador in China accused of using the Beijing American press to disseminate propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to the supplement paid by China Daily to the newspaper De Moines Register, which was sold by the State of Aiovas, accusing China of its attempt to intervene in the US Congress elections on 6 November, which China denies.
The Tramp’s accusation that Beijing was trying to intervene in the US elections marked what US officials said to the news agency Reuter, namely that it was a new stage in the growing Washington campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is entirely normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a growing trade war, resulting in a range of tariffs applying to each other's imports.
At the beginning of the trade war, Chinese repressive tariffs were directed against exporters in states such as Aiova, which supported the Republic of Trampa party, said Chinese and US experts.
Terry Brandad, US Ambassador to China and former long-term governor in Aiov, a large exporter of agricultural goods to China, said that Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote his opinion to the Sunday edition of Des Mines Register, claiming that China was doubling this intimidation now by inserting propaganda in our own free press.
“By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses its good American language freedom and free press tradition to put paid advertising “Des Moines Register, ” wrote Branstad.
\"In contrast, here in the usual Beijing news kiosk you will find different views of a limited amount and you will not see the true picture of such different views that the Chinese people may have in relation to the alarming economic trajectory of China, given that the media are here under the strict supervision of the Chinese Communist Party,\" he wrote.
He added that “one of the most influential Chinese newspapers avoided publication, but he did not mention who the newspaper was.
Analysts warn of the Republicans that alienate women voters from the mid-term elections involving the Kaveno scandal
Since many leading Republicans support and defend the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, against which several allegations of sexual violence have been made, analysts have warned that in the forthcoming mid-term elections they will experience a negative reaction, especially from women.
The emotions associated with it have been extremely high, and it can be seen that most Republicans have already been ready to give their voice.
The Saturday article, The Hill, which was presented by Grant Reeher, professor of policy at the University of Syracuse, McCall.
Rühren doubted that Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s recent incentive to investigate the FBI would be quite a reason to calm down the angry voters.
They will not forget it tomorrow or November, as indicated by Karine Jean-Pierre, the oldest advisor and representative of the State, according to a newspaper \"Washington, D.C.\", said on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters in the hallway of the Senate sang in a demonstrative demonstration – November comes – when Republicans in charge of the Committee on the Judiciary chose to continue with the nomination of Kaveno in spite of the testimony given by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford,
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be on a very high level, ” said the independent political analyst Stu Rotheenberg.
\"People say it's already at a high level, it's true.
However, this may be even higher, especially among the floating and younger voters in the suburbs (aged 18-29), who do not often go to elections even if the president does not like it.
Even before the public testimony of Forda, in which she presented claims of sexual violence on the part of the candidate for the post of the Supreme Court, analysts point to a possible failure if the Republicans continued to put forward this candidacy.
\"The Republican Party has become a mixed chaos,\" said Michael Steele, former Chairman of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
\"It is not just about the committee's vote or the final vote, or about whether Kaveno will be sentenced to judgment, but also about how the Republicans have dealt with the situation and how they have dealt with it.
However, the Americans seem to have been divided a little about what they believe after the Ford and Kaveno testimonies, a little more inclined to believe the latter.
A new-YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents are definitely or mostly inclined to believe in Forda’s testimony, while 35 percent say that they definitely or mostly tend to believe in Kaveno’s testimony.
In addition, 38 percent claimed that Kaveno may have lied for its testimony while only 30 percent of the same person said for Ford.
The Guardian reported that the FBI is currently conducting investigations into the statements made by Forda, as well as on at least another defendant Deborah Ramirez.
Last week, Forda witnessed in the Committee on Justice of the Senate that at the age of 17, Kaveno had committed sexual assault against him.
Ramirza claims that the candidate for the post of the Supreme Court judge has shown her his genius at a party in Jaila in the 1980s.
The global web inventor plans to launch a new Internet to take over Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the global web inventor, is launching a project that could compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend – Inrupt – is a company based on the Barnersa-Lie Open Source Platform – Solid –
\"Solid\" allows users to choose where to store their data and which people are allowed to access some information.
In an exclusive interview with «Fast Company»-Berners-Lī jockeyed that «Incrite» the hidden intention is «doing over the world»
“We have to do this now,” he said about the start-up business.
“This is a historic moment ”
The application uses \"Solid\" technology to enable people to build their own personal online data repository, or PTD.
It may include contact lists, job lists, calendar, music library, as well as other personal and professional tools.
It is like if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify would all be simultaneously available in one browser.
A personal online data repository is unique in that only the user determines which and what types of information can be accessed.
The company refers to it as \"personal authority using data\"
According to John Bruce, the idea is to provide the company with resources, processes and appropriate skills to make “Solid” accessible to everyone.
The company currently operates a security platform purchased by Bērners-Lie, Bruce, IBM, some external developers who have been contracted to work on the project, and a voluntary community of encoders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world could build their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the Internet at Inrupt.
Burners-Lī said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change within one night, fully encapsulate all their business models.
\"We will not require their permission,\"
On Saturday, in a report published by the Medium Berners-Līe, the platform stated that ‘Inrupt-mission is to secure commercial energy and ecosystems in order to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web based on Sold-
In 1994, Burners-Lie transformed the Internet into a Global Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Bernersam-Lie has had an influence on discussions about net neutrality.
Even after the launch of the “Inrupt” will remain the founder and director of the Global Web Consortium, the Global Web Fund and Open Data Institute.
“I’m really optimistic about this new Internet era,” said Burners-Lie.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of Victoria’s Cross awarded to the clergy during World War I
For 100 years, an event has been celebrated in its hometown when the only clergyman of the British Church has received the Victorian Cross during World War I as a fighter.
Lt-Col Bernard Venin received this award on September 29, 1918 in connection with the attack on Bellenglis and Lehaucort.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper, so he did not know the highest British military award.
His two granddaughter, in Northamptonshire, appeared to be a memorial stone dedicated to him on Saturday’s show.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, mentioned that it was “excellent symbolism ” that such a stone was discovered 100 years after his grandfather had received a significant award.
According to the newspaper London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lt Col Ven led his battalion across Canal de Saint-Quentin through very thick mist and cannons and pilots caused by large fires.
Later on, he rushed to the shooting line and, with the greatest confidence, led this line forward before the cannon zone was taken, where three groups were defeated.
Lt-Col Venu killed German Sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Ven (72) said that his grandfather’s actions were “something I could never do, and what is also very humble action...
He also accompanied Dr. James Vann by a crown orchestra with Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Venne claimed that he was “glorified, involved in the parade ” and noted that “the support provided by many people is evidence of the true value of heroics...
MMA fans waited all night for Bellator 206, but instead they welcomed Pig Pepus
Imagine spending the whole night to see “Bellator 206 ” at the end of this major event.
San José’s sheep included 13 battles, including six on the main map, which were broadcast live throughout the night on channel 5 of the United Kingdom.
At 6:00 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to stand each other in front of each other, the UK viewers were unpleasantly surprised by the replacement of the broadcasts to the Pig Pep.
Some were truly confused when they kept awake all night until early dawn waiting for battle.
On Twitter, a fan described the switch of transmissions to a child’s cartoon as a “failure joke ”
“The government has determined that this type of content is unacceptable after 6 a.m., so the switchover to the child programme took place,” said Dave Schwartz, “Bellator, the oldest vice-president on marketing and communication.
‘Swine Pepa’,
Scott Cooker, President of Bellator, said that he would work on scheduling so that future spectators in the United Kingdom can see these broadcasts.
“When I think about repeating transmissions, we can do something to solve it, ” said Koker.
\"However, the clock is there six o'clock in the morning, and we will not be able to solve the problem until Sunday after our time and Monday after their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, a lot of texts appeared after the switchover, and they were not positive.
We tried to prevent it because we thought it was a technical mistake.
It was under the control of the government.
I can promise you that there will be no such problem next time.
We will stop at five battles, not six (as has been so far).
This is a failure:
“Desert Island Discs ”: Tom Deile does not feel good enough on grounds of sexuality
Tom Daley, the Olympic nerve, says that he grew up feeling less valuable than others because of his sexuality, but that motivated him to succeed.
A 24 - year - old man did not realize that “not everyone was like me, until he began attending high school.
During his visit to the first Radio 4 “Desert Island Discs” program headed by Lauren Loverne, he said he started talking about the right of homosexuals to give others a hope.
He also mentioned that becoming a parent made him less nervous about winning the Olympic Games.
The permanent head of the long-term program, Kirsty Young, has gone to rest several months due to the illness.
At the time of the first Loverne program, Dale said that as the company grew more and more sensed than others, as both girls and boys were not assumed to like it.
He said: “Even today, the feeling that I am not as good as others or that I am different has been the main drive that has given me strength and endurance to succeed.
He said he wanted to prove that there was “something ” to make people hope when they finally learned about his sexuality.
The double bronze medal of the Olympic Games has become the leader of the high-level LGBT campaign and has used its appearance in this year's Friendship Games in Australia, calling for more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said that he decided to speak to society because he felt happy to be able to live openly and without difficulty, and wanted to give hope to others.
Three times the World Champion said that the fall in love with the filmmaker, Dustin Lance Black, U.S.A., was “surprisingly unprepared ”
Dale married the 20-year-old Oskars Prize laureate last year and claimed that the age difference was never an obstacle.
«When you’ve gone through so much of your age -- (he first Olympics were at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later) it’s hard to find someone at your age who would have experienced similar peaks and falls.
The couple became a son by the name of Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Dale claimed that his “all perspective ” had changed.
“For the first year, everything that was important to me was the extraction of gold medals, ” he said.
\"Do you know what? Life is the most important thing about the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie...
Robert has the same name for his son as his father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40.
Daley said that his father did not want to accept that he died, and one of the last things he asked Dale was whether they had tickets to the 2012 Olympic Games in London, where he wanted to be in the first row.
“I couldn’t tell him she wouldn’t be anymore to be in the first row, ” he said.
“I kept his hand until he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing and was dead, I finally admitted that he was not invincible, ” he said.
In the following year, Delay participated in the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze.
“I just knew that it was what I had dreamed of all my life – to dive into the Olympic Games. I had no feeling better about it, ” he said.
It also inspired his first song’s choice of performance – Heather Small, which resonated with him on his way to achievements in the Olympic Games and continually inflame the goose.
The “Desert Island Discs” programme is heard on Sundays of BBC Radio 4 at 11.15 a.m. after the British summer time.
The output of the shape of Mikelson reserve bench on Saturday Rayner Cup in the game
On Sunday, American Phil Mickelson will set a record by playing his 47th Raid's Cup match match, but he will need to change his strategy to avoid the failure of a turnaround.
Mielson, who is already taking part in the 12th time in every two years championship, was seated on the reserve bench Saturdays, four ball games, and two pair games.
Instead of being in the centre of action, as has often been the case with the U.S. teams, the fifth winner divided his day, acting both as a supporter and participating in his game with the hope of remedying what suppresses him.
Since the 48-year-old golfer has never been the most accurate player even at the top of his career, he is not the most suitable candidate for the strained fight, Le Golf National, an unparalleled field where unpredicted blows are regularly punished.
And if the game itself is not frightening enough, Mikelson will fight with the exact British winner of the Open Championship Francesco Molinari, who has joined forces with young Tommy Fleetwood this week to win all four matches.
If Americans who lag behind with four points, starting with 12 single-games, are successfully leading, Mikelson's match could prove decisive.
Furis expressed his conviction about his teammate without words.
“He was fully aware of his role today, took me on his back, put his hand on me, and told me he was ready tomorrow, ” said Furix.
“He is very confident about himself.
He is an outstanding sportsman who has given so many of these teams earlier and this week.
I don't think we've ever imagined him playing in two machines.
I imagined more, but everything changed as it turned, and we will count on it.
He wants to be out there, like everyone else.
Mikelson will give the Nick Faldo record in connection with the most played match in the Rayder Cup on Sunday.
This could mark the end of the Rayder Cup's career, which has never really coincided with the heights of his individual record.
Mikelson has won 18 victories, experienced 20 losses and seven unsorted games, although Furiks claimed that his presence gave the team certain intangible benefits.
“He’s funny, sarcastic and clever, he likes to ask about people, and he’s a great teammate,” he explained.
“I think the latest players liked to have been joking him again this week, which was fun watching.
He gives a lot more than just a game--
Thomas Bjorn, European random captain, knows that significant eviction can quickly escalate
European random captain Thomas Bjorn knows from his experience that the fight for Raider Cup in the last day singles can easily turn into an unpleasant situation.
The Danish cast in the matches of Valderra in 1997, where a team of opponents whose captain was Sive Ballesteros won a five-point victory over the Americans, but only now came to the finish line with a very small score of victory, i.e. 141⁄2-131⁄2.
“You keep reminding yourself that we have taken a big lead in Valderra; we have taken lead in Brooklyn where we lost, and in Valderram where we won but only with a little victory,” said Bjorn (in the picture), watching the 2018 release group wins with 5-3 on Friday and evening, leading on the 10-6 golf course at Le Golf National.
Thus, history will show me and every member of its team that nothing is done.
Tomorrow, you give yourself everything.
Go to the field and show your best performance!
It will not end until the resulting items are visible on the screen.
Our goal is to get this trophy, and we will also focus on it.
I have always said that I am focusing on 12 players on our side, but we are very well aware of what comes to us on the other side: the world's greatest players.
Lighted up on the performance of his players on the golf course, Bjorn added: “I never rejoiced at the early stage.
New challenges await tomorrow.
Tomorrow is about individual games, and that's a completely different thing.
It's great if, at times, when everything goes well, you have a partner next to you, but in individual games, your golfer skills are fully tested.
This message you have to pass on to your players, that is, to give them everything for the next days.
Now you leave your partner and he must also show his best performance –
Unlike the team of opponents of Bjorne, Captain Jim Furrick will look for his players to show their best performance directly in individual games rather than in partner games. The exception is only Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who got three points out of four.
Furik himself was on both sides of these important last days' tournaments, both as part of the winning team in Brooklyn, and then as part of the defeat when European teams had a sensational success, which was later known as “Miracle at Medinah” in the world.
“I remember every fucking word he said in response to Ben Crenshaw, a team captain in 1999, bringing his players together for the fight of the last day.
“We are 12 important games tomorrow, but you’d like to get to the quick trigger you experienced in Brooklyn that you experienced in Medine.
When such a pulse is transmitted in the same direction, it exerts a heavy pressure on mid-term games.
So we made our composition and ranked our guys in the way we thought it was right. Let's try to do some kind of magic tomorrow.
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the attack, and he was immersing the main game of Rory McIlroy and the Europeans Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter in the first part of the list.
\"I rank the guys in this order, because I think it fits best in the tournament,\" said Bjorn with regard to the chosen players of the same game.
Re-entry into service of the new German troops
German carflots had to be put into operation in 2014, replacing an ageing karate of Cold War time troops, but it will not happen at least until next year due to the wrong system and rising costs, it reported to local media.
The release into service of the Rheinland-Pfalz core vessel of the Baden-Württemberg class is now postponed until the first half of 2019 and reported in the Die Zeit newspaper, citing a military representative.
The ship had to join the carflot in 2014, but unpleasant post-supply problems affected the fate of the ambitious project.
Four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class, ordered by carflot back in 2007, will replace the old Bremen class of fregate.
It is expected that they will be equipped with powerful guns, a range of anti-aircraft and air missiles, as well as some secret technologies such as reduced reception of radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other essential features include longer maintenance periods: it must be possible to deploy new fregates for up to two years away from the ports where they are registered.
However, the continuing delay means that new technology warships, which would allow Germany to demonstrate its power in overseas countries, will already be obsolete until the entry into force of the note “Di Zeit-
The unsuccessful fregate F125 last year was in all the headlines when the German carflot officially refused to put the ship into service and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss- Hamburg yard.
This was the first time that Karflot returned it back to the yard after the ship had been delivered.
Although the reasons for this were little known, the German media referred to a number of significant ‘software and equipment defects’, which would render warships invalid if used in combat missions.
The software's weaknesses were particularly significant, as the ships of the Baden-Württemberg class are operated by a crew of about 120 seafarers, which is only half of the oldest Bremen class personnel.
It also showed that the ship had too much weight, which reduced its performance and limited the future ability of carflots to carry out its future improvements.
It is believed that 7,000 tonnes of heavy-duty vessel Rheinland-Pfalz are twice as heavy as that of a similar class used by Germany during World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the costs of the whole project (including crew training) also became a major problem.
It is said that it has cost EUR 3.1 billion instead of EUR 2.2 billion originally envisaged.
The challenges associated with the new freacts are becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the German Navy will be weakened.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament, acknowledged that the carflot really had a lack of ships to be used
The official claimed that this problem had been significantly magnified over time as old ships were taken out of service but were not delivered instead.
He regretted that none of Baden-Württemberg class fregates had joined the carfote.
“National Trust – listens to the secret bat life
The new study, carried out in the possession of a Scottish highland, focuses on discovering how bats used the landscape in the food search process.
The findings are expected to introduce new clarity on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and contribute to their future protection.
Scottish-National Trust, scientists in Invereves gardens in Vesteros will explore punches, pigmejus bats, brown longs and water night bats.
Special recorders will be deployed in key locations to track the bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand detectors.
The sound experts will analyse all records to determine the frequency of bat calls and the species involved in the specific actions.
A habitat map and a report will then be developed to create a detailed landscape view showing the behaviour of bats.
NTS nature conservation advisor Rob Dewar hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help to identify the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows, and how best to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
During the last centenary, the population of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom has fallen significantly.
These land is threatened by construction and development works affecting the loss of bat skiing and residence.
Wind generators and lighting can also pose a risk, as is the case with sandwich paper and chemical treatments for certain construction materials, as well as cat attacks.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, because of their overnight hunting habits, their ears are more valuable than their eyes.
They use a complex echo-location location method to find insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for over 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land all over the country, takes the problem of bats very seriously.
The organisation has ten trained experts who regularly carry out surveys, checks on bat concealment and sometimes even on rescue operations.
The organization has even set up Scotland’s first and only special bat reserve, Threave, owned by Damfries and Galowee, with eight of the ten bat species found in Scotland.
Property manager David Thompson claims that this territory is ideal for bats.
\"This is a great place for bats,\" he said.
“We have old buildings, many old trees and a generally suitable habitat.
But there are still enough things we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us to better understand what they need to survive.
He stressed that it was important to check that bats would not be carried out at the site before carrying out property maintenance work, as one mother's hiding sites might be killed by up to 400 females and their young children, possibly destroying all local populations.
The bats are protected animals and must not be killed, killed, disturbed, or destroyed by their hiding sites.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a member of the Scottish Conservation Trust, has called on the public to help.
She said: “We still have much to learn about bats, and for several of their species, we just don’t know how they are --
Ronaldo rejects the rape of charges by appointing lawyers to sue the German magazine
Crishian Ronaldo has condemned the rape of accusations against him as “false news, ” claiming that people “will pay attention by using his name. ”
His lawyers are assigned to sue the German News magazine Deer Spiegel, which published these statements.
Portuguese origin and Turin-Juventus, a football star, are accused of rape by American women Katryn Mayorga in 2009 in Las Vegas.
He said that he paid $375,000 to a woman to keep silent for this incident, she said on Friday, “Der Spiegel! ”
A few hours after these statements were made, Ronald, 33, through Instagram’s online video, asked 142 million followers to describe this information as “false news. ”
\"No, no, no, no.
What they have claimed today is false news: the fifth award winner of the Bellon d'Or was delivered in the cell.
\"They want to be famous by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to become famous at the expense of my name, it is part of my work.
I'm a happy person, and everything's good – a smile added by the player.
According to the information provided by Reuters, Ronalde’s lawyers are going to sue the magazine Deer Spiegel on the claims they have made on the grounds of suspicion in the area of privacy.
Lawyer Cristian Schertz stated that the player would claim compensation for ‘moorous damage to the extent that it corresponds to the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of the rights of the individual in recent years.
The incident occurred in June 2009 in the class room “Palms Hotel and Casino” in Las Vegas.
According to documents submitted by the State State State of Nevada at the Clark district court, it is reported that he returned to the player's hotel number after having met the nightclub in Ronald and Majorga, where he was an anal raper.
Majorga claims that the incident Ronalde has fallen on its knees and said that it is a great boy of 99 percent but that it has fallen by one percent.
According to the information contained in the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but this was done by mutual agreement.
Mayorga also claims to have taken pictures of the injuries at the police station, but later she agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt “fear of abomination ” and worried about “public humiliation...
A 34 - year - old woman claims that she does not want to agree to the terms of this reconciliation because the incident has caused lasting injury.
When these statements were made, Ronaldo was about to move from Manchester United to Real Madrid, but this summer it went to the Italian granda, Juventus, for 100 million euros.
Brext: United Kingdom to regret the loss of carmakers
“The United Kingdom, if it loses its world leader's position in car manufacturing, is sorry for all time, ” said Greg Clark, the business secretary.
The fact that Toyota UK has declared BBC that if Britain leave the EU without agreement, it will temporarily stop production at the Burnston plant close to Dubai.
\"We need an agreement,\" Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese author said that in the case of a border delay in Breksita, without agreement could put a job in the game.
Burnston factory producing Toyota – models Auris – and Avensis – produced almost 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to other Member States of the European Union.
“In my opinion, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our factory will be stopped,” said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda-BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have been concerned about exit from the EU without a contract and how cross-border trade will work.
For example, BMW claims that after Brexita will close his mini - plant in Oxford for a month.
According to the car manufacturers, the main concern is that the supply chain is threatened if no agreement is reached after Brexita.
“Toyota, a production line, operates on a time basis, where cars made on order come in shares from both UK and EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement on 29 March, there could be a disturbance at the border that could lead to partial delays and shortages.
According to the company, Toyota, it would not be possible to hold more than one day's valuable inventory at the factory in Darfur and would therefore have to stop production.
Mr Clark said that the withdrawal plan (Chequers) drawn up by Teresa May for the future relationship with the EU has been estimated to be ‘precisely calculated to avoid such border checks’.
“We need an agreement. We want the best deal that would allow me, as I would say, not only to benefit at the present moment but also to take advantage of this opportunity,” he said.
\"The proof of this not only from Toyota, but also from other producers, is that we must be able to pursue the very successful strategy of supply chains in full,\"
“Toyota” failed to tell us how long the production could be stopped, but warned that the growing costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness in the long term and ultimately put jobs at risk.
Peter Tsouvallar, who has been in Burnaton for 24 years and operates as a coordinator of unification, said that his members are more and more concerned: “From experience I can say that as soon as one position disappears, it doesn’t come back.
The government representative said: “We have submitted an accurate and credible plan for our future relations with the EU to be
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, reports the White House
An important meeting with the Deputy Prosecutor General Rhod Rosenstein may be postponed for another week – because the fight against the Supreme Court candidate Bret Kaveno continues, it was reported to the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein monitors the special advisor Robert Mueller, who investigates the interference in the Russian elections, the link between the means used by Trump and Russia and the alleged violation of the rule of law by the President.
For months now, Tramp is being put in Washington for a release of Deputy Prosecutor General, which will threaten Miller’s independence.
At the beginning of this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed recording negotiations with Trampa and stopping the President with Amendment 25.
Rosestein denied this information.
Last Monday, however, he went to the White House, where he was disappointed with the talk of his resignation.
Instead, a Thursday meeting with Trampa, who was then at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, was announced.
Tramp said that “it was better not to release Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with the hearing of the Senate's court committee, in which he showed both Kaveno and one of the women who accused him of committing a sexual violation, Dr. Kristīne Blaija Forda.
On Friday, Tramps ordered the FBI to carry out a week-long inquiry into the allegations raised by Kaveno, continuing to delay the vote of the Senate.
Tampa Press Secretary Sarah Sanders visited Fox News Sunday –
She replied: “The date of the meeting is not yet set, it could be this week or postponed for a week, taking into account all the cases that take place around the Supreme Court.
But we'll see it, and I always want to inform you about the news.
Some reporters contest this claim: Sandersa has not organised the White House press raid since 10 September.
The leader, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of ravens is not related to the displeasure of the television reporter’s humiliation, although she added: “I wouldn’t deny them that they were famous.
She then suggested direct contact between Trampa, which would lead to increased press interest.
\"The president is more involved in questions and answers than any president before him,\" she said and added, without providing any further information: \"We were interested in the number of questions.\"
Sanders claimed that the truffles would continue, but, if the press had the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it is far better than talking to me.
We are trying to do a lot, and you see that we have done a lot in recent weeks, and this will happen instead of a press break, when you can talk to the President of the United States -
Trumps regularly answers questions by leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences attended by important people.
Individual press conferences are rarely held.
Perhaps the President demonstrated that reason this week in New York by making the reporter's crowd uncontrolled and somewhat strange expressions.
The Minister for Health writes to the EU staff at the Scottish NHS on the fears associated with Brexitu
The Minister for Health has signed up for EU staff working at the Scottish National Health Service (NHS) to express their gratitude and wish them their strength after Breksita.
Jean Freeman sent a letter to MSP less than six months before the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish Government is already committed to covering the costs of standing applications for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In his letter, Friman wrote: “In summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU continued on the withdrawal leading to the decisions to be taken this autumn.
However, the UK Government is also preparing a possible scenario in the absence of agreement.
I know this is a very restless time for you.
Therefore, I would like to emphasise once again how much I appreciate every employee involvement, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues offer valuable experience and skills from both the EU and beyond to strengthen and improve the work of the healthcare service and to benefit patients and communities in our care.
Scotland is definitely your home, and we very much want to stay here.
After his head injury, Christian Abercrombymby is conducting an emergency surgery
In Tennessee, the State of Tigers, the guard, Christice Abercrombie, was the victim of an emergency operation after a head injury, which he won in a Saturday game with a score of 31-27 at the vanderbilt Commodores, reported by Tennessean, a sports reporter Mike Organ.
In Tennessee, a team chief coach, Rod Reed, told the reporters that the injury was obtained shortly before midnight.
“He came to the sideline and fell, ” said Rid.
While Aberkrombie was on the sideline, the coach and medical personnel gave him oxygen, then placed him on the backside and sent him for further investigation.
An official of the State of Tennessee told the reporter Chris Harris that Aberkrombie was isolated in the medical center of the University of Vanderbilt.
Harry added that, for the time being, there is no information on the type/severeness of injury and the state team of Tennessee is trying to understand the time at which the injury occurred.
Abercromy, a representative of the red shirt, is in his first season after Ilionya was replaced by the command of the State of Tennessee.

Foreign buyers will have to pay higher public fees when buying property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher public price when buying property in the United Kingdom, and the additional assets obtained will be used to help the homeless in line with the new Tory – plan.
Such a step will counteract the efforts made by Corbin to attract new voters.
An increased public duty will be applied to non-taxable persons in the United Kingdom.
The Treasury provides that up to GBP 120 million may be collected per year to provide assistance to the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher public price when buying property in the United Kingdom and redirecting the additional funds obtained to provide help to the homeless, it will report today to Tereza Meja.
Such a step is considered to be an attempt to counteract the efforts of Jeremy Corbyn to attract new voters with promises to provide housing at a more affordable price and address the wealthiest part of society.
The increased state tax will be applied to persons and companies not liable to tax in the United Kingdom, giving additional money to the government's efforts to combat the homelessness problem.
The premium included in the current public levy, including the application of a higher level of charges introduced two years ago for the purchase and purchase of another place for leasing purposes, could be as high as three per cent.
The Treasury expects such a step to be complementary to its budget of up to GBP 120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of the newly built property of London is bought by non-residents, thus blowing prices and making it difficult for first-time buyers to get to their homes.
Many of the rich territories of the country, especially in the capital, have become cities of spacuses, due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy was presented only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the national tax so that more young people could be allowed to buy their own home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high prices in real estate by sinking land but not using it, and urged Mrs Meja to give up quotas for affordable housing in order to deal with British housing.
Mr Korbin has put forward a series of attractive housing reforms, including reforms on rent control and removal from housing for no reason.
He also wants to give boards more powers to build new housing.
Mrs. Mia said: \"Last year I would mention using my Prime Minister's position in order to restore the dream of Britain: every new generation must have a better quality of life.
And that means adjustment of the housing market that we are doing down.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and set up their lives here.
It is not right, however, that housing can be purchased as easily as foreign companies and people who do not live in the United Kingdom as hard-working British citizens.
Many have become too far away with a dream of their home, and the harsh problem of homeless people is still topical:
Jack Ross: “My main goal is to lead the “Scottland”
“Sunderland – manager Jack Ross claims that his main goal is to become a head of Scottland at some point.
Scott, 42, has accepted the challenge of restoring the north-east club, which currently takes third place in the first league with three points from the top.
This summer he passed on to the Stateum of Light – after St Mirren – to return to Scotland's Prime Minister last season.
\"As a player, I wanted to play for my country.
I got the B cup, which was everything, for Scotland-BBC's Sportsound, said Ross.
\"However, I grew up with my father watching Scottland – games in Hampden Park, and it has always called me back.
However, this option would only appear if I were successful in managing the club:
The predecessors of Ross, Sunderland, are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic claims that he has not felt apprehension in following the footsteps of such a large club of recognized leaders, rejecting in advance the offers made by Barnsley and Ipswich.
“My success is now measured by whether I can return to the premiere of these clubs.
Because of the structure and possibilities of this club, it undoubtedly fits in in the premiere, he said.
“Returning the club's premiere will not be an easy task, but I'll probably think I'll have succeeded here only once this task has been accomplished,” he said.
Ross is only in the third year of his career as head of director, who has worked for some time as Deputy Director in Dumbarton and spent 15 months in the composition of the Hearts-trainers.
Then he helped the club Alloa to recover from falling to the third level and helped St. Mirren to win the champion’s title in the same season.
Ross claims that it is much more comfortable at the moment than during his player's career in clubs-Clyde--Charlepool--Falkirk--St Mirren- and-Hamilton Academic--
“It may have been a true crucifix, ” he remembers taking responsibility for the “Alloa ”
“I really believed that management was my real call, much more suitable than playing.
It sounds strange because I have made good progress, I can live from it and enjoy certain heights as well.
But it can be difficult to play.
We have to go through a lot of things every week.
I still feel it because of stress and pressure on work, but control is my problem.
I've always wanted to lead and now I'm doing it. I think I'm in the right place, I've never felt so good throughout my life.
You can listen to the full Sportsound interview on Sunday, September 30, at the Scottish Radio from 12.00 to 13.00, in the British summer time.
The survey found that the best time to enjoy the basket is 5.30 p.m. Saturday dinner.
The summer heat wave has caused the UK to subscrib, but it has increased pressure on restaurant chains.
The aggregated data showed that in July the sales of pubs and bars increased by 2.7 per cent, but in restaurants they decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, representing the business consultancy agency CGA who collected data, said: “Even after all, the sunny time and the long presence of England in the World Cup meant that in July there was a similar trend to June, i.e. a 2.8 percent increase in the yield of the crocodiles, while restaurants fell.
Restaurants, whose sales in June dropped by 1.8 percent, faced an even worse situation in July.
The situation in the beverage courts and bars was the most gratifying, as they experienced much higher upswings than restaurants were going down.
The food - based pubs suffered from the sun, but they were less dramatic than restaurant workers.
People seemed to just want to go out for a drink.
The monthly distribution of the fruit and bars increased by 6.6 percent, while food sales dropped by 3 percent –
RSM resting and hospitality analyst Paul Newman said: “These results continue the trend observed at the end of April.
The weather conditions and the impact of extensive social or sporting events are the biggest factors determining the turnover outside the home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups will continue to fight, although the drop in sales by 4.8 percent compared to the relevant period of the previous year will be particularly painful for additional constant cost pressures.
With regard to food providers, long and hot summers could not come at even more appropriate times, and the time will show whether the moderate temperature that we usually experience in August will provide the much-needed cooler -
The overall increase in sales among pubs and restaurants, including in new companies, reached 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a decrease in brand sales.

Every fifth child has a secret social media account that it hides from its parents
The survey reveals that every fifth child, some of whom are only 11 years old, has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed a false increase in Instagram pages.
This information has raised concerns about the publication of content of a sexual nature.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a “key ” account to show to their parents.
Every fifth child, some of which are only 11 years old, is responsible for social media accounts that they hide from adults.
The survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed that the photo sharing site Instagram is increasing rapidly.
This information has raised concerns about the publication of content of a sexual nature.
Twenty percent of the students said they had “a clean, key account to show to their parents and private accounts.
A mother in her 13 - year - old secret home revealed a teenager who encouraged others to rape her.
A study carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent Schools (HMC) revealed that 40 percent of 11-18 year-old students had two profiles, only half of which were identified as maintaining private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: “It’s frightening that so many teenagers form online profiles where parents and teachers can’t find them.
Eilīds Doila will be a ‘light voice’: Scotland’s Lighthouse Board
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Executive Board of Scotland without executive powers at the Annual General Meeting of the Board of the Eilidh Doyle.
Doila is the most award-up space and outdoor space, and President Ian Beatti described this step as an excellent opportunity for those who are driven by sport to benefit from her extensive experience at international level over the last ten years.
“The route is dedicated to a great deal of respect across the Scottish, UK and global palate communities, and we are convinced that Scotland will benefit greatly from its presence in their rule, ” said Betty.
Doila said: “I do not want to act as a “light voice” and I hope I can really get involved and help drive this sport into Scotland.
An American who won 200 metres and 400 metres in race at the 1996 Atlantic Olympics, thus obtaining a total of four Olympic gold medals, and is now a regular BBC panel, was unable to cope with a transient ischaemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “I had strokes on this day a month ago.
I couldn't go.
Doctors have claimed that only time will show whether and to what extent I will recover.
It was a terrible job, but I am fully recovering, learned to walk again, and I can already practice it today!
Thank you for the encouraging words:
Opinions on the advertising of breast milk pump comparing mothers to cows
Breast milk pumping company has taken care of shared online views on advertising comparing feeding mothers with milking.
To mark the release of the so-called, first silent breast pump in the world, Elvie, the consumer technology company released a sticky bell to demonstrate the freedom that the new pump provides for breastfeeding mothers.
Four true mothers in a hay - filled cow cake say about this: “Yes, I knock myself out, but you can’t see any tail, and if you didn’t notice it, it’s not my breasts.
She continues: “Excuse, absorb, feed, remove, remove, and remove, and I give up my ladies. ”
However, advertising published on the company’s Facebook page has produced a wide range of online resonances.
77,000 times viewed and hundreds of comments received from the viewers, many claim that this highlights the beauty of the dairy industry.
\"The decision to use cows for the advertising of the product is quite wrong.
As we do, they must become hard - to - live to produce milk, but their offspring must be taken away from them a few days after their birth, as they wrote.
Elvie – Breast Milk Pump inconspicuously belongs to breast-feeding women (Elvie/Sother)
Another comment states: “I understand that it is traumatic to both mother and baby.
But why not use it to promote breast milk pumps for mothers who can keep their babies...
It also said: “Advertising did not know what they were doing...
Others defended the advertising, and one woman admitted that she felt that the song was “sympathetic...
\"I think it's an excellent idea.
I would buy it if I was still breastfed.
The milk withdrawal made me feel like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I figured it out.
This is a generic product, as it was written.
The other comment states: “It is a fun advertising, for mothers that separate milk (seats in workplaces or toilets) and feel like - cow’s -
It's not an advertising that praises or condemns the dairy industry.
At the end of the advertising, a group of women discover that they all danced with unobtrusive pumps placed in their bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the observation that many women who relax milk claim to feel like cows.
However, “Elvie Pump, the pump is quiet, has no wire and pipes, and it is inconspicuously part of the breastplate for women, allowing them to move freely, keep their babies, and even take part in events outside their home.
Anna Balarin – Women, partner and creative director, commented: “Elvie Pump – pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves to be bold and provocative to the market.
With reference to the parallel between the women who separate the milk and the dairy cows, we wanted to pay attention to milk milk's milk's milk's milk's milk's milk's milk's milk's milk's milk's milk's milk's milking process, while demonstrating in an entertaining and intelligible way the feeling of shocking freedom that the new pump will carry.
This is not the first time that the Elvie pump has come to the heart.
During the London Modes week, a two - child mother appeared on the tongue of Martha Jacuwski when using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to the tent city at Texas's border
The number of migrant children detained has grown rapidly, although the border is crossed by as many people as before every month, and this is partly achieved by the harsh rhetoric and policy implemented by the Trump administration, which has made it difficult for children to be housed on sponsors.
Usually, most sponsors have also been undocumented immigrants, fearing that accepting a child will jeopardise their chance of staying in the country.
The risk increased in June, when federal officials announced that prospective sponsors and other members of their household would have to allow the removal of fingerprints, and this data would also be communicated to other immigration-related authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, senior official on the enforcement of immigration and customs laws, showed that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for sponsoring unaccompanied minors before the convention.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70 percent of arrested persons had not been punished in advance.
\"Almost 80 percent of the persons who are either sponsors or members of the sponsor's household stay here illegally, and a large proportion of them are criminal foreigners.
So we continue to persecute such individuals, says Mr. Albens.
According to asylum workers, in an effort to deal with child cases more quickly, officials have introduced new rules which will require some of them to appear before the court within a month after the arrest, not after 60 days, as stipulated in the previous standard.
Many will use the possibility of a videoconferencing call instead of coming in person to defend their legal status before the immigration judge.
Persons who will be considered inappropriate for obtaining exemption will be promptly expelled.
The longer children are held in custody, the greater the likelihood that they will become restless or depressed, which may lead to violent attacks or attempts to flee, has been reported in line with the information and evidence provided by asylum workers that have been taken out of the system in recent months.
The lawyers claimed that these concerns will be exacerbated by larger objects such as Tornillo, where the signs of child suffering are more often overlooked due to their extent.
They added that the transfer of children to the tent city, without taking enough time for their emotional preparation or the ability to let their friends say goodbye, could lead to traumas that many already struggle with.
Syria compels the US, France and Turkey to export their troops immediately
Looking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is already going on for eight years.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, claimed that foreign forces are illegal in Syria under the pretext of combating terrorism and will be dealt with accordingly:
“They must go away immediately and without any conditions, ” he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that in Syria, where more than 360 000 people died and millions were forced to leave their homes since 2011, the war against terrorism is almost over -
He declared that Damascus would continue to fight in the Holy War until all Syrian territories were cleansed of both the two terrorist groups and any foreign military presence.
The United States has deployed some 2,000 troops in Syria, who are mainly teaching and advising both the forces of the Kurds and the Syrian Arabs, who are opponents of President Bashar Al Asada.
France has sent over 1,000 men to this war - hurried country.
On the question of refugees, Mualem said that circumstances were great to bring back, and blamed the spread of irrational fears from a number of Western countries, why the refugees did not want to return.
\"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return,\" he said.
\"These people are politicising what should be a humanitarian issue only:
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not receive assistance for the reconstruction of the country before an agreement on ending the war is reached between Asada and the opposition.
UN diplomats explain that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in Idlib, the last rebel pillar, has made it possible to accelerate political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by the Russian-Turkish forces against the province of three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement - certain deadlines - and expressed hope that the military action would target the Jihadists, including the fighters from the Al-Qaeda related group - Jabhat al Nusrah - who would be destroyed -
The Ambassador of the UN, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to convene the first meetings of the new Committee, which will be composed of representatives of governments and the opposition, to draw up the post-war constitution of Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set out the conditions for the participation of the Syrian State in the committee, stressing that the work of the group would be limited to revising the articles of the existing constitution – and warned of intervention.
Why Trump will be elected to a second term
From this point of view, Mr Trump will be elected to the elections in 2020 if, and perhaps to that, many liberal observers, implications and scandals hope not to put an early stop to his Presidency.
And in that case, it will be the most dramatic final of the Presidency at all times.
At the moment, there is no evidence of the relaxation of the observers.
Since 2014, the ratings have more than doubled over the most advantageous times of CNN, reaching 1.05 million, but they have almost tripled at MSNBC, reaching 1.6 million.
Fox News informs Nielsen about 2.4 million viewers during the most favourable broadcast time, compared to 1.7 million years ago, while MSNBC-The Rachel Maddow Show-1 is at its highest position in cable TV rating with 3.5 million key news viewers in the evening.
“It’s a fire that attracts many people because it’s an inconceivable thing for us,” explained Neal Baer, the pillar of ABC’s drama “Designed Survivor”, which tells us about the secretary of the Cabinet of Ministers who becomes the president after the attack was destroyed by Capitol.
Nellai Scovell, a composer for the writer-veterāne and “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, the author has his own theory.
She remembers a taxi trip in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The leader told her that he would vote in favour of Mr Trump.
She wanted to know why.
\"He said, \"That's why he's laughing at me,\" said Ms. Skowel.
Haos is, to some extent, entertaining.
Of course, unlike the rest of TV shown, news from Washington could determine what will happen with the Rou judgment against Wade, whether immigrant families can unite themselves, and the state of the global economy.
Ignoring is a luxury that can only be enjoyed by the most attractive observers.
However, this is more than an informed citizen when, at six hours, we are discussing an expert group on how Bob Woodward used unnamed sources of information for his book “Fear - Paul Manafort, a 15 thousand-dollar bomber-type suit from the dead feathers and skin-wear from which pride sucks,” said «Washington Post», and on what will be the passion for Mr Trampa, Mr. Stormy Daniels, will play in describing the anatomical details.
I, for example, will never perceive the Super Mario as before.
“Some of what he is doing, which gives the impression of reality, is that he is informed every day, ” said Brent Montgomery, the creator of the Wheelhouse Entertainment, and the director of the Pawn Stars, explained about the variable team and daily developments of Trump’s show (crediting to N.F.L., Kyma Channa).

Money flows from outside into the most advanced parliamentary election campaigns
It is no wonder that the 17th Congress of Pennsylvania aims to receive money through the conversion of Congress areas, which will lead to two existing Members fighting for one place.
This recently modified region of Pittsburgh is linked to the democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won his place in the special elections in spring last year in another area.
Lembs will fight with another current Member, the Republican Kita Rothfus, who currently represents the former Pennsylvania district 12, which largely overlaps with the new 17th region.
After the decision of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January that the old areas were unconstitutionally divided in favour of the Republicans, the maps were revised.
Competition in the new region 17 has led to the struggle between the main financial groups of the parties: the Democrat Campaign Congress Committee and the National Republican Campaign Committee.
Lemb became known in Pennsylvania when he won the widely observed March elections at the 18th Congress District of Pennsylvania.
This place was held by Republicans for more than 10 years, and President Donald Trumps won 20 points in this area.
Political experts provide a small outweigh for the democrats.
The United States considered the punishment of El Salvador for Chinese aid, but then reconsidered
Diplomats acknowledged that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already acknowledged Beijing without much pressure from Washington.
Mr Trampa had a friendly meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, and he stayed in the hotel in Panama until the partners placed the team of the Trampa Organisation Management.
The officials of the State Department decided to withdraw the leaders of the United States diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, on the basis of a ‘no decision to refuse to recognise Taiwan’, a representative of its Department, Heather Nauert, indicated in a notice earlier this month.
However, only El Salvador, which received an amount of approximately 140 million from America in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support, was considered subject to sanctions.
The proposed penalties, including the reduction of financial assistance and the limitation of targeted visas, would be painful for a Central American country where unemployment and murders have reached its highest level.
At internal meetings, the North American and Central American officials left a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity, which would have followed a similar meeting last year, which was recognised as an approximation effort to prevent the relocation of migrants to the US.
In mid-September, senior officials of the state made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, effectively ending the considerations of punishing El Salvador.
The diplomats informed that Vice President Mike Pence has now decided to take part in the conference planned for mid-October, to show how serious the Administration emphasises the meeting.
And three American ambassadors quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without new and serious statements or penalties from Washington.
The representative of the White House who spoke on behalf of Mr Bolton did not want to provide more information on the debate, which was described by three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to consult in internal negotiations if their anonymity was maintained.
He was confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on condition that his anonymity will be preserved.
Studying history
A second stone garden could be the report by the Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller that Mr Trumpa may have prevented justice, which has had a great deal of evidence at the disposal of the public.
It is claimed that Mr Miller will also investigate whether the Trump campaign has co-operated in secret with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the other party goes ahead in Congress, Tramp will have to answer the structure and perhaps the jury of his associates just when he is coming back to meet the voters.
But I did not claim that the fall of the Trump is inevitable or that it will happen to his fellows in Europe.
There are choices that will have to be made on all sides of the Atlantic, and these choices will show the length of the struggle.
In 1938 German officers were prepared to turn to Hitler if the West had opposed him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid an extended blood bath.
History is turning around these turning points, and the unstoppable path of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The Americans now have to deal with a number of such turning points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump is to release a man under the control of Mr. Miller's investigation, Head Rod Rosenstein?
It has been difficult for Rosenstein since it was reported that last year he proposed secretly to keep a conversation with the President and thought about his ineligibility to the post.
Mr. Rosenstein states that “The Times is not a precise story.
«How can we respond if the requested FBI investigation into Bret Kaveno is not yet complete or fair, or if he will be approved for the position of the Supreme Court judge despite his unscrupulous testimony and credible accusations in the sexual attack?
And what is most important, will we vote in interim elections to the Congress that calls Trampa responsible?
If we do not pass all these challenges, democracy will enter a long winter.
But I believe that we will succeed by referring to what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jewish woman who was sent to Auschwitz the same Nazi regime, once in my homehouse.
She survived, emigrated America and sent me to light Sabata candles on the table with a swastic for 60 years later.
I am not optimistic about our future if I have such an inheritance:

“Rangers – the star Graham Dorran feels optimistic about the fight against Vienna – Rapid.
\"Rangers – will welcome themselves on Thursday, Vienna – Rapid – knowing that the victory over the Austrians after the impressive unsorted game in Spain with \"Villarreal\" will allow them to take on a stable position earlier this month to qualify from the European League G Group.
The road injury did not allow the center attacker Gram Dorans to resume playing part in the seasonal games until the undistinct result of 2:2 with “Villarreal”, but he believes that “Rangers ” can be used as trampling to achieve even more.
“We can be happy about this because Villarreal is a good team, ” said 31 - year - old football player.
“We went to play by believing that we were able to succeed, and we got this point.
Perhaps we could have done them at the end, but in general, an undisputed result is a fair one.
They were probably better in the first half, but we were in the second half, and we were a better team.
And on Thursday, there will be one more significant night for Europe.
Hopefully we will get three points, but it will not be a easy game, because they have achieved a good result in the previous game, but I am sure that with the help of our supporters we will be able to continue to fight and achieve good results.
The last year, with all my injuries and changes in the club itself, was clearly heavy, but now there are new cools that I feel good.
The team is great and the guys enjoy it; training is good.
I hope that we will be able to continue the fight, leave the past season behind and make progress.
Women cannot sleep because they worry about their pension savings
Although the interested parties knew clearly what care they wanted, few had discussed this issue with family members.
Around half of the individuals in a national study indicated that they were not talking to a matrimonial friend about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said that they had talked to their children.
“People want family members to take care of them, but they don’t do anything to talk about it, ” reveals Holly Snyder, Vice President of the State Life Insurance Agency.
That's what we should start with.
Talk to your spouse's friend and children. You can't prepare your family for you to need care if you don't do your wishes well for a long time ago.
Work together with your consultant and family to talk about where and how to get care, as these choices can be an important factor in determining costs.
Get your financial consultant involved. Your consultant can also help you to figure out how to cover these costs.
Your ability to provide financing for long-term care may include traditional long-term care insurance policies, hybrid insurance policies with an amount of cash to cover these costs, or provision of care using your own assets, above all, that you have money.
Make your own legal documents; you will avoid legal struggles before they start.
Talk to the authorised person on health matters so that you have a trusted person who will monitor your healthcare and ensure that your specialists will act in accordance with your wishes if you are not able to express them.
Consider also the possibility of granting a mandate for finance.
Choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf that will take care of your bills if you are not able to do so on your own account.
And do not forget the seemingly tiny details! Imagine that one of your elderly parents is being taken to a hospital to receive emergency assistance.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to the government, a strong earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Pala on Friday have killed at least 384 people. It is expected that the number of victims will increase.
Because of the devastation of communications, the rescuers have not been able to obtain any information from the region of Dongala, located north of Pala, closer to the epicentre of the earthquake of 7.5 magnids.
More than 16 000 people were evacuated from the devastating natural disaster.
Here is the basic information about Palau and Dongal, which are located on the island of Sulavesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi and is located on the west coast of the island of the narrow bay. In 2017, it is estimated that 379 800 people lived in it.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami.
Dongala is an area extending approximately 300 km (180 miles) along the northwest coast of the Sulavesi island.
It is estimated that in 2017, the area of administration in the province had 299 200 people.
Fishing and farming are the backbone of the economy of the province of central Sulavesi, in particular in the coastal area of Dongala.
Nickel mining also plays an important role in the province, but it is mainly concentrated on Morovali, the opposite shore of Sulawesi.
As the Indonesian disaster prevention agency informs, Pala and Dongala have suffered several times in the last 100 years from a tsunami.
In 1938 more than 200 people were killed by the tsunami and destroyed hundreds of buildings in Dongal.
The tsunami also fell over the Western part of Dongal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in a seismicly active Pacific fire ring, which regularly produces earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
In 2004, a strong earthquake on the west coast of Aceh, in the north of Sumatra, on 26 December caused a tsunami affecting 14 countries, killing 226 000 people along the Indian coast, of which more than half were in Aceh.
2005: A strong series of earthquakes struck the Western coast of Sumara in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, which is near the coasts of Sumatra.
2006: 6,8 The heavy earthquake caused the islands of Java, Indonesia’s most populated country, to the south, leading to a tsunami hit on the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: The earthquake of 7.6 magnanids rose near Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people went to damage.

Federal prosecutors want to demand the rarely used execution of a person suspected of a terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors want to demand execution of Sayfullo Saipov, who is suspected of a terrorist attack in New York City when eight people were killed, and this is a rare form of punishment that has not been committed in the State since 1953 on federal crimes.
According to him, 30 - year - old Saipov used the Home Depot car to attack the West Side Highway at Lower Manhattan where he hit pedestrians and bikers on his way.
In order to justify execution, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov, with intent, killed eight victims and, with intent, caused serious injury, as stated in the notice of intent to apply for the death penalty before the New York South District Court.
According to a court document, both of these accusations can lead to the death penalty.
In weeks after the attack, the Federal Grand Jury passed an indictment article about the prosecution of Saipova in 22 charges, which included eight charges for extortion of murders, commonly used by federal prosecutors in organised crime, and an accusation of cruelty and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “significant planning and premeditation” explained to prosecutors that the attack by the Siipova was “scrupulous, cruel and inhuman. ”
“Sayfullo Habibulajevs Saipov injured, damaged and damaged the families and friends of these people: Djego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Anna-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendo and Alehandro Damyan Pagnoco, ” stated a statement of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years have passed since prosecutors of the South District Court in New York implemented a case of executions.
The accused Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug providers, but he was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in 2009.
The death penalty was last executed in New York’s federal case in 1953, against Julius and Ethhel Rosenberg, a married couple who was sentenced to death after being accused of taking part in a spying for the good of the Soviet Union two years ago.
The death penalty on an electric chair was executed on June 19, 1953.
According to judicial documents, during days and months, Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, did not regret the attack.
As the police inform us, he has told the investigators that he feels good about what he has done.
According to the article in South Kivu, officials were told that he had the inspiration to attack the ISIS video on his phone.
The police informed that he had also requested authorisation to place the ISIS flag in his Chamber.
He has rejected 22 indictments.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said that he was “a very naturally dissatisfied ” about the decision on the accusation.
“We believe that the intention to demand the death penalty rather than accepting the guilt of accepting the death sentence in exchange for non-disabled life imprisonment will only prolong the existing injury to all parties involved,” explained Patons.
The Siipova team has previously called on prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
The Conservative declares that the conduct of negotiations in Brexita should be trusted in the FARM
At the protest of Naigel Farah today, the Conservatory Conference promised - to mobilize the nation's army -
The former leaders of the British Independent Party said that politicians must feel the anger of Eurosceptics when one of the members of the Parliament of the Meejos proposed that negotiations with the EU should be trusted in him.
A member of the Conservative Line, Peter Bone, announced to March in Birmingham that Britain would have gone out for a long time had Mr Faraža been Minister of Breksita.
However, the challenge that Mrs Meuse will have to face in trying to reconcile his controversial party was demonstrated by conservatives who support their stay in the EU and joined a town-specific protest against Brexite.
The Prime Minister is struggling to maintain his own compromise plan on the future relationship between the Great Britain and the European Union (Chequers Community) and is facing attacks from those who want to leave the EU, from those who want to stay in the EU and from the EU itself.
They insisted on her determination to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite a negative reaction, and on the Eurosceptics and Labourists to choose between her offer and her-hoosa--
Mr Bouna-Leave Means Leave - (Solihull) declared that she wanted to discard the plan of the Meejos in the wetlands (to chuck Chequers).
He suggested making Mr Farajs an ally and entrusting him with discussions with Brussels.
“If he had been speaking, we would have already gone out, ” Boun declared.
Wellingborough, Member of Parliament, added: \"I will support Brexit, but we must throw away the Meeah plan.
In support of his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight for tankboards!
We want to make our own laws in our own country:
Mr Bouna ignored the assumptions that public opinion could have changed since the vote in 2016: \"The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is totally false:
Andrea Jenkins, a supporter of Breksita, also took part in the mars, and the reporters said: “I just say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
\"The Chequers plan is not a popular plan, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular with our party and our supporters who actually do all the work and want us.
Please refuse to Chequers and start listening to
She added: “The Prime Ministers remain in their place of fulfilling their promises.
Mr Farage said that politicians in their home country have to feel pressured if they are going to ignore the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
\"Now it's a matter of trust between us, people, and our politicians,\" he said.
\"They're trying to hand over Brexit and we're here today to tell them we're not gonna let them do this,\"
In his message to the eager crowd, he adds: “I want you to be impressed by our politicians who are planning to hand over Brexit.
\"We will call on the people of this country who have allowed us to win the Brekst, and we will never relax until we are independent, self-governing, proud of the United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, the leftrs made their way through Birmingham before the city centre, a two - hour - long house was held.
Unknown activists greeted conservatives with Breksita banners after the group meeting this weekend.
Lord Adonis, a representative of the Workers' Party, ridiculed the Conservatives on security issues that they experienced at the beginning of the party's application conference.
“These are the people who are telling us that they are able to maintain the order of the IT system and all their technology for Canada and yet, and still, undivided border, for free trade without borders with Ireland,” he added.
“This is an absolute farce.
There's no such thing as a successful Brocsch, he added.

It was a very bad body language
President Donald Tramps was mocked at Saturday's home by Senators Diane Feinstein for her persistence not to disclose a letter from Kristīne Blaise Ford in which she accused Bret Kaveno of sexual harassment.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the President did not speak directly about the Forda testimony which it provided to the Legal Commission of the Senate, but commented that what happened in the Senate shows that people there are “false, unsatisfied and unreliable...

I didn't do it.
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, have you washed the information?
Remember her answer to the question... have you washed the document?--Ah, what did you do?
Oh, no.
I didn't do it.
Okay, hold on a second.
Did we do that... no, we didn't do it, he added, senator int.
In July, a letter was sent to Feinstein explaining in detail why Forda accused Kaveno, and at the beginning of September the contents of the letter were disclosed, but Feinstein denies that this would have happened in her office.
“I didn’t hide her accusations by Dr Ford, I didn’t break her story, ” Feinstein told the commission, reported the Hill.
“She asked me to keep it confidential and I also did it, ” she said.
But her denial disliked the president who commented on this situation at Saturday’s evening meal: “I’ll tell you that it was a very bad language of the body.
Perhaps she didn't do it, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen.
While continuing to defend the candidate of the Supreme Court, whose three women are accused of sexual harassment, the President suggested that the democrats use the accusations for their good.
\"They are determined to regain power by any means
Whether you see evil or not, they don't care what they hurt, what they have to destroy to gain power and control, says the President-in-Office,

In a letter, Bonda’s daughter, Karen Jenkel, who was born shortly before the book was approved, said: “It’s hard to put yourself in a shoe that reads the book for the first time before it was published.

She added that the 60th anniversary of the book was “sorry bitter, ” after Father’s leaving forever last year.

The future of Breta Kaveno is in the air because of the opening of an investigation by FBI
“I think if we could really get what he asks for, in time and scale, in a limited investigation, we could achieve a little consensus, ” stated Fleik on Saturday, adding that he was concerned that the commission – divided by a sturdy partisan landscape.
Why do the supporters of Kaveno and his Republican do not want the FBI to carry out an investigation?
Their abstention is just a coincidence.
Intermediate election is five weeks later, on 6 November, if, as expected, the Republicans will disappear badly, then their attempts will be much weaker to elect a man from among themselves in the Supreme Court.
George Bush calls the senators, lobbying to support them in Kaveno, who worked at the White House during Bush and met his wife Ashley, who was President Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI prepares its report?
A vote will take place in the Senate, where 51 seats now belong to the Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It remains unclear whether Kaveno can obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pens to decide the vote and confirm him in the Supreme Court.
Kim’s leadership – number of North Korea’s political asylum seekers
North Korea’s number of political asylum seekers in South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong came to power seven years ago, said the South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, quoted by the South Korean Ministry of Merger, said that last year there were 1127 political asylum seekers, compared to 2011, when they were 2706.
The Park said that stricter border controls for star North Korea and China and high rates for people trafficking are key factors.
Pyongyang has not provided public comments.
The largest majority of political asylum seekers from North Korea are eventually offered the citizenship of South Korea.
Seula says that more than 30 000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most travel through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarisisation Zones (DMZs) between the two Koreas.
China considers political asylum seekers to be illegal immigrants and deports them forced.
Relations between North Korea and South Korea, which are still technically at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of both countries met Pyongyang to discuss the delayed denuclearisation negotiations.
This was the result of a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jongun in Singapore in June, when they agreed to cooperate, on the large trains, to release the Korean Peninsula from nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea Ri Yong-ho blamed the US for sanctions since these negotiations failed to progress.
“In the absence of confidence in the United States, there will be no faith in the security of our country, and under such circumstances we will not unilaterally attack the first ones,” said Ri, in our address at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Bret Kaveno “historic ” and claims that he is unsuitable for work in the Supreme Court.
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the minority in the Court of Justice, named the candidate of the Supreme Court Bret Kaveno as “historic” and claimed that he was not suitable for work in the Supreme Court because of his temperament.

“I can’t stop thinking that if a woman had acted like this, they would call him a hissthetic, ” said Pelosi about her response to the testimony given on Thursday to the Senate’s Judicial Commission by Kaveno.
Kaveno emotionally denied the accusations of sexual harassment against Dr. Kristina Blaija Forda, both of whom were teenagers.
In its initial argument, Kaveno was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and sniffing when talking about his family and high school years.
He condemned, in particular, the Democrats in the Commission, by nameing the accusations against him, that he was being held by liberals who were angry about the loss of Hilaria Clinton in the Presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said that she believed that Kaveno's testimony was a justification for not being able to work in the Supreme Court, because it showed that he had a bilateral attitude towards democracy.
“I think he disqualified himself with such statements and attitude towards someone he refers to Clinton and Democrats, ” she said.
Pelosi objected when she asked if she would try to question Kaveno if she was confirmed and if the Democratics acquired a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I will say that if he does not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he is not suitable for post not only in the Supreme Court but also to work in the existing workplace in the court,” Plosi said.
Kaveno, right now, is a judge at the Washington County Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a democrat is concerned about the possibility of Kaveno taking decisions against “Affordable Care Act” or “Roe v. V. V.”, because she is considered to be a conservative judge.
In his approval negotiations, Kaveno approached questions about whether he would reject decisions of the Supreme Court.
«Not a good time for a hysterical and double-husked court, but we would expect us to be happy to say, «Is it not wonderful?», said Pelosi.
But women have to hold themselves in their hands.
It's a denunciation, months and years, but it's not allowed to get all of it out of her.
“We cry when we are angry, ” said Mrs Steinemas in 45 years.
\"I don't think it's something unusual, as you think,
She continued, “One day a woman who was a leader in a company, told me that she cried when she was angry, but created a technique.
I'm angry...
And then she kept going.
And I thought it was great...
Asnares accept only partially as an angry discharge because they are misunderstood in their own foundations.
One of my brightest memories is from the oldest work of men who once wept because of the inexplicable anger of the older woman who screamed me behind a snare, a reticent driver (a woman), from whom I was always a little afraid of what drew me to the floor of the stairs.
\"Never let them see that weep, she told me.
“They don’t know you’re overpaid.
They think you’re upset and they’re just gonna be happy that they’ve managed to make you ‘pick under the skin’.
Patricia Schreder, then the U.S. Democrats Congress from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart for the president of his election campaign.
In 1987, when Hart, who was caught in an extramarital relationship, abandoned a ship called “magicing, ” and left the elections, Schreeder thought that there was no reason why she could not stand for the President.
“It wasn’t a carefully thought out decision, ” she laughed to me 30 years later.
\"There were already seven other candidates and the last one they wanted to find another.
There were those who called it “Sniegbalt and seven robes...
She was late in the campaign, was late in the money-laundering, and promised not to participate in the elections unless 2 million US dollars were collected.
It was a fight lost.
She found that many of her supporters, who donated $1,000 to men, made only $250 to her.
“Do they think I get discounts? She was surprised.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was very emotional, grateful to the people who supported her, disappointed in a system that made it very difficult to raise money and not to speak to the voters, and angry about sexism, in which she was,
“ You’d think I had a nerve collapse, ” said Schreeder about the way the press responded to him.
“You would think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor...
I remember thinking what they were going to write on my gravestone.
\"She cried out\"
Why the US-China trade war can be a positive Beijing
The main excuses for the beginning of the trade war between the US and China are hidden and while the struggle does not see the end, differences between countries may be favourable to Beijing in the long run, claimed experts.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued his first warning at the beginning of this year, imposing a tax on the main Chinese export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important escalation started this week with new rates affecting a unit of $200 billion ($150 billion) by immediately charging half of the goods exported to the US from China.
Beijing also responds each time, the latest one is five to ten percent of American goods worth $60 billion.
China has declared its commitment to respond to one by one of the US and is questionable that in the near future, the second largest economy in the world could be called into question.
In order for Washington to resign, there should be agreement with certain requirements, but the President of China, Xi Siji Jinpin, would be too embarrassing to be publicly condone in the United States.
However, the experts say that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the US trade war pressure can have a positive effect on China in the long term, reducing the dependence of the two economies on each other.
“The fact that political decisions were made quickly, either in Washington or Beijing, could create uncontrolled economic conditions in any of the countries, which are really more dangerous than the observers,” said Abigeila Greisa, “New American Security, a researcher focused on Asia.
Syria is a finished – refugee return, declared by the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
Syria argues that it is ready to return refugees voluntarily and calls for assistance in the reconstruction of a country that has been enlisted in the war for more than seven years.
As regards the United Nations Assembly, Foreign Minister Valids Almualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
“The current situation on land is much more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to restore the areas that have been destroyed by terrorism in their normal condition.
There are all conditions for refugees to return voluntarily to the country they were forced to leave for terrorism and unilateral economic measures that had an impact on their daily lives and their livelihoods.
The UN assumes that the country has left 5.5 million Syrians since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six million more people still live in the country and need humanitarian assistance.
They said that the Syrian regime would accept assistance in the reconstruction of an destroyed country.
But he stressed that the state would not accept the conditions for assistance or assistance from countries that helped sponsor riots.

The eight Raider Cup Veterans, the Spanish Serhio Garcia, became the tournament of the best player from Europe with 25.5 career points.
“It’s normal for me to cry, but today I can’t rule the tears ”
This was a difficult year.
I am truly grateful to Thomas that he built me up and believed me.
I'm very happy we've got the cup back.
It is a team merit, and I am happy that I could help, - Garcia was emotionally commented on the European victory.
He goes on to give his fellow John Raam, who won the US golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday with 2 to 1 singles.
“That pride I felt in winning the Taidger Woods, I grew up following the steps of this player, ” said 23 years of young Ramas.
Woods lost all his four Mays in France and now has a career record with 13-21-3 Raider's Cup.
Unusual statistics for one of the best players at all times who won 14 top level golf tournaments behind Jack Niclaus.
The U.S. team fought all weekend to find their chance, with the exception of Patrick Rid, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf courses throughout the tournament.
Says U.S. random captain Jim Furrick: “I was proud of the boys, and they fought.
This morning, we were able to exert little pressure on the European team.
We fought.
I have my respect for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players went for a very good game.
We will restructure, I will work with the American PGA-US Radio Cup and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to tap your hats.
We were won...
