Ethic guards: Liberals Movement Board on Vilnius branch member's right
“The decisions taken by the Management Board are in accordance with the articles of association – after the meeting of the commission, the BNS informed its head Vytautas Tamošūnas.
\"Our decision was not a new one.
An explanation as we had already done in July when the question of Pagėgėjiai and Utena was raised.
Then we said that, according to the statute, this is a question of the competence of the board.
And if the Governing Board decides that a section may act as it wishes - go to the committee and approve it, then the section can go, but if the Governing Board decides that there will be party lists everywhere, what the Governing Board has adopted, then it is a decision that all sections should form part lists.
And if you do not agree with the Governing Board, then there is the possibility of stopping membership and going to the Committee, he added.
According to Mr Tamošūnas, the party board will now decide on the next steps.
On October 17, the Liberal Movement Board cancelled the decision of Vilnius City Branch to participate in municipal elections, not with the list of the party's new election committee.
In the opinion of the party board, the decision of the capital liberals to participate in the elections in the form of a public election committee violated the statutes of the party and the decisions of the board.
By 31 October, the Vilnius branch had to cancel its wishes to participate in municipal elections with a list of committee members.
But the chapter didn't do that.
Former Head of Unit Aušrinė Armonaite has already withdrawn from the Liberals Movement.
The mayor of Vilnius, former Chairman of the Liberal Movement Remigijus Šimašius, promising to pursue another term of office of the head of the capital, has already presented the team and ideas of the public election committee “Už Vilnis”, which we proud of.
He left the party too.
Elections of municipal councils and mayors will take place in March of the following year.
In northern India, a tractor was used by a tractor that previously disciplined a man, and officials reported it on Monday.
The forest maintenance officer Mahavir Kaujagi said that the villagers surrounded the beast and, when the mother tried to get out, were doing a tractor for her late on Sunday.
The residents say that this tigris about 10 days ago also attacked and disciplined a young man.
The village is located in the Dudhva Tigers sanctuary in the Lakhympur Kherio district, approximately 250 km southeast of the capital of Utar Pradesh, Laknau.
It shall be prohibited to close the tiger in protected areas.
Director Ramesh Pandej said that according to the Wild Nature Conservation Act, the case will be reported to the police.
In April, in the Nighasan region of Utar Pradesh, villagers beat another tiger, who suffered serious injuries.
Tiger is an Indian national animal and is considered to be a endangered species under the Wildlife Conservation Act.
The government figures of last year show that at least one person every day died during the last three years of contact with wild tigers or elephants.
The number of human conflicts with tigers has been gradually increasing since the 1970s, when India launched a tiger protection programme, which established sanctuaries in national parks, and the final fear of the great cats started to be a crime.
Although tiger calculation methods have changed, censuses would suggest that the current population of approximately 1,800 tigers increased to 2,226 individuals in 2014.
It is proposed that cats and dogs be labelled on a mandatory basis with microchips
The Chairman of the Committee on Environmental Protection of the Seimas Kęstutis Mazeika, together with other members of the Seimas, registered amendments to the Law on Animal Welfare and Protection, which suggest that cats and dogs must be labelled with subcutaneous microchips.
“We propose that cats and dogs should be labelled with subcutaneous microchips and that local municipalities, the Ministry of Agriculture and the State Food and Veterinary Service organise their registration and labelling.
In 2019, all dogs will be labelled free of charge with state funds, and in 2020 all cats will be marked free of charge, so the population will not have any concerns and the costs will be covered by specially provided for state funding\" - said Kęstutis Mazeika, Chairman of the Seimas Committee on Environmental Protection.
The amendments to the law address the systematic need for animal labelling.
This is expected to help avoid the problems caused by irresponsible livestock breeders, illegal multipliers or sellers.
The preliminary assessment is that all animal owners will be compensated during the transitional period on the basis of the expected average price for the supply of the microchip and the service, which will amount to around EUR 5.
The total cost of labelling for all pet animals is estimated at up to €6 million.
These funds are expected to be spread over three years and reach €2 million annually.
The funds for labelling programmes are expected to be allocated through the Special Programme for Local Government Environment Protection, whose income will increase significantly this year due to increased tax and re-allocation of natural resources.
These funds will be available to municipalities not only for the labelling of cats and dogs, but also for castration and other programmes.
According to Mrs Mazeika, the mandatory labelling practice is widespread in almost all European Union countries, allowing protection of both animals themselves ( since the lost ones can be returned to their owners) and saving the time of the farmers themselves, when a large amount of time and money is spent on the search for a escaped and lost pet.
In addition, EU legislation provides that only marked pets can travel.
At the same time, labelling commits a responsible care of the animal throughout his life.
The previous mandatory labelling proposals have been opposed, as the programmes concerned have been proposed to finance the population.
\"The model now being provided should avoid this criticism, as the protection of animals is proposed to finance increased income from an environmental support programme and the right to be labelled not only for veterinary doctors, but also for public officials, i.e. persons from animal care establishments who have received special courses at the veterinary Academy,\" says the project authors.
The draft law has been registered by a group of Seimas Members representing different groups of the Seimas - Kęstutis Mazeika, Algimantas Dumbrava, Eugenijus Gentvilas, Edmundas Pupinis, Rimas Andrikis, Antanas Vinkus and others.

“ Women lie better, ” says the actress B. Arsobite persecutes the liars
It's probably just a coincidence, but the charming brownie actress Brigita Arsobaitė already gets roles for the liars on her way.
The series “Moterys lies better at first, then the performance “Melagė” and finally the comedija “Melagėgi! ”
In this film Brigita plays a devoted hero's wife, Dainius Kazlauskas.
“ I enjoyed filming in girls because I’m more theatre actress and I’m rarely in the film.
The wonderful team of colleagues gathered from the beginning promised an excellent result.
This experience is very important and valuable to me.
But the most interesting thing that happened in the lot was a puppet Sunny!
I thought if I had a dog, it would be big and serious.
I never admired those little, decorative-faffles, quadrants.
However, during my filming Sunny got so attached to me that the sympatheticity became mutual and I finally wanted to buy it from my master, but unsuccessfully, it was an actress who smiled.
From the very first minutes of this year, the comical and exciting peripeties of family members have been inspired by a new Lithuanian comedy “The meagics are produced by the Lithuanian film hits “Unexposed ” and “There are our boys and...” the producers Paul Virbickas and producers Stasys Baltakis and Vladimir Razarionovas.
Your beloved just said she's waiting.
That would be a good news, but... your beloved is your brother's wife!
But that is not all.
Not to be declared to all, the “good news, ” the parents say unexpectedly, they are different!
After 50 years together...
And all this is happening just before the most beautiful celebrations of the year - St. Christmas!
But the end will surprise us even more because no one expected such a nuclear attack.
All the heroes are not what they looked like at first glance...
In addition to B. Arsobaitė's creative “Dear Image, ” film stars from four times: Giedrius Savickas, Dainius Kazlauskas, Edita Uaite, Giedrė Giedraitytė, Lubomir Laucevicius, Larisa Kalpokaitė and Gediminas Girdvainis.

Deciding to write off the payment of EUR 100 million to emigrants
On Tuesday, the Seimas adopted an amendment to the law on declaration of place of residence, prepared by Ramūnas Barbuskis, a national leader.
56 Members of the Seimas voted against - 9 and abstained 25.
The Seimas will continue its deliberations on 6 December, or later, after obtaining the conclusions of the Government.
According to R. Carbauskas, these contributions are calculated for people who have not declared their departure from Lithuania.
According to a parliament, in three years one person has not paid about 1 thousand euros, and now there are about 100,000.
Social Democrats Algirdas Syss regretted that, in this way, the Seimas would part of the people “sponsor not to comply with the obligations ” - declare departure and then no tax is charged.
Conservatives of the Committee on Health, Antanas Matulas, noted that Lithuanians living abroad use the fact that when paying a small health insurance fee they come to Lithuania for medical treatment – they are provided with the same services as the Lithuanians paying this tax.
The amendments provide that those who have left Lithuania are considered to be persons who will pay social insurance contributions in the European Union, in the states of the European Economic Area or in the Swiss Confederation, and Sodra will have been exempted from paying health insurance contributions in Lithuania.
“Sodros, Head of Gardens Mindaugas Sinkevičius has previously said that such a step will facilitate both the life of migrant people and the activities of “Sodros”.
A streaming video of a slippery bear reveals a serious problem on the Internet
It was filtered how the mother’s bear climbed into a steep snowy slope, while the little one continued to climb, slip down and climb again.
The video received numerous reviews and comments.
People were admired by the perseverance of the little bear, repeatedly slipping down, and again he climbed to his mother.
He is not the first time, but the young man is not trying to give up and finally reaches his goal.
The video really matters of attention, but it also reveals the danger that humans pose to animals.
Scientists claim that it is also necessary to talk about the fact that people's desire to know wild nature can sometimes be harmful.
“ It’s obvious to me that the bear drone was frightened.
Their movements tell them they panic.
If they did not fly the drone around, they would probably have chosen a safer route or a slower or more careful overcome.
It's a great example of how drones should not be used – - for the magazine \"The Verge\" said ecologist Mark Ditmer.
Some time ago, Mr. Ditmer, along with his colleagues, examined how the drones were working on the bear.
The animals were equipped with cardiac working gauges.
When the drones came near, some of the bears left behind, others didn’t run anywhere, but their hearts began to beat more often from fear.
Scientists suggest that drones should be filmed responsibly, that they do not fly too close, that they do not noise and that they do not fly where it is prohibited.

According to the party, V. Benkunkas, the chairman of the Vilnius Division Meeting, became the leader of the list of Conservatives.

Restrictions on cogeneration plants appealed against to the Constitutional Court
As the opposition of the Seimas promised, the Constitutional Court (CJC) appealed against the decision of the governing body to adopt a law on the possibility of suspending the construction of waste incineration plants.
On Tuesday, the oppositionary Group of the Seimas Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrat (TS-LKD) announced that a group of Seimas members had called on the RT to investigate the compliance of the governing members with the adopted Constitution amendments to the Law on Waste Management.
“Parliaments stress that the provisions of the law aim to question the existing waste incineration facilities’ projects, by entrusting the Government with to set new restrictions (20 km distance from the territory of residence) until the entry into force of the law on the construction of waste incineration plants in Vilnius and Kaunas,” says the report.
“The Parliamentaries point out that in view of the fact that the prohibition on the construction of objects of national importance for waste management (i.e. the distance and the definition of ‘resident territories’) is formulated in the Law, it is concluded that this prohibition is disproportionately restricted or even denied the essence of the right to carry out economic activities related to the incineration of waste for energy production, because the consolidated criteria are formulated in such a way that, when assessing the density and distribution of Lithuania’s population, it would be practically impossible to build such items across the territory of the country,” added.
The petitions state that the law adopted is contrary to the constitutional principle of the rule of law.
‘The CJEU has repeatedly indicated that the legislation does not apply to those facts and consequences which arose before the entry into force of the newly adopted act.
In this case, the Government is given the power to apply the law backwards according to an indefinite criterion.
Such legal regulation undermines the constitutional principles of legal certainty, legal certainty, protection of legitimate expectations, and hence the constitutional principle of the rule of law - referred to in the application.
It also notes that significant financial investments have already been made in Vilnius and Kaunas cogeneration plant projects.
If the current projects were stopped, the state would incur not only a hundred million financial losses, huge losses would be incurred, and the residents of Lithuania would increase the cost of heating, and increased environmental pollution would increase as a result of the increase in the amount of waste disposal in landfills.
Members from the Seimas TS-LKD, the Liberal Movement, the Social Democratic Groups and the working group of the managing Social Democrats have been invited to attend the CT.
A few weeks ago, the Seimas managed to collect 71 votes in favour of rejecting the amendments to the Law on Waste Management adopted by President Dalios Grybauskaitė, which provided for the Government's right to suspend the construction of cogeneration power plants already under way, and established a zone of 20 km from residential areas, karantine, for the construction of such power plants.
Amendments to the Law adopted by the Seimas will enter into force on 1 January 2019.
This proposal is planned to be debated at the autumn session of the Seimas.
However, the rights of the Government to suspend projects which have already begun shall not be planned.
The ECJ will deal with this case in order no earlier than a year's time.
I have raised the issue of LeBron James statistics in the Laters club
The beginning of LeBron James’s career in Los Angeles-Laker’s club is not the same as he expected, the organization and basketball fans.
“Lakers started the season with four victories and six defeats, and such a weak start helped the rumors to emerge due to the release of the possible coach Luke Walton.
However, such speeches were reassured by the president of basketball operations, Magicas Johnson, who declared that the coach would not be forgiven, but it is necessary to play better.
The largest star in the team, L. James, should also turn to himself.
Although attacker statistics are usually impressive - 26,8 point, 7.6 won ball and 7.7 resultant transfer.
But she doesn't tell the whole truth.
During the first ten-season matches, other numbers also emerged to show that “Lakers ” are playing better when L. James is not present in the square.
Unfavourable +/- statistics showing how many points more drop or miss a crew when there are certain players in the field.
For example, when L. James is in the square, “Laker” has spent 30 points more this season than rivals.
When he was sitting on a bench, he had 19 points more than rivals.
Currently, “Lakers” is only at the 13th Western Conference, but a few victories can turn everything around.

V. Ačienė about the detention of R. Ačas: believe in man's virginity and law enforcement
“It was the most unbelieving thing I could never think about.
On the other hand, it is likely that the service is carrying out the work that must be done.
We're every one of us doing our job.
I believe in law enforcement, I believe in my husband that everything is fair and fair, that no fraudulent act of him should be done – - BNS said V. Ačienė.
R. Ača Special Investigation Service (STT) held on Monday - the legal person suspects that he, while being the director of the administration of Raseiniai municipality, took the prize of high value, and in exchange was able to create exceptional conditions for a private company which signed the contract with Raseiniai Bus Park managed by the municipality.
Representatives of private companies are suspected of buying Ača directly, or of having participated in masking bribes for various financial operations.
The Raseiniai district municipal council R. Ača was dismissed from office as Head of Administration by a third trial in April of this year following a declaration of distrust.
Former “order” – this year’s March became a member of the newly formed Gediminas Kirkill working party of the Lithuanian Social Democrat, led by the Lithuanian Social Democrat, who suspended membership of this party on Monday.
Mr Ačas has been unsuccessfully nominated as a representative of the election committee \"Your Raseiniai\" in mayor elections a few years ago.
V. Ačienė says that the man did not intend to nominate his candidacy in the Race mayor elections next year, but had not yet decided whether he would participate in municipal councils elections.
V. Ačienė was elected to the Seimas together with the list of the Lithuanian Statehood and Green Union, and is a member of the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission.
Politician says she expects further actions of law enforcement - it will depend on whether it will be removed from work in the commission.
“I don’t really do these decisions today, I think I will make a decision this week.
I will see if there is a need for what to blame, of course, to make a different decision.
Perhaps I would stay away from all the things that are being examined by the Anti-Corruption Commission, but again, everything will be timed to its places – she said.
Representative of Opposic Conservatives in Seime Radvilė Morkūnaitė-Mikulėnienė called on the Speaker of the Seimas Viktoras Prancikis and the “Head of States” Ramūnas Carbauskas to dispel from the statements of the political colleague Vida Ačienė and to withdraw it from the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission by transferring to another Seimas committee or commission.
She claims that the further work of V. Ačienė in the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission would raise public confidence and discredit the work of an important parliamentary oversight committee.

The soldiers “proven the attack because they identified a terrorist trying to hit a knife on civilians and an IDF (Israelian Defence Forces) officer in a report published by the Israeli army on an incident near Kirjath Arba Naoussey near Hebron.

Grybauskaitė urges China to create a more favourable investment environment for EU business
President Dalia Grybauskaitė invited China to create a more favourable investment environment for investment in EU countries and to facilitate foreign import conditions.
At the China Import Exhibition in Shanghai, opening the Trade and Investment Forum, President Grybauskaitė stressed that the overall goal of Europe and China should be to unite their efforts to prevent the spread of protectionism in the world – at the root of the stress caused by the wars of trade, as well as overproduction and unfair competition.
\"The European Union has a key role to play in China's commitment to creating a more attractive, open environment for investment, which is important when negotiating a trade agreement with China.
It is important to conclude this trade agreement as soon as possible, ensuring that foreign businesses feel welcome and secure here, as well as strengthening intellectual property protection,\" said Mr Grybauskaitė.
According to them, the opening-up of China is important not only for Europe but also for this country, as well as for global economic growth.
The President underlined that transparency of investment must be “upward beyond the interests of any business group”
\"Transparency, the primacy of law, strict compliance with international treaties - that must be essential for the environment in new investment relations - have been highlighted by Mr Grybauskaitė.
“The collapsing flows of capital should not be expected in any country in the world, not just here or in our countries,” she added.
China's import exhibition is trying to mitigate the criticism that it avoids opening up its market and protects only its companies.
The exhibition is attended by several Heads of State, more than 2,800 companies from 130 countries and regions of the world, including Lithuania.
According to the Lithuanian Department of Statistics, China currently holds 25th place among its export partners.
Last year Lithuanian exports to China grew by 50%, which was 180 million euros.
At the same time, imports from China exceeded EUR 820 million.
Some officials worry that Chinese investment in Lithuania may have undesirable political influence, and Beijing has special attention to the unity of the EU that divides Eastern Europe.

The reason for the crash was Lion Air, who had died in anger.
Data from the crashed Indonesian airline Lion Air indicates that during at least the last four flights there was a disturbance in speedometer’s work, reported to researchers on Monday.
Soerjando Tyahjon, Chairman of the National Transport Security Committee (NTSK), said that a similar relic occurred during the last four aircraft flights, including the fatal one, when on 29 October the liner fell in the Javan Sea shortly after taking off from Jakarta.
All 18 people died during this disaster.
A lot of media reported troubles during the previous Boeing 737 MAX 8 - flight from Denpasar to the capital of Indonesia.
“When we opened the black box - yes, the technical problem was speed in the air, or the speed of the plane, ” said Mr Tyahjono during the press conference.
“The black box data showed that in the two pre-flight flights, Denpasar-Jakarta was also the same problem,” he added.
“There are many rumors in the social networks.
Now we want to clarify that in the black box (the data remain) four flights with problems with the air speed gauge – the Head of the NTSK has stated.
During the meeting with members of families who had died, Mr Tyahjon said that the information from the flight recorder was in line with the announcements that the speed and height of the last flight had changed unexpectedly.
Search teams have not yet found a second black box recording conversations in a flight deck.
‘Lion Air’ indicated that it had been repaired following a technical failure between Bali and Jakarta in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations.
One of the company's founders, Rusdi Kirana, was not invited to speak at a meeting of the Minister of Transport, Budi Karyos Sumadi, who was awakening family members with officials supervising the search for remains of planes and victims and investigation of disaster.
However, he stood up and bowed his head when angry and distressing family members demanded that Kirana, along with his brother Kusnan, “Lion Air ” had been introduced in 1999.
“ Lion Air did not act properly, ” said one man who presented himself as the father of Shandy Johan Ramadhan, a prosecutor on the island on which the plane was flying.
“I want Mr. Rusdi Kirana and his team to pay attention,” he stressed.
- Lion Air, since the beginning of the crisis, has never met me.
We lost our child, but “Lion Air ” did not show us any compassion
After this meeting, Mr Kirana went on an urgent basis to avoid the question of journalists.
Many families expect the results of a long process of recognition of the dead.
The police handed over to medical experts almost 140 parts of the dead-mixes loaded with human remains.
Only 14 victims have been identified so far.
The family questioned why the liner started two months ago had been allowed to fly, although a failure occurred on the 28th October flight from Bali to Jakarta, including causing the frightened sudden downturn of the plane.
“Lion Air ” said that this failure had been corrected.
Is it true that the problem was solved? - asked the son of one of the dead.
- If not, the technicians concerned must be held liable.
The law is very clear, and they did not say that the plane was allowed to take off again.
These bad technicians must be responsible under the law so that aircraft accidents no longer occur in Indonesia.
Mr Tyahjon said that the large number of small scrapes and the fact that the scrap spread is quite small in the area shows that the liner is likely to enter the water at a very high speed.
“The plane was complete when he fell into the sea.
He did not blow into the air, and the aircraft engines, when he touched the water, were subject to heavy turnouts, as is illustrated by an officer in all the broken turbine blades.
“Lion Air has been the largest aviation disaster in Indonesia since 1997, when Garuda has crashed a plane close to Medan by 234 people.
After the crash, rescue workers were controlled: a minor and a minor
On Monday night on the road Vėžaitėi - Plungė, the cars at Tilwickai are hit by BMW-1 and Mercedes-Benz-1
The cars were hit by a mob, reports three victims.
The BMW driver, born in 1999, reportedly went to the opposite side of the traffic, and the neck-sleep ran into the car ‘Mercedes-Benz’ by Dad, born 1967, and the daughter, born in 2005.
“BMW, firefighters, rescuers, rescuers, rescuers, rescuers, rescuers.
To the girl, teeth were killed during the accident from ‘Mercedes-Benz’.
All victims were taken to the hospital.
Presidency: no artificial facilitations due to referendum
Following the approval by the Seimas of its proposal to reduce the referendum cartel for the first section of the Constitution with greater protection, the president will make amendments to the vetu, says Mindaugas Lingė, her advisor.
\"For more than half of the population voted in the Constitution, this is a demand.
This and its amendment, in particular the items in its first section, should certainly be at least a majority .
It is easy to predict that the President would really veto – - Ms Dalia Grybauskaitė's advisor to the Knowledge Radio on Tuesday, on an internal policy, said.
He stressed that the basic elements of the State, such as the language, the flag, the territory, the capital, the sovereignty of the State, were defined in the first section of the Constitution, thus reducing the number of votes required to replace these articles, according to Linges, would create a ‘negative precedent’ and ‘residual risks’.
\"In the opinion of the president, there is no need for artificial facilitation, more preparation for the referendum itself, more dialogue with people is needed,\" he said.
The Seimas is planning to vote on Tuesday on the adoption of the Amendment to the Law on Reference.
It provides for a decision on amendments to sections 1 and 14 of the higher protection Constitution to be taken if at least two-fifths of the citizens entitled to vote agree to this in a referendum.
At present, more than half of all citizens entitled to vote may replace the articles of Sections 1 and 14 of the Constitution by referendum.
The right to vote in Lithuania has approximately 2.5 million citizens: half would be 1.25 million voters, two fifths – one million voters.
This proposal was born after the Seimas confirmed in September the veto of the President regarding previous parliamentary amendments which watered down the requirements for the number of votes by replacing Article 12 of the first section of the Constitution defining citizenship.
Once a referendum is proposed to be reduced in preparation for a referendum on dual citizenship, it should take place on 12 May next year and on 26 May when the first and second round of presidential elections are planned.
At present, with the exception of some exceptions, migrants cannot have double citizenship on 11 March 1990, after the restoration of independence.
Double citizenship seeks the Lithuanian community of the world, but fears that a referendum would not be held under the current conditions - a sufficient number of people would not vote.
R. Masiulis: Lithuanian Airports “french” – therefore they need to be updated
Lithuanian airports and road infrastructure starts to cry out, therefore it is necessary to update it, says Rokas Masiulis, Minister of Transport and Communications.
According to him, the renovation of Vilnius Airport is the minimum task that the State must carry out.
‘The air transport infrastructure is already under way as it was planned for smaller passenger flows.
We must renew Vilnius Airport - it is not even part of the long-term planning - it is a minimum of what we must do - Mr Masiulis said at the transport conference held in the State of Democracy and the State magazine on Tuesday.
According to the Minister, the next decade will be very important, because important projects will have to be implemented - the construction of “Via Baltica“ “Rail Baltica” is completed, Klaipeda external port is built, Vilnius and Kaunas airports are renewed, and perhaps a new airport is being built.
\"The next decade will be very important - we have to complete the integration of roads, railways, the construction of the external port in Klaipėda, the clean-up of airports, and perhaps decide on the construction of the new airport.
We must not sleep, already now start projects that will exploit our potential in 10, 20 or 30 years' time – said the Minister of Transport.
Mr Masiulis has repeated that too little money has been spent on road transport in recent years.
“The situation of people is not getting better, as there is not enough money available.
We are able to build new roads, but even for the minimum care, for example on major roads, there is a shortage of funds.
We must determine the amount to be devoted to road surveillance, if they are to improve', Mr Masiulis said.
He stressed that exports of services of the Lithuanian transport sector increased this year by 18.6%, while the largest export market became Germany above Russia.
Mr Masiulis once again criticised the European Commission's proposal that EU carriers will be obliged to return tractors periodically to the country of registration.
\"We must make our exporters in Western Europe feel at home.
In my opinion, the offer of a permanent return from the tugs is absurd because, in Europe, trucks would be emptyed, burning fuel would increase emissions.
The railways will win most of this because the cost increases so much that part of the transport goes to the railways.
We are looking for ways to defend our position,\" said Mr Masiulis.
According to the Ministry of Transport, the transport sector generates 12.2%.
Lithuanian Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
It employs more than 118,000 people and has more than 7.500 companies.
Dispute with heritage savers
Last week, Mr Masiulis announced in the Committee on the Economics of the Seimas that after the start of negotiations on the replacement of the cultural purpose of Vilnius Airport, this would allow to destroy the old terminal and build a new one.
However, the Interim Head of the Department of Cultural Heritage (CND) Algimantas Degutis called the deliberations of Masiul political pressure.
According to him, the building built in the 1950s is a value recorded in the register in 1993, and not politicians, but specialists have to decide on its exclusion.
Mr. Masiulis then commented that a modern arrival terminal would contribute to improving the image of Lithuania.
“It would be a politically important step to withdraw from the heritage that old terminal would be to demolish it and build a new modern arrival terminal, so that when Vilnius falls in a modern country, it would not be such an interesting one, really not representing our country as an innovative one,” said Mr. Masiulis last week.
Mr. Masiulis then also announced that it is planned to build a completely new passenger terminal in Kaunas and connect the airport to Rail Baltica by building an underground station.
This transport hub should operate in 2026 after the completion of the construction of Rail Baltica
Last year Vilnius Airport handled about 3.7 million people, this year 4,8 million passengers are expected, and next year it is estimated 5 million passengers.
Kaunas Airport last year handled 1.2 million passengers.

Flights to Madagascar will start direct flights from Vilnius next year
The largest regular passenger aircraft flying at Vilnius Airport in the spring of next year Boeing 767 – which will fly from Lithuania directly to Bee Island on the basis of information from the tour organizer Itaka Lietuva – writes the portal “madeinvilnius.lt”
It is announced that ‘Blue Panorama’ will offer passengers a choice from 259 places of the economic class and 8 business class.
The new holiday route will be reached directly from Lithuania since April 2019.
Dominkas Milowskis, CEO of Itaka Lithuania, says that tourists from Lithuania are trying to offer new routes of vacation.
Madagascar is an island in the Indian Ocean, near the eastern coast of Africa.
Other tour operators also prepared new holiday trips for the summer season of 2019.
For example, “Novaturas is and Itaka will start flying directly from Vilnius to Tirana, Albania.
Minister of Finance about possible crisis: it is important not to talk about illness
“We must always prepare for more times.
I would like to welcome the fact that for the third year in a row, for the first time in the history of Lithuania, we have reserves.
But it is also very important not to talk about the disease - - Mr Shapoka said during her visit to Brussels on Monday.
ELTA recalls that on Monday and Tuesday, Minister for Finance and Vice-Minister Miglė Tuskienė are taking part in the meetings of the Euro Group and the EU Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN).
The ECOFIN meeting discusses the taxation of digital services.
The purpose of this new levy is to avoid fragmentation of the EU's single market, as some Member States have already introduced or intend to introduce a certain tax at national level.
In the short term, it is proposed that an agreement be reached on how the revenues generated for the provision of certain digital services in the EU Member States should be taxed until there is a global consensus.
The Eurogroup will review the draft budgets of the euro area countries submitted to the European Commission (EC).
On 23 October, the EC rejected the Italian draft budget as not complying with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact.
This is the first time that the EC makes use of this option.
Further information was requested from Belgium, France, Portugal, Slovenia and Spain.
The Eurogroup will also discuss deepening Economic and Monetary Union: possibilities for implementing the European Deposit Insurance System and reforms of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).
Lithuania supports a stronger role of ESM in financial support programmes, but it is assumed that the functions of ESM should be clearly defined in order to avoid duplication of functions between ESM and other EU institutions.

Lithuanian work traditions and customs
More recently, 120 years have passed since the birth of Balis Burač (1897-1972), a famous Lithuanian photographer and cultural metematicist, ethnographer and local expert, born in Sidarenai, the state of Šiauliai, at the time.
We have an excellent opportunity to remember how the national rebirth that will rise in our lives called on many people of Lithuania, including Brother Burač - Bali, John, Bronius - to engage in the promotion, recognition and preservation of our cultural traditions from the very depths of the countryside.
In more than 50 years, Balys Burač, who traveled the country after his home country with his camera, presented a wide and realistic picture of our country’s customs, traditions, folk art and material culture.
He sought to preserve fast-growing national cultures and had a rare ability to perceive the value of the remains of his work.
In the photos of Bali Burač Lithuania's landscape, castles, everyday life and celebrations our people decorated the pages of Lithuanian newspapers and magazines with national costumes.
This publication contains a significant part of the legacy of Bali Burach for describing national practices and related traditions and, above all, their attractive iconography.
The published material shows not only the identity and beauty of these traditions, but also the progress of our civilization over the last century, despite the two world wars and the difficult occupation.
The book’s manuscript is rich in the works of the interwar Samogitia, especially the eloquent, the Šalšiai, the Šalšiškai, as well as the works of Aukštaitija and Dzkakya, their holidays and other traditions and mores written by Bali Burač.
Some 10,000 negative photos have survived in museums and archives and have been selected for this publication over 400 rare, mostly unpublished, which are grouped according to selected texts.
They reflect the unique aspects of ethnic culture that are characteristic of the landscapes, landscapes, other areas of Aukštaitija and Samogitija.

The Tragic Legacy of the couple: Deaths After A Few Hours of Marriage
In the southwest of the U.S. Texas, a young married couple died during a helicopter disaster only a few hours ago.
The 24-year-old William Troyus Byler and his wife, Bailee Ray Ackerman Byler, died on Sunday shortly after the middle-night helicopter was in the hill 16 km northwest of Juvaldi and 129 km west of San Antonio, said local peace judge Steven Kennedy.
It is strange that the disaster occurred at 24 miles [24 km], exactly as many young people were in their age.
The helicopter pilot 76, Gerald Douglas Lawrence, also died.
The young guests studied at Sam Houston State University, located in Huntsville, Texas State.
They got married on Saturday evening at the Family Ranch of Bylers near Juvaldis and the family fluttered by a family helicopter after the wedding.
The accident occurred when the helicopter flew about 20 miles [24 km].
The young guests went to Sant Antonio International Airport, where they intended to sit on the plane and fly the honeymoon, said Mr Kennedy, without specifying the destination for the final couple's trip.
“This is a very shattered, uneven terrain, and that hill is about 120 to 150 meters high,” said Mr Kennedy.
G. D. Lawrence has been piloting this family aircraft for many years.
According to S. Kennedy, he piloted helicopters and served in Vietnam.
After autopsy, it should be revealed what the physical condition of the pilot was and whether it could not be the cause of the disaster.
The helicopter crashed about 5-10 minutes after the rise.
It fell in wide radius on the rocky hill slope, and the hull remained – dangerously immersed – on Monday during the press conference said Flight Safety Investigator Craig Hatch from the National Transport Security Board (NTSB).
Researchers are going to take a break and then see it thoroughly, but it will not be easy for the tractor and truck to reach that place, he said.
The cause of catastrophos has not yet been established and the preliminary report on the NTSB should be published after two weeks.
The Prime Minister of Israel calls the entry into force of new sanctions for Iran a \"historic day\"
\"Today is a historic day,\" said Mr Netanyahu, the Bureau of his party – the Likud-Parliaments.
\"Today is the day when the President-in-Office of the Union (Donald Tramp) has imposed particularly severe sanctions against Iran in the US, the most severe sanctions against Iran throughout the period when efforts have begun to curb his aggression,\" said the head of the Israeli Government.
Earlier on Monday, the Israeli Minister for Defence Avigdor Lyberman stated that the new sanctions would be a - decided - blow to Israel's actions in the region.
The measures that Washington refers to as “the worst sanctions of all times ” began to apply after the decision taken in May Trump to withdraw from the world’s power agreement with Tehran on its nuclear programme.
The sanctions aim to significantly reduce Iranian oil exports, which have fallen by about one million barrels a day since May, and to separate Tehran from international financing.
Israel has long opposed the agreement in question with Iran and is saying that its scope and timing are too limited.
The Jewish State also states that the abolition of sanctions enabled Iran to finance its militia groups and its own military activities.
Israel is particularly concerned about Iran's actions in neighbouring Syria and promised to prevent Iran from standing there from a military point of view.
The other participants in the agreement with Iran - the United Kingdom, France, Germany, China and Russia - disagree with the US decision and say that the agreement, as envisaged, has not so far allowed Iran to acquire nuclear weapons.
The court again speculates circumstances of the young motorcyclist’s death
The death of a young motorcyclist in Vilnius, Northern town, in the event of an accident, the court will listen to the witness's testimony.
On Tuesday, Vilnius Regional Court decided that one witness will be questioned at the next meeting on 26 November in order to clarify all significant circumstances of the case.
In this case, a judgment of conviction has already been issued, but is not in favour of the prosecutor’s office.
On August 22, Vilnius City District Court legitimized the car driver in the event of a death, announcing that the motorcyclist was driving in the city at a high speed and committed a harsh violation.
Vilnius Regional Public Prosecutor’s Office asks the Regional Court to annul the judgement of the District Court and states that the biggest fault due to the accident lies with E. Osipov, and the conclusions of the District Court are not justified.
The deceased motorcyclist's family lawyer also asks for the annulment of the judgment.
The accident took place on August 11, 2015 at about 15 a.m., when Škoda Fabia, a car driven by E. Osipov, entered the Žirmūnai street from Lakūnai street and faced a main motorcycle on the road.
The prosecutor's office accused the man that the driver violated the road rules and caused the accident to be caused by death on the main road by the motorcycle “Piaggo”, a man who was driving.
The initial police reports indicate that the engine driver died, but later on after the investigations, they found that the vehicle was equivalent in power to a motor cycle.
The judge of Vilnius City District Court Rolands Bužinskas BNS has said that experts found that the motorcyclist drove 89.2 kilometres per hour, although the speed allowed at that place is 50 kilometres per hour.
“The driver could not predict that the motorcycle would run at this high speed, ” said the judge.
At the time, the driver claimed to drive just 5-6 kilometers per hour.
The motor cycle driver saw the obstacle and tried to stop and fell from the vehicle before facing the Škoda Fabia-1
The prosecutor's office believes that E. Osipova, who was on the side to the main road, had to give the motorcyclist the way.
‘Novaja Gazetto: Six Vagner staffs killed in Syria
Among the dead - five Syrian troops and six persons belonging to the military company Vagner -

\"Novaja Gazeta has sent a request to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs with a request for information on Russian fate.
The former King of Belgium will have to undergo a paternity test
This decision is a part of the victory of the artist Delphinės Boel.
Since 2013, she has been seeking recognition for the child of the former monarch.
A 50-year-old woman claims her mother's Baroness Sybille de Selly Longchamps and Albert II had a little love novel for her decades ago.
84-year-old king denies parenthood.
According to data from the RTBF station, he may refer the case to the Supreme Court in opposition to a DNA investigation.
According to the Court of Appeal, Jacques Boel - the ex-man of the mother of Delphinė - is neither biological nor legal father of the artist.
The relevant study was conducted by Delphinė in order to be recognised as the daughter of Albert’s father.
The LAG allocates money to the parties, but it will not give the social workers any money
The Central Electoral Commission (CEC) plans to allocate a budget grant of almost EUR 3 million to the largest political parties this week.
The Lithuanian Social Democratic Working Party (LSDDP), established this spring, is under the authority of the Vice-President of Parliament Gediminas Kirkill, but it is not yet foreseen to allocate funds from the budget.
But they can be awarded in the near future by a separate LAG decision if the legal environment governing the distribution of grants to parties changes.
Ms Matčiaityte, President of the CoR, informed the CFR that ‘the meeting of the panel is scheduled to take place this Thursday, in which the decision on the allocation of the half-yearly grant for parties is planned to be adopted’.
According to them, it is for the NRA to take a decision on this matter by 15 November.
Seven parties, six of which are parliamentary, are scheduled to be allocated EUR 2.751 million.
The opposition Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats should receive more than EUR 0.66 million, the ruling State-Green Union - about EUR 0.55 million, the opposition Social Democratic Party - about EUR 0.5 million, the opposition Liberals Movement - almost EUR 0.4 million, the working party without its group - about EUR 0.23 million, the recently joined by the governing party - almost EUR 0.22 million, the parliamentary representatives, but neither the opposition announced the Polish election campaign-Christian family union - about EUR 0.18 million.
Under the current law, which will also be guided by the CoR by the allocation of budget money, grants shall be awarded to parties which meet the requirements laid down by law and which have received at least 3% of the votes during the last elections to the Seimas, Municipal Councils and the European Parliament.
Therefore, the current legal framework does not allow only the LSDDP established this spring to expect money from the budget.
Because this party has not yet taken part in any single elections.
It is true that the ruling coalition is making efforts to change the law so that social workers receive at least about a couple of hundreds of thousands of euros coming to the next elections - the self-government, the President and the European Parliament.
The corresponding amendments to the laws of political parties adopted by the Seimas and this year's budget were vetoed by President Dalia Grybauskaitė.
The Seimas has not yet decided on this veto, but the representatives of the governings, Mr Kirkilas, and the leader of the peasant-greens Ramūnas Kbaruskis, believe that the parliamentarians will strive to reject the President's objections.
However, it will not be possible to do this before this Thursday's meeting, and therefore, according to Mr Matčiaitytė, the grants will be broken down according to the legal framework that has existed up to now.
It is true that the Head of the CoR did not deny that if the Seimas were to reject the president's veto and a new amendment to the budget allocation for parties would enter into force this or next week, a decision on the granting of an additional grant to individual political forces, including the LSDDP, could be discussed within the Commission.
\"We will take the decision into account the entire legal environment in force, because we are an executive body to implement the adopted legislation,\" she said.
If the Seimas were able to reject the veto and the new laws would enter into force, they would allocate additional money to the parties by the Government, with additional borrowing of the corresponding amounts.
The grants already allocated to the seven parties would not be affected by such a decision.

Poshovenk: active Handiuk murder clients have to be punished
\"I would like to state that no version - and more than 20 of them today - will be rejected.
Each will be thoroughly checked in accordance with the test procedures.
As a president, I do not have the opportunity or need to receive information that could harm the course of the investigation.
However, the government must ensure transparency and law enforcement institutions must work effectively.
Only in this way will it be possible to learn the truth and punish evil,\" said Mr.Posošenko at the meeting with young people on Tuesday in Kiev.
He stressed that he had the greatest interest in the investigation of the murder of K. Handziuk and that the murderers, crime organisers and clients were given the necessary responsibilities.
“After this case has been reclassified into a murder (a woman), they are quite rightly and rightly threatened with imprisonment to a living head, ” said the President of Ukraine.
He rightly referred to the public demand to investigate this case in an open and impartial manner.
Mr Posošenka stressed that the speeches by the representatives of law enforcement authorities in the parliament should show that “the authorities are determined to bring criminals and murderers to justice, whatever they may be...
He also said that the political speculation on this subject would not help to clarify the situation, but would be more confused.
“I call on all forces, both power and opposition, not to extort unjustified arguments and, defend God, not to use this murder for public relations,” the President said.
On the contrary, we now need to come together to ensure that the investigation is effective, fair and transparent, and that public confidence is built up.
We just don't have another way
\"No one will be allowed to use this situation to destabilise the situation in the country,\" he said.
In July, K. Handziuk was attacked and contaminated with acid in the town of Cherson before corruption.
She was the advisor to this southern mayor of Ukraine.
After the attack, the woman was hospitalized, but she died in the hospital on Sunday.
In the absence of a statement from the police and prosecutors of the attack, on Tuesday, the Prosecutor General of Ukraine, Jurijus Lucenka, submitted a resignation statement.
After her death, the public activists were accused of failing to carry out the proper investigation.
Activists also called for the resignation of the Prosecutor General and the Minister for the Interior.
\"I will present my resignation today,\" said Mr Lucenka, to the Members of Parliament, reading my study report.
Parliament must also support the resignation of the prosecutor.
Mr Lucenka accused activists of exerting pressure on the investigation and squandering important information, making it difficult to identify the murder perpetrators of Mr Handziuk.
Bill Gates introduced a bathroom without water
By presenting a futuristic toilet, Bill Gates has compared the transition from traditional such facilities to an unwaterlined computer revolution in the 1970s.
“Microsoft, the founder of Bill Gates at the exhibition in Beijing, presented a high-tech toilet that does not need water line pipes.
The toilet without water works according to the principles of separation of solid and liquid waste.
Both types of sewage are processed into chemical fertilisers.
\"The technologies you see here are the greatest achievements in the field of sanitation in the last 200 years\" - Bill Gates quoted by Bloomberg
The technological toilet was created with the funds of a charity fund set up by Bill Gates and his wife, Melinda.
In seven years, work was done on a plant that could turn man’s waste into fertiliser or water, to which the fund spent $200 million.
In total, Bill Gates had about 20 models of toilet.
Now the device is complete and can be sold.
However, in order for such toilets to be produced massively, the Gates Foundation is ready to spend another 200 million.
According to the Gates Foundation, 500 000 children under five years die every year because of the poor health conditions in the world.
The fight against poor sanitation, such as Cholera and others, increases the cost of health spending, which already amounts to 233 billion.
In order to better illustrate the state of sanitation that needs to be improved, Bill Gates has to take a glass-false presentation to the toilet.
According to him, this is a good reminder that in a small example, “ there may be 200 trillion Rotavirus cells, 200 thousand bacteria causing infections, 100 thousand worm parasite eggs ”
S. Slelia was elected president of the football association.
On 5 November, an extraordinary meeting of Lithuanian mass football association took place in Kaunas, where Sergej Slūla was elected as the new president of the organization.
Anatoly Stecenko’s request to resign from the president of the association led to an extraordinary meeting of the members of the general association being convened.
13 members from 15 took part in the meeting.

The oldest president of Africa, who has been ruling his country for 35 years, has been a winner in the elections on 7 October, with 71% of the votes.
The elections, however, were tarnished by small electoral activity, violence and suspected fraud.
On the eve of Biya's inauguration, 79 students and three school staff, including directors, were kidnapped at one presbition school in the North Western region, where English-speaking separatists carry out an armed campaign for independence.
Most 22 million Cameroonns are French and a fifth are English.
In 2016, in the North West and the neighbouring province of South West, autonomy was initiated in the face of a problem of alleged discrimination in the fields of education, courts and the economy.
In 2017, when Biya refused to give up, radically declared an independent state, ‘the Republic of Amazon’, and raised weapons.
According to non-governmental organisations, the officers of at least 400 civilians and more than 175 security forces died in separatist attacks and response operations this year.
More than 300 000 people fled from violence: some cross the border to Nigeria, but many are forced to live in semi-baby forests.
During the October elections, only 5% of voters voted in the north-western region, and 15% in the south-western province.
In both parts of the country, Mr Biya had two-thirds of the votes.
Conservatory initial elections: errors led to inexperience
\"When there was a lack of space, understand that the party organized everything with its resources.
Some municipalities have allowed their premises to be used, but not all of them were voting rooms, because we cannot buy them ourselves.
Thank you to those who lent -- - said politics.
According to him, complaints have been received, but their content does not change substantially, and the infringements themselves are not of a malignant nature.
‘There were cases.
Not all the people who took part in the elections had experienced, they also had a news news.
Hence, not all of the actions were in line with our procedures.
It was therefore necessary to warn the CoR that the principles we described should be followed.
These complaints, however, do not give rise to any doubts about the results,\" said Anušauskas.
According to the president of the CoR, there have been cases when ballot papers have been unprinted - if you know this - the ballot papers found in the ballot boxes have been cancelled unsealed.
Some towns lacked space but, according to A. Anušauskas, complaints and irregularities concern several dozens of ballot papers.
\"Well, since the difference is several thousand, this does not make a real difference in the outcome of the election,\" said Anušauskas.
It was argued that party members' activity in elections was 55%, while non-party voters' activity was 69%.
Both candidates had 400 observers and 600 people worked in commissions.
The results announced on Sunday also remain unchanged - 79 percent of voters voted for the winning Ingrid Chimonyt (6418 votes), while 21 percent voted for Vygaudta Ušack (4441 votes).
On 17 November, the TS-LD Council will officially support Mr Šimonytė's candidacy in the country's presidential elections in May next year.

The investigation established that four transactions were declared out of the scheduled deadlines: in 2010 the bank loan, the purchase of securities from the bank with the spouse was made in 2017, the gift was given to the daughter in 2017 - an apartment in 2017 and the loan was granted and not repaid to the spouse in 1996.
Mr Strupienė also declared these transactions by missing deadlines.
Persons who have violated the Law on Harmonisation of Public and Private Interest in the State Service may not be encouraged for a year.
The law obliges you to declare not only your own data but also your spouse's data.
The study was carried out by VTEK on the basis of the TV information provided by Info.

Strup, together with at least 10 other persons, has raised suspicions in corruption investigation - according to law enforcement, winning public procurement of computers and software in clinics, he has demanded illegal financial remuneration from companies, he is disguised as support.
In this way, Mr Strupas is suspected to have talked at least five times in the course of public procurement in the field of information technology in Santara clinics.
Mr. Strupe himself denies his guilt.
Corruption suspected professor K. Strupas was dismissed in September from the post of head of Santara clinics.
At the decision of the Ministry of Health and Vilnius University, members of Santa Maria clinicians work relations with K. Strupas to terminate at his own request.
He has been head of the hospital since 10 November 2013.
At the end of this year, Professor Juozas Raistenskis has been temporarily led by the Santa Rican clinics until the competition for the election of a new director-general has been announced.

Minister of Energy Mr Vaičiūnas meets with representatives of Orlen Lietuva
The meeting will address the achievement of renewable energy targets in the transport sector by 2020 and beyond, as advised by Aurelia Vernickaitė, Minister of Energy.
According to the European Commission (EC), transport is the only sector currently not reaching the aggregated trajectory set out in the national renewable energy action plans at EU level, accounting for 6% of renewable energy in 2015.

The bodyless girl is tearing down stereotypes about wedding dresses
Conveying a girl with a white bloated bride dress - a mission (no) possible?
Can the white swan go to the altar of greater size than S or M and still look attractive?
Plus-size shows of reality - (r) evolution - the participants will prove today that the beauty and elegance of the bride really do not depend on the kilograms of a woman.
But it's not all that, one of the girls in the project tonight, will find the tears of happiness - her boyfriend will show up on the stage.
“There are others who think that older girls do not get the attention or the eyes of boys.
It's just a myth - my boyfriend is a sportsman himself, but he likes me he doesn't require a figure from me that meets some standards - before the performance with a wedding dress speaks to the show participant Aurika.
Wedding dress is not easy, all the meanings of the garment - it's a complicated design, it contains a lot of materials, dress difficult, uncomfortable movement.
Also some women think that a bigger girl in a white dress will look even bigger and therefore less confident.
I can assure you that the appropriate dress pattern has been chosen for this \"problem\" really solves\" - explained one of the members of the show commission, fashion designer Robert Kalinkinin.
The girls' fates in the project are decided by Kalinkinas along with the entire Commission - among the size of the fashion house, Erika Vitellskiene, photographer and social networking star Naglis Bieranca and TV producer Laura Paukštė.
“In the event of a girl having to say goodbye to the show, there are many cribs among the members of the panel - because we all represent different spheres and we imagine the winner of the show differently.
The challenge of showing wedding dresses has been all the more difficult, and this - I can already reveal now - that there have been two new people who have not really been worse than their old home.
It was a special evening in every sense, ” says Kalykin.
Dovilė, a 31-year-old mother of the two children's exceptional beauty at one summer reality show, participated in the scandalous conduct of 23-year-olds and joined the top 20 in the selection of «Dydis’s (r) evolution.
Unfortunately, after the first extremely open photos of the girls, they had to say goodbye to the project on the streets of Vilnius City.
LNK spectators returned to the show girls and voted on the TV portal for their favourites.
The international recognition of the reality of the beauticians in Lithuania takes place already in the second week - here will be the competition of a girl of size due to the size of the star in the first country plus.
So far there are only eight of them - and they all understand perfectly that the winner will only be one.
This week begins this Monday at 2.30 p.m. through the LNK.

It became the 46-year-old British actor Idris Elba.
Although the man says that this message was unexpected when he spoke of the new title, he did not lose his mind.
I thought, “Can’t be!
Seriously.
Then I looked myself in the mirror and thought -- yes, today I look sexy -- laughing at an actor.
To be honest, Idris described this title as a very pleasant feeling that had been embarrassed by his ego.
The British star believes that he often received abusive words and practices that made his childhood difficult because, as he himself said, he was “very high and very inexpensive. ”
The young actor distrusted the peers and became an object of practices and his rare and unusual name and his African origin.
“I’ve just grown up my mustaches and became the worst guy in my city area, ” says Idris.
When a man loses his pride on the Osse screens, I. Elba works discords in party parties held in Spain, and especially in surgling Ibiza.
In leisure time, the man enjoys the boxing of Thailand and has a hymn of fashion that he realizes, creating his own line of clothing.
The British actor believes that the family is the most important thing for him in the world, so he plans a wedding with the engagement of Sabrina Dhowre.
Elba became the sexiest man in the world who was chosen by the 33rd edition of People.

The management no longer requires a distance of 20 km for the construction of waste incineration plants
Vilnius cogeneration plant is being built, near Gariūnai market.
The ruling no longer makes sure that the construction of the waste incineration plant keeps a distance of 20 kilometres away from the settlements.
The head of the Committee on Environmental Protection – stateist – Kęstutis Mazeika registered on Monday at the Seimas an amendment to the Law on Waste Management, which refuses to do so.
According to Mrs Mazeika, “the group of states that had previously adopted a 20 km distance clause, promises to maintain an amendment on its refusal.
The amendment by Mr Mazeikos provides that, from January 2019, waste incineration plants could be built into statutory environmental and public health protection requirements.
He acknowledges that the amendments led to the President's doubts about such a ban.
‘In view of the definition of the residential area, it is obvious that such a place where the above mentioned objects could be built would be almost impossible to discover’ - says the chairman of the committee.
The majority in October were opposed to the President's veto amendments strengthening the construction of waste incineration plants.
In addition to the ban on the construction of waste incineration plants less than 20 km from settlements, the amendments provided for authorisation of the Government to take decisions on the future of the already built two power plants, taking into account public health interests.
The latter provisions are not proposed by Mrs Mazeika to adjust.
In Vilnius, the power plant is being constructed with waste and biofuel by the energy group “Lithuanian energy – and in Kaunas – together with the Finnish energy group “Fortum – company “Fortum Heat Lietuva”
The latter is already burning waste in Klaipeda.

On Monday, the British and Irish leaders discussed a possible compromise on a difficult Northern Ireland issue that was stagnating in the Brexit negotiations, which was announced by Dublin.
Speaking on the telephone, British Prime Minister Theresa May proposed a revision of the so-called 'Temporary Measures Agreement' mechanism, which would allow an open border between the British province of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland belonging to the European Union.
Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar promised to consider this proposal, but rejected any possibility of unilateral withdrawal from this agreement by Britain, in the report issued by the Irish Government.

\"The Varadkar has made it clear that there is an open proposal for a review, provided that such a review does not result in a unilateral decision to cease the imposition of insurance measures,\" says the government report.
‘Brexit: there is no acceptable solution by the negotiators to avoid checks at the United Kingdom's and Ireland's land border when Britain leaves the Single Market and Customs Union in March next year.
Both parties agree on ‘prohibitive measures’ to keep the border open between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland until a larger trade agreement is signed to ensure that additional border checks are not carried out.
The EU wants Northern Ireland to continue to comply with EU customs rules, but London wants them to be applied on a temporary basis to the United Kingdom as a whole.
The Daily Telegraph reports on Monday that “Brexit’s Secretary Dominica Raabas wants Britain to withdraw from the cartel agreement unilaterally in three months’ time.
However, Mr Varadkar told journalists in Dublin that his government could not
‘Insurers for a period of three months or a limited period are not worth the paper on which they will be written-- he has stated.
In the past, London and Brussels did not approve of the Brexit negotiations following the weekend's report in Britain that the agreement was reached by hand.
“I would say that we are continuing to make progress in the negotiations, but there is still a job,” said Mr May in London.

Nobel Prize winners encourage access to reliable information
On Monday, a group of emerging thinkers, including the Nobel Prize winners, issued a declaration calling for the right to reliable information in the Internet epoch.
Among the 25 signatories to the International Declaration on Information and Democracy are the economists Amartya Senas and Joseph Stiglitz, Iranian lawyer and human rights activist of Nobel, Shirin Ebadi, and the winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature, Mario Vargas Llossa.
\"We are calling on good will leaders on all continents to take action to strengthen democratic models and open public debate on the basis of facts,\" says the Group report.
They argue that ‘the world’s information and communication area’ is a common good that ‘should be protected in order to strengthen freedom of expression and freedom of opinion’.
‘People have a fundamental right to information which is freely collected, processed and disseminated in accordance with the principles of the duty to truth, pluralism of approaches and rational methods of determining facts’, the authors of the declaration are added.
The document calls for help from world leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump, who often criticises “unreal news, but regularly accused of distortion of facts.
The world leaders should take a stand on this issue when they meet in Paris on 11-13 November, under the name of the Signatarians.
This declaration was made within two months, under the direction of Sh. Ebadi and Christophe Deloire, the head of the media freedom and defence organisation of journalists based in Paris, the “Reporters without borders” (RSF)”.
Among others, he was former President of Senegal, Abdu Diuf, Chinese lawyer and human rights activist, Teng Biao, and political scientist Fraensis Fukuyama.
Seim confirmed higher penalties for harmful products
The Seimas approved the amendments to the Product Safety Act, which provided for an increase in the fines for product safety infringements.
For the amendments, the Chamber was unanimously approved.
As Mr Winkus, a member of the Seimas Committee on Health, when speaking about the new project, it is welcome that the objectives set relate to better consumer protection of products.
It also adapts its provisions to the requirements of the Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
\"My head, the proposed draft law, is better and more specific to all the actors involved in the supply and distribution process: producers, service providers, importers, distributors and others.
As practice shows, the current system of fines does not always prevent further infringements, because entities that have paid fines continue to commit repeated infringements - - Mr Vinkus said.
The project was prepared by the Ministry of Economy, after approval by the Government, by the Seimas Economic Committee and supplemented by its proposals.
The amendments to the law aim to increase fines for infringements, to strengthen consumer protection, to give more powers to market surveillance authorities and to establish a clear framework for the requirements and supervision of product safety.
According to the Ministry of Economy, there is currently no obligation on producers to correctly label the product, thereby ensuring its traceability.
Moreover, according to the Ministry, the public product safety control performed by the market surveillance authorities does not allow access to the territory, buildings and premises of producers and suppliers, as well as to inspections, which makes it more difficult for the authorities to do so.
According to the Ministry's assessment, the six-month time limit for imposing fines and warnings is too short to detect, investigate and impose a fine.
Also, according to the ministries, the fines imposed are not effective enough.
Companies often repeatedly violate the law - only within the year 2017 it did by 14 companies.
The Ministry of Economy has proposed to impose an obligation on manufacturers to properly label the product, thereby ensuring its traceability, in order to facilitate the clarification of suppliers of non-compliant products by market surveillance authorities.
It is also proposed to grant market surveillance authorities the right to enter into the territory, buildings and premises of operators who manufacture, supply, supply products on the market, to carry out checks when carrying out national product safety controls.
It is intended to increase the amount of fines for infringements of the law.
A fine of between EUR 150 and EUR 2 500 (now: 144 to 1 448) would be imposed on the manufacturer, importer or authorised representative who made dangerous products on the market and the distributor, who made dangerous services available on the market.
A fine of between EUR 1 000 and EUR 5 000 (now between EUR 868 and 444) would be imposed following a decision by the State Consumer Rights Protection Authority (VVTAT) or another market surveillance authority to prohibit the placing on the market and placing on the market of dangerous products or the provision of dangerous services.
Failure to comply with the requirement to withdraw, recall and dispose of dangerous products from the market would lead to a fine of between EUR 2500 and EUR 6 500 (now between EUR 1.448 and 5 792).
Where dangerous products have caused damage to the health of the consumer, a fine of between EUR 2 500 and EUR 15 000 (now between 1 448 and 11584) would be imposed.
If dangerous products have caused consumer death, a fine of between EUR 6 500 and EUR 25 000 (now between 5 792 and 23 169) would be imposed.
According to the Ministry, in Poland and Austria, a fine of up to EUR 25 000 is imposed on the breach of product safety legislation (minimum fine is not established), in Belgium - from EUR 26 to EUR 600 thousand, in Romania - from EUR 155 to EUR 666, in Bulgaria - from EUR 125 to EUR 7 500.

Norwegian Armed Battalion participates in NATO exercises in the most remote areas
Wars from the Norwegian Armed Forces took part in a series of complicated exercises in the mountains north of Oslo, the capital of the country.
This is part of NATO Trisakene Connection 2018 – the biggest NATO exercise since the end of the Cold War.
Most soldiers from the Second Norwegian Armed Forces Battalion spent a lot of time after the 11th of September in terrorist attacks away from home in places such as Afghanistan - that is, in warm countries.
But most of all, they have been able to fight in the Arctic, and these skills are especially helpful now that NATO changes its focus.
In recent days, in the eastern mountains from Tysnet, often in the outermost and most remote areas, soldiers participated in the intense battles against the true British soldiers.
Wars have the skills to survive in this cold wild nature, but in the harsh climate they have to stretch on their shoulders a much bigger weight - one backweight of about 50 kg.
The leaders who stay in the Vadegian Hall say that they share their skills to survive and fight under conditions where they can share with other NATO troops.
According to the soldiers, these exercises, which like no one else resemble real military service, will teach them to be prepared if there is a serious threat.

According to the Head of EESC Linas Kojala, established in Vilnius and counting for the thirteenth year of its activities, the networking in the USA will allow the implementation of the projects and make Lithuania's voice more audible on the other side of the Atlantic.
“We have worked in this direction for several months.
I am glad that two large institutions are looking for us as partners and for joint activities.
I have no doubt that niche activities will come as our analysed topics of NATO, security, disinformation and Eastern Partnership development are also priorities for them.
The agreements state that EESC and US authorities will work together on transnational project proposals, exchange expertise and expertise, and prepare expert visits.
This should be particularly useful for Lithuanian analysts, since both partners have an excellent international reputation.
The FIRI has been operating since 1955 and unites nearly one hundred top analysts.
In the latest World Rating of Analysis Centres drawn up by the University of Pennsylvania, FIRI took the seventh place in its category.
At the same time, CEPA, whose analysts were repeatedly invited to consult and work on top of the US political institutions, is going to ten in the same rating category.
“This will give more opportunities to Lithuanian analysts working in various institutions to get to the US information space and encourage us to raise the quality card up – added Kojala.
One of the first practical steps should be to help partners in distributing their upcoming EESC analytical publication “Lithuanian Foreign Policy Review” among US decision-makers and in the public space.
The Eastern Europe Studies Centre operates on the basis of the projects implemented and does not maintain targeted grants.
The EESC's joint initiatives include the European Commission, NATO, USAID, various international funds, etc.
