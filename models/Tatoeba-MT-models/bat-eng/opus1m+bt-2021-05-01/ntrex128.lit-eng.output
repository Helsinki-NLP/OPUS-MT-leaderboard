The members of the Wales Assembly are concerned that “like dolls ”
Some members of the Assembly abstained from the proposal to change their name to MWP (Vales Parliament).
This concerns the intention to change the name of the Assembly to the Wales Parliament.
The Assembly is concerned that this could be a joke at political level.
One – Labour – Assembly member said his group was concerned, because it was worried about Twp – and Pwp –
Not Wales's readers: The Valeian language ‘twp’ means ‘buyish’, ‘o’ and ‘pwp’ means ‘what’
“The members of the plenary assembly said that the entire group had been “unsatisfied” and offered alternatives.
The conservator of Wales claimed that its group was ‘open’ because of the change of name, but pointed out that it was a reduction of the word from MWP to ‘soil’.
In fact, the letter w is considered similar to the letter in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly commission, which is currently preparing draft legislative proposals to change the title, said: “The final decision on the names of all the members of the Assembly will of course be a matter for the members themselves.
The law of the Wales Government of 2017 gave the Wales Assembly the right to modify its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposals which received strong support to call the Assembly the Wales Parliament.
As regards the name of the Assembly members, the Commission gave priority to Wales's Members or WMP, but in the public consultation the MWP received the highest support.
The members of the Assembly obviously offer alternative options, but efforts to reach an agreement can turn into a headache chair, Elin Jones, from whom it is expected to submit draft legislative amendments within a few weeks.
The legislation on reforms will cover other amendments to the work of the Assembly, including the rules on the disqualification of the Assembly Member and the Committee's framework plan.
During the legislative debate, the members of the Assembly will have a decisive vote on the question as to how they should be called.
Macedonian residents vote in referendum on the change of name of the country
On Sunday, voters will vote , or change the name of their country to the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The general vote was held in order to resolve a dispute lasting decades with a neighbouring Greece, which has its own province, called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim on the territory of Greece and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia's aspirations to join the EU and NATO.
The protesting plebisci, on the change of name, the President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanovas, said that he would not respect the vote.
But the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zaev, say that changing the name is simply a price that must be paid in order to join the EU and NATO.
Harlem’s difficulties prevented the bells of St. Martyn and other churches
“The people I talked to said that it was possible to find the bar and church on every corner,” said Adams.
- You can't find either of them today.
He said it was understandable why bars disappeared.
“In modern times people communicate differently, ” he said.
– The Bars are no longer a neighbourhood site where people regularly gather
When he talks about churches, he is worried that the money he receives from the sale of the property will not be sufficient for the duration of the leaders’ expectations – and sooner or later they will return to where they began to --
He added that churches could be replaced by multi-apartment houses with co-operative apartments, where such people would live that would not accompany the preserved temples.
“The majority of the people who will buy cooperative apartments in these multi-apartment buildings will be white,” he said, “and will therefore bring up the moment when the churches will completely close, because most of these people who have moved to these cooperative apartments are unlikely to become members of these churches”
Both churches were built in 1870, before Harlem became a black metropolis community, and St. Martynas’ church was built ten years later.
The primary cogregation of white methods emerged in the 1930s.
Nearby the church, the organized black congregation took over the name of the building.
St. Martyn's Church was taken over by black cogregation with clergyman John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott of the retailers in 125th Street, the main store in Harlem, where he refused to recruit or appoint blackman to a higher position.
In 1939 the building was severely destroyed by fire, but because the parishioners of the spiritual father Johnson planned to rebuild it, they ordered a military.
The priest David Johnson, the son and heir of the spiritual father Johnson at the church of St. Martynas, described the warry as poor bells.
Experts who entered the military in July called it otherwise – the cultural treasure – and “the indispensable historical instrument.”
Tiffany Ng, an expert at Michigan University, also mentioned that it was the world's first carryon, which was played by the black musician Dionis A. Lind. 18 years ago he started playing a bigger carryon at the Riversaid Church.
Merriweather said that the Church of St. Martyn did not replace him with another musician.
What happened in the church of St. Martynas in the last few months was a difficult story related to architects and contractors – some of them were called upon by the ecclesiastical worlds and others – the bishopship of the Episcopal Church.
Zacristia, a parish management body made up of secular leaders, expressed the concern in July that the bishop’s “will be able to overturn costs, ” the Zacristia, even though it did not hire architects and contractors who were sent by the bishops.
Some parishioners complained that the bishopy lacked transparency.
Shark in California injured a trapping lobster in the 13th century
Officials reported that shark on Saturday attacked a 13-year-old boy when he received lobster on the day of the opening season in California.
He was attacked at Ensinitas, 7 a.m., near the beach in St.
Chad Hammel San Diego's KSWB-TV wires said that he was playing with friends around half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy shouting for help, and then sailed with a group to help him get out of the water.
Hammel told me at first that the boy was nervous when he caught the lobster, but then he realized that the boy shouted: “I was bitten!
I was bitin'
Hammel said that when he approached the boy, he noticed that all his keybone was removed.
“ I began to shout to everyone to come out of the water: “A shark is flying in the water, ” Hammel added.
The boy was on a plane to a children’s hospital in San Diego-Radey, where he was recognised as in critical condition.
The type of shark that a boy had attacked was unknown.
The Savior, Captain Larry Gilles, told the media that a shark was observed in that zone a few weeks ago, but it was decided not to be a dangerous species of sharks.
Giles added that the victim suffered trauma in the upper part of the torso.
Officials closed the beach from Kasablado Ponto to Ensinitas Swami for 48 hours on investigation and protection.
Giles mentioned that there are more than 135 shark species in the zone, but most of them are not considered to be hazardous.
“Sainsbury’s – plans to engage in UK beauty market
“Sanesbury’s – taking over “Boots” – “Superdrug” and “Debenhams” with department for the beauty of online shops, where experts will be trained by consultants.
Actively turning to the UK GBP 2,8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow, while fashion and household goods sales fall, larger items will be tested in 11 shops throughout the country and, if they are successful, more shops will be installed next year.
Investment in beauty is growing, and supermarkets are looking for ways to use shelves, for TVs, microwave ovens and household items at some point.
\"Sanesbury's\" reported that it will double its range of beauty by 3 000 product names, including marks such as \"Revlon'-Essie'-Tweezerman's' and, for the first time, \"Dr. PawPaw\"
The existing-L'Oreal--Maymalline- and Burt's Bees- range will also receive more local branding in similar stores such as-Boats-
The shopping centre also reloads its own ‘Boutique’ makeup range, most of which products are vegan, which is increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, the perfume shop Fragrance Shop will test discounts in two Sainsbury’s shops, the first of which opened in Croidone, South London last week, and the second will open later in Seli Ouke, Birminga.
Thanks to online shopping and the desire to buy small amounts of daily from local minimal shop shops, supermarkets should try more to attract people there.
‘Sainsbury’s, CEO-in-Office, Mike Coupe, said that brand shops increasingly seem to be universal stores, as supermarket networks are trying to combat sales in the cheapest way by offering more services and non-food products to Aldi and Lidl.
“Sabitat” has included “Argos” in hundreds of shops and has also installed a large number of “Habitat” shops, since two years ago both networks were bought, which were claimed to have strengthened the sale of food products and made their purchases more profitable.
A previous attempt by the shopping centre to update its beauty and pharmacy department ended in failure.
In the beginning of the 1st century, Sansbury tested a joint venture with Boots, but the union ended up in a dispute about how to distribute income from the shops of pharmacists located in supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sansbury – three years ago for GBP 125 million – sold to the owner of its pharmacy 281 stores “Lloyds Pharmacy”
It was argued that the ‘Lloyds’ contribution to this plan was accompanied by an extended range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay- and Vichy-four shops.
“Sainsbury’s, sales director, Paul Mills-Hicks, said: “We changed the outside and atmosphere of beauty sections to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be prepared to provide advice.
Our trademark range is designed to meet every need, and thanks to the attractive environment and comforts we are now an attractive beauty site that challenges an old form of purchase.
Peter Jones is “sent-in because Holly Willoughby terminated a transaction with him in GBP 11 million
“Dragons Den ” star Peter Jones ” wrote after the TV host Holly Willoughby ended a GBP 11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on the new contracts with “Marks and Septemberer” and the ITV
H. Willoughby has no longer had time for their household addict and accessories trademark ‘Truly-1’
A couple of businesses were compared with the Gwyth Paltrow-Goop mark.
37 - year - old “This Morning ” has reported the exit from the release account.
At a last moment, Holly Willoughby has left a profitable lifestyle brand to focus on her new big contracts with Marks & Sverige and ITV – Dragoon Den – star Peter Jones.
Sources say that Jones was “subsequent, when at a special meeting on Tuesday, the golden TV girl admitted at the headquarters of his business empire Marlow (Bakingamshire) that new transactions of up to GBP 1.5 million would be sufficient for her to allocate time to his household property and accessory trade mark ‘Truly’.
Verslas was compared with Gwyneth Paltrow’s brand “Goop” and was presumed to have doubled the GBP 11 million assets of H. Willoughby.
Since 37 years of age, Willoughby-Instagram reported that he left the account---Truly-Jones left the UK to one of his cottages.
Source said: ‘Truly’ – So far was one of the most important Holly priorities.
This was to be her long - term future that would last for the next two decades.
Her decision to leave all of us was striking.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, because the beginning was so close.
Marlow's home has a full store of ready-to-market goods
Experts believe that “The Morning, the wife of the release, which is one of the most financially successful stars in Great Britain, can cost the company millions due to large investments in products, from cushions and candles to clothing and household items, as well as delays in starting things.
And that could be the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children, Mr Willoughby, and her husband Dan Baldwin, maintained close contact with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for a decade.
In 2016, Willoughby joined with T. Cappu – Trily – while 52 years of age, Mr Jones was joined as Chairman.
The couple go on holiday together, and Mr Jones holds 40% of the shares in Baldwin's television company.
Willoughby will become an \"M&S\" trademark ambassador and replace Mr Anto McPartlin, the head of the ITV show-I'm A Celebry.
The nearby source of Jones said yesterday: “We will not comment on his business.
We had a strong talk and “so we fell in love ”
He mocked the media criticism of the presentation of a comment that some might consider to be “unpresidental, ” as well as its positive response to the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
A brief voice of a deceivable “newer leader ” said: “
“ I didn’t give up anything ”
He mentioned that Kim was interested in the second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June was a major step towards the nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
However, the negotiations on nuclear disarmament are strict.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's highest-ranking diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not come from the US, a corresponding response to the early disarmament of North Korea.
He noted that the US would continue sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure instead.
A brief speech expressed a much more optimistic view.
“We are good at North Korea, ” he said.
- We were going to fight North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we are maintaining this fine relationship
He said that his efforts to improve his relations with Kim had brought positive results: after the missile tests had ended, his help was released by hostages and the remains of American soldiers returned home.
He defended his unusual attitude when talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people who want to enter this clap arena, we’ll have more than 200 people here, ” said Trump, pointing to the crowd standing right in front of him.
The Indonesian tsunami and the earthquake have destroyed the island, killing hundreds of people
Following the earthquake in Lombardo, foreign non-governmental organisations were informed that they were not in need of assistance.
Although more than 10% of Lombok’s population has been deployed, this has not been declared a national disaster, a prerequisite for international assistance.
“In many cases, unfortunately, it was said very clearly that there is no need for international assistance, so this is a little difficult,” said Sumbung.
Although “Save Children ” prepares a team that travels to Palau, it is still unclear whether foreign workers will be able to work.
The representative of the National Disaster Agency, Sutopo, said that Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palau in order to find out if international agencies will be allowed to contribute to the aid.
In view of Indonesia’s persistent earthquakes, the country is still far from prepared for its natural wrath.
Although the shelters against the tsunami were built in Aceh, they are not common in other coastal areas.
In spite of the reported warning, Palau is likely to increase the loss of life due to a apparent lack of tsunami warning.
The best time to travel between many Indonesian islands is complicated.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
A hospital ship stationed in Lomboke, where victims of the earthquake are treated, sail to Palau, but it will reach its new location in at least three days.
President Joko Widodo has chosen his election campaign centre for the reconstruction of Indonesia's demolished infrastructure, and he has spent money on roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding did not leave the Jock administration alone, as he will be attending the elections again in the coming years.
Nothing is also under pressure from persisting sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where Muslims follow more conservative forms of faith.
More than 1 000 people were killed and tens of thousands expelled from their homes, because the Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using matchhunts, bows with arrows and other common weapons.

He finally flew above Kepa Arrizabalaga and reached the net.
“I was just trying to get the ball, and players like Shaq always play as far ahead as possible, so I just tried to stay as time to hit,” LiverpoolFC.com said.
- I saw a run-off in Cante, one thing I had made sense of a ball, and without thinking too much, I just kicked it.
After the ejection of the Belgian star Eden Hazard for 25 minutes, Chelsea, from the first chair of the chair 1:0.
During that attack, “the blue attacker in the middle of the square returned the ball to the Mateo Kovacci and hurried to the Liverpool side.
This wall was quickly broken in the middle of the square.

Parliament’s Kromwell statues are shocked by a dispute between the recent rewriting of the history.
Its removal would be a poetic justice for the destruction of England's cultural and religious heritage, like the Taliban, for which the fantastic followers of Kromwell's Puritans are responsible.
However, the Society of Kromwell described the Cricko’s suggestion as “a fooly, and “the attempt to rewrite the story ”
John Goldsmith, president of the Kromwells Society, said: “In the current debate on the shift of statues to Oliver Kromwell’s statue at the House of Westminster was inevitably to become a target.
Kromvel did not order or execute the iconicism of the English Civil Wars.
This is perhaps not Kromwell who will be sacrificed for his ancestor Thomas's actions in the last century.
The wonderful image of Kromvelis, created by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is part of the historical picture of the 19th century attitude and of the figure that many still hold to be honored.
J. Goldsmith, The Sunday Telegraph, said: “Many people, perhaps at the end of the 19th century, have received more than today, Kromwell was regarded as a parliamentary defender of external pressure, which was, of course, a monarchy.
Whether it is precisely portrayed or not, historians have argued so far.
One thing is certain is that the middle-century conflict in the 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Kromwell has become an exceptional figure representing one of the sides of this divide.
His achievements, as Jehovah’s defender, are also worthy of mention and honor.
Swine’s murderer put an end to the Chinese farmer’s death
According to local media reports, in the southwestern Chinese market, the pig attacked and put a farmer on death.
On Sunday, the Morning Post reported that a dead man named Yuan had been found. Due to the damaged artery, he was blood-washed and lay next to the pighouse in the Lupanshui market, Guijou Province (South China).
On 30 May 2005, a pig farmer in Siningo, Czech province, China, prepared to inject vaccines into pigs in a pig pig.
He reported that on Wednesday, along with his cousin from the neighboring province of Junan, he intended to travel to market for 15 pigs.
The next morning, he detected a relative who died and found a door to a nearby pigbed.
He said that there was a large cull in the pig that had a bloody mouth.
According to the report, the forensic study confirmed that a 250 - kilogram [250 kg] pig was tearing down a farmer.
“Guiyang Evening News ” quotes: “My cousin’s legs were bloody and damaged, ” said cousin, pointing out his name Wu.
The filmed material of the security camera showed Yuan, who was on the market at 4.40 p.m. on Thursday to feed his pig.
His body was found in about an hour.
The man’s shrivelled animal, Yuan, or his cousin, did not belong.
The Head of the Market reported, “Evening News, ” that the pig had to be locked down to stop attacking other people and kept until the police collected evidence on the spot.
Yuan's family and the market authorities are reported to negotiate compensation for death.
Although limited, earlier cases of attacking pigs have been reported.
In 2016, the pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, and the man was severely injured.
Ten years ago, a cow weighing 295 pounds [295 kg] put the Wales farmer on the tractor and pressed the animal’s wife down.
After the pigs ate Oregon’s farmer in 2012, one Manitoba farmer, ABC News, told us that the pigs are usually not aggressive, but that blood tastes can stimulate aggression.
“They are just playful.
They like to be a moron, very curious... not wishing to harm anyone.
You just have to respect them accordingly,\" he said.
Uragano Rozo’s remnants – bring great rain to the southwest of the United States
The storm Rosa is forecast to weaken as it passes through the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rose will bring plenty of rain to all of northern Mexico and southwest U.S.A.
On Sunday from 5:00 a.m., Rose moved 137 km/h as a 1st category storm and was 620 km southwest of the Cape of Euchenia (Mexico).
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
At the same time, the Pacific side begins to form an outlying area of low pressure and moves eastward towards the US west coast. As Rose approaches the California Peninsula as a tropical storm, it will begin to bring great tropical humidity northward, southwest US.
On Monday, Rosa will cause rain up to 25 inches [25 cm] in some areas of Mexico.
Then, the tropical humidity, interacting with the approaching area of low pressure, will bring much rain to the southwest in the coming days.
Instead of 2,5 to 10 centimetres, rain will cause a dangerous sudden flood, scrap flow, and possible landslide in the desert.
High tropical humidity will cause rainfall to fall from 5 to 8 cm [8 cm] per hour in some places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
The rain is expected in southwestern regions, especially large areas of Arizona.
The tropical rainy nature of the potential for sudden flooding and rapidly deteriorating conditions.
In the face of tropical storms, a particularly poor plan would be to get to the desert by foot.
Significant rain canyons can be turned into raging rivers, and thunderstorms can cause wind and dust to jump.
The approaching vast area of low pressure will bring some local heavy rain to the south coast of California.
It is likely that more than 1 inch [1 cm] of rainfalls can cause a small stream of scrap, and roads can become slippery.
This would be the first falls of the wet season in the region.
Some tropical rains will come near Arizona late on Sunday and early Monday, and then rain will spread late on Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rains after Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Juta will continue on Tuesday and Wednesday.
The October is possible with intense temperature fluctuations in all the USA, as the Arctic cools, but the tropical zone will be relatively warm.
Sometimes this leads to huge temperature changes at small distances.
Sunday was an excellent example of huge temperature differences in the central United States.
The temperature of Kansas Sichi (Misur) and Omaha (Nebraska) is almost 20 degrees different from the temperature of Saint Louis and Di Moin (Ayova).
In the next few days, the summer heat should rise again and cover more areas.
It is expected that in the vast central and eastern United States, from the Great South League to northeastern areas, a warm October with much of the prevailing 27 degrees temperature is coming.
The temperature in New York is expected to rise to 27 degrees Fahrenheit [27 ° C] on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows that the temperature in the eastern US will be higher than the average multiannual temperature in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people were watching the Bretto Kavanaugh hearing
More than 20 million people on the six television broadcasts on Thursday watched a wrestling note of the statements made by Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate for the Supreme Court, and of the woman Christine Blasey Ford in the 1980s, in charge of sexual violence.
However, the political impasse continued as the broadcasters interrupted their regular programmes on the change of the last minute of Friday: Arizona's senator made an agreement that the FBI would carry out a week-long investigation into caste charges.
Ford Senate Court Committee has said that it is absolutely sure that Kavanaugh, who had worked at the high school party, had groaned her and tried to take her clothes off.
The Kavanaugh angryly demonstrated that he was absolutely sure that he had not.
“Nielsen reported on Friday that more than 20,4 million people watched the broadcast.
The company calculated the average number of viewers watching the broadcast via CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel-1 and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available to other networks, including ‘PBS-1-C-SPAN-1 and Fox Business Network-2’.
Moreover, “Nielsen ” usually has some difficulty counting people watching TV in the offices.
To explain, it is the same size as the playoffs or the Oskar awards.
“Nielsen ” reported that Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly supported Kavanaugh’s candidacy, came from all networks, when the number of spectators reached an average of 5.69 million during the day’s hearing.
ABC was in second place with 3.26 million spectators.
‘Nielsen’ reported that CBS had received 3.1 million, NBC 2,94 million, MSNBC 2,89 million and CNN 2,52 million.
The hearing continued with great interest at the end of the hearing.
The main figure of the Friday drama was Flax.
After a small Republican Bureau issued a statement that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, he was arrested on Friday morning of the CNN and the CBS cameras, when protesters shouted on him, trying to lift him to the hearing of the Court Committee.
The CNN directly filmed it down when people flooded it.
“I stand here in front of you,” said one woman.
- Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told: “You have power when so many women are powerless, ”
He said that his office had issued a statement and added that he had to say something more in the Court Committee before he closed the elevator.
Later, cable television and broadcasting networks discussed directly when the Committee of Justice voted in favour of Kavanaugh’s candidacy to the Senate.
However, Flaque said that this would only be done by knowing that the FBI would investigate, in the coming week, cast charges against a candidate whose investigation called for a minority of democrats.
At Flax, he had a conversation with his friend, a democratic senator, Chris Coons, in part, was convinced.
Having spoken to Coons and several Senators, Flake made a decision.
The panel had power to choose because it was obvious that Republicans would not have votes to confirm the Kavanaugh will not carry out the investigation.
President Trump started an investigation into FBI suspicions against Kavanaugh.
The British Prime Minister is accused of criticism of policy-making on \"Brexit\"

\"It is always thought about this,\" said Wade.
The fireball bursts into ashes in the city of Mexico
The rocks erupted from the Popocatepetle volcano, which reached the southern surroundings of the Mexican capital.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Prevention Centre warned the Mexicans to stay away from the volcano, when increased crater activity was recorded and 183 discharges of gas and ash were recorded within 24 hours.
The center has been watching many ruins and earthquakes.
The pictures presented in the social media show a thin layer of ash covered by cars windscreens in the vicinity of Mexico, for example, Chochimilke.

Before the vote on independence, the police competed with Catalon separatists
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after the protesters competed for independence with the riot police and thousands joined the opponents' demonstrations to commemorate the first anniversary of the vote on separation against Catalonia.
The anti-riot police covered eggs and powder paint with dark dust clouds in the streets, which are usually filled with tourists.
The police used bats to stop the fights that started later on the day.
Within a few hours, the group for the independence singing “Unforgetable, unforgiving ” faced the Unionist protesters who shouted: “Let Spain live.
The local press reported that fourteen people were being treated for minor injuries caused by protests.
A year after the referendum of 1 October, which Madrid regards as illegal, but which is presented by the Catalon separatists, the tensions that remain high in the area of independence.
The majority of voters decided to become independent, but the activity of the voters was low due to a large part of the vote in favour of boycotters who did not want to separate themselves.
According to the Catalan authorities, last year the police were injured by nearly 1 000 people during violent clashes when trying to stop voting in the polling districts.
On Friday night, the independent group established a camp to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place, but it was forced to change the route.
The 68-year-old electrician, Narciss Termes, who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said that he was no longer sure about the prospects of the independence of Catalonia.
“In the last year, we survived one of the best moments.
I watched my parents joyfully shouting to be able to vote, but now we are stuck,\" he said.
Despite the fact that last December was ripped out in regional elections with a vital and difficult victory, the Catalonia's independence parties have been difficult to keep up their momentum this year when many of their most famous leaders have left for voluntary exile or have been detained and awaited by the court for their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
In support of the police, a 42-year-old mechanic Joan Puggy, who filmed the protest on his phone, said that the conflict was exacerbated by politicians on both sides.
“The tension is constantly increasing, ” he said.
On Saturday, Oriolis Junqueras, one of the nine Catholic leaders in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced his participation in the European Parliament elections next year.
“Practicing in the European Parliament elections is the best way to condemn the decline and repression of democratic values shown by the Spanish Government,” he said.
Londonder: Men entering the car in the house
Three men 33, 34, and 39 were arrested after they re-entered the house in London.
The incident was held on Thursday at 7.30 p.m. (BVL) in Ballinagard Crescent.
The detective inspector Bob Blemmings said he had ruined the gate and the building itself.
At a certain point in the car could also have been shot in the arlett.
Men’s blow ensured the “Livingston” victory of 1:0 before the “Rangers”
“Livingston – the first victory of player Dolly Menga guaranteed victory
Livingston, the highest league was moved to surprise Rangers to force Steven Gerrard, the head of the club, to win the second of the 18th game.
Dolly Mengos blow turned out to be very important, because in a moment the Gary Holto team got into a match with “Hibernian –”
Gerrard’s team in this Premium League season remains unlucky and will meet the leaders Hearts, from which they are eight points, the next Sunday.
Earlier on Thursday, the ‘Rangers-European League matches at home’ will play with Vienna-Rapid.
At that time, Livingston extended its unparalleled series of unparalleled matches to six, while the chief coach Holt has not yet felt the taste of defeat, since Kenny Miller has changed only last month.
“Livingston – the chance of a miss in the match with Orthodox guests
Even before he beats the victory, the Holt team had long before, due to its perseverance, Rangers, had to be at the forefront of various problems.
At first Scott Robinson struck and struck the cross-gates, later Alan Lithgow failed to reach the head of Craig Halketto by the hand of the ball and this jumped next to the gate.
Masters, allowing the Rangers to play in front, did not feel concerned because they knew that they could make the guests trouble by creating standard positions.
That is what a decisive victory has been defeated.
“Rangers ” released the free blow and “Livingston ” got ahead; Declan Gallagher and Robinson, in a joint effort, handed over the ball to Menga, which stopped him and earned a defeat from the middle of the fine lot.
Since then, the ball has been controlled for a longer time by “Rangers, ” but the defence of the hosts was insurmountable and the goal for Liamm Kelly was virtually nonexistent.
This kind of thief game continued in the second chair, even though Kelly had to work to support the blow of Alfredo Morelos to the gate.
The Scottish Pittman Shot Allan McGregor hit the leg, and then the Livingston, the standard position of the Lithgow hit the ball, running near the gate.
The transfer of the ball kept at Livingston, a fine ground, but every time it was expirated, and the two claims were imposed – one due to the Halkett collision with Glenn Middlert, who ran into the square after the change, and the other due to the ball's touch, was not satisfied.
Phenomenal-Livingston-Show analysis
‘BBC Scotland-reporter Alassair Lamont from Tony Mašiai arena
Phenomenal-Livingston – a game and result.
All by one they were excellent and continued to exceed expectations for an ever better game.
Game style and staff have hardly changed since the return to the upper league, but the great merits should be assigned to Holt, because upon arrival he lit the team.
He has been assisted by many heroes.
Captain Halkett played a wonderful game, focusing on a well-organized defense, and Menga evaluated Connor Goldson and Joe Worralla not to lose sight.
Still, “Ranger did not get inspired.
Although they played perfectly under Gerrard's direction, this time they did not have enough to reach their level.
They had little fight of decisive shocks and had only once crossed the defence of their owners. A certain alarm call was placed in the middle of the table by the Rangers team.
Erdogan in Cologne was met in various ways
On Saturday (September 29), there were smiles and blue skys when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, when the goal was to restore the relationship between NATO allies.
The leaders challenged problems such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new big mosque.
The largest community outside Turkey is located in the city.
The police banned 25 000 people from uniting in front of the mosque for security, but many supporters arrived to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of them Kurds, also tried to be heard condemning both Erdogan policy and the German Government's decision to accept it in their own country.
Different protests show the fragmentation of visitors: some German Turks hold it a hero, while others call it a dictator.

“Long Lartino, a prison and six officers injured during the uproar
The prison service reported that six inmates were injured in a time of severe breakdown in a special security men's prison.
The uproar took place at HMP Long Lartin, a prison in Wismütwire, on Sunday at 09.30 a.m., where it continues to exist.
The special “Tornado ” officers were invited to control this disorder, which involved eight prisoners, and it takes place on one side of the prison.
Officials shall be treated for minor facial injuries at the site of the event.
The prison representative said: “HMP Long Lartin was invited to prison in order to manage the ongoing incident.
Six personnel were treated against injuries.
We cannot tolerate violence in our prisons and we ensure that those responsible will be given to the police and perhaps spend more time with bars.
‘HMP Long Lartin – has more than 500 prisoners in prison, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
June was reported to be treated by a prison manager after he was attacked by a prisoner.
In October of last year, riot - fighting officers were invited to take control of a serious tear in which some workers were hung by billiard balls.
Urgan Rose is threatening Finix, Las Vegas, Solt Lake Sichi, with his sudden floods, which can be useful for the dry areas.
It is not common for tropical depression to hit Arizona, but this is precisely what will probably happen next week, when the urban Rose with its remaining energy dries through the southwest of the desert and this will cause the risk of a sudden flooding.
The National Meteorology Service has already declared a monitored sudden flood on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, extending toward southern and eastern Nevada, south-eastern California and Juta including Finix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Solt Lake City.
It is expected that late Monday will be close to the rain on Tuesday, Rose will go straight to Finix.
Finixe’s National Meteorology Service mentioned that only “ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storms or tropical depression no more than 322 kilometres from Finix since 1950!
Katrina (a year 1967) was a storm limited to 64 miles [64 km] from the Arizona border.
According to the latest models of the National Urgan Center, rainfalls of 5 to 10 centimetres are predicted to fall, while in some places of Arizona Mogolon Rimo the amount of rainfall is estimated to be 5 centimetres.
Other areas in the southwest of the desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to reach between 2.5 and 5 centimetres, and in some cases fall to 10 centimetres.
The rain of Rose can be a blessing to people who are not in rapid tides because of the drought in the region.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some of these rainfalls can be beneficial because south-westerns are currently suffering from droughts.
According to the US Drought Monitoring Centre, slightly more than 40% of Arizona’s suffers from extreme drought, which corresponds to the second highest category,” reported Weather.com.
First, urban Rose travels to the coast across the California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday, Rose is still like a urban category with a huge wind of 137 km/h, located 619 miles south of the Cape of Euchen, Mexico, and moves north at a speed of 19 kilometers per hour.
Audra is in contact with cooler waters in the Pacific region, and this has given rise to concern.
So it is expected that it will reach the Mexican coast with a tropical storm force on Monday at lunch or at evening.
A drop in certain parts of Mexico may be severe and present a high risk of flooding.
“Sonora is expected to reach 8 to 12 centimetres from the California Peninsula to the northwest, but possibly – and the amount of rainfall of up to 25 centimetres – is probably said by Weather.com.
Rosa will then move north through Mexico as a tropical storm, and later, on Tuesday morning, it will reach the border of Arizona as a form of tropical depression, and Tuesday night later at Arizona will be moving southward towards Juta.
‘The major danger that Rose or its residues are expected to pose is the very high rain in the California Peninsula, north-west Sonora and south-west US Desert,’ the National Organisms Centre reported.
These rains are expected to cause life - threatening sudden floods, falls in the deserts, and landslides in mountain areas.
The attack at Midsamer Norton. Four people suspected of killing were arrested.

Briefly he says that Kavanaugh “was suffering from the fury of the Democratic Party, anger ”
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice that we would like to reject the cruel and offensive tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said in her speech in Viling, West Virginia.
Briefly he said that Kavanaugh had experienced the fury of the Democratic Party during his nomination process.
Kavanaugh witnessed to the Congress on Thursday the strong and emotional condemnation of Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation that she had been sexually assaulted several decades ago when they were teenagers.
He also witnessed his accusations during the Ford court hearing.
On Saturday, the president said that “the Americans saw on that day the great, noble, and courageous of Kavanaugh.
– Voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for one of the most experienced legal minds of our time, it is a lawyer with a reliable reputation in the field of public services,” he said the crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The President referred indirectly to the candidacy of Kavanaugh, while speaking about the importance of the republican election activity in the mid-elections.

The number of hundreds of deaths caused by the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia continues to grow
The authorities reported that at least 384 people died, and many were threatened by huge waves that were breaking the beach when a strong earthquake and tsunami struck Indonesia’s Sulawes Island.
Hundreds of people gathered for the Palu beach festival on Friday, when waves of six meters high went to the coast. Many of them were deadly wiped out and destroyed all that happened on the road.
After the tsunami there was a 7.5-point earthquake.
“When the threat of a tsunami arose yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not run immediately, so they became victims, – an information report at Jakarta said at the time of the BNPB Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency representative for the press Supoto Purwo Nugroho.
– Tsunami did not remove himself, he pulled cars, logs, houses, and struck everything on the ground – – said Nugroho and added that the tsunami was running at 800 km/h before the coast hit.
He said that some people went into the trees to avoid the tsunami and so survived.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Photographs from the aerials of the Agency of Serious Disasters showed that many buildings and shops were destroyed, bridges rolled out and destroyed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the seaside city was further shaken by repeated shocks.
The series of earthquakes was felt in the area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (FPPT) reported that the energy released by the extremely strong earthquake on Friday was about 200 times higher than the nuclear bomb, which was thrown down on Hirozym during World War II.
It was reported that the tsunami was likely to increase due to the geographical location of the city, as it is located in the back of a long, narrow bay.
Nugroho described the damage as “significant ” and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers, and hotels had been destroyed.
He said that the bodies of some victims were found trapped under ruins of buildings, later added that 540 people were injured, and 29 people were missing out.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and the damage could be greater along the coast, 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Dongala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Nugroho said that the communication networks ‘were completely paralyzed and therefore no information was received from Dongala.
“There are more than 300 000 people living on it,” said the representative of the Red Cross, adding that workers and volunteers travel to areas affected by the disaster.
It was said that “this could already be regarded as a tragedy, but the situation could be worse...
On Saturday, the Agency was very criticised for not reporting that the tsunami struck Palau, although officials said that the waves came after the announcement of the warning.
The amateur material of the social media can be heard by a man on the top floor of the building, who is shouting about the approaching tsunami below the street.
In a few minutes, a water wall strikes the shore, carrying buildings and cars.
“Reuters ” could not confirm the film immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami have disrupted the supply of electricity, which has decoupled the communication networks around Palau and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the provision of aid.
The authorities reported that the army from Jakarta and other cities had begun to send cargo aircraft containing aid equipment, but that the evacuated person still needs food and other essential equipment.
The airport was reopened only with a view to granting the aid and will be closed by October.
On Sunday, President Widodo planned to visit Palu evacuation centres.
The number of Indonesian tsunami victims exceeded 800.
That's very bad.
Dazeba reported that when “World Vision, the staff from Dongala safely traveled to the city of Palu, where the workers were encircled in the brewest tents located in the office yard, they were en route to destroy their sights.
“They told me that they had seen many destroyed homes, ” he said.
That's very bad.
Even when emergency teams started taking difficult steps to provide disaster relief, some people complained that they had a lot of experience of travelling to Pala with foreign aid workers.
According to the Indonesian Regulations, funding, provision and external personnel can only help when the disaster site is declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
“This is still a provincial-level disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
– When the government says: “Yes, this is a national disaster, we can invite international aid, but this status has not yet been published.
The second night after Friday earthquake and tsunami Palau, friends and relatives of the missing people hoped that their loved ones would be part of a miracle that would mark the dire history of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small boy was taken out of the sewer.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been pressed under ruins for two days near the body of her mother.
Gendon Subandon, a coach of the Indonesian national paraspartic team, had learned the two missing parasponsors of the Asian Games which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others were his disciples in the hotel of the erect “Roa Roa, ” including Mandag.
“As I am older in paragliding sports, I carry my emotional burden, ” he said.
Gendon gave a detailed description of how, after announcing the humiliation of the Roa Roa, the hotel was travelling through the paraspartic sport community within a few hours. He was desperately sending messages through the WhatsApp, the Pau competition, who took part in the beach festival.
However, his report contained only one gray bell, not two blue bells.
“I think this means that messages have not been received, ” he said.

Seaan Combsas has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year has announced a preference for the names of Love and Brolish Love.
Former Western colleague JAY-Z also exchanged his name and used it with or without a dash and capital letters.
Mexican politics, Andrés Manuel López Obrador (abbreviated AMLO), promises not to use soldiers against civilians.
The elected Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador promised never to use the military force against the civilian population when the 50th anniversary of bloody repression against students approaches the country.
López Obrador promised that he would not use the military forces in Tlatelco, Square, to tame the people of Mexico on Saturday.
On 2 October 1968, at a time when left student movements began to take place throughout Latin America, military forces were shooting for peaceful demonstration and 300 people were killed.

He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities include young people in criminal groups.
USA should double funding for artificial intelligence
“As China is becoming increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount spent on research in this area,” says the investor and specialist in artificial intelligence Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google “Microsoft” and “Apple ”
These comments were received after various bodies of the U.S. government issued reports on artificial intelligence, even the fact that the U.S. is generally not an official artificial intelligence strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan for leading innovation in artificial intelligence by 2030 last year.
“The double budget for artificial intelligence research would be a good start, given that all other countries are more advanced than the United States and are waiting for another breakthrough in artificial intelligence,” said Lee.
Double funding could double the likelihood that the other great achievement of artificial intelligence would be achieved in the US, as Lee said with the interview this week – CNBC –
Lee, whose book The Superstates of Work Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, released this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt – is the CEO of Sivulation Ventures, who invested in one of the leading Chinese artificial intelligence companies, Face ++
In the 1980s, he worked at the Carnegie Mellon University with an artificial intelligence system that won the top American Othello - player and was later the head of Microsoft Research and the president of the Google - Chinese branch.
Lee acknowledged the previous US government technological competitions, such as the “Robot Challenge ” Agency for Advanced Defence Research Projects, and asked when to help find more intelligence people.
Lee claimed that US scientists often have to struggle to win state grants.
“It’s not China that takes academic leaders – it’s companies, ” said Lee.
“Facebook“ Google ” and other technology companies have in recent years hired bright university minds to work with artificial intelligence.
Lee stated that changes in immigration policy could also help the US to strengthen its efforts for artificial intelligence.
“I think doctoral students working in the field of artificial intelligence should be automatically offering green cards,” he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese Council of State announced its plan for the development of the new generation of artificial intelligence.
In addition, Lee said, the Chinese National Natural Sciences Foundation finances academics people, just like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations spend money on US scientists, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established the Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence to involve partners from industrial and academic community, and the White House announced that a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence would be established.
This month, DARPA (An Agency for Advanced Defence Research Projects) announced an investment of USD 2 billion for the “AI Next” initiative.
NSF is currently investing more than USD 100 million a year in research on artificial intelligence.
However, nothing has been done in the coming months with US legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonian people vote in referendum on whether to change the name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted in Sunday's referendum to change the name of the country, the Republic of Northern Macedonia, an act that would resolve the dispute over decades with Greece, which blocked its aspirations to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, in which the province of Macedonia is located, argues that the name of its northern neighbour means claims for the territory of Greece and veto Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments agreed on the proposed new name, but the opponents nationalists claim that the change of name would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority of Macedonian population.
President Ivanovas said that he would not vote in referendum, and the boycott campaign expressed doubts as to whether the voter engagement would reach a minimum of 50% of what is necessary for the entry into force of the referendum.
The question of the referendum was raised on the voting card: \"Am you in favour of NATO membership and the EU in agreement with Greece?
The supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that Macedonia, one of the countries that suffered from the collapse of Yugoslavia, is worth paying a price to join institutions such as the EU and NATO.
“Today I came to vote for the future of the country, for the young Macedonian people to live freely, protected the European Union, as it means a safer life for all of us,” said Oliver Georgijevska 79 years of age.
Although not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members said that they would comply with the results of the vote and make them decisive.
A change of name would require two-thirds of the majority in the parliament.
The National Electoral Commission announced that no reports of violations were received by 13.00.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of voters cast their vote.
“I came to vote on my children, because of our place in Europe, ” said Gjose Tanevski, the voter in Skopje, 62-year-old capital.
On 30 September 2018, the Macedonian parliamentr Zoran Zaeva, his wife Zorica and his son Duško voted in a referendum in Macedonia to change the name of the country in order to open the way for accession to NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years of age, made a small scene and held chairs in front of tents, which he built in a boycotting referendum.
“We are behind NATO and the EU, but we want to join the heads raised and not enter the door of the servants,” said Kawadarkov.
- We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and participate in Eurasian integration.
Prime Minister Zaeva says that NATO membership in Macedonia, with unemployment rates of more than 20 percent, will attract the necessary investment.
“I believe that the vast majority will be in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO, ” said Zaeva.
He said that the result would be “ensuring our future ”
According to the results of a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters should participate in the referendum, less than the required turnout.
According to another survey conducted by Macedonian television “Telma – Sunday, 57 percent of respondents prepare for the vote.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote “Yes”
In order for a referendum to succeed, 50 percent of voters will have a single vote in it.
If the referendum failed, it would be the first serious failure of pro-Western government policy since it took over power last May.
Look at: “Manchester City” player Sergio Aguero overcomes the entire “Brighton” defense and profit victory
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling won the Brighton, and the team Manchester City on Saturday, playing at the Etihad stadium in Manchester, England, reached the result of 2:0.
Aguero won the 65-minute rape, which would seem incredibly easy.
Argentina's attacker the ball in the middle of the square got in the beginning of the attack.
Before he broke into the open field, he passed between three to Brighton protectors.
Then Aguero surrounded the four green T-shirt players.
He shot one defender, before he passed several other on the ‘Brighton’ area of the fine.
Then transferred the ball to the left where Sterling was.
The English attacker, one of the kicks from the fine ground, returned the ball to Aguero, and this right foot hit the right side of the gate’s network by overcoming “Brighton” the goalkeeper Mathew Ryan.
“Aguero has problems with its feet,” said Peps Guardiola, the Head of City.
- We talked he was gonna play for 55-60 minutes.
That's how it was.
We were lucky that he won the victory at that moment.
However, it was Sterling that helped Sky Blues, the first to break through this \"Premier League\" game.
The rape was earned for 29 minutes.
During the attack, Aguero received the ball at “Brighton ” beds in depth.
Following the left side of the square, between the two opponents, he gave the ball nicely to Leroy Sane.
Sane's drive the ball forwards a few clicks until Sterling's turn towards the next basement.
“Sky Blues, a attacker, launched the ball at the gate just before slipping out of the square.
At 12 p.m., 55 p.m., City meets the Hofffenheim, the Champions League Group matches in the Zinsheim Arena-Rhein-Neckar (Germany).
Scherzer wants to play friendly matches with “Rockies”
After the Nationals came out of the playoffs, there were no valid reasons to reinvigorate.
Competing Scherzer hopes to overcome the “Colorado Rockies”, but only if Rockies are still able to stay in the playoffs; in the national league, the West – they are going one point ahead of Los Angeles Dodgers –
“Rockies – Friday evening result at 5:2 by “Nationals” at least ensured the chance to get a travel guide, but still has to try to ensure the right to play in the first two.
“We’ll be able to go out at least for nothing while knowing that the atmosphere in Denver, where the crowd and the other team will gather, will probably be at the highest level we can reach this year.
Why don't you talk?
On Sunday, the team had not announced the start composition “Nationals” yet, but in this case to throw the ball is clearly inclined to release Scherzer.
Scherzer, who will be on the 34th of this game, made a drop-out workout on Thursday and will take the position of the metik on his regular holiday day – Sunday.
Washington right-handed for this season statistics: 18-7, 2.53 ERA and 300 autos over 220 2/3 chair.
A Short Language in West Virginia
Speaking of the importance of the work of the Republican voters in the middle of the term of office, the President indirectly mentions the situation regarding the appointment of Bretto Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
“All we have achieved will be placed on the balance in November.
The top five weeks of elections have been made to our lives.
It's very important, I don't run... but I actually run, so why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere,\" he said.
Then he said: \"You see this terrible, terrible group of democrats, and you see how it happens right now.
And they are determined to regain power by whatever means, you see it as low as evil.
They don't care what they hurt, through what they went over to get power and control; that's what they really want – power and control – but we won't give them.
Democrats, he said, have a mission to resist and block
“ And you can see it for the past four days, ” he said, “and he said, ‘Democrats, disgust, abominations, low tendencies, and the wrong people ’
He referred to the Senate Court Committee, referring to the name of the democratic senator Dianne’s Feinstein, which led to the huge innovations of the audience.
‘Remember her answer?
Did you run the document?
Oh, hm, yeah.
No, hm... no, I'm waiting for one – it was really a bad language of the body – the worst language of the body I've ever seen.
Labourers have lost opinion.
They do not tolerate openly expressing their opinion
When the “Monitor” activists in my local party voted in favour of distrust, he knows if he should be surprised.
Finally, I am the most recent Labour MEPs, who have been told that I am unwelcome, and this is in favour of what they have said.
My fellow Member, Joan Ryan, faced similar threats because she was firmly against anti-Semitism.
My mistrust was expressed in criticising me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbion.
The importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically, on similar issues that Jeremy has not agreed with previous leaders.
On Friday, the report on the “Nottingham East Labour” meeting stated that “We would like many members to be involved and that meetings would be productive.
Most of those eight years when I am a local Labour Party parliament, the GC meetings of Friday evening were just like that.
It is sad that today the tone of many meetings is less than what has been said by policies that are “softer, more pleasant ” than ever before, even if they ever started to do.
It is increasingly evident that a different opinion in the Labour Party is intolerant and that each opinion is assessed on the basis of its acceptability to the party's leadership.
This began shortly after the party's leader became Jeremy, and my colleagues, who, as I have previously believed, have similar political views, began to hope that I will turn around at 180 degrees and will hold the opinions with which I would never disagree – whether for national security or for the EU's single market.
When I speak in the public – and even no matter what – in social networks there is a tyrannism of insults that promote my withdrawal, it is said that I am not in the Labour Party.
And that's not just my experience.
In fact, I was far more successful than some of my colleagues, because my comments were political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who have to endure daily a healthy sexual and racist abuse.
One of the most disappointing things of this political era is how insults have become a normal phenomenon.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a party of the same opinion, and with every procedure of non-confidence or amendment of the electoral system, this party is becoming increasingly minor.
Over the past two years, I have received a lot of advice to avoid jumping, speaking so loudly, and then I’ll be “all right ”
But I didn't come into politics for that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago when I was still a student, provoked by the negligence of the Thatcher government, which really ruined my entire school class in the sense of the word, I sought to combat better public services for those who need them most, whether as a local council member or a government minister.
I have never hidden my policy, including the recent elections.
No one “Nottingham East ” was surprised by my political opinions and disagreements with the current leaders.
To those who have promoted this procedure on Friday, when a country is running towards Brexit, which is the victim of domestic, business and public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy because of my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threats of cancellation or political accuracy will stop me from acting in accordance with my beliefs and all your best interests.

‘Ayr’- ‘Melrose’ – 38:17 Insurable ‘Ayr - conquers the tops of tables
Two late attempts have deviated the final results, but there is no doubt that “Ayr – deserved the moments of this triumph in the impressive, promise of subtracting Tennent's Premiership – day match.
Now the team is at the top of the table – the only one undone.
Finally, they have been won with perfect defence and good use of opportunities, so the coach Peter Murchie can really feel satisfied.
“We raised all the tests during all the matches that have been held so far and we are still undone, so I’m really happy, ” he said.
Robin Christie of “Melrose” said: “Ayr – it turned out well, the players used their odds better than we did.
The Granto Anderson's 14-minute test, which was successfully completed by Frasier Climo, resulted in the ‘Ayr’, but the yellow card for Rory Hughes, which was released by Warryors, allowed the number to be collected by ‘Melrose’, and ‘Baggot’ stopped the non-resultant test.
Climo increased Ayr, an advantage in which before, in the middle of the contest, he won a score and successfully completed his personal test, helping Ayr to untie the result at 17:5 before the break.
However, “Melrose, the second chair, started well, and Patrick Anderson’s test, which was completed by Bagggot successfully, reduced the gap to five points.
The match was suspended for a longer time because Ruaridhas Knott had a serious injury and was taken out of the hut on the carriers. After the prolonged game, Ayr, continued to move forward when Staffford’s McDowall test resulted in successful completion of Climo.
“Ayr – Captain Blair Macpherson got a yellow card, and “Melrose” tried to take advantage of the players’ surplus, but Bruce Colline’s attempt at ending with intense pressure was ineffective.
The player in the team returned, however, when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for stopping Climo without a ball, MacPherson pressed the ball from the fine line for the continuation of Ayr’s back place.
Climate has successfully completed its test, as it had already done almost since the start of the game's renewal, after Kyle Rowe stopped David Armstrongo's kick at the corner of the square and prevented the land attacker Gregor Henry from holding the fifth home team's test to earn points.
“Still Game is a star that seems ready to start a new career in the restaurant industry
“Still Game, the star Ford Kiernan, seems to be ready to move to the accommodation and catering services sector when it turns out that he has been appointed a director of the licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old man plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC comedy, writes and plays a script with Greg Hemphil, his long-time partner.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the last season of the show, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning her life under Kraiglange.
For official data, it has become the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this fact, although “Scottish Sun ” sources highlighted that Kiernan was looking for ways to get involved in the Glasgow-crowing restaurant business.
“The sea belongs to us: Bolivia, which has been imprisoned on land, hopes that the court will return to the ocean
The seamen shall patrol the Navy at its headquarters in La Pass.
Public buildings are covered with an ocean - blue flag.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are shouting: “We rightly depend on the sea.
It is our responsibility to recover
In Bolivia, all on land, the memories of access to the ocean, which had to be sacrificed for Chile in the nineteenth-century conflict, are still alive – a living and long time again to be set up in the Pacific.
The hopes enjoyed in recent decades have now been considerably strengthened, as, after a five-year hearing, Bolivia is awaiting a ruling by the International Court of Justice, which will be published on 1 October.
“Bolivia is focused on the spirit of unity and peace and is of course hoping to achieve positive results,” said Bolivian diplomat Robert Calzadilla.
Many Bolivian citizens across the country will be watching the announcement of the TTT on large screens, hoping that the Hague Tribunal will make a positive decision on the Bolivian complaint, with Chile obliged to negotiate the Bolivian State's access to the sea.
Mr Evo Morales, the charismatic President of Bolivia, who is awaiting a counter-party election fight for re-election, and who is very interested in the end of the day's decision.
“We are very close to the opportunity to return to the Pacific, ” he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts tend to believe that it is unlikely that the court will rule in favour of Bolivia – even if it were taken, little would change.
A UN body based in the Netherlands has no power to demarcate the territory of Chile and indicated that it will not identify possible results of the negotiations.
The fact that the TTT judgment will only be delivered six months after the last arguments have been heard shows hardly that the case was “uncomplicated” – said Paz Zárate, an expert in international law in Chile.
And even if Bolivia managed to take some step back, the last four years could block her back.
“This issue of sea access was unlawfully raised by the current Bolivian administration,” said Zárate.
She believes that any remnants of good will in Chile have been destroyed by the avenger rhetoric of Morales.
Bolivia and Chile will sometime continue the conversation, but after all it will be extremely difficult to discuss it.
The country has not changed its ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Mr Rodríguez Veltzé, a representative of Bolivia in The Hague, opposed the idea that the judgment was given unusually quickly.
“On Monday, Bolivia will have an exceptional opportunity to start a new relationship with Chile and to put an end to the 139-year disagreements in mutual benefit,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales is still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America and uses the maritime issue as a political manipulation.
‘Bolivia will never promise to have access to the Pacific,’ he added.
\"The decision is an opportunity to see that we have to deal with the past \"
North Korea states that nuclear disarmament is only possible if it can rely on the US
Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea Ri Yong Ho assures that his people will never give up nuclear weapons first if they cannot trust Washington.
Ms Ri, spoke at the General Assembly of the United Nations on Saturday.
He urged the United States to follow its promises at a meeting held in Singapore, which were agreed by the leaders of the rival countries.
His comments were made at a time when the Secretary of State, Mike Pompe, seemed to have been planning to renew the brutal nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the meeting with Kim Jong Unu Singapore.
Ri says that “the inner dream ” is that by continuing sanctions, the US would be able to squander at some time when the declaration on the end of the Korean war would end up in North Korea.
Washington avoids supporting the declaration if Pyongyang does not, first of all, act as a convincing means of disarmament.
And Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to hold a second meeting.
But the widespread sceptical opinion that Pyongyang is not serious about giving up the arsenal that the country seems to see as its only security guarantor.
Pompeo is going to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare the ground for the second meeting of Kim and Trump.
The Paris fashion show has revealed that the latest trend is massive headgear, and they will soon conquer the nearest fashionable shops.
If you want to complete your hat collection or fully protect yourself from the sun, this trend is just for you.
The designers Valentino and Thomas Brown in their 2019 spring and summer collections presented a wide range of eccentricly large headbands, and he in his style simply shocked the spectators of the Paris fashion week.
These extremely unpractical hats this summer conquered the social network \"Instagram\" and these designers presented their eye-catching works on the podium.
The distinctive work of Valentinas was a large hat of body color decorated with a wide face, a colour-like edge, enveloping the head of the manikin.
Other accessories of non-standard size were precious watermelons, a hat of the magician and even pineapple – but they were not created to protect your head from cold.
Thomas Browne also presented a strange mask collection at the same time to Halloween.
Many colorful masks were with their lips and reminded Hannibal Lecter more than the high fashion.
One of the works looked like a cage suit, a tube, and underwater glasses, and the other reminded of a purged ice brush.
And if you follow this huge trend in fashion, you will not be surprised.
Stylius experts predict that these huge covers can enter the shops.
The big hats became popular yet with “La Bomba,” and the water hats were worn with the two-foot edges by everyone – from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The creative trademark, which has created extremely impractical hats that have conquered all social networks, has released another huge work on the podium – a straw beach basket, almost the same size as the manikin carrying a bathing costume.
The red brick color raffia basket, decorated with raffia cubes and a white leather handle, became the exclusive collection of Jacquemus “La Riviera SS19” accent of Paris on the week of fashion.
FEMAIL, a celebrity stylist at Luke’s Armitage, said: “I think the next summer a lot of hats and beach baskets are going to store, because the designer has had such a great impact, so it would be difficult to ignore the need for non-standard size accessories to be used in

Scotlandn independent schools improved their record of academic achievements, not losing out in 2018, and once again demonstrated their exceptional exam results, which were further reinforced by individual and collective achievements in sports, art, music and other community merit.
When more than 30 000 pupils are enrolled throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the SCIS, seek to provide their pupils and their parents with the highest possible service.
Independent schools seek to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen career, and to be world’s citizens.
Working in an educational sector that can develop and implement the planned school scheme, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and are willing to meet in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you are able to talk to a person in a language that he understands, he will understand you.
If you talk to him in his own speech, you will talk to him about his heart.
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to sweat relationships and build confidence in people from other countries.
According to the results of the recent exams this year, we can say that languages are at the top of popularity and in independent schools with the best maintenance ratings.
A total of 68 percent of foreign language students received the highest score A.
Data collected from 74 schools that are members of SCIS show that 72 percent of students received the highest assessment A during the Mandarins Language Exam, 72 percent of those who studied German, and 69 percent of those who studied French and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish.
This shows that an independent school in Scotland considers the knowledge of foreign languages to be an essential skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages as a choice are now seen as important as key issues in independent school curricula and elsewhere (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
According to a survey carried out by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014, 17 percent of all the reasons for employers’ difficulties in filling jobs were found to be insufficient language skills.
As a result, linguistic skills are becoming increasingly mandatory in order for young people to be prepared for their future careers.
As future employment opportunities depend heavily on languages, these skills are becoming essential in a globalised world.
No matter what career a person would choose in teaching a second language, it will be much better than others in the future if they have these lifelong skills.
By being able to communicate directly with people from abroad, people who learn several languages will be much more competitive.
According to a survey conducted by youGov from 2013, involving more than 4 000 adults in the UK, 75 percent were unable to speak the foreign language well enough to be present and the French language was the only language spoken by two significant percentages of people, which is 15 percent.
That is why investing in language teaching is important for children of today.
By learning several languages, especially in developing countries, children will have better opportunities for meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school differs according to the languages they teach.
Many schools focus on more classic modern languages, while others teach languages considered key to the United Kingdom in view of the future of 2020, such as Mandarins or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of your child, there will always be a lot of languages available in an independent school with teaching staff and specialists in this field.
Scotlandn independent schools are ready to develop a training environment that will equip children and provide them with the skills they need to live in the future.
In today's global business environment, languages remain vital to the future of the country, and this must also be reflected in the education system.
Indeed, modern languages should certainly be considered as ‘international communication skills’
Independent schools will continue to offer this option of choice, diversity and results for the Scottish youth.
This has to be done.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will open the debut on Sunday at San Diego
There is little waiting for fans to see LeBron James start the season in Los Angeles-Lakers.
“Lakers, trainer Luke Walton announced that James will play at the Sunday season opening events with Denver-Nuggets-San Diego.
But how exactly you play for minutes is still unclear.
“It will be more than one and less than 48 minutes,” said Walton on the official-Lakers-website.
“Lakers, a reporter in the Mike Trudella-Twitter account, said that James is likely to play for a limited time.
Earlier this week James was asked about the plans “Lakers ” in the team during six preseasonal matches.
“At this stage of my career, I no longer need preseason matches to get ready, ” he said.
Short talk in West Virginia, YouTube
President Donald Trump starts his campaign tonight in Viling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five planned Short Languages next week, including pauses in friendly areas such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
When voting on the suspension procedure, Trump seeks to mobilise its support in the forthcoming mid-elections because the Republicans were threatened by the loss of control in Congress in November by voting on the suspension procedure.
A few hours tonight will be a Short Language in West Virginia and how will it be monitored online?
Short speech in Viling, West Virginia, scheduled for 19:00 Eastern time in the evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018
You can watch the Short Language on the West Virginia Internet at YouTube+
Briefly, this week's candidate for the Supreme Court, Bretto Kavanaugh, is likely to be affected because of the stress on suspicions of inappropriate sexual behaviour, when the Senate voted for the suspension of the candidate's submission for a period of one week until the FBI is conducting an investigation.
But the most important aim of this campaign is to help the Republicans to gain some strength in the coming November elections.
Hence President Trump's campaign states that the aim of these five meetings next week, as announced by the Reuters, is “to generate energy for volunteers and supporters who try to defend and extend to the majority of the people they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives.
\"Congressive control is so important on his agenda that the President will travel to as many states as possible because the campaign season begins very hot,\" said the Short Campaign Representative, who would not want to reveal his name.
“Wiling-Wesbanco is scheduled for tonight’s speech to attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract the media from Pittsberg,” states West Virginia-Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump's second time in the last month will visit West Virginia, the state where he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
A brief attempt is made to help Western Virginia candidate for the Senate, the Republican Patrick Morrisey, who, according to the polls, is in the lowlands of ratings.
“It’s not a good sign to Morrisey that the president had to come to get him to the top of the ratings, ” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, who reported “Reuters ”
2018 \"Ryder\" Cup tournament: U.S. team are in a war and hopes to get to the Sunday unit matches
After three personal stages on Saturday afternoon fours can be just what was needed during this “Ryder ” Cup tournament.
Such a shift in success is completely fictional, but players really believe it, especially in events like this.
So what side of it is a success now?
“They came first with six points, and now, at four points, so, I guess we can keep it a little bit of a success, ” said Jordan Spythes, preparing for the day.
Of course, Europe is the leader, has a four-point horizon and is still waiting for twelve matches.
The American enthusiasm, according to Spyth, has waned, and they don't lack it, not to mention the shape of Spyth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long and each one collected three points out of four.
Spythes were insurmountable from beginning to end and a flawless leader.
These wild victories continued to be known to the round. Thomas scored two points from two possible points to complete the fourth match.
His blow, which won't win in this macho at the 15th hole, was accompanied by similar slogans that, as it were said, the end of the American team is not yet going.
“You just have to concentrate and take care of your matches, ” said Spiethas.
Now each of these players has been played separately.
To the successful end – 18 holes.
The only players who have collected more points for Spieth and Thomas in the last few days are Francesco Molinaris and Tommy Fleetwoods, the story of “Ryder” is undisputed.
Strange but charming couple from Europe have collected four points out of four possible and can be calm.
“Moliwood ” was the only couple whose extra blows were not only on Saturday afternoon, but also on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and Friday morning.
That course of events and the boutling audience's reaction only confirm that they will be the players who win on Sunday, and no one else will be able to achieve such popularity as the Fleetwood or Molinari, who, when they are last set-up in the «Le Golf National» field, have the chance to achieve a European victory.
It would be good for the different wells to succeed both at the same time.
Although it is too early to talk about the glory of Europe.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson briefly played with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the eastern four balls when he was paired with Alex Noren.
An extra impact and two double additional strokes during the first nine wells series pushed the Spanish and Swedish into a trouble from which they did not succeed.
However, no one will get out of trouble on Sunday.
The four balls and four-pined wallets are so interesting to observe due to the interaction between couples, the advice they give and what they do and the fact that the strategy can change instantly.
Europe was better played as a team, so it came to the finals with decisive leadership, but this four-stage has also shown that the US team has a fighter spine that some, especially in the states, had doubts.
On the last day of the race, Europe’s leader is 10:6 on the Day of the Cup.
Europe’s last “Ryder” Cup Day will meet with a strong horizon, starting after a Saturday quadrennial before the results of the United States 10:6.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari duo continued to heat the atmosphere by winning two victories against the hard fighter Woods and led to Le Golf National to lead it at four points.
Thomas Bjorne's European side, in order to preserve the trophy that had been lost by Hazeltine two years ago, dominated by morning four-year-old matchers before the unsuccessful American side and completed the stage of the score 3:1.
The U.S. have demonstrated more resistance in four pieces, when they won two wallets but failed to overcome the score curves
Jimo Furykas needs eight points from the 12 huts on Sunday to keep trophy in his hands.
Fleetwood is the first newcomer in Europe who succeeded in winning four points in a row when together with Molinari duplicated “Molliwood” after the sensational weekend, and they are only the second couple who won four points through their first four match “Ryder” cup in the history of competitions.
After overcoming Woods and Patrick Reed in four pieces, they flawlessly undermined the confidence of the lost Woods and the American rookie Bryson Dechambeu even better result in 5:4.
Woods, after having finally overcome two Saturday Mayas, at some points showed a high level of professionalism, but had already lost 19 and 29 of their Mayes in the fours, seven of them in a row.
Justinas Rose’s morning rested and returned to play with a partner Henrik Stansons in four pieces; they scored 2/1 Dustin Johnson and Broxe Coepk, who took the first and third places in world ratings.
Despite the pleasant, mild wind - depressing day in the southwestern part of Paris, Europe has not been in butter.
Three times the winner Jordan Spiethas and Justin Thomas raised the American cartel, winning two points on Saturday.
In the match of the four balls they won the uncomplicated victory of the result 2:1 against Spanish John Rahm and Ian Poulter, while in four-thoused macho they overcome Poulter and Rory McIllroy's score 4:3, without the ball to the first two wells.
Only twice “Ryder, a cup in history, has the team been able to score four points in a single match, even though Furyk’s side would have enough equal to keep the trophy.
Although two days were in the second place, on Sunday success seems to have subsided.
North Korea says that it will not be bothered unilaterally, unable to trust
The North Korean Foreign Minister stated on Saturday to the United Nations that the sanctions continued to deepen their mistrust with the United States and that, in such circumstances, the country would not give up nuclear weapons unilaterally.
The General Assembly of the Ri Yong Ho World Organization said that North Korea has taken “a great measure of goodwill in recent years, such as halting the nuclear missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test base and undertaking not to distribute nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“However, we did not have a similar response from the US side. ”
\"We will not be able to rely on our own national security without any trust in the US, and under such circumstances we will in no way be the first unilaterally to disarm\"
As long as Ri repeated North Korea's already heard complaints about Washington's opposition to the ethic approach to nuclear disarmament, according to which North Korea would be rewarded during the steps of its action, his statement was divided in the way that he did not completely reject the idea of bilateral disarmament, as Pyongyang did earlier.
Rim referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Unas and Donald Trump at the first US President-Nordic Leader meeting in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim agreed to work on “The disarmament of the Korean Peninsula” and Trump promised North Korea security.
North Korea is achieving a formal end to the Korean War between 1950 and 53, but the United States says that Pyongyang must first abandon his nuclear weapons.
Washington also refuses to relax strong international sanctions against North Korea.
\"The U.S. is demanding nuclear disarmament first and increasing the pressure of sanctions to achieve its objective by coerced methods, even by abandoning the declaration on the end of the war,\" said Ri.
“Think that we can be knocked down by sanctions is the same as being a child of utopian dreams to people we don’t care about.
But the problem is, the continuing sanctions exacerbate our mistrust...
Ri did not mention plans for the second Kim and Trump meeting, which was underlined by the US leader in the United Nations a little earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim's and South Korea's leader Moon Jae-in over the last five months: \"If the other country were South Korea on this issue of nuclear disarmament, it would not have raised the issue of nuclear disarmament in the US, the Korean Peninsula.
However, the tone of Ri’s speech changed dramatically compared to the last year when he said to the UN General Assembly that “the President of the Blog, Trump, called Kim, a child of the missiles, was absolutely inevitable to direct North Korea’s missile to the US.
This year, in the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to “prevent completely ” North Korea last year, snorted her appreciation for the courage of the Commission to take steps towards disarmament, but stated that much remains to be done and that sanctions should continue until North Korea has complied with its nuclear disarmament requirements.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had not set a timetable for this, and said that “if it takes two years, three years or five months, it would not be
China and Russia claimed that the UN Security Council should repay Pyongyang for its actions.
However, U.S. Secretary of State, Mike-Pomeo to the UN Security Council on Thursday, stated that “The Council of Security sanctions must continue decisively, without any concessions, until a complete nuclear disarmament confirmed by evidence has been completed”
The Security Council supported the sanctions in North Korea with all votes since 2006 to prevent the funding of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with the backstages of the United Nations General Assembly and later said that he would return to Pyongyang the next month to wash the soil for the next meeting.
Pompey has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip was a failure.
In July, he left Pyongyang, saying that all progress had been made only to declare North Korea after a few hours that he had made “Gangsterical demands ”
North Korea has promised this month, at a meeting with Moon, to dismantle the missile base and nuclear complex if the United States takes \"appropriate measures\" to:
According to him, Kim argued that the “relevant measures ” he sought are the security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore, and that the shift towards a normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn enough to rest
New course at Harvard University this year encouraged all their students to sleep more in order to combat the growing culture of mach in studies, using caffeine and not sleeping at night
One academician found that students in the world’s best university often do not have basic knowledge of how to take care of themselves.
Charles’s Czeisler, Harvard Medical School sleep medical professor and Brigam City, a woman’s hospital specialist, developed a course that, according to him, is the first of its kind in the United States.
The inspiration to prepare this course visited him after talking about the effect of sleeplessness on learning.
“ At the end of the talk, one girl came to me and said: “Why is this just being said about now, in the last year of the study ”
She said that no one had told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me.
The course is first offered this year. It explains to students how the most important quality sleep habits contribute to academic and sporting outcomes, and improve overall well-being.
Mr Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard School of Medicine and Executive Director of the Health Services Department of the University, said that the university decided to offer this course at a time when it became clear that students lack sleep in a week.
The hour course shall cover the series of interactive tasks.
In one section is a photo of the hotel room, where students can click coffee cup, curtains, simulators and books to learn about caffeine, the effects of light, how lack of sleep affects sports results and how important to go to sleep.
In the next section, participants learn how long-term sleeplessness may increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of students' town with interactive icons, where participants are encouraged to think about their daily routine.
\"We guarantee that this will not change the behaviour of students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know about the health consequences of your choice for smoking – explains Professor Czeisler.
The pride culture does not sleep overnight, according to him, still exists. Modern technology and ever increasing pressure on students have led to growing problems of sleep shortages.
“To ensure enough and quality of sleep, students should have a secret weapon to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, ” he said, “even avoiding weight gain, because sleep deprivation turns the brain into a fasting regime, so students constantly feel hungry and hungry.
Raymond So, a 19 - year - old Californiaian who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to prepare a course when he attended one of the subjects he taught last year in Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to ask for a course available to the entire town of students.
He hopes that the next step will be to invite all second-stage students to listen to this course before attending this competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set a alarm, when it is time to go to sleep, just like the rising, and protect the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic devices and light diode lighting, as they can blow your circadian rhythm from balance, making it difficult to sleep.
‘Livingston 1:0-Rangers: The victory of the art has upset the men of Gerrard.
“Rangers ” experienced another disappointment when Dolly Men in Livingstone succeeded in overcoming the weakened result of Steve Gerrard 1:0.
“Ibrox was hoping to earn his first victory on the trip after the February triumph result of 4:1 “St Johnston” but Gary Holt’s team over Gerards for the second time at the 18th Game Leader’s post, and now the latter team is eight points behind the faraway Prime Minister’s leaders Hearts.
The Menga beat up seven minutes before the break, but the Rangers, without inspiration, did not see the opportunity to level the result.
“Rangers, now down to the sixth, “Livingston,” went up to the third and then got behind Hibernian.
The “Rangers ” does not end the trouble, since it is likely that the object of the three - story butter hit Calm Spence in his head and wounded him.
Gerrard made four changes that allowed it to go over to the Irish and led to the Betfred, a semi-finals cup.
On the other hand, Holt trusted in the same eleven who took a point from Hearts last week and would have liked his well - thought combinations to gather opponents in every step.
“Ranger, a dominant player in controlling the ball, but with it Livingston, he did more.
They could beat up for the second minute, when Menga gave the ball a close hit towards Scott Pittman at allan McGregor's door, which was raging, but the safety has broken his chance of turning the ball away from the gate.
After the distant free shock ball of Keaghan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his lawyer defender Alan Lithgow asked for it.
“Rangers ” took control, but the last third of the matches was only hopeful, not faith in their games.
For 15 minutes, Alfred Moreelos found himself worthy of a fine when he faced Steven Lawless, but the judge Steven Thomson took his hand to Colombian.
“Rangers, in the first chair, managed to hit only twice, but the former Ibrox gateman Liam Kelly was hardly frightened by the head of Lassana Coulibaly or the gentle humiliation of Ovie Ejaria.
Although “Livi, the 34th minute of the race might not correspond to the course of the match, no one would argue that they deserve it for their own effort.
“Rangers ” failed again to overcome the oscillation of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher transferred the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his self-name and gave Menga a light ending.
During a break Gerrard took action to replace Coulibally to Ryan Kent, and this change almost immediately gave fruit when the country guarded Morelios, but the impressively admired Kelly came back to shock.
“Livingston” involved guests in the game they loved – with distant transfers of the Lithgow and Halkett Ball.
The Holocaust team at the end was able to increase its weights, but McGregor defended from Jacobs' impact after giving Lithgows a hand in the corner.
At the end of the game, Glenn Middleleton once again appealed against the fine after the conflict with Jacobs, but Thomson ignored it again.
Almanach: Inventor of the Geiger Meter
Today, on September 30, 1882, it was 136 years ago, and I was older... that day, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm (Hans) Geiger was born in Germany.
The geler invented a method to detect and measure radioactivity. The invention by which the device was later developed, known as the Guier's counter.
Since then, this device has become the hit of the scientific world, and later the popular culture hit, when the 1950s film Bells of Coronado plays cowboys not very similar to those of Roy-us Rogers and Dale-Evans:
Male: “What the hell is this ”

A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to develop bad cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to develop and kill bad cells
The vaccine has taught the immune system to recognise the bad cells – this is part of the treatment
The technique involves recovering immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory.
Then the cells can “see ” proteins that are common in many cancers and are re-injected
The vaccine has given promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
For one woman treated with this vaccine who teaches the immune system to recognise bad cells, ovarian cancer has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The technique involves recovering immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory, and then the cells can see proteins specific to HER2 cancers and are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.
HER2 promotes the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovaries, lungs, and rectums, and explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar attitude was successfully applied to the treatment of leukaemia when the immune cells were extracted from patients and cultured into cancer cells.

He's free.
But we are free, too. ” She was added.
Prior to the show, Twitter has announced in his account that the name has changed and that he is now formally known as Kanye West.

“The Capitol War - Star Next Harington criticises a distorted attitude toward manhood
Harington became famous as the sword-boning character John Snau in the fantastic adventure series about the Middle Ages – The Host Wars --
But the 31-year-old actor criticises the stereotype of the macho hero. He says that such roles on the screen often make young boys feel as if they should be cool to be respected.
Speaking of “Sundy Times Culture, the other said that he felt that “something is wrong ” and asked how to tackle the problem of distorted masculinity in #MeToa.
Another, who recently married a 31 - year - old colleague named Rose Leslie, a star of the “Sports Wars, ” admitted that this topic was “extremely touching ”
“I feel that this is a topic that matters to me now. Where we made a mistake in raising masculinity, ” he listened.
“ What we teach grown men to face such problems ”
Another believes that, in part, this distorted masculinity could lead to TV being responsible for creating very male characters.
He added: “Who is innate, but what is taught?
What are some of these taught on television or on the street that young people believe that they should be of this type?
I think it is one of the important issues of our times, and how can we change this?
We made a mistake somewhere with the young men --

HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% in new cases
China reports that 14 % of citizens infected with HIV and AIDS have increased.
According to the health authorities, more than 820 000 people were infected with infection in the country.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most newly infected people have been transmitted through the sexual route, which is different from the statistics of the past.
Traditionally, HIV infection was rapidly spread in some parts of China due to blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV has fallen to almost zero, according to the Chinese health authorities at the conference in the province of Junan.
Over time, however, the number of people living with HIV infection and AIDS increased to 100,000 in China.
The transmission of HIV through sexual transmission is a sensitive issue in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality in China was decriminalized as far back as 1997, but discrimination against LGBT individuals is widespread.
Because of the conservative values in the country, between 70% and 90% of men who have sex with men are ultimately female.
Most cases of this disease occur because of inadequate protective measures in such sexual relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to anti-HIV medicines as one of the ways to tackle this problem.
Maxine Waters denies that the workers have run the data of the Republican Senator, condemns - dangerous lies - and - conspiracy theories -
On Saturday, US Representative Maxine Waters denied the suspicion that one of its employees published the personal information of three Republican senators on the pages of the legislators Wikipedia.
L. Angelo Democrat believed that the accusations were made by ultra-right wing experts and websites.
“Mall, lies and once again hateful lies ” said Waters in his Twitter account.
U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham, from South Carolina and Mike-Lee and Orrin Hatcho, both of U.S.A., had home addresses and phone numbers.
The online information appeared on Thursday, it was published by an unknown person from the Capitol Hill at the time when the Senate examined the accusations of improper sexual behaviour against Brittas Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court.
The information leaked appeared a little later when these three senators asked the Kavanaughu questions.
‘On Conservative sites, such as ‘Gateway Pundit’ and ‘RedState’, it was reported that the IP address for which the source of these records related to the Waters Office had been identified and that the information of the Waters worker’s member was disclosed Ö reported from the Capitol.
“These unwarranted suspicions are completely false and absolute lies ” continued Waters.
\"My staff member, whose identity, personal information and security have been affected by these fraudulent and false suspicions, is in no way liable for any leakage of this information.
These unwarranted suspicions are completely false and absolute lies -
Waters' statement quickly received criticism on the Internet, as well as from the former representative of the White House in the press of Ari Fleischer.
“This denial sounds evil ” wrote Fleischer.
“It is said that it has insufficient autonomy to be a member of the Congress.
If someone is accused of things he has not done, he should not be angry.
He should not defend himself.
He should not question the motives of the accused.
It should be calm and humble
It seems that Fleischer tried to compare the reaction of Waters with the democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too angry at the Thursday sitting.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, participating in the mid-election campaign to replace Waters, also expressed his thoughts in the Twitter report.
“ True, if not a lie, ” he wrote.
In their statement, Waters claimed that its Bureau had informed the relevant authorities and enforcement bodies about these false accusations.
“We will ensure that the organisers are clarified, ” she said, “that they continue to be legally responsible for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous for all my employees without exception.
Comedy-Jonis Inglišas is smog again. Review – exhaled spy show with Rowan Atkinson
The same seems to be true with regard to the revitalization of the actions of the comedy of spy “Jonius Inglišas” – “Jonis Inglišas” started in 2003 and returned back to the screens with the comedy “Jonius Ingliša Resurrection” in 2011
Is this sarcastic car becoming a new national export option, as we have obviously lost ourselves?
In any case, the incompetent John Ingliša has a second chance to bring uncomplicated justice to the surface, even though the title clearly indicates that this work is intended for non-English kinematograph regions.
Of course, this stupid secret agent, who, despite having a luxury claim, has also acquired some of the characteristics of the inspector Clouseau, a little likeness to Mr Byno's features and a shell to that guy, a hint of which was used during the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games for the creation of the drama-Ugiles theme.
It is also a bit based on the character of a traveler and a mysterious man who has caused chaos, once played by Atkinson in the now forgotten “Barclaycard TV ” advertising.
This latest film by John Ingliša contains several beautiful moments.
I liked John Ingliša when he came to the helicopter by wearing a medieval suit and armor, and the men ’s rotor hit his helmet.
The Comedic Atkinson talent is obvious, but humor itself seems breathless and strangely excessive, especially when serious brands of film, such as 007 and “Mission is impossible, it is also dangerous to insert the elements of comedy.
Humor is as if it were more for children than adults, and the adventures of John Ingliša that I did not believe do not seem as ingenious and peaceful as Atkinson's quiet laughter by playing Mr. Byna.
The most common issue now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
The cyber hacker successfully broke into the British highly secret Internet of spyes and revealed the identities of all British spyes in this area, causing the agent to be offended by the excessive role of Kevin Eldon.
This is the last drop in the cup of the Prime Minister, the pompous and speckled character who is already suffering from a stunting political unpopularity: Emma Thompson from Teresa May's depicting character clicks everything he can but the scenario of a good material for a few.
Wise advisors inform her that the identity of all its agents has been revealed and that it will have to look for people who have retired.
This means that John Ingliša, who is currently the director of the school, will have to go to some form of a small institution, but he will have to provide illegal lessons on how to work as a secret agent. There were several good laughters when Ingliša proposed the “School of Rock ” type spying.
Inglysh is sent back to Wythol to discuss the emergency and there agrees for a long time with his common Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
A man who is now married to a submarine master, while the talent of Vicki Pepperdine, a girl of the highland, seems underexploitable.
So Batman and Robin, who are able to mix matters with her Majesty in the secret ministry, are taking steps again and meet Olga Kurylenka, a falsian beauty of Ofelia Buletova.
Prime Minister’s head is seriously crushed down by the charismatic billionaire, claiming that he can solve the British computer problem, i.e. the evil Jason Volt, which is played by Jake - Lacy.
Inglysh and Bough begin their odysée: once ready for the waiters, they cause a fire in the French restaurant, causing chaos in the luxury Volta yacht and Ingliša begins a complete anarchy, trying to use the headphones of virtual reality to get to know the interior of the Volta house.
All the crackers were clear on this final series, but whatever it is kind or wild, all of this is much like a children’s television.
It's quite moderate.
How about the rest of Johnny Ingliša's movies, I could not get rid of the idea: the British film industry is not able to give Rowan Atkinson a role that would be worth his talent?
Labour Party denies the development of a British plan for work four days a week, but that would be paid for five days
The Jeremy Corbyn Labour Party plans to consider a radical plan that would allow the British to work four days a week, but that would pay compensation for five days.
It is reported that a party wants company leaders to share savings accumulated as a result of the intellectual intelligence (DI) revolution in providing their employees with one free day.
This would allow employees to enjoy the three-day weekend and to bring the same amount of pay together at home.
The source says that this idea is in line with the party's economic agenda and plans to shift the country's development towards a job-friendly path.
The transition to the four-day week was also welcomed by the Trade Union Congress as a way of taking advantage of the changing economy for workers.
One of the high-level leiborist party sources, The Sunday Times, said: “The review of the political provisions is expected to be published by the end of the year.
This will not happen overnight, but is in line with the party's approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as the overall strategy of the party's industry, by four working days' week.
The Labour Party is not the first to promote this idea; the Green Party also promised a campaign of general elections in 2017 on four working days a week.
However, the entire Labour Party is not currently in favour of this idea.
Leiborist party representative said: “The four-week working week is not a party policy and the party does not consider it.
Mr McDonnell, representative of the shadow government, took the opportunity to present his vision on the social revolution in the economy at the Labour Party Conference last week.
Mr McDonnell claimed that he is determined to regain power from “the faceless dictators ” and profit hunters in utilities.
Such shadow plans also mean that current shareholders of water companies may not recover all their share because, if they see the hurt done, the Labour Government may deduct something.
It also approved plans to involve employees in the company's board and to create inclusive equity funds so that 10% of the private sector's capital could be transferred to employees and could receive up to GBP 500 per year dividends.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy answered to the ‘60 Minutes’ question whether the FBI investigation concerning Kavanaugho could change their opinion.
During an investigation into the allegations against the judge, Mr Kavanaughu, the FBI postponed the final vote for at least one week, or his appointment to the Supreme Court, and the question arises as to whether the facts interpreted by the investigating office could affect the opinion of the senators of some Republicans in such a way that they did not devalue the judge.
On Sunday, the correspondent Scott Pelley asked senators John Kennedy and Lindsee Grahamo, who had an interview on the television, or might happen to the FBI to find out something that would change their opinion.
Senator Kennedy seems to be taking a more liberal approach than his South Carolina colleague.
\"Well, yes, of course, - responds to Mr Kennedy.
“As I said when I went to the sitting, I talked to Judge Kavanaughu.
When that happened when these charges came to light, I called him and asked him: “Do you do so?
He responded in a bold, firm, unambiguous manner.
So Mr Graham's opinion seems to be no change.
“I’ve made a decision on Bretto Kavanaugh, and I would need real shocking accusations, ” he says.
“For Dr. Ford – I don’t know what was there, but I know one: Brett dissents it strictly, ” added Mr. Graham, bearing in mind Christine Blasey Ford.
‘No one designated may confirm this.
It's been 36 years.
I don't think anything new will come up.
What is the World People's Festival and does it in any way contribute to poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will host the World Citizens' Festival, an annual music event with an impressive number of stars and an ambitious goal of eradicating poverty in the world.
For the seventh year already, the World Civil Festival of the Great Park will meet tens of thousands who will not only listen to stars such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawna Mendes, but will also spread the message about the real goal of the event to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
The World People's Festival was held in 2012. It is a follow-up to the World Platform against Poverty, an international mediation group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people fighting against it actively.
In order to get a free ticket to an event (never they wanted to buy a paid VIP ticket), the concert visitors had to carry out various tasks or actions, such as volunteering activities, sending an email to a world leader, calling a phone or any other meaningful help to raise awareness of their goal of eliminating poverty.
However, are the citizens of the world successfully achieving this goal? 12 years have passed by the deadline.
Will the idea to reward people with a free concert really convince them to demand and encourage them to act? Maybe this is just another example of so-called cliktyism, fictitious activism – people think that they will really change the situation by signing an online petition or publishing an entry on the Twitter network.
Since 2011, more than 19 million of its supporters have registered the movement, according to the organisers of the World People's Festival, which promotes a wide range of objectives.
They say that, under pressure from these actions, world leaders have declared USD 37 billion of commitments and policies to change the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, this group identified 390 commitments and statements triggered by the group's actions, of which at least USD 10 billion has already been paid or collected.
According to the group, almost 649 million people around the world are already directly affected by the funds provided.
Some key commitments include “The Power of Nutrition” – a partnership between investors and operators operating in the United Kingdom to “help children grow and discover all their opportunities – With more than 4,700 citizens of the world called Twitter, it promised to give Rwanda US dollars to help solve nutrition shortages in the country.
“With the support of the British Government, supporters, national governments and people like you, the world’s citizens, we can make social injustices like a diet failure into the past,” said “Mr Tracey Ullman, the Ambassador of the Mission in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that, after receiving 5 000 requests to improve the nutrition of mothers and children in the United Kingdom, the government announced that funding for the project ‘ Nutritional Capacity’ would reach 5 million women and children through nutritional interventions.
Answering one of the FAQs on our site, why do you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?
The world’s citizens respond: “This is a long and difficult road, and sometimes we will stumble and fail.
However, like the great movements for human rights and against apartheid, we will win, for together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, “The Weeknd – Shawnas Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe – are some of the performers involved in this year’s event in New York. The event will take place in Deborra-Lee Furness and Hughas Jackman.
According to the Secretary of the Interior, the US can use the fleet in blockades to prevent Russian exports of energy
“If necessary, Washington can use the fleet to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, as well as the Middle East markets,” says Ryan Zinke, US Home Affairs Secretary, says the “Washington Examiner”
Mr Zinke claims that Russia's participation in Syria, especially when it operates at the invitation of the legitimate authorities, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I think Russia interferes with the Middle East because Russia wants to regulate the area of energy, just as it does in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe,” said R. Zinke.
According to the official, there are ways and means to resolve this issue.
“The United States can do so through the fleet, can make sure that the waterways are open and, if necessary, can run a blockade, make sure that their energy does not reach the market,” he said.
Mr Zinke said this to the participants in the event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group called the US-energy consumer voice.
He then compared Washington’s methods with those applied to the issues concerning Russia and Iran and noted that they were essentially identical.
\"The Irish and Russian economic alternative is to find more or less a counterweight to replace fuel,\" he said and also called Russia a country that depends solely on fossil fuels.
These statements have appeared in the short administration of the mission to increase its exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe and to replace Russia with a market offering a much cheaper opportunity for European consumers.
Therefore, Mr Trump's officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the somewhat inappropriate project of the Nord Stream 2-3 pipeline, which, according to D. Trump, made Berlin a prisoner of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2-5 pipeline, which will double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is just an economic project.
According to Cremlius, the exact reason why Washington is opposed to this project is purely economic, which is an example of unfair competition.
\"I think we all agree that energy cannot be a means of pressure and that consumers must have the opportunity to choose their suppliers,\" said Alexander Novak, Russian Minister of Energy, following a meeting with U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position received a hostile reaction from Germany and reaffirmed its determination to continue the project.
The main German industrial organisation, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), called on the US not to intervene in the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I do not really agree with the third country's energy-supply intervention, ” said Dieter Kempf, Head of the German Federation of Industry (BDI), following the recent meeting between Angela Merkel and the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren says that there is a serious debate on the possibility of his candidacy during the Presidential elections in 2020
On Saturday, Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said that he would seriously discuss the issue of presidential candidate after the mid-term election.
During the meeting at the Holjoko Hall in Massachusettse E. Warren confirmed the possibility of a candidate being considered.
“The time for women to go to Washington to manage our failed powers must also go to the highest post, ” she said in the town hall.
\"On 6 November, I shall seriously consider whether or not to participate in the Presidential elections.\"
During the meeting at the town hall, Mrs Warren called on President Donald Trump, saying that he led the country in the wrong direction.
“I am very afraid of the way Donald Trump treats our democracy, ” she said.
Mrs Warren openly criticises Mr Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Britta Kavanaugha.
Ms Warren, who was published on Friday’s Twitter magazine, says that: “Unforeseeablely, the FBI study must be carried out before the vote.
A poll published on Thursday, however, shows that most of Mrs Warren's national voters themselves believe that it should not be presidential candidate in 2020.
According to a survey conducted by the Political Research Centre of the University of Safolk and the Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of the expected Massachusetts voters say that the senator should not participate in the elections.
Thirty-two percent support her candidacy.
The survey showed that former Governor Deval Patrik – 38 percent support his possible candidacy and 48 percent opposes him.
Other names discussed for possible candidates were Joe Biden, former Vice President and Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
J. Biden says that the formal decision would be taken in January, as reported by “Associated Press”
At a brief meeting in Donald Palin spoke about a post-traumatic disorder of Tracco Palina
The 26 - year - old Track Palin spent a year in Iraq when he was in military service in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and accused of being an incident of domestic violence.
“I see what my son is experiencing when he comes back to life, so I understand other families who feel the consequences of a post-traumatic disorder and some of the injuries that our soldiers are coming back with, ” she said to the meeting of Donald Trump in Tals, Oklahoma.
She said that the son and the other soldiers “returned a little change, they return to a more solid heart, they return to doubt whether they will be respectful for what their fellow soldiers and pilots have done, and all the other soldiers have opened their country...
He was arrested on Monday in Vasila, Alaska, in charge of domestic violence and violence against women, as well as indictments to prevent family violence from being reported with a gun and in the face of a treacherous state, as reported by Dan Bennett, a representative of the Vasila Police Department.
18 states and Colombian County supports resistance to the new asylum policy
The 18 regions of the states and Colombia support the legal challenge of a new US policy that refuses to provide asylum to the victims of the successive violence of gangs or domestic violence.
On Friday, in Washington DC, 18 state and local representatives submitted amicus curiae’s comments to support the challenge of asylum seekers’ policy.
The applicant’s full name in the Grace v Sessions, which was initiated by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy, is not disclosed.
She says that her partner, “and members of his criminal gang, ” was violently abused against her, but on July 20 U.S. officials rejected her application for asylum.
She was detained in Texas.
State lawyers in Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which the US receives many asylum applications, as states, which are being undermined by the constant problems of domestic violence and domestic violence of gangs.
The new U.S. asylum policy repealed the decision of the Immigration Appeal Council of 2014, which allowed non-documentary immigrants who remained in the family to apply for asylum.
On Friday, in a report by the Regional Prosecutor General of Colombia, Karl Racine said that the new policy was not in line with the national, federal and international laws in force for decades.
‘The federal law requires decisions on asylum applications to be taken in the light of specific facts and circumstances of the application, in which the principle is violated,’ says amicus curiae.
In this comment, lawyers also say that a policy that prohibits immigrants is damaging the US economy, and that there is a greater likelihood that immigrants will engage in business and provide the necessary employment services.
In June, Prosecutor General Jeff Sessions pointed out that the judges dealing with immigration would no longer provide asylum to those fleeing from domestic violence and victims of gang violence.
\" Asylum is granted to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear related to race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or certain political views,\" said Mr Sessions in his policy report of 11 June.
It was never a purpose to solve all the problems (not all the serious problems) that people face in the world every day.
Two times as many victims as Palu grow, desperately looking for the rest of the living
The situation of the rest of the living is constantly deteriorating.
“The pressure is very high, ” says 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, impoverishing the fevery son of her baby in the city evacuation centre of Palu.

A Missing Clean Water
It is noted that the population is returning to its destroyed homes, collecting overloaded water objects, and trying to save whatever it is possible to find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the damaged 7.5 - point earthquake hospitals were dry.
Some of the injured, like Dwi Harris, have experienced fractures of the back and shoulder, put outdoors outside the Palau Army Hospital – continuing to treat patients outside with strong repeated strokes.
His eyes were filled with tears when he told us how a loud earthquake was seen in the 5th floor room of the hotel, where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
\"There was no time to save others.
I seem to have gone through the ruins of the border,\" said Mr. Harris-Associated Press, and added that he and his family came to the city to take part in the wedding.
“I heard a cry for help from my wife, ” says silence.
I don't know what happened to her and her daughter.
I hope they're all right.
US Ambassador is accused of Chinese fearing propaganda
Last week, when the official Chinese newspaper distributed four pages of ad in the US daily, praising the mutual benefits of US and Chinese trade, the US Ambassador charged Beijing with the promotion of American press.
U.S. President Donald Trump mentioned last Wednesday the premium paid by China Daily to the most purchased newspaper of the State of Iowa, De Moines Register, and accused China of influencing the US Congress elections on 6 November. China denies such a charge.
“D. A short accusation that Beijing is trying to influence the US elections marks a new phase of the growing Washington campaign to put pressure on China,” said US officials Reuters.
Although it is common for foreign governments to distribute advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in an increasing trade war, and both countries are struggling with tariffs for imports from each other.
According to the Chinese and US experts, the Chinese reply rates were applied to the exporters of Aiovo and similar states, who supported the short-term Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the US Ambassador in China, the former long-term Governor of Iowa and one of the major exporters of agricultural production to China, said Beijing damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
On Sunday, in an article published in “Des Moines Register”, Branstad said that China “is even more concerned with printing propaganda in our free press ”
“The Chinese authorities used the freedom of speech and press to spread propaganda in America and ordered the paid advertisement “Des Mines Register, ” wrote T.Branstad.
“However, in the local press of Beijing, you will not find any conflicting voices and will not create a real picture reflecting the different opinions that the Chinese people may have about the worrying Chinese economic trajectory, as the press is under the hard sole of the Chinese Communist Party, ” he wrote.
Mr Branstad also added that “one of the most famous Chinese newspapers turned away from the paper proposal to print, but he did not mention which newspaper was.
Analysts warn: With the mid-elections approaching, Mr Kavanaugh fiasko has been deterred by the Republican Voyage
Although many Republican leaders remain loyal to the candidate to the Supreme Court in Bretto Kavanaugh, who has even been accused of sexual harassment, analysts have warned that this will be a negative response in the forthcoming mid-elections, especially from women.
Situations are driven by very strong emotions, and many Republicans already formally state that they wish to exercise the vote.
Such things cannot be taken back later, ” said Professor Grant Reeheri, professor at the University of Syracuzi, in the article “The Hill, ” published on Saturday.
According to G. Reecher, doubting whether the last minute of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s calls for the FBI investigation to be calmed to the evil voters will be enough.
“The women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will remember both tomorrow and November –” said the Washington newspaper on Friday, “MoveOn”, the Chief Advisor and National Representative of the Progressive Viewing Group at Karine Jean-Pierre.
On Friday morning, protesters would say: “The neighbourhood is near to the traditional foyer, when the republics under the control of the Committee on Justice decided to celebrate the Kavanaugh despite the demonstrations by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, zip reported
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will touch the edges,” said Stu Rotheenberg, an impartial policy analyst at the news site.
- People say she was already strong, and they're right.
But it could further strengthen positions, especially among the unsolved women's voters in the suburbs and younger voters aged 18-29, who, even though they don't like the president, often don't vote.
Even before Mr Ford made public statements, when she detailed her accusations of sexual harassment against the candidate to the Supreme Court, analysts claimed that if the Republicans approve the candidature, this could lead to indignation.
“The Republican Party was caused by a great confusion,” said Michael Steele, former Chairman of the Republican National Committee of the Republican, at the beginning of last week, said, “NBC News”
“In addition to the committee's or final vote, it is the director who is talking about whether Kavanaugh will be appointed a judge, but also about how Republicans has coped with this situation and how C.B. Ford has dealt with it,” said Guyus Cecilas, “Priority USA – a group that helps democratic elections.
However, the Americans seem to disagree so far on what they believe after the demonstrations by Mr Kavanaugh and Mr Ford, even though she has a little more support.
The new YuGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents are fully or most likely to believe in Ch. B. Ford’s statements, while 35 percent say fully or most likely believe in B. Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that Mr Kavanaugh was really, or likely, lying to give evidence, and only 30 percent thought the same about Mr Ford.
The FBI is currently investigating the accusations made by Mr Ford and the demonstrations of at least one other accused, Deborah Ramierz, reported by The Guardian to
Mr Ford made a sworn statement last week to the Committee on the Court of the Senate, claiming that Mr Kavanaugh had been abhoring her when she was 17 years of age.
Mr Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed her his genitalia at the party where they visited the University of Yale at 9 ths.
Web inventor plans to create a new Internet to resist Google+ and Facebook
The innovator of the global network, Tim Berners-Lee, is creating a new start to compete with Facebook's \"Amazon\" and Google's.
The most recent project of the legendary inventor “Inrupt” is a company whose work is based on Bernerso-Lee Open Source Platform “Solid”
“Solid” allows users to choose where their data is stored, as well as who and to whom information they have access.
The exclusive interview with Fast Company- Berners-Lee laughed at the aim of Inrupt's being to conquer the world.
“We have to do this now,” he said.
– It's a historic moment –
“The Solide-based technology-based app enables people to create their own personal data online store – POD.
It may contain lists, work lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal or work tools.
Tarsi ‘Google Drive’ would be accessible in one browser at the same time by Microsoft Outlook’s “Slack” and “Spotify”.
The online store of personal data is unique in that only the user decides who and what information can be accessed.
The company calls this a person's access through the data.
According to John Bruce, CEO of the company, the idea is to provide resources, processes and skills to make “Solid” accessible to everyone.
Currently, the company consists of T. Berners-Lee, J. Bruce, the security platform purchased by IBM, several developers who have been hired to work with this project, and the volunteer programmers community.
Since this week, world-wide technology developers can create their own decentralised applications using the tools provided by the \"Inrbat\" website.
Berners-Lee argued that he and his team did not agree with Facebook or Google because of the changes that would turn all business models around overnight.
“We do not ask for their permission ”
In a report published on Saturday, ‘Medium’, Berners-Lee notes that ‘The mission is to provide trade in energy and an ecosystem to protect the sustainability and quality of the new ‘Solid’ network.
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the Internet into a web consortium at the University of Massachusetts.
Berners-Lee has had an impressive opinion in recent months in the debate on internet neutrality.
Even working with Inrupt – Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I feel great optimism about this new web era, ” added Berners-Lee.
Honored Bernard Vann – a clergyman awarded the First World War of Victoria
On the occasion of the 100th anniversary in his home town, the only clergyman of the Anglon Church was honored and awarded the first world war with Victoria’s cross as a fighter.
Lieutenant-President Bernard Vannas awarded the prize on September 29, 1918 during the attack between Belenglis and Lucuk.
Unfortunately, four days later the pastors were shot by a sniper, so he did not know that he was awarded the highest-level British army award.
Two grandsons opened the memory stone in the county of Norsttonshire.
One of the grandchildren said that the stone was unveiled exactly 100 years after the old award was awarded, it was “remarkably symbolic...
According to the London Gazette, on September 29th, 1918, Colonel Lieutenant led his battalion through the channel of Saint Kentten.
Later, he rushed to the fireline and, especially Galantically, led the line forward, and then he alone attacked the shelter and conquered three troops.
Lieutenant Vanna had shot the Colonel on 4 October 1918, just over a month before the war ended.
For 72 years, Michael Wanna said that his grandfather’s actions were “something that is never equal but also an inspiration for humility...
After the discovery of the Brentwood emperor’s Youth Orchestra, Michael and his brother Dr. James Vann were in a crown.
Micheal Vanne stated that he was honored to participate in the paradise, adding: “A hero who is real is going to be supported by a multitude of people.
MMA passionates throughout the night did not go to sleep to see “Bellator 206 ” but had a contentment.
Imagine: You don’t go to sleep all night to see the chocolate “Bellator 206-1” but, finally, you don’t get to look at the main vision.
There were 13 fights in San Jose Afisha, six in the main card and live live in the United Kingdom all night during the “Cannel 5-10
At 6 o'clock in the morning, Gegard Mousas and Rory MacDonald prepared for the fight, the UK viewers were stunned by the film “Keytte Pepa ”
Some viewers, to put it mildly, were not impressed because they did not sleep until night.
On Twitter, one of the fans called a broadcast replacement for a child’s cartoon - some lyricist joke -
“In accordance with the rules laid down by the authorities, at 6 o’clock in the morning this content was not appropriate, so children’s programme needed to be enabled, ” said Bellator, Vice President of Marketing and Communication Dave Schwartz, who asked for the broadcast.
‘Yes, ‘Pep’
President Scott Coker, said that in future, there would be an effort to adjust the timetables to the audience in the United Kingdom.
“When I think of repetition, it seems to me that we could do it, ” said Cocker.
“But at that time it is 6 o’clock in the morning, Sunday, and we would not be able to solve it by Sunday at our time – Monday at their time.
However, we are already working on this.
Believe that, once the broadcast changes, many reports are exchanged, not all of which were friendly.
We tried to correct the situation, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But it's not a matter of authority.
I can promise that this will not happen the next time.
We're going to reduce the number of fights to five instead of six – as usually we do. We wanted to give the fans more, but simply failed.
This is a failure.
‘Desert Island Discs’: Tomas Daley felt inadequate due to its sexual orientation
The Olympic jumper says Tom Daley grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexual orientation, but that gave him the motivation to succeed.
24 A sportsman said only in the main school, when he realized that he was not the same as everyone.
For the first time in Lauren Loverne’s ‘Radio 4’ class, ‘Desert Island Discs’, he stated that he had a public talk about gay rights because he wanted to give others hope.
He also stated that having become a father, it was not so important to win the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the permanent leader of this long - term program, withdrew for several months from work due to the disease.
In the first program led by Loverne, whose guests were asked to imagine travelling to an uninhabited island, Mr. Daley said that growing is less than everyone else's, because it was socially unacceptable to love both the boys and the girls.
He stated: “This feeling of weakness and climax today was an incentive that gave me the strength that helped me to succeed.
He stated that he wanted to prove that it was worth it, so that they would not be disappointed when they finally learned about his sexual orientation.
The winner of the two Olympic bronze medals became a high-level LGBT activist and took the opportunity to call on more countries to decriminate homosexuality to participate in this year's British Arab Games.
He said that he had talked about this publicly because he felt that he was lucky that he could live a life without any consequences, so he would also like to give the others that hope.
Three times the World Champion claimed that it was unexpected for him to fall in love with a man named Dustin Lance, the USA filmmaker, who met him in 2013.
Mr. Daley got married last year with Oskar Laureata 20 years older, but she says that the difference in age was never a problem.
According to T. Delay, when so much life is so young – in his first Olympics he was only 14 and three years after his father died of cancer – it is difficult to accept something of the same age, but having experienced the same heights and lowliness.
Robert Ray Black-Daley, the parents of a couple who became a son, T. Daley's perspective changed completely, according to him.
“If you had asked last year, I would have told me the most important thing to win a gold medal,” he said.
– But you know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
Robby – my Olympic gold medal
The name of the son is the same as that of Grandpa Robert, who died in 2011 when he was 40 years old when brain cancer was diagnosed.
Mr Daley, the father did not want to deal with death, so one of his last questions was whether the tickets to the 2012 London Olympic Games were already bought, which he intended to watch while sitting in the first row.
“I couldn’t tell him that I couldn’t live so long to sit in the first row,” said T. Daley.
– I kept my hand when he stopped breathing, and then I finally recognized that he was not unharmed, ” said T. Daley.
A year later, the sportsman competed in the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze.
“I just knew that I had dreamed of it all my life – dancing to water watching the local audience in the Olympic Games – there was no better feeling,” he said.
It was also inspired by the first song’s choice of wires – the Heater Small’s work – the Proud, which responded to the Olympics who prepared his feelings and still pleasantly heat up their skin.
“Desert Island Discs is broadcast on Sundays at 11.15 a.m. during British summer time.
After losing the form, Ph. Mickelson spent his Saturday “Ryder” cup tournament on the bench
American Phil Mickelson will get a record on Sunday, because he will have to improve the shape very much for 47 times in the Rayr Cup.
Mr. Mickelson, already playing every 12 years for two years, at Saturday quavern competitions, Mr. Jimas Furykas was on the bench.
Instead of being in the center of the action, as was often the case in the United States, five times the main winner spent a part of the day in the support team, and the rest improved its machinery in the square in order to correct the troublesome mistakes.
Even at high altitudes, 48 athletes are not an ideal player in the foothunts of Le Gold National, whose long section of rough grass is extremely unfavorable for impeccable shocks.
In addition, as if the square itself would not be sufficiently frightening, on the 9th May, which will take place on Sunday, Mr. Mickelson will play against the super-target British Open Cup champion Francesco Molinari, who together with the rookie Tommy Fleetwood won all four matchers this week.
If the Americans who are four points behind achieve a good start for the 12-unit match, Mr. Mickelson's match may become absolutely decisive.
Furykas has expressed trust in his player, but it is likely that he cannot speak differently.
“He was well aware of his role today, spread me through the back of my back, and told me that he was ready to play even tomorrow,” said Furyk.
- He's good at self-confidence.
He is the most glorious athletes in the list both in the past and this week he has given a great deal to these teams.
Maybe I didn't imagine he was gonna play two wallets.
I imagined more, but it went out like this, so we decided that we would do that.
He wants to play like everyone else.
On Sunday, Mr. Mickelson will improve Nick Faldo's record and become the most \"Ryder\"-the cup of match-fashioned athletes.
It may be that it marks the end of his “Ryder ” cup of career, which is not equal to the heights of his personal record.
Ph. Mickelson owns 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven equals, but Furyk claims that his presence brought intangible benefits to the team.
“He likes to laugh from people and is a great guy with whom to be in the team room,” he explained.
– I think younger players were also having fun playing with him this week, it was good to look at it.
It brings a lot more than a game--
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great outweigh can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that a great emphasis on the final “Ryder” can easily become a difficult battle.
The Danish sportsman debuted in August 1997 in Valderam, where a team of opponents led by Captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point victory over the Americans, but the finish line was only passing away by the result 141⁄2:131⁄2.
“We constantly remind ourselves that we had a great victory in Valderam; we had a great victory in Brooklyn, where we lost, and also in Valderam where we won, but only barely,” said T. Bjorn (in the photo) after observing the 2018 victory in 5:3 on Friday and 10:6 “Le Golf National” in the square.
So the story will show me and all the team members that it's not yet over.
Tomorrow, we're gonna need every strength.
Go and do everything right.
Until there are no points on the board, the game is not finished.
We have the goal of trying to win this prize, so we must strive to achieve it in a consistent way.
I always said, I rely on the 12 players on our side, but we know very well what's standing on the other side – the best players in the world –
In fact, he added: “I would not want to run behind my eyes.
It's gonna be a big different hair thing in the morning.
Tomorrow, the most important will be an individual game – it's a different one.
It's great to play with a partner when everything goes well, but when you're alone in a square, try your limit on the ability to play golf.
This idea needs to be implemented by players – everything will have to be pulled out tomorrow.
Now we're gonna have to divorce with a partner, and he's gonna have to pull everything out of him.
In contrast to Mr Bjorn, the opponent Jim Furykas expects that his players will appear better on their own than on their own, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who collected three points out of four.
Furyk himself experienced both sides of the surprises of the last day, because in Brooklyn he was a lucky team before Europe performed a miracle of Medina and turned them into losers.
\"I remember every cursed word,\" he replied, asking him how in 1999, Captain Ben Crenshaw motivated his players in preparation for the final day.
- Tomorrow we have 12 important match-ups, but you want to start quickly – the kind you saw in Brooklyn and Medina.
When one direction of acceleration occurs, the middle sleeve becomes very tense.
Accordingly, we formed our team and released the players in a way that we know... are trying to create a certain magic tomorrow...
Thomas will have to try and fight countering and negotiate with Rory McIlroy's top mache, and among Europeans, the leader Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter.
“I have chosen these guys in this order because I think they will manage the whole game successfully, ” said Bjorn about his choice of the unit matches.
The delivery of a new German military ship is postponed
The latest aviation fisheries in Germany had to start work as early as 2014 and replace military vessels in cold wartime, but, according to the local press, we will not see them at least until next year due to the growing temptation of systems and the high price increase.
According to a report from the military representative, quoted by the Die Zeit’s ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’, the main new shipboard of the Baden-Württemberg class, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was supposed to join the navy in 2014, but the fate of this ambitious project has been tarnished by the already delivered ship's problem of suffering.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class, ordered by the military fleet as early as 2007, will replace the old Bremen class charter.
It is expected to include powerful pre-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as certain security technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic footprint.
Another important feature is longer maintenance intervals, which could travel far away from home ports for up to two years.
However, the ‘Die Zeit’, according to the report, is a constant delay in the use of advanced technology by military vessels, which are supposed to allow Germany to channel military power into the overseas territories until they are put into service.
The unsuccessful F125 fregata entered the headlines last year when the German navy officially refused to accept the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss yard in Hamburg.
This is the first time a navy returns the ship that has already been delivered to the builder.
The reason for the return is limited, but the German press highlights a number of key software and hardware defects that would have caused the vessel to have had nothing in the military mission.
There are some 120 seafarers' crews in the Baden-Württemberg class, which is half the size of the former Bremen class.
This ship has also proven to be very difficult, reducing its efficiency and limiting the possibilities for the fleet to introduce various improvements in the future.
It is estimated that 7 000 tonnes, Rheinland-Pfalz, are twice the size of the ships of a similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
The cost of the whole project – alongside the sedentary technical equipment including crew training – is also gradually becoming a problem.
It is said that it has risen from the initial amount of €2.2 billion to an amazing €3.1 billion (3.6 billion).
The latest fregate problems have become extremely significant since the recent warnings that the German navy has lost its power.
This year, in the past, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, acknowledged that the fleet actually lacks the right ships to use.
The officer argued that problems had been encountered over time, as old ships had already been burned down, but there was no way to replace them.
He regretted that none of Baden-Württemberg class fregates could join the navy.
“National Trust” listens to the secret bat life
A new study carried out in one of the heights of Scotland aims to reveal how bats use landscapes to hunt food.
The findings are expected to provide new knowledge of the behaviour of unique flying mammals and provide some guidance for future nature conservation activities.
“National Trust for Scotland is going to be observed by scientists in the study at Wester Ross Inverevo gardens, soprano hounds, brown ears, and water-flying Western Ross Inverevo gardens.
Special recorders will be installed in certain areas to allow you to track the activity of bats throughout the season.
The national health service's staff and volunteers will also perform mobile tests using manual detectors.
The expert analysis of all sound recordings will determine the frequency of signals transmitted by bats and one or other type of activity.
Then a map and a report of the habitat areas will be created to help form a detailed picture of behaviour on the scale of the whole landscape.
\"National Trust for Scotland\" (NTS) natural conservation advisor Rob Dewar hopes that the results will reveal which living areas are the most important for bats and how each species is used by them.
This information will help to identify the benefits of housing areas’ maintenance work, such as the creation of meadows, as well as to find out how best to care for forested areas so that they are suitable for bats and other related species.
During the past century, bat populations in Scotland and the United Kingdom have been squandering.
They are threatened by construction and the development of immovable property, affecting hatcheries and destroying residential areas.
It is also a threat to wind farms and lightnings, as is the case with mosstags, some chemical agents used for the processing of construction materials, as well as to the hunting of domestic cats.
The bats are not really blind.
But your ears are more likely to catch the prey during night hunting than your eyes.
The location of the insects or obstacles in the flight path shall be determined by means of a sharp echolocation.
The NTS, which is responsible for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land throughout the country, has a high level of responsibility for bats.
There are ten trained experts who regularly carry out investigations, checks on hatcheries and sometimes on rescue operations.
The organisation has even created the first and only reserve for bats in Scotland, specifically for the Damfries and Gale, in Threave Manor, where eight of the ten species of Scottish bats live.
Manor caretaker David Thompson says that the Manor territory is ideal for them.
“Threave Manor has a great place for bats,” he said.
– We have old buildings, many mature trees and beautiful areas to live.
But we do not know much about bats yet, so work here and in other places will help us to understand what they need so that they can flourish.
It stresses the importance of checking the absence of bats before the start of the site maintenance work, since the accidental destruction of one hatchery can kill up to 400 females and juveniles, which could lead to the destruction of the entire local population.
The bats shall be stored and shall be prohibited from being killed, irritated or disrupted, and the destruction of their hatcheries shall be prohibited.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an officer of the Scottish bat Protection Fund, called on the public to contribute to the rescue of bats.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and how many populations of native species succeed, and we don’t know...
Ch. Ronaldo rejected the charges of rape – lawyers intend to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described the accusations he had made against him as “mammals ” and stated that people who used his name “beloved themselves. ”
His lawyers are ready to sue the German news magazine Deer Spiegel.
Portugal and “Juventus” are accused of raped American Kathryn Mayorg in the hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
“Der Spiegel ” reporteded on Friday that he had supposedly paid a woman $375,000 for this event.
Speaking in a live broadcast of 142 million followers, Instagram, a few hours after reports of accusations, reports by the critic 33 years of Ronaldo and called them “melgiens. ”
\"No, no, no, no, no.
What they say today – the liars,\" said five times “Ballon d’Or – a laureate looking at the camera.
– They want to make a name for me.
It's normal.
They want to be loud, to say my name is part of my work.
I am a happy person, it's all right,\" a smiling sport added.
According to the report, “Reuters – Ch. Ronaldo’s lawyers are going to sue “Der Spiegel ” against the charges they called “acceptable disclosures of private spaces”
Judge Schertz argued that the sportsman would seek compensation for ‘moral damage, the amount of which would correspond to the significance of the infringement, probably the most serious violation of the law of one person in the last few years’
It is said that the alleged incident occurred in June 2009 “Palms – casinos and hotel apartments in Las Vegas.
According to documents filed with Nevada Clarka Regional Court, after the meeting at the night club Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the sportsman’s room where he allegedly raped it by an anal way.
According to Mrs Mayorga, after the alleged incident, Ronaldo attacked her knees and told her that there was a “99 percent good man ” who was betrayed by the remaining one percentage by his personalities.
According to the paper, Ronaldo acknowledged that the couple had sexual relations, but he said that they had been contractual.
Mrs Mayorga also claims that she had addressed the police and that her hospital injury was photographed, but later she agreed to agree not on a court order, because “the fearful actions ” and was concerned that she would be “publicly humiliated ”
A 34-year-old woman says that she is now seeking to withdraw the agreement because she still feels the trauma of the alleged incident.
At the time of the attack on Tarim, Ronaldo was Bepereine from Manchester to United Kingdom to Madrid-Real, and this summer, after signing a contract of EUR 100 million, he joined the Italian giant-Juventus-Juventus-
‘Brexit - United Kingdom will forever regret the loss of car manufacturers
According to Grego Clarko, the Secretary of Business Affairs, the United Kingdom would forever regret the loss of the world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit.
He added that the ‘Toyota’ division in the United Kingdom was concerned about the statement by the BBC that the withdrawal of Britain from the EU without an agreement would put an end to production in the Burnston factory near Derby.
“We need an agreement,” said Mr Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer claimed that the delay at the border after ‘Brexit’ would mean job losses without an agreement.
The Burnston factory, which produces Toyota’s models Auris-1 and Avensis last year, produced almost 150 000 cars, of which 90 % are exported to other European Union countries.
“In my opinion, if Britain suddenly leaves the European Union at the end of March, our factory will have to stop production,” said the Director General of Toyota Burnato Marvinas Cooke.
Other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom, including Honda-BMW-Jaguar and Land Rover, also expressed concern about exit from the EU without an agreement and its consequences for international trade.
For example, BMW claims that after ‘Brexit’ months it will close its ‘Mini’ plant.
According to the car manufacturers, the main concern is the threat that will be posed to the supply chain, Brexit, without the contract.
“Toyota is a production line that works when needed, with car parts coming from both the UK and EU suppliers coming every 37 minutes.
If, on 29 March, the UK will leave the EU without a treaty, there may be a disruption at the border; according to this industry, it may be delayed to present details or lack them.
‘Toyota’ claimed that the Derbishir plant could not store more than one day of required supplies, so production would stop.
According to Clark, the plan for the future relations with the EU, which includes Theresos May-Chequers, is ‘prepared precisely to avoid such border checks’.
“We need a contract. We want to have the best contract, which, as I say, would not only enjoy success today, but also use this opportunity.” he said for the BBC 4th programme “Today”
‘Not only ‘Toyota’, but also for other car manufacturers, the need to continue using a highly successful supply chain system’,
\"Toyota\" could not say for which time production would be stopped, but warned that, in the long term, additional costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallar, working for 24 years in the Burnston factory and responsible for the U.S. trade union meetings, said that members of his trade union are increasingly concerned: “I say that, from my experience, these jobs will never return to life.
The government representative stated: “We have proposed objectives and confidence in the plan for future relations with the EU ”
According to the White House, the short meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again
“The continuing fight for the candidate for the Supreme Court, a very important meeting of Donald Trump, with Deputy Prosecutor General Rhodesenstein, can be postponed even a week later,” said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller – the latter investigates Russia's interference in elections, short relations with Russia and possible interference by the President to execute justice.
The question of whether Short will forgive the Deputy Prosecutor General, thereby threatening the independence of Mueller, has been fueled for months in Washington.
This month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed carrying a microphone for brief conversations and the possibility of removing the president by means of an amendment 25.
Rosenstein has denied this report.
However, when he died of resignation, he went to the White House last Monday.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting would be held on Thursday with Trump, who was then in the United Nations in New York.
Short said he didn't want to forgive Rosenstein. Later, the meeting was moved to disagree with the meeting of the Senate Courts Committee, where he witnessed both the Kavanaugha and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women accused of inappropriate sexual behaviour.
On Friday, Trump FB ordered a week to investigate the accusations made by Kavanaugho, thereby delaying the vote in plenary again.
Short press release Sarah Sanders appeared on Sunday at Fox, a news release.
When asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “It is not fixed on the date, but it can happen this week, but in the light of all events relating to the Supreme Court, it may be postponed for another week.
But we'll see. I always like to post news for the press.
Some journalists would not agree with this statement: no press conference in the White House has been held by Sanders since 10 September.
Guest Chris Wallace asked why.
Sander replied that press conferences were rarely held, not because they did not like the TV journalists who wanted to see the viewers. She added: “I have to agree with the fact that they are reaching out to the viewers. ”
Then he said that Trump was more often with the press in direct contact.
“The president answers questions more often than any previous president ” she said without any evidence she added: “We reviewed the statistics ”
Says Sanders, press conferences will be held, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it is much better than talking to me.
We have often tried to do this, and you have seen that this has happened many times over the past few weeks. Press conferences will replace your direct communication with the President of the United States.
A short permanent response to questions while leaving the White House, participating in public meetings or press conferences with honourable guests.
One person's press conferences are rare.
This week, in New York City, he may have explained why.
Health Minister for the EU workers in Scotland wrote about the concerns of Brexit
The Minister for Health wrote a letter from the EU to the workers of the Scottish NST, expressing the country's gratitude and willingness to stay after ‘Brexit’.
The Scottish Member, Jeane Freeman, sent a letter to the UK less than six months before the withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to cover the costs of applications for permanent resident status for EU citizens working in the public services sector entrusted to it.
Mr Freeman wrote in his letter: \"The summer for the UK and the EU on exit negotiations continued and is on the verge of the forthcoming decisions this autumn.
But the UK Government has also started to speed up preparations for a possible scenario without a contract.
I know you're all very worried right now.
That is why I wanted to reiterate how I appreciate the contribution of all workers, no matter what their nationality is.
Colleagues from across the EU and elsewhere bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the healthcare system is useful to our patients and communities.
Scotland really is your home and we want you to stay here

Foreign buyers purchasing property in the UK will have to pay a higher stamp duty
According to the new establishment plans, foreign buyers purchasing property in the UK will have to pay a higher stamp fee and the additional money received will be used to help the homeless
This step will reduce the risks posed by the successful Corbyn campaign to attract young voters
An increase in stamp duty will be imposed on non-taxable persons in the UK
The Ministry of Finance hopes that it will be able to collect up to GBP 120 million a year to help the homeless
Today, Theresa May will announce that foreign buyers purchasing real estate in the UK are going to be subject to higher tariff stamp duty and to the use of additional money to help the homeless
It is expected that this step will reduce the risk of a successful Jeremy Corbyn campaign to attract young voters in order to secure more affordable housing and people on high incomes.
The increase in stamp duty will be levied on non-taxable persons and companies in the UK and the additional money received will be allocated to promote the government campaign to combat homelessness.
The additional charge, which is paid in addition to the current stamp duty, including higher rates for the purchase of second homes or houses two years ago, may amount to as much as three per cent.
The Ministry of Finance hopes that this step will allow the collection of up to GBP 120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the real estate newly built in London is bought by non-UK residents, which leads to rising prices and making the first buyers of housing more difficult to do.
Many foreign buyers spend most of their time outside the country, making many rich countries, and especially the capital regions, a number of city ghosts.
The new strategy was presented just a few weeks later when Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the signpost fee, thus helping more young people to buy their first homes.
He accused large construction companies of buying land quickly, but without using it, they supported high real estate prices, and urged May to tackle the British housing shame by giving up purchased home allowances.
Corbyn has published several eye-catching proposed housing reforms, including the control of rental prices and the prohibition of moving away without guilt.
He also wants more power to build new homes for municipal councils.
Says May: “Last year, I said that as a Prime Minister I wanted to return my British dream – every new generation must have a better life.
This means that we have to deal with our failing housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and create a life here.
It is not fair, however, that non-residents in the UK and foreign businesses can buy homes as easily as hard-working British citizens can.
Many people’s dream of having a home has become almost impossible, and the threat of humiliation is still too real.
Jack Rosss: “My final goal is to lead the Scottish team.
“The Sunderland head, Jack Ross, says that his ultimate goal is to ever become head of the Scottish team.
The 42-year-old Scotch has the challenge of revitalising the North-East club, which is currently in the third place of the first league and three points behind the first-place club.
Last season, after taking St. Mirren back to the Scottish Championship, he moved to Stateum of Light this summer
“As a player, I wanted to play for my country.
I became part of the B-selection team and all this ended up with the ‘Scotland's Sportsound’ programme, said Ross.
“But in my childhood, I grew up at Hamden’s stadium with Dad, watching a lot of the Scottish team matches, and it always led me back.
True, this opportunity will only occur if I successfully guide the club
Dickas Advocatas, David Moyes, Samas Allardyce’s, Martin O’Neill’s, Roy’us Kane’s, Gus Poyet’s and Paulo Di Canio’s led up to Rossso-Sunderland.
Having previously rejected Barnsley’s and Ipswich Town’s proposals, the former head of Alloa Athletic says that he was not worried about starting to work after such well - known leaders in such a large club.
‘Now my success will be measured by the answer to the question ‘Can I return this club to the Premium League’.
By structure and conditions, this club undoubtedly belongs to the “Premier” league, ” he said.
“It’s not an easy task to take him back, but I’m probably just going back to the league that I thought I was doing a good job here ”
Rossso's leadership career lasts only three years. Before that, he worked as a head assistant in the Dumbarton – club and changed the Hearts – trainers for 15 months.
Later, they helped to recover to the third division, turning the block of Alloa's and St. Mirren's club, which was on fall, the next season into a championship winner.
Ross claims that he is now more pleased than ever felt during his career as a player in Clyde--Hartlepool--Falkirk-St Mirren- and Hamilton Academic-clubs.
‘This change was probably radical,’ he recalls, ‘manager’s direction’: ‘Alloa’
“I sincerely believed to be able to lead me – better than playing.
That sounds strange, because I was successful, earned a lot, and I was happy with the blessings.
But it can be hard to play.
You have to overcome many problems every week.
And now it's not easy – working stress and stress, but I feel that leadership is exactly what I need.
I always wanted to lead, and now I am doing this. As an adult, I always felt at my slicks, but leadership gives me the greatest satisfaction.
You can hear the full interview at Sportsound on Sunday, September 30, during “Radio Scotland – 12.00-13 p.m.” at the English Summer Time.
Studies found that the best time to pick a beer – Saturday at 5.30 p.m.
The summer heat wave increased the income of the poor British beers, but the burden on the restaurant networks was even more complicated.
The figures showed that in July sales of brewery and bar groups increased by 2.7 percent, but income in restaurants declined by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, of the business consultancy firm CGA who prepared this data, said: “The sunshine and longer than expected, England’s participation in the world championship meant that July followed a trend similar to June when brewery income grew 2.8 percent, and restaurants were even more affected than before.
In July, the trade in restaurants declined by 1.8 percent, and the situation became worse.
The main results of beer and bars benefiting from the basic income from the trade in beverages were undoubtedly the best, and the trade in them grew stronger than the decline in restaurants.
Although not as strong as restaurant companies, the primary income from food sales also hit sunset.
People seem like they just wanted to get a drink.
The sale of beverages in well - handled breweries and bars increased by 6.6 percent this month, and food sales dropped by 3 percent.
Paul Newman says from the leisure and fertility sector analysis company RBM: “These results continue with the trend observed since the end of April.
With regard to catering establishments, the effects of the weather and of the major social and sporting events remain key factors.
It was not surprising that groups of restaurants were still in a poor situation, but the drop in sales of 4,8 percent for many years will be particularly painful as it will contribute to the inexpensive cost-related pressure.
The most earning food businesses could not come in worse times with a long hot summer. Time will show whether the milder August is feeling the temperature that will give the necessary freshness.
The overall growth in sales in breweries and restaurants, including newly opened places, was 2.7 percent in July and reflected the slowness of the development of brand-based networks.
The UK beer, bars and restaurants sector and its guidelines recognise \"The Coffee Peach Tracker – a sector’s sales monitoring tool collects and analyses activity data from 47 active groups with a total turnover of GBP 9 billion.
One in five children is from parental secret social media accounts
The study revealed that one in five children – some just 11 years of age – has social media accounts hidden from parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed a growing number of counterfeit-insta pages
The news has strengthened the fear that sexual content is published
Twenty percent of the students said they had a key account designed to show their parents
One of the five children – some just 11 years old – is creating secret social media accounts and hiding them from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed a rapid increase in the number of counterfeit-insta-pages – a link to the photo-sharing website-Instagram-
The news has strengthened the fear that sexual content is published
Twenty percent of the students said that they used a censored master account to show their parents, but they had secret accounts.
A mother who accidentally found a secret daughter’s website in her 13 - year - old girl learned that she insisted: “Turn me up.
“The study carried out by Digital Awareness UK and independent School Directors’ Conference (MDK) found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-old students had two accounts, and half of these students recognised the accounts as slippery.
Mike Buchanan, head of the KGB, said: “The temptation of so many teenagers to create virtual spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them is worrying...
Eilidha Doyle will be sportsmen's voice in the Scottish Sports Council
In the general annual meeting of the governing body of the Scottish Sports Council, Ms Eilidha Doyle was elected as the director of her director.
Doyle is the most award-winning Scottish Lightette and President. Ian Beattie described this step as an excellent opportunity for sport leaders to take advantage of the diversity of the international experience they have acquired over the past decade.
“Eilidha has earned great respect throughout the entire sport community in Scotland, the UK and the world, and we have no doubt that its inclusion in the Scottish sports council will be of great benefit. ”
Doyle said: “I want to serve as the voice of athletes and I hope that I will really contribute to and guide the sport in Scotland.
In 1996, an American winner of the 1996 Atlantic Games and a total of four Olympic gold medals, now appearing as a permanent BBC expert, could not walk after a short-term ischaemic attack.

I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that it was only time for me to show me whether I would go well and to what extent.
We needed to do it until we were exhausted, but I got a complete recovery, I've been able to walk again, and I'm doing my mobility exercises today!

Online breast dairy advertising, in which mothers are compared with cows, received different assessments
The company producing breast milk has received different views on its advertising, which compares mothers with dairy cows.
To mark the beginning of the sale of a product described as the world's first silent portable breasts, the technology company for consumers Elvie has released an inspired advertisement for a ironic music video, which aims to demonstrate the freedom that the mothers are providing for the feeding of new milk.
In this full - frame carnival four real - mother dances according to a sound recording, for example, the following words: “Yes, I lie to myself, but no tail can be seen; and, ‘If you didn’t notice, it wasn’t the ink, it’s my breasts.
The Annex continues: “Put him out, pull him out, feed his babies, pull him out, pull him out, pray his beauty. ”
However, advertising published on Facebook caused an online dispute.
The viewers responded in a variety of ways when the viewer reviewed 77,000 times and received hundreds of comments, and many said that it looked at the horrors of the dairy industry.
“The use of cows to promote this product is a very bad solution.
Like us, they must become pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their newborns must be taken away from it after a few days.
“Elvish – Breast Milk Breaker in the Power Bra” (“Elvie – / “Worth” –
Another comment was: “The injury caused by both the mother and the newborn.
But why not use advertising to present breast milk to mothers whose infants are not taken away?
Still, he added: “Advertisement is a total misunderstanding.
Another commentator defended advertising – one woman admitted that she had turned out to be “very fun ”
“I think the idea is genius.
I would buy if I'd still feed.
When I cut off milk, I felt like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I accepted it as what it is.
This product is genealogous, ” wrote one.
Another comment was: “This kind of advertising is for mothers whose milk falls away (often in workplaces or toilets) and feels like cows.
Its purpose is not to drunken or condemn the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that all the unobserved milk of the shock in the vests is present.
The idea of the campaign is based on an insight that many women who stop their breast milk say they feel like cows.
However, “Elvies” does not sound at all, has no wires or tubes, and it’s unobserved to fit in the power bra, so women can move away, keep their babies, or even leave home when they pull out of their milk.
“Other partners and executive director Ana Balarin commented: “Elvie – dairy is a revolutionary product that deserves to be marketed boldly and provocatively.
When we compared the feeding woman with dairy cows, we wanted to pay attention to the end of milk and all its challenges, at the same time showing, to the extent possible, an incredible sense of freedom that will be given by the new milking system.
“Elvie’s press release was not the first time.
During the fashion week of London, the mother of two children demonstrated that product by using her podium.
Hundreds of migrant children moved quietly to a tent camp near Texas
The number of people moving within a month has not changed substantially, but the number of children of apprehended migrants has increased significantly, partly as a result of the strict short administration's rhetoric and policy making it more difficult to accommodate them with carers.
Traditionally, the majority of guardians themselves were undocumented immigrants and feared that applying for child custody put the possibility of staying in the country at risk.
Once the Federal Government announced in June that potential guardians and other adult members of their families would have to submit fingerprints and that this data would be shared with immigration authorities, the risks were further increased.
Last week, Matthew Albence, chief official of the immigration and customs service, testified to Congress that several dozens of people were detained by the institution who had applied for custody of unaccompanied minors.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70 percent of arrested people had not been tried before.
“Almost 80 percent of these people – guardians or family members – live illegally in the country, and most of them are foreign criminals.
We will therefore continue to persecute these individuals, ” said Albence.
According to the shelter staff, officials have introduced new rules in order to consider the cases of children faster, with some children coming to court within one month of the detention, not within 60 days as was usual before.
Many attempts will be made to defend the application for legal status against the immigration judge by using a conference video instead of being personally present.
Recognised persons who do not have access to the aid will be promptly deported.
According to reports from shelter workers and from the system in recent months, the longer children remain detained, the more likely it will become restless or depressed, which may lead to violence breakthroughs or escape attempts.
The defenses say that this is even more worrying in large bodies, such as the Tornil shelter, where size increases the likelihood that they will not notice signs of child suffering.
They added that moving children into a tent city without giving enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends may incite many of the traumas that have already been experienced.
Syria told the U.S., French and Turkish occupations to withdraw immediately
In addition, when addressing the UN General Assembly, the Foreign Minister Walidas al-Moualem invited Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Moualem, who also holds the position of Deputy Prime Minister, stated that the anti-terrorism forces on Syrian land are illegal and will be treated accordingly.
“ They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally, ” he said to the Assembly.
Moualem claimed that in Syria, where more than 360 000 people died since 2011, and millions of people had to leave their homes, the war with terrorism was almost finished.
He said that Damascus will not stop fighting this sacred struggle until we destroy both terrorist groups and any illegal aliens in all Syrian territories.
Syria has some 2,000 troops in the United States who train and advise the Kurd forces and President Bashar al-Assad who resist Syrian Arabs.
France has more than 1 000 land soldiers in the country that has taken the war off.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions for them to return are good, and at the same time accused some Western countries of spreading unjustified fear that deters refugees from returning.
“We went to the international community and humanitarian organisations to help them get back ” he said.
\"They politicise what should be a purely humanitarian problem\"
The United States and the European Union warned that Syria would only be helped with reconstruction when Assada and the opposition reached a political agreement and ended the war.
UN diplomats say that the recently concluded agreement between Russia and Turkey in the last large fortress of the rebels set up a buffer zone in Idlib has made the progress of political negotiations more rapid.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented the large-scale attack by the Syrian forces on the province of three million people.
However, Moualem stressed the clear deadlines set out in the agreement, and expressed the hope that military action would target the Jihadists, including those from the Nusra-front associated with al-Qaeda, who would be destroyed.
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of the Committee composed of the Government and the opposition members to prepare the post-war constitution project of Syria and prepare the ground for elections.
Moualem has set out the conditions under which the Syrian Government will take part in the committee – the work of the group must be limited to reviewing the articles of the present constitution and has warned against the interference.
Why will Trump be elected for the second term of office?
Based on this logic, Trump would be elected in 2020 unless, as probably, many liberal spectators expect, his Presidency would be pre-emptive and scandalous.
Of course, it would be the most dramatic end of a previous Presidency!
So far, no sign of fatigue can be seen.
Since 2014, the best broadcast time ratings in CNN's television has increased more than twice by up to 1.05 million, while MSNBC has increased almost three times by 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, ‘Fox News’ has an average of 2.4 million best broadcast audiences, with a number rising from 1.7 million years ago, while MSNBC’The Rachel Maddow Show holds its first place in cable TV ratings with up to 3.5 million audiences on the main news evenings.

Chaos is worthy of relief.
Of course, contrary to the other show on television, jamming coming from Washington may lead to Roe v Wade's future, the possibility of unification of immigrant families and the state of the global economy.

Money from around the middle of the term of office is coming into the fight against the Representative's Chamber
It was not strange that the 17th district of Pennsylvania was covered with money as a result of the resolution of the congress districts which ended with the attempt of two Members of the House to win the same post.
The recently reinstated suburbed Pittsberg County has included a democratic Member of the House of Representatives Conor Lamba as he won his place in special elections in the last spring in another county.
Lambas competed with another Member of the House of Representatives – the Republican Keithfus, currently representing the previous 12th County of Pennsylvania. A large part of it overlaps with the new 17th.
Maps of the revolution, when the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January ruled that, in violation of the constitution, the old districts had been reclaimed for the Republicans.
During the election fight, the financial institutions of the main parties in the new 17th region – Congress Committee of Democrats Campaign (DCCC) and National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC) – have been upset about the campaign's finances.
Lambs in Pennsylvania became famous when, in the 18th Congress District, a small majority of votes won the widely watched special elections in March.
This place was occupied by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump has won 20 points in the District.
Political experts have given such an advantage to the democrats.
The US discussed El Salvador being punished for supporting China, but then calmed down
The diplomats noted that Beijing had already been recognized by the Dominican Republic and Panama but did not have a major negative reaction from Washington.
In June 2017, Trump attended a warm meeting with Panama's President Juan Carlos Varela and had a hotel in the country until the partners left the leadership of the Tremp Organization.
‘For recent decisions to withdraw recognition of Taiwan’s State Department, officials decided to withdraw heads of American diplomatic missions from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama,’ said the departmental representative Heather Nauert in a report published earlier this month.
But sanctions are only being considered for El Salvador, which received approximately USD 140 million in 2017, American aid as well as for drug control, development and economic support.
The sanctions proposed, including the reduction of financial assistance and visa restrictions for specific persons, would have been painful for a Central American country with high levels of unemployment and murder.
In the course of internal meetings, the North and Central American officials postponed the conference on security and economic prosperity and had to take place after a similar meeting last year, which was considered an important step forward in order to prevent migrants moving to the United States.
But in mid-September, the top administrative officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, and that was the main outcome of any debate on sanctions against El Salvador.
‘In order to demonstrate the importance of the administration for this meeting, Vice President Mike Pence has now been added to the list of speakers at the conference in mid-October,’ said diplomats.
On the other hand, three American messengers quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without reporting any restitutions or punishments from Washington.
The representative of the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate that were presented by the three American officials, including two diplomats, and they agreed to discuss their inner deliberations only if their anonymity was preserved.
Their stories are confirmed by an analyst close to the administration, and also if its anonymity is preserved.

The special advisor Robert Mueller's report on the possible short-term disruption to justice is still unavoidably welcome – its evidence is now available in public archives.
In addition, as has been said, Mueller's investigation raises the question of whether the short-term campaign is not carried out in secret in cooperation with Russia which has suffered the consequences of our elections.
If Congress were to change to other hands, Trump would have to assume responsibility in this institution, at the same time as he is going to stand up again against the voters, and perhaps finally also before the Board of Governors.

It is a story that is about the main points of turn, which is then speeded up or halted by an irresistible course of democracy.
Now the Americans have come to some of these crucial turning points.
What will we do if Trump forgives the Deputy Prosecutor General Rodas Rosenstein, a man on whom the fate of Mueller's investigation depends?
The problem of Rosenstein began when this paper reported that last year the official had suggested that the president be clandestinely recorded and considered his ineligibility in carrying out the duties.
Rosenstein states that “The Times is a true story.
‘How will we react if the new investigation by the FBI by Brett Kavanaugh proves to be incomplete or incorrect, or if, despite persuasive accusations, the candidate is appointed to the Supreme Court?
And finally, will we vote for Congress in the middle of our term of office, which will lead to a brief discharge of responsibility?

Graham Dorrans from “Rangers” to a meeting with “Rapid Vienna ” looks optimistic
Thursday 'Rangers' to 'Rapid Vienna' will admit that if after the impressive competitions with 'Villarreal' in Spain earlier this month had been held in Spain, they could find themselves in a strong position to leave the G group against the east.

On Thursday, there will be another significant evening of the European League.
I hope we can get three points. The game will be difficult, because in the last competitions it has been a great result, but I have no doubt that with the support of spectators we can break through and get a good result.
Last year was really hard – and what happened with my injuries, and changes in the club itself, but now there is a good mood.

These pensions cause the fear of savings for a woman who suffers from insomnia
Although the participants in the survey clearly saw what care they would like to receive, few talked to family members about this.
About half of the respondents to the Nationwide study said that they talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t try to talk about this, ” said Nationwide, vice president of the life insurance company Holly Snyder.
That's what we need to start with.
Talk to your spouse and children, and if you do not give your wishes in advance, your family will not be prepared to take care of you.
Please discuss with the counselor and the family where and what care you would like to receive, as these may be important to predict costs.
Call a financial advisor, and the advisor can also help you think about how to pay these expenses.
Long-term care may decide to pay these costs as a result of a traditional long-term care insurance certificate, a mixed certificate of money-life insurance or insurance of your assets for as long as you have money.
Support legal documents.
Support your healthcare authority and make sure that you give you a trusted person who takes care of your medical care and ensures that the professionals respect your wishes if you cannot communicate.
Also think of the power to take care of your finances.
You should choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and make sure that the accounts are settled if you become inefficient.

Federal Prosecutors to the New York terrorist attack suspected of the rarely applied death penalty
In New York, federal prosecutors seek the death penalty for Sayful Saipov, a suspected terrorist attack by eight people in New York City, a rare punishment that has not been committed in this country since 1953 for federal crimes.
On October 31, the 30 - year - old Saipov from “Home Depot ” took the truck and set up an attack on the bicycle path along the western highway of the Lower Manhatane, on the road, laid pedestrians and cyclists.
According to a report from the Southern District of New York on the intention to pursue the death penalty, justified prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov deliberately killed eight victims and deliberately caused serious body injuries.
According to the court document, both of these accused points can lead to the death penalty.
After the attack a few weeks later, the Federal Grand Compendium announced to Saipov an indictment of 22 points, including eight accusations of killing property (usually in organised crime cases by federal prosecutors) and the indictment of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The prosecutors say that the attack was very well planned and premeditated, and the way Saipov carried out it was called a disgust, cruel and immoral.
“The actions of Sayfullo Habibullaevicius Saipov were injured, suffered and lost by members and friends of the following families: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleveso, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Dreek’s, Ariel Erley, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendozo and Alejandr Damiano Pagnuncco,” states the statement of intent.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
The last case in which the death penalty was requested was dealt with in New York South District a decade ago.
Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but finally, in September 2009, he was sentenced to life sentence.
The last time the death penalty was executed in 1953 in the New York Federal case for the spouses Julius and Ethele Rosenberg, when they were sentenced two years ago to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipova, born in Uzbekistan, did not regret his actions either immediately after the attack or several months later.
According to the police, he declared to the researchers that he felt good about what he did.
According to the accused act, Saipova revealed that the Islamic State's (ISIS) videos were inspired to execute the attack, which were watched on his phone.
The police reported that he also asked the hospital to hang an Islamic flag in the ward.
He did not recognise his guilt under 22 points of accusation.
David Patton, one of the federal-funded defenders in the Philippines, said that they were obviously disappointed by the decision of the prosecutor's office.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than recognising guilt and imprisonment to live without the possibility of being released will only prolong the injury to all individuals involved of these events” said Patton.
In the past, the Saipovo Defence Team asked the prosecutors not to execute the death penalty.

“Brexit, a proponent of Tom Andrea Jenkins, also took part in the demonstrations and told the journalists: “I just say, Prime Minister, hear the people.
The Chekers' plan is not popular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it; it is unpopular, and it is also among our party members and activists who are on the streets and, most importantly, voting in favour of us.
Reject the Checkers plan and start listening
In her critical report, May she added: “The Prime Ministers keep their promises to be kept. ”
Farage said that maintenance politicians must be forced to feel the heat if they issue a referendum decision in 2016.
“Now this is a question of our trust, our people and our political class,” he said.
“ They try to give up “Brexit, ” so we’re here today to tell them that we won’t allow them to do it ”
He added to the enthusiastic crowd: “I want you to force our political class, which almost gave off “Brexit, ” to feel the heat.
We are mobilising the army of this country's people, which has brought us the \"Brexit\" victory, and we will not stop until we become independent, self-governing and proud of the United Kingdom.

When Walter Bottt over Lewis Hamilton at his Saturday qualifying ride, it was clear immediately that “Mercedes ” team’s orders in the race would be of great importance.
After the race started from the first place, Bottt had a great start and, defending his position in the first two turns, he hardly left in the run of Hamilton, encouraging Wettel to attack his teammate.
He left the Hamilton in the race and returned to the tail of the group, so it was fatal.
“Mercedes went to the two-wheeled garage after the wheel and returned to the track behind Vettel, but Hamilton, after a little away from the contacts, came forward when Ferrari, the driver, after a double manoeuvre to keep his position in the third direction, reluctantly freed the inner side of the track.
Max Verstappen, who was celebrating the 21st birthday, started from the end of the row, but the seventh one was at the end of the first circle.

The team worked well and won two first places, ” Hamilton said.
It was really a bad body language
President Donald Trump himself at a Saturday meeting with the people by senator Dianne Feinstein because he perseveres against Christine Blasey Ford's letter, in which the candidate for the Supreme Court judges Brettas Kavanaughas is accused of sexual rape.
In his speech at West Virginia, the President did not directly name Ford's statements to the Senate's Legal Committee, but said that what is happening in the Senate showed that people are wicked, unholy and wrong.
“What could happen and actually happen in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see that people are evil, wicked, incorruptible and wrong,” he said.
“When you see official declarations and rundowns, and then you say, “Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't do it...
Remember?
Dianne Festein, did you run away?
Remember her answer to the question, did he cast off the document? “Oh, oh, what?
Not at all.
I didn't drive...
Well, wait a minute.
Whether we ran away... no, we didn't leak,\" he added, depicting the senator.

The flight manual died to help hundreds of plane passengers escape from the earthquake
An Indonesian flight guide was published by a hero who died by helping a plane with several hundred passengers safely take off into the air.
More than 800 people were killed, and many were kept missing after the strong earthquake that caused the tsunami on the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The area continued to be shaken by strong re-emergetic shocks and many people trapped in the ruins of Palu.
Although colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his office at a heavily fluctuating management tower at the Al-Jufri airport in Palau City.
He remained in his workplace to help 6321 Air, who had a flight, to safely take off the aircraft that had already been on the runway.
Then he jumped out of the flight control tower.
Later, he died in the hospital.
The Australian-ABC News, Yohannes Sirait, an Indonesian air navigation agent, said that his decision could save hundreds of lives.
We took him on a helicopter from Kalimantaine to a larger hospital in another city, Balikpapan.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“ It’s a painful news for us, ” he added.
The authorities, however, fear that the number of deaths could grow to thousands, as the country's disaster-reduction agency reports that the cities of Dangala, Siggio and Boutong are difficult to reach.
“It is expected that the number of victims will continue to grow, as many victims are still under the ruins, and they cannot be reached,” said the agency representative Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Up to a height of six meters, the city of Palu has been destroyed and will host a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and supplies supplies.
A 35 - year - old mother, Risa Kusuma-Sky News, said: “Each minute, fast cars bring the victims.
Clear water is missing.
Self-service shops that are ripped out in every place
Janis Gelfandas CNN, head of the International Indonesian Red Cross, said: “The Red Cross in Indonesia is quick to help survivors, but we do not know what we will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but the situation may get worse.
The President of Indonesia, Jokas Widod, arrived in Palau on Sunday and said to the army of the country: “Please work day and night all you need to do all the tasks related to evacuation.
Whether you are ready - Mrs. CNN reported.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was shaken by earthquakes in Lombardok, which killed more than 550 people.
Aeroplane accident in Micronesia: “Air Niugini is now saying that one person is missing when the plane goes down to a lagoon
Air lines operating a flight that ended with an aeroplane accident at the Micronesia-owned Pacific lagoon now say that one person is missing, although previously said that all 47 passengers and crew members were rescued from the sinking plane.
The report “Air Niugini ” said that on Saturday afternoon they had no knowledge of a traveler’s husband.
The airlines indicated that they were cooperating with local authorities, hospitals, and researchers when looking for a man.
Airlines have not responded immediately to requests for more information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew when the plane dropped into the water when he attempted to land at Chuk Island airport.
Officials reported that seven people were taken to the hospital on Friday.
The airlines said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, and all of them were in stable condition.
It is not clear what the accident occurred or what the exact sequence of events was.
The airline and the U.S. Navy reported that the plane landed in the lagoon without reaching the runway.
Some eyewitnesses believe that the plane did not land on the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane fell from very low.
“It was very good, ” said Jaynes.
Jaynes told him that he and others were able to get down to emergency exits on the sinking and roll-down plane.
He said that the flight satellites were panic and shouted, and he himself suffered a head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that when their sailors were repaired near the quay, they also helped rescue people brought by a purged boat to the shore before the plane ran to a depth of about 30 metres.
According to the Air Safety Network, 111 people died in crashes of the aircraft registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none of them owned Air Niugini.
Analyst set out a sequence of events during the night that the woman had been burned alive
The Public Prosecutor's Office set out facts in the Saturday repeated case of a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
The U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett witnessed for a few hours as a court expert in intelligence analysis.
He set out to the jury how he used the mobile phone records to connect the flow of the 29-year-old indicted Quinton Telliss and the 19-year-old sacrifice of Jessica Chambers at the death night.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett, he received location data from several mobile phones showing that Tellis was on the eve of her death, which contradicts earlier statements.
When data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he said he had a friend of Michael Sanford, the police went to survey Sanford.
On Saturday, he expressed his position, and he testified that there was no one in his city.
When the prosecutors asked whether Tellis was telling the truth that he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford replied that he was “a lie, because his truck was Nasville...
Another coincidence was that Tellis said that he knew Chambers about two weeks after she died.
Mobile phone records show they knew each other for the next week.
Rowlett said that in some time after the death of Chambers Tellis deleted Chambers messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
“He wiped it out of his life, ” said Hale.
It is foreseen that defence will begin on Sunday.
The judge alleged that the case would be referred to the jury later on the same day.

New Yorker was sued for a couple after she was dismissed for a ‘realistic’ message
New Yorker put a couple to court for dismissal on grounds of discrimination after having received a message sent to the wrong address from her mother calling for her to be “a black one ”
The couple denys that they are racist and that the action is termed ‘violence’
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, upset when she learned that the new child carer Giselle Maurice is black when she arrived on the first working day of 2016.
“NEEEEEE, DAR UNIT JUODAO – Mr Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a letter.
However, she has not been sent twice to her husband, but to Mr Maurice.
According to the New York Post, the insane Plasco-Flaxman, who understood the new York Post, was embarrassed and dismissed by Mr Maurice, claiming that the previous African-American teacher had done the wrong job and had hoped to receive the Filipino instead.
Mr Maurice was paid for one working day and she was sent to the house by Uber.
Maurice now sued a couple to claim compensation for the forgiveness and seeks to swear even after USD 350 a day for half a year's life and work at the customer's home for which it was originally hired without a contract.
“I want to show them that such things cannot be done, ” she said, “Post ” on Friday, adding: “I know it’s discrimination.
The couple turned away from the accusations they had made in racism by denying that it was reasonable to dismiss Maurice from her job because they feared that she could not be trusted after she was offended.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racer.
We're not racist -- – husband Joel Plascas said, \"Post --
Would you please your children for someone who was unwise, though it was a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
I don't think –
In fact, Plascas said that his wife had a baby just two months ago and that she was “in a very difficult situation ”
You were going to judge it?
This is not a very nice behaviour – an investment banking specialist has been added.
While the trial was being dealt with, the media were hasty to condemn a couple on the social media, criticizing their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington’s publishers fear that readers will not understand a bear
Bondo’s daughter, Karen Jankel, born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It is difficult to feel the next place to read the book for the first time before it was released.
Now it’s very interesting to know what we know about Paddington’s enormous success!
Saying that her father, who had worked as a BBC operator before finding an inspiration to write a book about a teddy bear for children, would not have been too upset if his work had been rejected, and added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book after the death of his father was pleasant and sad at the same time.
When referring to Paddington, she described her family as “a very important member of the family, ” she added that her father was silently proud of her success.
“He was quite a quiet man and did not like to praise, ” she said.
“As Paddington was like him, he felt as if he had a child who had achieved something: be proud of him, but it is not your job.
I think he had a similar appreciation for Paddington's success story.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always profited on the merits of Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her phone
When her daughter was taken down, he was rushed to the Nice Louis Posteuro 2 hospital, where doctors failed to save her life.
“Never has always called and said that the condition is really bad, not expecting it to survive,” said Mr. Ednan-Laperouse.
“I then received a call from Nado, who called to say that she had two minutes to live and say goodbye to her.
And I said goodbye.
I told her: “I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
Doctors given medicines that supported her heart rate, slowly stopped working and left the body.
She died a little early, and it was the end of everything.
I just had to sit down and wait, knowing it's all going on.
I could not fight, scream, or cry, because I was in an environment surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep it in my own place.
Finally, Mr Ednan-Laperous, now disrupting her dead daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers who do not know how difficult it is to overcome.
“No one knew ” she said.
“My head was abandoned, and tears continued to roar.
It is difficult to explain why, but it was on the plane that I felt great compassion for Nadu.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew his love for her was strong.
Educating women's postcards aim to prevent suicide on bridges
Two women who have lost their deadly loved ones try to prevent others from taking their lives away.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys on the Wales Bridge distributes postcards with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call and call for help.
Mr. Davis’ son Tyler was 13 when he was depressed and committed suicide at age 18.
“I don’t want one father to feel the way I feel every day, ” she said.
Mr. Davis, who lives in Lidne, said that her son was a promising chef, who stands out for a contagious smile.
“They all knew him about his smile.
They always used to say that his smile covered the room.
But he gave up his job before he died because he was “a true place in the dark. ”
In 2014, Tyler’s 11 brother, found his dead brother.
Mr Davis said: “I am constantly afraid that a chain reaction can occur,
Mr. Davis has developed a postcard for people to know that there are people around who can be contacted and discussed, even if it is a friend.
Don't sit in silence, you have to talk...
Mr. Humphreys, a long-term friend of Mr. Davies, lost his 15-year-old partner Marco, who left his life shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed, depressed, and didn’t complain about anything, ” she said.
“We noticed his changed attitude a few days before Christmas.
At Christmas, the situation was totally wrong. When the children rolled out their gifts, he did not look at them and did not respond.
She said that his death was a huge trauma to them, but they have to overcome it: “In the family it has left empty.
This disciplines our heart.

The future of Bretto Kavanaugh hanged on his hair at the opening of the investigation
I thought if we could actually get something that he asked for – a limited length and scope study – maybe we would bring some unity – – said Mr. Flake on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the committee “is in strong supporters.
Why did Mr Kavanaugh and his supporters not want the FBI to open an investigation?
Only time is the reason for their opposition.
Only five weeks have been left before the mid-election, which will take place on 6 November, and if the Republicans are expected to turn out poorly, their efforts to elect the wanted person to the highest court in the country will be greatly weakened.
George Bush called the senators, trying to convince them to support Mr Kavanaugh, who worked for Bushui in the White House and met his wife Ashley, former Busho's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI submits its report?
A vote will take place in the Senate, which currently includes 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr Kavanaugh Senate can receive 50 votes, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to terminate his ties and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean deserts has decreased when Kim came to power
South Korean legislator said that the number of North Korean deserters to South Korea decreased when Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
According to Park Byeong-seugas, quoted by the South Korean Ministry of unification, 1 127 deserts were identified last year, compared to 2,706 deserts in 2011.
Mr Park said that the main factors were tighter border controls between North Korea and China and increased people's smuggling costs.
Pyongyang did not comment publicly.
In the end, many North Korean deserts offer South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that since the end of the Korean War, more than 30 000 North Koreans illegally crossed the border in 1953.
Many fled across China, which has the longest border with North Korea, and which is easier to cross than a heavily protected demilitarised zone (DMZ) between both Korea.
China treats deserters as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often force them back to their homeland.
The relations between North and South Korea, which are still fighting technically, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang in the centre of negotiations on the waiver of nuclear weapons.
This took place after the historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June in Singapore, when both agreed in principle to make the Korean Peninsula a nuclear-free zone.
On Saturday, however, Mr Ri Yong-ho, North Korea's Foreign Minister, accused the US of not changing the sanctions since then.
“If there is no confidence in the US, we will not be able to rely on our own national security, and under such circumstances we will not in any way be the first to deny ourselves unilaterally.” Mr Ri said during the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi Bretta Kavanaugh rescues “the hysterical, ” claiming that he is not eligible to serve in the Supreme Court
The minority leader of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, named the candidate for the judge of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh as “insterical, ” and claimed that he was not eligible to serve in the Supreme Court for his temperament.
These comments were made by N. Pelosi during the Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival by Ostine (Texas).
“I can’t really think that if a woman did so, it would be hysterical, ” said Mr Pelosi, who responded to the statements given by Mr Kavanaugh to the Senate Court Committee on Thursday.
Mr Kavanaugh has been emotionally accused of having committed sexual abuse against Dr Christine Blasey Ford when both teenagers were still.
During his introductory speech on family and secondary school time, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes in the face of shouting or overstretched.
He also completely condemned the democrats who had been in the committee, who had been accused of calling the \"Greek and Coordinated Destruction\" of being organized by the liberals, angering that Hillary Clinton defeated the Presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi argued that Mr Kavanaugh's evidence showed that he could not work in the Supreme Court because he had revealed his bias towards democracy.
“I think he disqualified himself by his statements and by the attack of the Clinton and the Democratic Party, ” she said.
It was asked whether Mr Kavanaugh's candidacy would be eliminated if the democratic majority in the House of Representatives had been confirmed, Mr Pelosi opposed.
“I will say yes – if he lies to Congress or to the FBI, he is not fit to perform his duties not only in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he works now,” said N. Pelosi.
Mr Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Regional Court of Appeal of Colombia.
Mr Pelosi added that she was concerned about the possible decisions of Mr Kavanaugh regarding the Accessible Law on Health Care or in the Roe v Wade case, since he was considered to be a conservative judge.
During its approval meetings, Mr Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether certain decisions of the Supreme Court would be annulled.
“It is now not the time for the hysterical, impartial character to say to the judge: “How wonderful it is, ” said N. Pelosi.
Power that women should enjoy
This is a legitimate criticism: finally, when the months have been spilled and even years have been built up, it cannot be said without tears.
“When we get angry, we cry, ” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“It doesn’t seem unusual to me, and for you ”
She went on to say: “I was helped greatly by a woman, the head of some company, who told me that she was crying when she was angry, but she had a certain method of crying. She told the man she was talking to at the time: “You may think that I am sad because I’m crying.
Actually, I'm angry...
And she just cry.
It looked like a genius to me...
The tears are considered to be an acceptable expression of anger, partly because they are generally misunderstood.
One of my most prominent memories is from one of the first works in the office, which mainly worked for men, and where I started to cry for indecisive anger once, and then my older woman, a harsh text, who was always a little afraid, and stretched me to the stairwell.
\"Never let them see you crying,\" said me.
- They don't know you're crazy.
They think you’re sad, so they’ll be happy to overcome you.
A member of the Congress of the Democratic Party from Colorado Patricia Schroeder worked with Gary Hartu during his presidential election campaign.
In 1987, when Mr Hart was caught on board an alien ship, “Monkey Business’s Aphorism, which represents an easyly permitted time), and withdrew his candidacy, Mr Schroeder found that there was no reason why he could not stand for the President himself.
“It wasn’t a well thought out decision,” laughingly told me in 30 years.
– There were already seven other candidates at that time, so one of them really did not need.
Someone called me “Snieguole with seven thumbs, ”
Not much time was left to raise the funds before the campaign was launched late, so she promised that she would not be applying for the 2 million dollars.
It was a kind of fight.
She noticed that some of her supporters, who had given men $1,000, had only distributed to her 250.
“ Maybe they thought I was getting a discount, ” she thought.
Speaking of the speech that announced that it was launching a formal campaign, it was so filled with emotions, such as gratitude of the supported people, a disappointment system that made it extremely difficult to raise funds and reach voters directly, not representatives, and anger for sexism, to blasphemed.
“You would think that I was nervous, ” recalled Mr Schroeder’s press reaction to her speech.
– You would have thought I was supported by the “Cleenex” shelf business.
I remember, I thought what would be recorded in my grave's monument.

How US and Chinese trading generation can benefit Beijing
The first halls in the U.S. and Chinese trading war were curated, and even though the battle was still far from complete, according to experts, the strife may eventually become beneficial to Beijing.
U.S. President Donald Trump gave his first warning this year a tax on key Chinese exports, including solar cells, steel and aluminium.
The most prominent resistance took place this week, when new tariffs entered into force, affecting goods worth $200 billion (150 billion), i.e. essentially one half of Chinese exports to the US.
Beijing responded to all of the measures at the same time, with the latest decision to put between five and ten percent of American goods worth a total of $60 billion.
China has sworn to fight the US teeth for the tooth, and this second largest global market does not seem to land in the near future.
Washington's sanctions would only mitigate if China complied with the requirements, but publicly bowed down in the US would be too tricky for China's President Xi Jinping.
Experts, however, say that if Beijing shoots its own party properly, the difficulties of trade war with the US may, in the long run, have a positive impact on China as it will reduce the interdependence of these markets.
“The fact that a rapid political solution in Washington or Beijing can create the conditions that would make the economies of both countries more difficult in fact than the observers have already recognised,” said Abigail Grace, an employee of the scientific institute Asia New America Security Centre.
According to the Syrian Minister for Foreign Affairs, the country is ready to accept returning refugees
Syria stands ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for assistance in the reconstruction of a country that has been destroyed by war lasting more than 7 years.
In speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Walid al-Moualem, the Foreign Minister said that the country's conditions are improving.
“The progress in combating terrorism in the area has made the situation much more stable and safer,” he said.
Governments continue their efforts to restore terrorist-demolished areas and restore the normal situation.
The voluntary return of refugees to a country that they have left behind by terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions against everyday life and well-being is already open.
According to UN estimates, about 5.5 million Syrians have left Syria since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem argued that the Syrian regime would gladly accept the aid by restoring the destroyed country.
However, it was also stressed that the country would not accept conditional support or assistance from countries supporting the uprising.
Europe won the ‘Ryder’ Cup victory in Paris
The European team, which concluded the U.S. team's final result is 16,5:10,5, won the 2018 \"Ryder\" Cup at the Le Golf National\" Square near Paris (France).
The U.S. has already lost for the sixth time in a row in Europe and has not won the “Ryder” Cup on the continent since 1993.
Europe recovered the crown when the Danish-origin captain Thomas Bjorn's team picked up a 14,5 point that was sufficient to defeat the United States.
The U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who struggled throughout the tournament, launched a blow from the starting ground right into the water of the 16th well in 3rd night in the match against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian player F. Molinari won all rounds and has become one of the four players who have achieved a result of 5-0 from 1979, when the tournament has acquired the current form.
The American Jordan Spieths 5:4 has won the lowest ranking in the European team Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson 2:1 with the highest rating in the world lost to English Ian Poulter, who may have played his last “Ryder” cup tournament.
The eight-Ryder Cup Veterans Spanish Sergio Garcia has become the most successful European player of this tournament ever, collecting 25.5 career points.
“I’m just crying, but I can’t control today.
It was a difficult year.
I am very grateful to Mr Thomas for having chosen me and believed me.
I am very happy, very happy to have the cup back.
Everything depends on the team, and I'm glad I could help it,” said Emotionally busy S. Garcia after the victory of Europeans.
He transmits the estafet to his compatriot John Ramm, who negotiated on Sunday units in the game 2:1 of the US golf legend Tiger Woods.
“I’m not really proud to win Tiger Woods,” said 23-year-old Rahm, “I grew up watching him play.
Woods lost all four of his wallets in France and now holds a record of a cup of career of 13-21-3-Ryder.
This is a strange statistics for one of the best players of all time who won the 14 biggest prizes and descending only to Jack Nicks.
The U.S. team did not succeed at the weekend to hit the barn, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who demonstrated a high-level game throughout the tournament.
After the enticing team appeared, U.S. captain Jim Furyk said: “I’m proud of these guys and they have fought.
It was a moment this morning when we put pressure on Europeans.
We're fighting.
I'm taking my hat against Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will regroup, I will work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud of being their captain.
It's going to bend your head down.
Our adversaries were superior to those of Jehovah.
