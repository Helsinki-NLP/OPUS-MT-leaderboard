When an English-speaking learns that a foreigner with whom he speaks does not understand something he says, he repeats exactly the same, but louder, as if this man were deaf. At no time comes into his mind that the choice of his words might be difficult, or that his expression could be easily perceivable, and that he could say it simpler with other words. As a result, a person not only still does not understand what he is saying, but also becomes irritated for being considered to be a deaf.
