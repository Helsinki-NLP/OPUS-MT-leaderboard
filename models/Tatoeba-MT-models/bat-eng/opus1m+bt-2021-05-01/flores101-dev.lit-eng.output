People broke glass in chairs, but the windows didn't break.
One of the glass was finally broken, and they began to climb through the window,\" said Franzzek Kowal, a living man.
The stars emit light and heat, because by combining (switching) hydrogen atoms to make up the more heavy elements, the energy is produced.
Scientists want to develop reactors that can produce energy in the same way.
However, this is a very difficult problem, and when we build a useful fusion reactor, we will only see it after many years.
The steel needle floats on the surface of the water due to surface tension.
Surface tension results from the fact that the water molecules on the surface of the water are drawn to each other much more forceful than the air molecules over them.
The water molecules form an invisible film on the surface of the water that allows the needle to float to the surface of the water.
The modern-fashioned blades have two edges, including an engulfed pit, which make it easier for two edges to get into the ice, even with a pass.
Because the bottom of the blades is slightly curved, the blades shift to one side or another, a brim that touchs the ice, also bends.
This allows the skater to turn the turn. If the bumpers turn to the right, the skater turns to the right, and if the bumpers turn to the left, the skater turns to the left.
To return to the earlier energy levels, they must get rid of the additional energy they have received from the light.
They do this by blowing out a small piece of light called photon.
Scientists refer to this process as “privileged radiation, ” because bright light stimulates atoms, causing photopollutant light to become a type of radiation.
The next image depicts atoms emitting photons. Of course, photons are much smaller in reality than in the picture.
The photos are smaller than the particles that make up the atoms!
After hundreds of hours of operation, the light bulb finally burns and the light bulb is no longer working.
The lamp should then be replaced.
You must first turn off the lamp switch or disconnect the wire.
This is important because in a socket that has a metal part of the lamp, the electric current can cause a strong electric shock if you touch the inner part of the socket or the metal base of the bulb until it is at least partly contained in the socket.
The main organ of the bloodstream is the heart; it pumps the blood.
Blood from the heart flows through blood vessels called arteries, and blood vessels called veins return to the heart, and the smallest blood vessels are called capillaries.
Not only the leaves but also very hard branches and roots of the teeth of Trieratops could be crushed.
Some scientists believe that triceratops have eaten tumors, such as plants that have been found in the creed period.
These plants are similar to a small palm tree with a crown of sharp leaves.
Perhaps Triceratops used his powerful beak to kill all the leaves before they were eaten.
Other scientists claim that these plants are very toxic, so it is unlikely that any dinosaur ate them, even though today lazy animals such as the parrot (the descendant of the dinosaur) can eat poisonous leaves or fruits.
What kind of force would you draw me into gravity? If you stood on the surface of Ii, you would weigh less than you were on the earth.
The person who weighs 200 pounds (90 kg) on Earth, Ijo weighs about 36 pounds (16 kg). So, of course, gravity attracts you less.
The sun has no crust on which can stand as on the ground. The entire sun is made up of gas, fire and plasma.
The gas becomes more rarer than it is from the center of the sun.
The visible outer part of the sun is called photosphere, meaning “light ball”
After about three thousand years in 1610 Italian astronomer Galilee noticed through the telescope that Venezuela had phases like the moon.
The phases exist because only one side of Venera (or the moon) is illuminated, which is turned to the Sun. Venera phase supported the Copernican theory of turning planets around the Sun.
A few years later, in 1639, the English astronomer Jederaph Horrocx watched the transit phenomenon of Venera.
Following the return of the Danish law territory, peace continued to prevail in England.

At first he called Hangul Alphabet Hunminjeongeum, meaning “just to teach people. ”
There are many the theories of Sanskrit’s appearance, and one of them brought his language from the west to India.
Sanskrit is an ancient language similar to Latin used in Europe.
Of course, the oldest book in the world was written in Sanskrit, and after the sanskrit of the riverished collection, it simply disappeared because of the hierarchy.
Sanskrit is a very complex and rich language that has become a source of many modern Indian languages (as is Latin, which is a source of European languages such as French and Spanish).
At the end of France’s battle, Germany started preparing for the invasion of the British island.
Germany referred to the operation under the code name “The lion of the sea, the majority of the British army’s heavy weapons and supplies were lost by evacuation from Dunkirk, making the army rather weak.
But the Royal fleet was still far more powerful than the German fleet (Russiansmarin) and could destroy any fleet of invasion that had been sent to the English Channel.
However, the Royal Navy has had very few bazaars near the likely invasive routes, because the Admirals feared that they would be charred during the German weather attack.
Let us first explain Italy’s plans: Italy was mainly Germany and Japan, the little brother.
Her army and the fleet were weaker, even though four new ships were built just before the war began.
The main aims of Italy were the African countries. In order to occupy these countries, she needed military departures so that they could plunder the Mediterranean and invade Africa.
To that end, they had to get rid of British bases and vessels in Egypt, and in addition to these actions, there was no need for Italian military ships to do any more.
Now about Japan. Japan, like Great Britain, was an island state.
Underwater vessels are vessels designed to sail underwater and stay there for a longer period of time.
Underwater ships were used in World War I and World War II. Then they were very slow and had a limited shooting distance.
At the beginning of the war, they sailed mostly on the surface of the water, but after improving and starting to operate more accurately on the radar submarine vessels were forced to dive in order not to be noticed.
German submarine vessels were referred to as “U Boat ” Germans did not have good navigation and control.
Because Germans have successfully used underwater ships, they are not allowed to have a large number after the war.
Yes! King Tutankhamon, sometimes called King Tutu or Boy King, is one of the most famous kings of ancient Egypt in modern times.
It is surprising that in ancient times he was not considered to be important, and he was not included in most of the ancient kings’ lists.
However, finding his grave in 1922 made him famous. Many ancient graves were robbed, and this grave was virtually untouched.
Many of the items buried with Tutanchamon, including thousands of artefacts made of precious metals and rare stones, were well preserved.
When the wheels were discovered with stencils, the Assyrians became easier, faster, and better equipped to cover the troops and other carriages.
Their dead - minded porching arrows were able to beat the armor of the adversaries. Some 1,000 years before Christ, the Assyrians had the first known artillery.
The Kavalery is the horse army. The furniture has not yet been invented, so Assyrian soldiers rang on the backs of the horses.
Many Greek politicians, scientists and artists are known. The most famous figure of this culture is the legendary blind poet Homer, who created two masterpieces of Greek literature: poem-Iliad- and Odyssia-
Sofoklis and Aristofan are still popular dramatics, and their plays fall among the world's best literary works.
Another famous Greek is the mathematician Pitagor, who is best known in his famous theorama, which describes the ratio of the sides of the rectangles.
It is believed that it is between the second and the fourth most widely used languages in the world.
The number of people who speak languages depends on whether or not much-needed pronunciation is included.
It is estimated that there are some 340 to 500 million users and that 800 million may understand that language.
Hindi and the words of the urde languages are similar but written in different ways; on daily basis, consumers can usually communicate with each other.
About the 15th century, culture in Northern Estonia has been heavily influenced by Germany.
Some German monks wanted to draw God closer to the natives.

The European part of Turkey (eastern Trakia or Rumelia on the Balkan Peninsula) represents 3% of the country.
The territory of Turkey is more than 1 600 kilometres (1 000 miles) and 800 km (500 miles) wide, in irregular rectangular shape.
The territory of Turkey covers 783 562 square kilometres (300 948 sq. m.), of which 755 688 square kilometres (291 773 sq. m.) are located in southwestern Asia and 23 764 square kilometres (9 174 sq. m.) are located in Europe.
Turkey is the 37th largest country in the world and is about the size of the French metropolitan area and the United Kingdom combined.
Turkey is surrounded from even three sides by the sea: the west of Egypt, the north of the Black and the south of the Mediterranean.
Luxembourg has a long history but has become independent in 1839.
The current parts of Belgium were in the past owned by Luxembourg, but they became Belgium after the Belgian Revolution of the fourth decade of the 19th century.
Luxembourg has always tried to remain a neutral country, but Germany has occupied it during both World War I and World War II.
In 1957, Luxembourg became the founder of an organisation that is today called the European Union.
Drukgyal Dong is a destroyed fortress and Buddhist monastery in the upper part of Paro district (Phondey village).

Learning to create interactive media requires standard, traditional skills and tools developed and managed through interactive lessons ( editing of cameras, audio and video recordings, storytelling, etc.).
By taking an interactive design you will have to re-assess your assumptions about the creation of media production and learn non-linear thinking.
The interactive design requires project components to be connected to each other, but also makes sense as individual entities.
The lens deficit of the image array is that the complexity of the fireplace and the number of lens elements needed to reach the range of the focal length require significantly more basic lenses.
This problem is declining as the lens producers achieve higher production standards for lenses.
This allowed photos of equivalent quality to those obtained by using a fixed focus distance lens to be used with a closer lens.
Another objective deficiency of the optical enhancement function is that the maximum aperture (speed) of this lens is usually less.
It is therefore difficult to use low-expensive lenses without flashing under bad lighting conditions.
One of the most common problems when trying to convert a movie into DVD is that the image expands beyond the display range.
Many TV sets are produced to meet the needs of the general public.
For this reason, everything you see through the TV was cut down from above, down and side.
This is done so that the image covers the full screen. This is called an image extending beyond the screen display limits (overscan-3).
Unfortunately, when creating a DVD, its edges will likely also be cut off, and if the video subtitles were too close to the bottom, they will not be fully displayed.
The traditional medieval castles have long stormed the imagination of the people – many have remembered the fights of knights, noble poems and traditions of the ruling era of King Arthur.
Even when standing between the ruins of a thousand years old, it is easy to imagine the sounds and smells of long-standing battles, almost hearing a hustle of hooves on stones and smelling fear from underground pits.
But is our imagination based on reality? Why were the castles built at all? How were they designed and built?
The period is characterised by Kirbi Mukslou castles which are more similar to the established palace than the true castle.
Its large glazed windows and thin walls would not have tolerated a long, intense attack.
In the 1980 ’ s, when Lord Hastings started building it, the country was quite calm and it only needed to protect itself from small numbers of fearing robbers.
The balance of power was a system whereby the peoples of Europe sought to maintain national sovereignty across all European countries.
The idea was that all the peoples of Europe had to try to prevent one of them from becoming powerful, so national governments often changed allies in order to maintain balance.
The Spanish successor war was the first war, the main object of which was the balance of power.
This was a major change because Europe’s powerful people lost their claim for religious wars. That is why the thirty-year-old war is the last war called a religious war.
The temple in Ephesus was destroyed on 21 July 356 B.C.E. at the time of the intentional ignition of Herostrat.
It is said that he sought glory at any price, and the evil Ephesianss declared that the name of Herostrat would never be written.
The Greek historian Strabo later noted the name, so we know today. The temple was destroyed the same night as Alexander the Great was born.
Alexander, as king, offered to pay for the restoration of the temple, but this proposal was rejected. Later, after Alexander died, the temple was rebuilt in 323 B.C.E.

The civilization of the Indus Valley was a bronze-age civilization in the northwest of India, most of today's Pakistan and some north-western Indian and north-eastern Afghanistan regions.
Civilization flourished in the Indus basin. It was named after the river.
Although some scientists speculate that civilization was also present in the currently dried Sarasvati river basin, it would be intended to be called the Indo-Sarasavati civilization, and some call the Harapa civilization, the first place of which was buried in the third decade of the last century.
The military ambitions of the Roman Empire have contributed to medical progress.
Emperor Augustus began to hire a doctor and even formed the first Roman medical corps to use after the battle.
The surgeons had knowledge of various sedatives, including morphine, derived from aguona seeds extracts, and scopolamine derived from eschar seeds.
They managed amputation to protect patients against gangrene, as well as Turniquets and arterial spats to stop the blood flow.
Over the centuries, the Roman Empire has achieved great achievements in the field of medicine and has built up much of the knowledge that is still important today.
Simple origami is an origami which is subject to a restriction that only one bending can be carried out at the same time; more complex bendings, such as inverted ones, are not allowed and all bendings are carried out at normal positions.
It was created in the 1990 ’ s by John Smith to help non-experienced or traffic-restrictive lampers.
Children who are relatively young begin to perceive racial and racial stereotypes, and these racial stereotypes influence behavior.
For example, if a child is identified with a racial minority who, according to stereotypes, does not succeed in school, he usually becomes a poor student when he learns about the stereotypes associated with his race.
“Myspace – is the third most popular website used in the United States, which currently has 54 million profiles.
These websites have received considerable attention, especially in the field of education.
These websites have positive aspects, for example, it is easy to identify a class page that can contain blogs, videos, photographs and other features.
This page can be easily reached by providing only one web address in order to be able to remember and enter students who may find it difficult to use a keyboard or write.
It can be customized to be easy to read, as well as add as little or as little color as desired.
Disturbance in attention “is a neurological syndrome defined as the three classic symptoms of impulseness, paleness and hyperactivity or excess energy.
It is not a development disorder, it is a learning disorder that affects 3% to 20% of all children, perhaps as many as 2 million American children.
Children with an activity and concentration disorder find it difficult to focus on things like learning, but they can focus on doing things they like, for example, playing games, watching cartoons or writing sentences without any sign of divorce.
These children can cause many problems because they are “at risk of doing things, wrought, and opposed to officials, in order to stimulate their brains, because they are not able to do so in normal ways.
A disturbance of attention affects relationships with peers, because other children do not understand why they do so, why they write so, or do not understand that they have a different level of maturity.
As a result of the change in the ability to acquire knowledge and training, the basic rate of acquisition of knowledge changed.
The information was obtained in another way.There was no pressure to remember separately, but more attention was focused on the ability to remember the text.
In fact, Renaissance significantly changed his attitude towards learning and the dissemination of knowledge.
Unlike other primates, hominides no longer use their hands when moving, maintaining weight, or burning under trees.
The hand and foot of the chimpanzee are of similar size and length, indicating that the hand retains weight when using the gears.
The human hand is shorter than the foot, the palm of the hand is straighter.
This shift in hand-specialization from a spiriting to manipulation reveals the age of 2 to 3 million old hand-bone fossils.
Some people believe that many and often artificially produced conscious dreams may be very distressing.
The main reason for this is the outcome of clear dreams that prolong the time between restless sleep (REM) phases.
When night there are less REM phases, this state when you actually sleep and the body recovers, becomes quite rare and this causes problems.
It's as if you wake up every twenty or thirty minutes and watch the TV.
The effect depends on how often at night the brain tries to dream consciously.
The Italians in North Africa did not succeed almost from the start. In the week of the war announced by Italy on 10 June 1940, the British eleventh hussars force occupied the Fort to Capuzzo-Libya.
The British took Lastucci, the Italian Chief Engineer General, to the east of Bardy.
On 28 June, Marshal Italo Balbo, the Libyan Governor and the obvious heir to Musolini, killed his own shots when he allowed him into Tobruk.

A winning player who carries out the least impact or moss stick to complete the square.
The game is played on the grass, and the grass area around the well is cut shorter and called a rowing court.
Perhaps the most common type of tourism, which many relate to travel, is recreational tourism.
This is when people go to a place that is very different from their normal daily life to relax and relax.
Common beaches, thematic parks and campings are the most popular holidaymakers.
If a certain place is visited to learn about its history and culture, such a type of tourism is referred to as cultural tourism.
Tourists can visit various places to be visited by a particular country or can simply focus on one area.
As the colonists saw these activities, they also mobilised reinforcements.
The units strengthening the front position consisted of the 1st and 3rd New Hampshire regiment after 200 soldiers, led by Colonel John Stark and James Reed (both later turned into generals).
Stark’s men took positions along the fence at the northern end of the colonites.
When the space along the mysterious river in the north and east of the peninsula arose because of the equator, they quickly extended the fence by a short stone wall to the northern end, ending at the water boundary of the small beach.
Gridley or Stark built a column about 100 ft (30 m) in front of the fence and indicated that no one would shoot until the troops were over.
The American plan referred to coordinated attacks in three different directions.
General John Cadwalder initiated a fraudulent attack against the British Crew in Bordentune in order to prevent road reinforcement.
General James Ewings transferred 700 reserve troops through the river Trenton Ferry, took the bridge over the Assunpink stream, and prevented the enemy from fleeing.
The main forces of 2 400 men crossed the river nine miles north of Trenton and then split into two groups: one led by Green and another by Sullivan to launch the attack before dawn.
If you run half a mile, the importance of speed is reduced and endurance becomes absolute necessity.
Of course, a mile of the first half of the class, capable of overcoming this distance in two minutes, must have a certain speed but, in any case, it is necessary to develop endurance.
Cross run in winter and gym exercise for the upper part of the body-building work is the best preparation for the running season.
Just an appropriate nutrition practice will not lead to an elite performance, but it may have a significant impact on the overall well-being of young setbacks.
By maintaining a healthy energy balance, maintaining efficient fluid consumption habits and understanding the principles of different food supplements, athletes can improve their performance and enjoy sports more.
The average distance run is relatively cheap sports; however, there are many misconceptions about certain equipment that is needed to carry out it.
If necessary, products can be purchased, but they do not have any significant impact on efficiency or will not have any significant impact on them.
A sportsman may feel that he chooses a product, even if he does not make any real gain.
It may be considered to be one of the most important components of the component matter.
This is a very complex object, which, according to the simplified Boro model, consists of a central kernel around which electrons run; it is slightly similar to planets around the sun – see Figure 1.1.
The nuclear material consists of two particles, neutrons and protons.
Protons have a positive electrical charge and neutrons have no charge. Electrons have a negative electrical charge.
To check the victim, you have to investigate the place first to ensure your safety.
As you approach him or her, you need to draw attention to the position of the victim if there are obvious signs of danger.
If you get hurt by trying to help, you can only get the situation worse.
The results of the study showed that depression, fear and excessive response are associated with pain and disability in people suffering from lower back pain.
At regular weekly pa sessions, the condition was only a tendency to see everything through the prism of the disaster, rather than the effects of depression and fear.
Those involved in regular activities needed more help with the negative perception of pain, separating chronic pain from normal physical discomfort.
Vision – the ability to see – depends on the sensed organs of the visual system – the eyes.
There are so many different eye patterns, whose complexity varies according to the body’s requirements.

Chemical elements and compounds can be transferred from one state to another unchanged.
Nitrogen gases have the same properties as liquid nitrogen. Liquid life density is higher, but molecules are the same.
Another example is water. Its compound consists of two hydrogen atoms and one atom of oxygen.
Its molecular structure remains unchanged, whether it is gas, liquid or solid.
Although the physical state may change, the chemical composition remains the same.
Time is around us and affects all our activities, but it is difficult to understand it.
For thousands of years, researchers in religion, philosophy, and science were studying.
We experience time as the consequences of events that take place from the future to the past.
The timing can also be understood in terms of how we compare the duration (length) of events.
You can mark your own last time by watching recurring cyclical events. Cyclic events are constantly recurring events.

Convergence-based thinking models are problem-solving approaches which require a combination of different ideas or areas.
This approach focuses on speed, logic, accuracy, factual determination, re-application of existing methods and collection of information.
The most important aspect of this kind of thinking is just one answer. You only think about two answers: right or wrong.
This type of thinking is related to certain scientific or standard procedures.
People with such thinking have logical thinking, can remember trends, solve problems and work with scientific trials.
People are the most advanced species that are best able to understand others.
This means that we can successfully predict what other people perceive, intend to do, think, know what they want.
One of these abilities – understanding other people's intentions – is very important. It makes it possible to resolve the possible uncertainty of physical actions.

MRT is based on a physics phenomenon, called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), discovered by Felix Bloch (working at Stanford University) and Edward Purcel (working at Harvard University) in the 1930s.
Because of this resonance, magnetic field and radio waves force atoms to spread small radio signals.
In 1970, doctor and scientist Raimonds Damadian discovered the basis for using magnetic resonance photographs as a medical diagnostic tool.
Four years later, a patent was granted which was the first in the world in the field of MRT.
In 1977 Dr. Damadian completed the construction of a first-completed magnetic resonance reader called ‘unscrew’

The summer is mostly home to a couple of thousands of people in those places, and few in the winter.
The depth of the Antarctic region is an uninhabited pantyhose, covering 2-3 km of ice.
Sometimes the specialists fly to the depth of the continent to climb through the mountains or reach the South Poles, where there is a large base.
The cross (or road) of the South Pole is a 1,600 km long road from the Macmerd Station on the coast of the Ross Sea to the Pole.
It is a pressed snow with filled and flag marked cracks, and can only be driven by special tractors that pull rails with fuel and supplies.
They were not very intrusive, so the road led around the transantarctic mountains on a flat hill.
In the winter, the most frequent causes of accidents are skiing roads, sidewalks and especially stairs.
