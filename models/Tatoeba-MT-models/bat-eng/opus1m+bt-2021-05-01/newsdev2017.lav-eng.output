New questions on California Water Supply Project
Critics and the state legislator say that they want to know more about who pays for the USD 16 billion project supported by Governor Jerry Brown, according to the leading representative of California's Water Supply Administration, that the Brown Administration offers government funding to complete the construction of two huge water tunnels.
Critics claim that the government described by the Los Angeles metropolis Water Supply Authority may run counter to the long-standing statements made by the State that the various local water supply administrations, not California itself, would pay for the Brain vision to extend two equal 35-mile tunnels to land the water south of the Sacramento River, mainly to Central and South California.
Initial expenditure on the construction of tunnels of USD 248 million, yet authorised by the supervisory authority, has already been launched by the federal audit investigation.
On Wednesday, the state legislators also ordered an audit of the state’s expenditure on tunnel construction.
On Thursday, State Spyker Nancy Vogel said that despite the water supply management accounts in Los Angeles, money from the State's general budget will not be used to complete the current planning phase of the twin tunnels.
However, tunnel opponents and a group of taxpayers were critical on Thursday, and the Assembly's representative, Susan Ega, one of the statutory officers behind this week, asked for explanations to be sent to the State on Thursday.
\"It's a game with shopkeepers,\" said David Wolf, the legal director of Howard Jarvis's Taxpayers' Association.
In my opinion, it is called up with yesterday's audit (demand): there are many more questions than answers.
The tunnel project has confirmed Brauns and some politically influential water administrations and water users in Central and Southern California.
Supporters claim that tunnels will benefit the environment and provide Californians with safer water supplies.
The opponents claim that they are worried that the state will use tunnels to divert too much water from the Sacramento River and the San Francisco Bay, causing damage to Northern California and further endangering native species.
Metropolises and other water supply administrations, which are to receive tunnel water, have yet to undertake to pay for their insecurity as to whether investing huge amounts of water will actually bring enough water to repay.
The same water supply authorities also announced this year that they would not pay for the completion of the current preparatory work unless the project was first authorised by the supervisory authority.
On Thursday, in a monthly report published by the Los Angeles Water Supply Authority on the tunnel project, the State stated that the additional funding for the completion of the planning phase would be provided from the state or the federal budget.
After all the local water supply authorities spent on the project, including $63 million from his water supply, the State is expected to use state money to complete its planning, ” said Bob Muir, a spokesman of Los Angeles’s Water Supply Authority.
He further addressed questions to Vogel, the spyker of the state.
Vogel said that the state planned to allocate money to the completion of tunnel planning at the cost of the existing half-year old water network, the Stata water project.
The tunnel development opponents, however, point to a regulation issued in 2009 that, according to them, prevents the State from spending money on tunnel construction, while the water authorities that will benefit from it will not accept payment obligations for them.
“The project contractor has promised to pay for this project, and they have used financial tricks to circumvent these commitments,” said Patrija Šieferle, environmental consultant and an old planned tunnel opponent.
That raises questions about where this money was suddenly found.
Business group referral to China Cyber Security Act
The coalition of international business groups has called on China to change the proposed rules on cyber security by warning that they will harm trade and isolating the country.
The letter to the Prime Minister of China, Li Kecjan, has been signed by 46 groups from the USA, Europe, Asia and Latin America, showing global concern that the rules could restrict or suspend access to the Chinese information security products market.
The signatories include the US Chamber of Commerce, the European Service Forum and groups from Japan, Korea and Mexico.
The proposed rules require suppliers to demonstrate to the Chinese authorities how security products work and how information about Chinese citizens will be stored in the country.
The last letter, dated Wednesday, says that it could make data theft easier and lessen access to Chinese customers.
Chemical explosion in Tiandzin: Year passed since the tragedy
Zhang Mengfan claims that the public deserves to know what happened in Tiangin.
The Chinese leaders plan quiet memory events to commemorate the first anniversary of a large-scale chemical explosion that killed 173 people, but not everyone agrees.
John Sadvort reports from Tiandin.
Almost anywhere else in the world would be an anniversary of a disaster of such a magnitude, a time that the people remember and remember.
However, not in China.
Although a memorial service is being held in the city of Tajina for the memory of some dead firefighters, such memorial events are being excluded.
The Communist Party's controlled media tells what they can and cannot say, and some surviving and deceased family members are warned not to talk to the foreign press.
However, Zhang Mengfan, 23 years old, does not want to remain silent.
“On this anniversary, the public should somehow know what happened, ” he tells me.
I don't want silence.
On August 12, last year, Zhang was the radio operator at the military fire brigades, which were only a mile away from the epicentre of explosions.
“Tonight the call was received 22.53 a.m. and we started sending my teammates, ” he says.
They could come in 10 minutes instead of the event.
Commands from other parts of the city also rushed to delete a large fire in a chemical storage.
None of them drew attention to the fact that large amounts of volatile and toxic substances were unlawfully stored, well above the authorised levels and without proper monitoring.
The fire began when it was allowed that the lot of nitrocellulose - the chemicals used in nail lacquers - dries and then burns in summer tehnology.
It was then spread in a huge area of 800 tonnes of ammonium nitrate fertiliser.
Windows and a fire-fighter depot were used to trigger the roof, where Zhangs Mengfan was waiting for radio panel news from the scene.
This information was not received either.
“When I saw a mushroom cloud, I fell into despair, ” he told me.
I knew what that would mean for my friends.
Out of his 26 units of firefighters who were sent to the explosion site that night, eight of them never returned.
Many others suffered severe burns and other injuries.
The largest of the two major explosions was likened to the earthquake, and the wave of the explosion was seen many miles away.
The total loss is estimated at over USD 1 billion, including more than 300 destroyed buildings.
A total of 173 people, 104 of whom were firefighters, lost their lives.
Neither has the remains of the eight humans been found.
The official government investigating authorities were unequivocally responsible for corruption, political communications and formal secret agreements, which allowed circumvention of the rules and disregarding the security systems.
First of all, such warehouses should never have been built close to dwellings.
More than 100 officials and management representatives of the company have been subjected to some form of disciplinary or criminal investigation.
Thus, while the government can point to progress being made - thousands of decent homes and compensations for its citizens, these sensitive issues remain topical.
The tragedy has revealed a gap in a system where rapid economic growth is a priority and the lack of independent monitoring is a fact.
So the courage and sense of duty of the evening are undoubted, and yet, without fire, the image of the hero turns out to be rather glamorous.
It is a firefighter, a victim who has been sent out unpredicted in the fight against a man-made disaster that could be prevented.
Zhang Mengfian will not work any more in the fire protection service, but will attend the memorial church service in Tiandzin.
He will bring a message to his heart about his perishing companions.
I would like to say to them most: I have visited your parents and gone well.
Leave your parents in my sense.
I am now a member of your family.
I will perform your duties as sons.
Cold spring could affect the shooting season of scotto rubble
The slaughter season of Scottish rubble will start later, as this year the number of birds has fallen due to cold weather.
In several properties shooting has been postponed, because many of the young Ruby have not survived under the cold spring conditions.
Celebrating the start of the season, the Scottish Games Organization (SGA) tells us that the shooting of rubbles provides more work than the Edinburgh festivals.
However, the Animal Protection Charity Foundation OneKind calls for an end to the \"brutal killing of birds\":
Harry Huuton, director of the organization, said: “The work invested in providing large numbers of games for shooting is huge and undoubtedly involved in any contentious activity.
It is no surprise that society is turning away from this so-called sport and calling on the government to ban the cruel, unnecessary employment enjoyed by only a very small part of Scotland's population.
The land owners both insist that they commit to maintaining the number of birds and that rubbing is important for the development of the rural economy.
The chairman of the SGA, Alex Hogg, said that the sector provided 8 800 full-time jobs per year in the most remote regions, and that it had been a rich workspace, in precarious times.
He said: “Compared to many European countries, Scotland has not been so rooted in hunting: culture, and some people do not know how the shooting season has an economic impact on the country.
Hoggs said, the number of jobs provided during shooting exceeds the number of jobs created by Edinburgh at the international festival, friedge festival, tattoo festival and the Old Year evening celebration together.
He added: “The employment situation in Scotland is currently rather worrying, especially in the oil and gas sector, so game operators and their families want to see the industry flourishing.
We want to work with the Scottish Government to make sure that hard-working people can also rely on these jobs in the future.
The RSPB Scotland considers that at least eight golden eagles were killed near the habitat.
Many game operators admit that rubbing is not generally popular, but the SGA claims that the industry “has taken important steps in terms of best practice.
The opening day of the Ruby Shooting Season is traditionally known as the “Holy twelfth...
However, there is still a lot of discussion on this type of sport, and the management of rubble shooting sites is linked to persecution by some nature protection authorities.
On Thursday, RSPB Scotland said that within less than five years in the mountains of Monadliath, southeast of Invernes, eight ringed golden eagles have disappeared.
The Nature Conservation Charity Foundation considers that they have been illegally killed near the rubble shooting sites and that their satellite bracelets have been destroyed.
Rosanna Kaningema, Scottish Environment Minister, said that these reports are “very worrying and sad...
Mrs Caningham charged officials to analyse the evidence of about 90 surviving and missing eagles with transmitters in order to determine whether there is a trend in criminal activities.
The Scottish Trawls Group blamed RSPB for trying to suppress firepower before the start of the rubble season, and also said that there was no clear evidence that the birds would even have died in the area of the Naandalita Mountains.
Rio Olympics 2016: British Pidge Britain won silver trampling
British Representative, Peidjas, for silver slide attack
Brian Pidge has become the first British woman to be at the medal in the Olympic Games to fight silver with Rio.
The 25th of Peige lacked 0.425 points to gold, because the Canadian representative Rosanna McLenan won the second Olympic title in a row with a score of 56.465.
The World Champion, the Chinese representative, Lee Dana was at bronze, while the second British finalist, Catherine Driskola, finished on the sixth.
I can't believe I won the Olympic medal.
I'm so happy to say clearly to the emotional Pidge.
I had no idea that it was a medal, but I was able to demonstrate the best performance, so I was so happy that all the training and hard work was rewarded.
I am so happy that I could get off to the finals together with Keta, one of the representatives in the finals would be historic, but we were there two.
Before the Olympic silver wins, the highest achievement in international competitions was the fifth place in the 2015 World Cup in Denmark.
Tramplein jumping into the Olympic Games was included in 2000, and this is the first time that British women have managed to get to the finals.
Medal reaction.
The British team's representative, Nathan Bailey, the only man's competition on the trampoline on Saturday, was in ecstasy.
Hanna Velana, who participates in the Olympic Games for the second time, quickly began to praise the achievement of Peidžas.
Paige has acquired bachelor’s in biology with excellence in the University of Shefield.

By cutting off the end of the game, the thrilled celebrations went on the streets, joyfully and dancing.
“Some people, even on the crowded streets of Suvas, stopped their vehicles and joined Fiji’s flags with celebrations without addressing the small congestion that they caused, ” reports Fiji Times.
Celebration will certainly continue on the weekend and next week.
Irish Prime Minister: Finn Harps 0-5 Derry City
Aaron Macenef was shot by two first-half-time criminals in favour of the guestman's team in Finnpark.
Derry City has risen to the second one of the Prime Ministerial, gaining a convincing victory with the result of 5-0 in the fight against Finn Harps.
In charge, Aaron Macenef put forward a ‘confident strife’ by successfully executing two first half-time criminals granted for violations against Luke Schubert.
Nathan Boyle entered the gate at the beginning of the second half of the period, and Schubert beat his opponent in the fourth quarter before Kita Varda late by closing the opponent's defeat in Finnpark.
Derry is on one point in front of Cork City, and both teams will meet in the decisive game on Monday evening in Brendwell.
It was Derry's first victory over its north-western competitors in Taseson, and they were bothering me on the HARPS side.
Makenef saved the opening blow 17 minutes after Kīran Col's march against Schubert, although the violation turned out to be outside the court.
There was no doubt about the second penalty blow, with former - Caramel stripes - half guard Barry Moloy falling into the land and Macenef achieving 2-0 minutes after the break.
Boyle put the exact point after Dīna Gervis's hand in the middle of his foot in the eighth minute after the game's restart.
The Derry City gatekeeper Gerard Dohertie had a peaceful evening, but managed to protect the gate perfectly, going beyond David's Skallium's best opening.
Schubert left the ball past Col before he broke out at 83 minutes, and soon followed by the Varda Gudra's rebound over the Harps Centre protector Richard Bras.
It was the Darry's biggest victory in the competition series and the great preparation for closing the game with Cork.
Mass-survey test at Invernes College University of High Ages and Islands (UHI)
The entire 20 students course could have failed in the UHI Highest Media Course of Invernes College.
Most of them were 17 and 18-year-olds who hoped to use the mark in their studies to join the university.
The UHI of the Inverness College claims that quality assurance processes are applied, adding that the Scottish Qualification Authority (SQA) is investigating this case.
The SQL press secretary said that the highest media assessment of 2016 available across the country was – as intended –
Twenty students signed up to the course offered and evaluated by UHI at Invernes College.
Many of the students were young people living in rural areas who were studying online, but often had to go to Invernesa College from their homes, such as Ločeibera.
One student’s father said that after publishing his daughter in social media that she had not received any evaluation of her job, at least 10 more also came out with a declaration that she had not received any evaluation of her course work.
He said directly to the BBC News Scotland that the five more people who learned this course at Invernesa College last year and whom he was able to contact said that this was also the case with them.
The situation means that his daughter is unable to provide a place at the University of Glasgow, but she will be able to accept another university offering through qualifications obtained at school.
However, her father said that there were others who attended a college media course that was unsuccessful and that was now in forgetfulness and uncertainty as to whether their course would be reviewed and rated with a mark to enable them to join universities.
The UHI of Inverness College is part of University of High Ages and Islands.
Diāna Rovlinsone, head of Invernesa College and executive director, said: “We have the results of examinations and the success of students is very important...
This is also confirmed by the excellent review of Her Majesty's Education Inspectorate (HMIE) received this year, as well as by the improved levels of achievement in both further education and higher education compared to the past year.
As every year we carry out a review of all the published results, compared with the forecasts for each student.
In the case of this specific course, standard quality assurance measures were taken and the evaluation body recently reported significant improvements in the presentation and management of this assessment and confirmed that the evaluations were in line with national standards.
SQA is currently investigating this case at our request.
QUE press secretary said: “We are glad that the assessment of the highest media in 2016 was going as planned and that candidates had the opportunity to show their understanding of the subject –
Many candidates have shown good performance and there was a slight increase in the A-C score compared to the same qualification last year.
It was drawn up in accordance with previous and model documents and in accordance with our course and evaluation specifications.
Brothers put in prison for samurai sword - blood alcohols - Kilmarnoca
Jason Braden was attacked with samurai sword, knife, and nunchers.
Two brothers were imprisoned for killing a man with a samurai sword after a drug-related drug theft in Airshire, who turned out to be “aspirated as an alcohol...
Upuris Jason Braiden (38) was assembled several times in his home in Kilmarnok on 5 July 2015.
In Glasgow, James Clark (36) will be sentenced to at least 22 years in prison after being sentenced to murder.
His brother John (38) was sentenced to 10 years after he was sentenced to 10 years after he was sentenced to less serious charges for murder without a prior intention.
When applying for prison sentence for both men, Judge Bill Danlop told the brothers that they had committed “a cruel, cruel and wild attack. ”
He rejected any assumption that Mr Braid was sleeping and waiting for them, armed with a samurai sword.
Judge Danlop added: “You plan, together, illegal entry with at least one knife and no one of them...
Jason Braden may have been a drug dealer, but he was a son, father, and friend.
You wiped him out.
After the arrest of both men in prison, the criminal police inspector who led the investigation said: “Jon and James Clark have caused the death of Jason Bradyden to occur.
Going out in 38 years of age in such terrible circumstances is a heartbreaking situation that the family must survive.
The court heard earlier that the Kilmarnok brothers decided to abduct Bryden’s golden bracelet, which they had given him in exchange for drugs.
Both of them went under the influence of alcohol and drugs to his house, masked their faces with scarves, and armored with a knife and an east fight against nunches.
The sword used in the murder is believed to have belonged to the deceased.
Neighbors said that they saw Clark attack Brian when he was sitting on the sofa at the window and heard him shouting.
The prosecutor Richard Godard at the hearing said: “The attack on this man was being endured, chaotic...
The murder was described as “blood alcohol ”
In addition to his injuries, during the attack on the knife stab, Braiden suffered severe injuries with a drum object.
Three days later, he died at Kilmarnokas Kroshaus’s hospital.
Both brothers fail to admit by murder.
When giving evidence, James Clark, who had been tried 38 times before, including in an attempt at murder, said: “I didn’t want it; it was an accident.
John Clark, who had already been tried 23 times before, said that he had only engaged in helping a brother who, according to him, had been attacked by Braden...
Male sentenced to prison for shaking and killing a son of his baby’s age
David Sinkler acknowledged his guilt at the murder of a child in his home in Eastkill 2012 .
A man who shakes and killed his baby’s anger in an outburst because he did not want to eat, sentenced to seven years and three months imprisonment.
David Sinkler shook Joshua four months old when he lost control of his home at Laitkillbreak, South Lancashire, on December 6, 2012.
The cause of death was found only after a medical trial.
Sinkler (34) was originally accused of murder, but was found guilty of murder without prior intent.
At the High Court of Glasgow, Lord Breiseidl Sinkler said: “You attacked your son of a baby by shaking him up, causing injury from which he died.
You should have known this when you shaken him, but you did not discover it.
Only after thorough medical examinations will you know what has been done.
Your wife believed you.
Now she feels handed over and can no longer support you.
Lord Breiseid described the consequences of Joshua’s death as ‘catatrophy, ’ for all, adding: “Nothing will return Joshua any more...
In the past, the court found that on the day the child died, Sinkler and his wife, Cursty, had gone with Joshua to swim and to shop in Eastkill.
17.30 In Cērsty Sinklere went to meet her mother and sister.
Just 11 minutes later, Sinkler called her, who sounded--
He said to her: “Jewing do not breathe as it may come, straight come home,
Then he ended the conversation and called 999.
The infant was immediately taken to Hermara’s hospital where she died.
At first, the cause of Joshua’s death was not clear, but he was looked at by a judicial team of medical experts who found the consequences of the injuries suffered shortly before death in the eyes and brain, and such injuries were not possible by chance.
One expert, Dr. Peter Richard, child neurosurgeon at the Oxford University of John Redcliffe, said: “This is because the child has been shaken and thus has been injured and has become more powerful than it has been in everyday life.
The representative of defence, Jan Djgid, told the court that Sinkler was “extremely sorry ” about what he had done.
Rio Olympics 2016: Hloja Tatone threatened by July Jephimov positions
Britain’s representative, Tatone, leaves hands in bronza 200 m swimming
British representative Hloy Tatone criticises the participation in Rio games by the swimmer Julia Jefimova, who was controversially evaluated, after the Russian representative rushed him over 200 metres in swimming.
Jefimova, who was authorised to participate in the games following a complaint against a participation ban on doping, won the silver, leaving Tatoni in fourth place.
“I would have liked them to be a pure gamer, ” then said a 20 - year - old Welsh swimmer.
I didn't say who was there.
I'm not satisfied with it, but that's it.
Jefimova, who won the second prize, learned about his participation only three days ago.
I don't want to see people get out of sports, but I don't think it's right.
She didn't have to compete, and the 20 - year - old British representative had to win the medal.
Rio won the seventh medal of gold for Japan in 2016, beat it to Jefimovas, which was on the silver medal.
The Chinese representative Ginsling This was at bronze, just six seconds in advance of the fourth one of the remaining Tatoni.
Molly Renshova, 20 years old, was a British teammate who finished his sixth team.
“Left in fourth place is a little disappointment, no matter what you are in front, ” added Taton.
It's a great experience, and I'm a little disappointed about the fourth place.
I'm so close to the medal, and that would have been a dream.
However, the final experience of our own training is an excellent experience I will take with me in the coming years.
It was a little disappointment, but in the long term it will make me strong, and it makes me increasingly seeking the medal, so I hope I will see it closer next time.
The Tatone only lags for 0,01 seconds from the British record of women 200 m swimming in the finals.
\"Everyone should be given a second chance,\" - Jephimov.
Jefimowa, who said she was tired to answer questions about her doping past, defended her right to Reboot Rio.
In 2013 she was banned from 16 months after finding the traces of anabolic steroids in her body.
Sports Arbitration (CAS) established that athletes could not be denied participation in Rio games because they had already been sanctioned in advance.
CAS dealt with my complaint and I won.
If someone does not like it and someone else has a different view, they can turn to CAS, ” she explained.
I do not support doping, and I have never used it.
In the second case, it was certainly not my fault.
Everyone must have a second chance.
When you drive and prescribe you a penalty receipt, no one puts you in jail.
Ben Pulf wins 50 freestyle swimming
Earlier installed a British record to win a place for men 50 m freestyle swimming in the finals.
The Union's champion Plus (21) set off distance in 21,54 seconds for the fifth fastest qualified Friday final (02:44 BST Saturday).
Your delegation is shameless and rude
In the Rio Olympics, Indian sports minister Viyy Goels has had a rather striking personality, often a couch in triplets, encouraging Indian athletes and taking selfie after their starts.
However, he and his wide company have obviously caused the anger of the organizer of the Olympic Games due to his uncontrolled behaviour, repeatedly trying to break up to the competition zones without any appropriate accreditation and in serious reaction, being verified, reports the Indian news agency Press Trust of India.
Wyye Goel, photographed in July, justifies his behavior.
On Wednesday, the organizers of the Olympic Games threatened to cancel Goela's accreditation if his behavior would not improve by sending a letter of notice after he and his company tried to enter restricted areas of the exercise competition at the venue and arena, where the embellishment and sakvando take place.
“We have received several reports that your Minister of Sport has tried to enter accredited competition zones with non-accredited persons,” says Sara Petersone in the statement, the continental manager of Rio 2016.
When staff tried to explain that this was not allowed, the people together with the minister became aggressive and rude and sometimes broke past our staff.
“If our protocol team becomes aware of any other cases of such behaviour, the accreditation of your Minister for Sport will be withdrawn and his privileges will be cancelled in the Olympic Games,” mentioned the letter in the following.
The leader of the Indian delegation referred to the case as “a blue from the flies ” and Goel himself said that he did nothing wrong with writing it all out as “a misunderstanding...
He wrote in Twitter: “As far as I know, we have observed all the rules.
We maintain the spirit of Olympic games and support our Indian athletes.
Otherwise, these Olympic games have a gloomy gloom for India, but not a medal yet.
The hopeless fans in social media pointed out that Michael Fellaps had won as many medals as 26 in India in its history.
Several prominent candidates have already been excluded, including the shooter Abhinav Bindra, who won a gold medal in Beijing in 2008.
This time he stayed fourth.
Money and opportunity were released in the wind – the author of the sardonian ettiary and the writer of the columns Shoba De.
However, some bright expectations still remain, because there will still be competitions in boxing, golf, tennis, ease and, yes, badminton.
The only Indian gymnasticsman, Dip Carmarok, will compete for the jumps on the final Sundays, showing his terrible double speed “Death jump, Produnova’s jump, which has been tried by only a few other gymnastics.
In the country of 1,25 billion people, India’s low - scored medals have always been a cause of indignation.
The analysts say there are countless reasons for this.
National passion is a cricket that is not an Olympic sport.
India has not made a thorough investment in infrastructure and the Olympics in training - the first exercise tool in Carmara was made from spare parts of an old pen.
Parents have always stressed the superiority of academic knowledge on sport.
And the institutions responsible for sport have been taken over by corruption.
The International Olympic Committee has set aside the Indian Olympic Association for infringement of its statutes in 2012, since it elected the leaders against whom criminal proceedings have been initiated.
In Sochi, three participants in the Indian Winter Olympic Games were even denied to represent their country, to carry the flag or to wear anything with a symbol of the country.
They competed like independent athletes.
When people are injured, JetBlue, which was hit by the Turbulent, is forced to land in South Dakota on the Boston-Sakramento route.
The jetBlue plane was forced to make an emergency landing on Thursday night after 22 passengers and two crew were injured during turbulent periods, reports the CBS Sakramento.
Reiss 429 from Boston to Sacramento landed in Rapidsia, South Dakota, shortly before 19:30 p.m. in the evening after local time.
The airline says that the injured have been hospitalized for screening.
JetBlue claims that it has sent personnel to help the wounded, that the spare flight has taken to the Rapids to bring the rest of the passengers to Sacramento.
Drug Control Agency (DEA) misses the possibility of medical marijuana
The answer is, unfortunately, unlikely.
This is a lost opportunity that could further delay treatment for countless people.
Until today, there is only one source at federal level for scientific purposes of the use of medical marijuana at the University of Mississippi.
In what appears to be a little more positive news today, DEA has also announced that it will now also allow other places to apply for authorisation to do the same.
There is hope that the volumes and diversity of marijuana available for scientific purposes could expand.
Although it will attract attention as a weight for the study, it will largely be symbolic, since no matter how much marijuana is available, if access to it is still difficult, it does not play a major role.
Imagine a product that is very demanded but stored behind closed doors.
In response to a request for a product, someone makes a hard-to-perceived decision to produce it more, but to be and it never shuts the door.
This product is marijuana and its location in list 1 contains these locked doors.
In this unpleasant situation, there is a medical marijuana.
Since marijuana is a substance in list 1 (i.e. it is not currently approved for medical use and has a high potential for unexpected use), there are significant barriers to locking the door.
Potential researchers usually first turn to the DEA, as it gives permission to start scientific research.
Even if a study of substances on the list 1 is authorised, institutions must comply with very strict safety rules and have high safety systems, which may be costly.
There is also the subjective consideration of obtaining authorisation from their academic institution to carry out research on substances included in Schedule 1.
Even if some of the faculty representatives wish to carry out this study, the university administration may not want problems or potential co-results due to negative press reports.
This was the case at the University of Arizona, when Dr. Sisley was released from office after an effort to move the tests of medical marijuana.
She eventually had to seek private funding for her project, and only in April, seven years after the initial proposal of the project, her project became the first DEA-approved medical marijuana trials to prevent post-traumatic stress for veterans.
Then after years of fight against bureaucratic barriers, the key behind the last lock was the National Institute of Drug Independence.
It is currently the largest federal public fund for the marijuana investigations and is the sole provider of the marijuana itself.
Even if more medical research is released for free circulation, all research funded by it will still have to be approved by the Institute.
The problem, however, is the use of the name ‘maluse’.
Dr. Donald Eibrom, a representative of the University of San Francisco, interviewed for my documentary film Marijuana, says that the main task of the Institute is to study the substance in the context of its potential dependence rather than as a medicine.
Abrams draw attention to an important fact.
Even if the study overcomes all of the above mentioned barriers, the door can still be closed if the intention is to study the benefits of medical marijuana instead of the damage it causes.
Notice: In a quick (and, must be recognised, unscientific) search at the U.S. National Medical Library, 1,434 were found of medical marijuana during the last five years.
In the same search only 57 works were on the benefits of medical marijuana.
Most of the studies involved damage to marijuana, for example, the ‘bad travel due to the anticholinergic effects of marijuana’, ‘Marijuana-induced pancreatitis’, and ‘Marijuana use and risk of lung cancer’.
Such dispropriation leads to a rather distorted picture.
The road to the use of the marijuana of medicine is paved by surprises and hypocrisy where the view opens.
As long as DEA recovers to the status of List 1 without having to see a medical effect, the U.S. Department of Health and Social Affairs simultaneously retains the cannabionide patent for large-scale medical purposes.
DEA continues to position marijuana next to heroin and LSD as a drug with a high potential for addiction, even though the DEA Chief Administrative Justice himself was opposed to it by Fransis Jang.
The strict medical sense of marijuana is safer than many widely consumed foods.
For example, 10 fresh potatoes can cause toxic reactions.
By comparison, it is physically impossible to eat so many marijuanas to die.
Marijuana is one of the safest therapeutic active substances known to humanity in its natural form.
Rationally analyzed, marijuana can be used safely in the treatment of proper monitoring.
I must say again that this was proposed by the DEA judge himself.
And yet, almost 30 years later, little has changed.
Whether we recognize it or not, we all accept some hypocrisy in our daily lives.
Maybe we don't always have the energy to express it loudly, or we're so confused that nobody seems to have noticed it.
With regard to hypocrisy in the context of federal medical marijuana policy, endurance must be required in order to present the facts restlessly.
Lifes of patients, such as Charlotte Fiji, whose seizures are controlled by medical marijuana, and many other lives are dependent on it.
The fact that the plant can provide so much benefit and still be behind closed doors is worth speaking at a higher level.
Bloody Beetroots: Donalds Tramps-Berlusconi-Blonde
Bloody Beetroots is a well-known electronic dance music context
The musicians say that Trump dominates the media like Berluskoni
You know, we're used to Berlusconi in Italy, and my Trump looks like a blonde Berlusconi. The Bloody Beetroots, the founder of the electronic music panques, said CNN.
President-in-Office of the Republics and the Italian media magnet which became a politician, both known their exaggerated personalities, the ability to attract the press and the changed stories of the media.
“Bloody Beetroots – Rifo is known for its electronic dance music and has collaborated with various artists, from legendary Sir Paul Macartney to electropop singer Greta Svabo Beču in the 2013 song “Chronicles of a Fallen Love”
Rifo was born in the Italian city of Basāno del Grapa, close to Venice, in 1977, which coincides approximately with the time of the pancroca, and the figure “1977” is applied to a musician on his breast.
“English is not my mother tongue, so I don’t understand everything about your world, ” Rifo said, hiding behind the black charge with which he’s known.
I try to explore and I’ve tried to improve my understanding of your culture.
Rifo invited Americans to watch “Environmental, a documentary, ” where Berlusconi’s monopoly over Italian media is studied.
The documentary says that “Berluskoni made Italy crazy, ” said Rifo, adding that Tramp had a similar impact on America.
\"You see how a man can turn the system completely and fold everything out... on his own,\" he said.
I think Tramp is not good for this country.
Two Turkish sailors were imprisoned in prison for more than GBP 500 million on drugs.
Two Turkish men were sentenced to over GBP 500 million worth of cocaine smuggling on board the North Sea, each sentenced to at least 20 years in prison.
Mom Sahin and Emin Ozman were found guilty of trial at the High Court in Glasgow after about 100 miles from the coast of Aberdeen were found on the board of “MV Hamal ” of three tons of class A drugs.
In 2015, the detention was the largest cargo of cocaine seized at sea in Europe at one entrance.
sentenced Mamin Sahin and Emin Ozman to prison sentence for his role in a large-scale drug transaction
The important drug cargo found on board is one of the biggest in British history
The drugs were found hidden in a specially equipped skiing on a tugboat registered in Tanzania, sailing from Istanbul to Tenerife and then to the North Sea.
It was suspended by the British Fleet Fregate-HMS Somerset- and by the Cower-HMC Valantto-
Sahin (47) was sentenced for 22 years, while Ozman (51) is sentenced to 20 years in the Supreme Court of Glasgow.
The judge Lord Kinkleiven told men that the amount of drugs was “not only substantial, but rather ambitious ” and that drug trafficking had a negative impact on people and the community around them.
He said: “You were involved in the most commercially advanced operation, including the transport of cocaine by ship, the operation crossing the international and truly intercontinental boundaries.
He said that the captain of the ship, Sahin, was not at the top of the drug tree, but he played a key role in the offence, while the second captain, Ozman, played a role – albeit to a lesser extent – in the crime.
Inspectors climbed the “Hamal ” deck after aberrant information from the French customs office, DNAED, and when it stopped in Aberden, they hurled through a steel plate, accessing a secret section where 128 cocaine links with a weight of 3.2 tonnes were found, with an estimated value in the black market of GBP 512 million.
“MV Hamal, last year the Royal Fleet was inspected.
Three tons of cocaine were on board.
During the inspection, the vessels were found to be ballastd in tonnes of ‘A’ class drugs in ballast tanks.
The ship was on the way from the Bosphorus to South America before it was stopped in the North Sea.
Access to this area was opened under the closet in one of the crew's crew's rooms, and the gap was cemented.
Sahin and Ozman were found guilty of the transportation and concealment of cocaine between 20 February and 23 April of last year, and of the delivery of cocaine between 21 April and 23 April.
Both previously unscrupulous men who have worked in the shipping industry since they ended school continue to claim to be guilty, but take the jury's judgment.
The appeals against another four men lack evidence.
Says that a married father of two children is “glorified Wall. ”
He said: “What was involved in drug trafficking?
Someone who was able to drive the ship.
Looking at the drug hierarchy, Sachin is certainly not a drug at the top of the tree, but somewhere below.
The huge amount of cocaine on board means that it had to be picked up by a crane
Police days went through the whole ship before drugs were divided over these boxes
Sahin asked questions about the work of his captain at the Hamal in February 2015, who was heard by the court.
Mr Krav said that he has been shocked to miss important events of daughter (9) and son (13) and that he would simply want to go back to Turkey
Both men have not seen their families since the arrest in April 2015 because the families are still struggling to obtain a visa endorsement.
Ozman’s lawyer, Di Mour, said that he was desperate to see his family, but he knew that it would not be possible in a transparent future
In response to the judgments of the Scottish prosecutor David Harvey today, he said: “There are no borders on international drug trafficking and we, whose task is to destroy it, are working ever closer together to get us one step forward.
\"Scottia's success in the persecution of criminals is indeed at a global level, and in this case we have caused significant economic losses to organised crime.\"
The drugs were tainted in all gaps on board the ship, including under floors.
The inspectors found this smuggled in a hidden ship's laundry room
Mr Harvey added: \"Hamal – was identified by reference to intelligence from the French authorities, and after a swift cooperation with the prosecutor-general of Tanzania where the vessel was registered, who also allowed the ship to climb.
\"Our investigation then provided access to essential consignment data from Gijana to Spain, which provided us with very valuable information on the ship's stops in the Canary Islands.
We also cooperated with colleagues in Denmark, Norway and the United States to bring together specific elements of evidence.
Despite the fact that ‘Hamal’ is being carried a large amount of drugs, representatives of the British authorities on board in international waters could not climb without permission of the Tanzanian government - something which they had never granted before.
Suju Peitna, Head of International Justice and Combating Organized Crime at the Royal Criminal Prosecutor’s Office (CPS), said: “As soon and precisely as possible, the CIA Criminal Law Adviser was able to obtain permission from Tanzanian authorities to board the ship within 24 hours of receiving intelligence information.
In accordance with international maritime law, British officials are not entitled to climb into international waters on board a ship flying the flag of another State unless that State grants a special legal authorisation to do so.
Without the prompt action of our criminal law advisor, there would be a great risk that the ship could escape and that we could never call these people to justice.

Dispatch of flexible father from children’s school for wearing T-shirt with llamo-words
The father of two children is expelled from the children's school for their arrival on the sport day in the T-shirt with a touching inscription.
Kayak Macbet (36), from Birnle in Lauskashire, says that he did not have to wear a shirt with the inscription Laiž and Dr.am.
However, despite the fact that when he noticed his lien and put on the T-shirt the reverse, the next day he found that he was forbidden to enter the school area.
Lone father, who has served for four years as head of primary school of Park in Colne, Children, was unable to follow children because of the ban, and staff even called up social services and police.
KAKAK Makbet (36) of the Children says that he has not entered the school territory after he had arrived on the children’s sports day in an offensive T-shirt.
Mr. Burnley accuses school director Sarah Migley of being over-respondent.
He says he's wrongly punished for the fact that before going watch his two children's race, the error after rushing on the T-shirt.
Father, who no longer works as a school manager, said: “It was a mistake and neglect on my part.
I don't think about the sport day, and I rushed when I put it on.
Soon after the event, we had a father's race, and the director noticed my T-shirt and said it was not appropriate.
I apologize and cut it to the other side, and that's why the case ended.
The 36-year-old man, however, said that he had received a letter from the president of the school, inviting him to meet with the director the next day, but he did not see the need to do so because he had already done apologies.
“The school principal called me and said that I was forbidden to enter school territory, ” said Mr. Burnley.
I learned that after the sport day, some parents on Facebook had been alarmed about the alarm and that many people had an interest in it.
Any person who thinks along the lines would say that it is exaggerated.
Mr Macbeta, who is editor of the online Love Mini magazine, said that he believed that he could not even come after children last day of the semester because of the ban.
This, however, led to a call from school and the social services.
On the T-shirt was the image of Craig Charles Lister of the BBC cult's comet, the red rooster, with one of his iconic expressions, Laisves and Dr.am
He commented: “I told them I wasn’t there because I was forbidden to go to school.
Then I was called from the social services and asked why I wasn't going to be a girl.
The school also called the police because I wasn't coming after the daughter for some 40 minutes --
Mr Macbeta claims that he was told that he could no longer be present at school and that the ban would apply until further statements were made.
He also said that he had been warned that he would be able to impose GBP 500 per pound on breach of this rule.
Sarah Migley, Director of the Primary School of Park, said that this case has now been closed.
Sarah Migley, director of primary school in Park, said: “I can confirm that Mr. Macbeta has resigned and is no longer the head of our school.
The case has now been closed, and I look forward to returning to the school's usual life in September!
The child’s urban counselor Joe Koony said that the school had clear policies and guidelines.
“We all have to bear in mind that when you take positions such as advisor or manager, you are subject to higher standards, and unfortunately this time he did not meet these standards,” he said.
Pastor Jonathan Nixon added that he did not think the school should have imposed a ban on him and that a elephant had been pulled out of the fly.
Mr. Nixon added: “This T-shirt was stupid, and he also apologized for it.
The Lancashire police confirmed that they were calling from school, but they did not come.

Ombudsman: The demagogy of the compulsory health insurance model, with an additional financial burden on the population, does not hold any criticism.
Any demagogy of compulsory health insurance, which would impose a direct and increased burden on the population, does not hold any criticism, shall be regarded as the Ombudsman of the Republic of Lithuania Juris Jansons.
Janson met with Health Minister Andu Čakš today to discuss the situation in the health sector.
Following a meeting, Janson told the journalists that the sector financing model offered by the Minister of Health was sustainable and developed healthcare system, making it more accessible to patients.
He pointed out that, in this case, additional funding for healthcare should be discussed, as this is not enough at the moment.
Janson also stressed that any demagogue on compulsory health insurance, which would impose a direct and increased burden on the population of the payment, does not hold any criticism, especially if the Dutch model is called upon.
Jansons said the Netherlands gave 11% of the gross domestic product to health, while Latvia accounted for only 3%.
So the government and the parliament must be sufficiently responsible to understand that it is necessary to get up from this point of the cold, say the Ombudsman and added that otherwise the model offered by the Ministry of Health (VM) will not work.
Čakša thanked the Ombudsman for his support and pointed out that the main concern was that the patient should get medical attention, which in turn required additional funding for the health care system.
Although the Minister pointed out that with the planned additional 35 million euros, it will only be possible to do the most acute cases of oncological patients and maternity specialists next year.
The LM has therefore drawn up a plan and submitted a request for an additional EUR 41 million to be allocated to healthcare in order to reduce the number of rows to specialists and to investigate.
“The question of priorities, whether funds will be available or not,” said Chakša.
This amount, however, does not include an increase in the remuneration of medical practitioners.
Commenting on the fact that the doctors are not delighted that all three options of the health care financing model are being pursued by the government during the examination of the VM, including the additional payment to patients, Čakša said that the government is given the opportunity to choose when moving all three models.
Jansons also added that it is possible to clearly demonstrate that Latvia is not prepared to impose additional burdens on the population when moving all three models.
It has already been reported that the VM will defend the variant of the model of financing of health care, which does not imply an increase in the overall tax burden, but requires part of the social tax to shift health to health, says the conceptual summary of the report on the change in the financing model of the Latvian health care system.
At the same time, the Ministry indicated that the best option for the financing of health care would be selected by the end of September as a result of the discussions.
The local watercourse is ready.
Arbūzis has given up this year, recognises the owner of the Arējs municipality of Grobiņas region of Medge, Rolands Dambis.
Watermelons are already available on the Liepaja market.
Production began in several early breeds, but the preferred tubers are well abandoned, reports the regional newspaper Kursas Laiks.
“This year the aromatics grow better than last year, ” says the large berry farmer in Rucavas district of Artis Ķūsis.
In terms of weather conditions, it is also a much more favourable summer than when it was cold and windy.
Guest performances of Liepaja theatre started in Riga.
On August 12 and 13, the theatre of Daile will be visited by Liepaja theatre, offering viewers both “Stapeman’s night-time – winning performances, and a bright actress – the monoduction of Herbert Laugina by the Liepaja theatre director Herbert Laugina, the portal “Delfi” is informed by the theatre representatives.
On the evening of August 12, a human drama-Sillower, presented by director Laura Groza-Ķibere, will be shown to the audience.
It is a story of a real historical person - John Merik - who lived in London of the Victorian Age and his crocular, because of the deformed body of an inherited disease, was called the Ziloņman.
The lecture is presented by actor Egons Dombrovskis, who received the nomination of the players' night – the actor of the Year – for the role of Merika.
As the critic Normunds Akot described his performance, Meric is a role that is unique in the heart.
On 13 August the audience will be presented with a \"Portrait\" presentation
The show received six night nominations of “Playman’s Night, including “The Big Show of the Year”
The director's intervention was created as a kind of portrait gallery, giving each plays an equal role in the image, so each of them has its own centre and background.
The performance is made up of a series of mini-signs that are connected to a single whole at the end.
It is an observation of human nature, where the main conflict is between genuine emotions and a cold estimate, brightly revealing how a person is changing in various situations - each of the heroes is a wolf who, due to the covetousness and its own benefits, is torn apart by the surrounding sheep, sometimes broken by someone else.
On both of these dates, the Small Room will be played by the director of Liepaja theatre, Herbert Laugina, a mono-show of the \"People\", who is getting away from the director of the lift - Gaļinas Poliščuks.
It is not sad, but a humorous story about how one man’s only friend becomes a lift.
Despite the style of the cemetery, which dominates the visual image of the performance, the dominant intonation of the exhibition is, however, bright and even optimistic.
“The man who avoids the elevator is not a judgment of loneliness and age, but a love of life is worth it.
Even if you don't think you're on it, you wrote critic Līga Ulberte about the show.
Tickets for all presentations can be purchased from “Biļšu Paradīzes – cash desks and the Internet.
Detective Olga: My job is not serial, but real life.
Olga Zelika expects me already halfway to see the owner and investigator of the Riga Detective Agency.
She laughs loud and leaves a very positive human impression.
Dress in white pancakes and in white jacket – a very elegant woman, who overscrews all my views of what a woman needs to be – a detective.
She's expecting me with a Champagne, from which I'm kind to respond.
I told her that I was talking to him because I thought it was interesting that a woman was dealing with such an unusual thing.
It's always seemed men's work.
Olga has higher legal education - master's degree.
He's been working in the criminal police for a while.
Having realized that he wanted something he wanted to set up a company.
You know what I mean.
“I really didn’t want to return to Poland, Olga says.
It's a rutin.
There, in the criminal police, we looked into things, we collected information.
We work with suspects.
“We celebrate 10th anniversary of Riga’s Detective Agency this year.
She calls for a anniversary: “There will be no drinking...
Everyone is promised people.
Asked about her business, Olga says: “Business is very specific...
I had a team for the first five years.
Then I realized that sometimes working as a team was dangerous.
This is a business where, if someone does not work professionally, it can get into a very bad situation.
If journalists are fifth power, then we're second.
The sphere is certainly not simple.
Many try to invade us because we cheat on our spouse.
That's what people think!
Many come and require whether or not a listening machine can be imposed, attract dogs.
Many have seen films.
The detective business is serious.
“It’s the collection of information – Olga’s story.
If a crime takes place by law, I have to warn about it.
We boil the green tea and laugh: there is at least a cup to hold on and make negotiations.
I've had a client whose husband is constantly hit.
She was looking for protection, of course.
We also have security.
Her husband was manic.
At first everything is always beautiful and good, but then starts.
“That's the worst thing, Olga says.
Psihe is broken, and it happens that you can be treated like an animal.
This can end badly.
Don't give it to God, with suicide.
It's very dangerous.
People become victims at some point.
\"The dozen women try to leave their families and then return again, she says.
I refused the last assignment.
“It happened for the first time in my life, that Olga discovered.
There was a strange situation.
She was married, she had a son.
“My husband struck his son and made him disabled, Olga remembered.
I believe that a woman has a mother's instinct, and first of all, she must protect her children.
When all this happened, she came to me with a request to get out of that man.
There are people who are obscene.
The worst thing is, my mother put her eyes on it.
I can't understand it.
Her child is now disabled.
We once couldn't find the body, and the dog really helped.
The drug department cannot do anything without dogs at all.
\"I understand that there are adequate people and there are those who do not have a normal psyche: she says.
Of course, the facts of fraud are topical.
Or a divorce takes place in the family, and information is to be collected.
It's a question of what's the wrong side.
The last thing I have been on is when my friends have been deceived by other friends.
It's interesting, because some of the men have shot, now - the women.
Even the best friends are fighting!
Women around €100 and over thousand friends.
Women should be careful when they go abroad, as they can be sold in slavery.
“Latvian women are intelligent and have too much confidence.
There have been cases of couples going abroad to marry again.
It's not legal.
Olga says that she had a husband similar to Jesus Christ.
Long height, long hair.
When I was 22 years old, a tragedy occurred.
He had a severe head injury.
He returned as a completely different person.
\"I pulled him out, Olga remembers.
It was like hell, it was terrible.
Olga says: “All things are special, but the most common thing is that of exercising trust.
When a girlfriend, a friend, throws it.
Takes away and don't give back money.
If you have a lawyer's education and experience in the police, you can work as a detective.
“One thing is to feel like detective, the other - to be - Olga tells.
The situation of mistrust is rather crazy, as women are often not ready to deal with the situation.
They are not prepared to accept the result.
This is an unpredictable situation because man is not prepared to lose his family.
Not every woman is prepared to accept reality.
Often young girls who taste money use rich married men.
One man who traced his wife said that he can't be that she doesn't have the lover, because all the wives have cheated on her.
“He was married three times. Olga remembers.
So there's a man's problem if all the wives cheat on her.
Olga tells of a woman who left her husband with all her children, and she asked him if he had ever raised his hand against her.
In general, I was constantly in contact with him, and he responded.
In such cases, I will refuse to work.
I find it interesting to see how things are solved - are photographs taken and shown to your spouse if there is evidence of fraud.
How is this happening?
“The protection of personal data exists in parallel to the detective work – Olga tells.
This is a provocative question.
One law allows everything, the other - does not allow anything.
For personal interests, we are allowed to take such photographs and videos, but not for public viewing.
If material is submitted to a court that does not comply with the law, there may be major problems.
In order to become detective, education and experience are not enough, it is also necessary to be mentally healthy and meet the criteria.
We're not taking fingerprints, it's the police.
I say to the clients - turn away from the series, here is a real life!
In fact, when I was working in the (police) system, dogs had to be used, they helped a lot.
“There is no way in the narcotics section without dogs at all,” Olga says.
Some people turn to me in connection with a murder investigation, but I don't like to take such things.
These are very serious things.
Now there are more and more clients of men, women tend to dive into men.
Sometimes it was different.
Now women are entertaining, but men are sitting at home with children.
“Of course, well - suffering people, that’s Olga.
I like Dale Carnegie.
He says stop worrying and start living realistically.
We all know that if you hit one face, you have to turn the other but you can't!
You have to say it's unpleasant.
This cannot be done.
Do not be afraid to lose what prevents living!
You can't become a little hysteria, and what we do with us is what we allow ourselves to do.
Yes, my first thing was directly related to the infidelity of a man when a woman was not prepared to accept the fact that he was cheating on him.
She kept calling and asked her what to do.
“I now ask all the clients if they are willing to accept a situation when they find that a man really cheats on him. Olga says.
It's not entertainment, it's life.
If you come and wage detective, you have to take responsibility.
It's not a theatre, a show, but a real life.
I'm also a specialist.
It is a heart thing and related to Japanese medicine – treatment with hands.
That is a very interesting thing.
Why have I started working with this?
This is due to a large amount of adrenaline, and you need to calm down something.
Need not only calms but restores energy, lights.
“People get out of my office positively and satisfied, ” Olga says.
Olga says that she has signs in her office on the wall, and she says that she does not write with brush but with fingers.
I didn't just get to it, the book on the need fell into my hands literally.
I found it a sign.
However, this is very personal.
Learn more about this.
Olga also sings.
It's her hobbies.
All of us are brewed by creativity.
From 11 years I played guitar.
I've recorded songs and clips.
I'm positive and smile, but I need to rest to reset.
Others save their alcohol, you need me.
Alcohol sinks.
The police use it a lot, because the work is stressful.
“It causes aggression, and moves can be unpredictable – she says.
I'm interested in sport and needy.
I've been doing tennis for 15 years.
I also liked riding with horses.
I turned around in nature, articles, and I would like to write a book.
Detective work is a fine limit when work enters your life.
“This is a job that shouldn’t be put into life, ” she says.
Olga says: “My loved one is in Italy, ” she says.
We have very strong feelings.
That's the best love in my life.
It's enough for me to think about him, and I feel better.
Detectives usually don't trust, but he's accepted my job.
Actually, I separate my work from private life.
I didn't get into this business either.
Reiki has set me.
Even when I was a child, I saw more than others.
Thanks to needs, an intuition opens.
There are many detectives, but few actually working.
In any case, it is work with the brain, and it is hard to disconnect.
You also need rest.
\"Others you can't recover. Olga admits.
The worst case I've been working with is Konstanz's story.
I've been working on that case for a year.
The man literally despised the woman.
I made it so that my child and my mom went to England, away from the danger.
There were no other options.
We must not regret ourselves.
Looking for compassion.
You shouldn't do that.
We need to rejoice for every day we have.
I have to thank God.
We must say three good things to each other every day.
You have to do a good job or take a day for yourself.
We can't do it with men.
It's a big mistake.
We have to understand that we have a man next to us, not a child, and we need him to take care of us.
If not, turn and leave.
You can go to church, you have helped me a lot.
You don't have to be a fan, but do what you like and helps.
Nothing will change, if it has not changed, have to go away and change your life.
Under no circumstances should we put ourselves and your children at risk.
You don't have to sit down and wait for anything.
People are created to do good and support each other.
If God has created us, we are already in need and are not in this world for free.
You can't ever sit on the ground!
How to prepare for your family photo session.
The summer is still in full swing, as is the current immediately held school year that families can notice in their photos.
To make all the pictures look happy and beautiful, it is worth considering how to prepare for the photo series in advance.
The advice Ihappymama provides many children’s mother Alexander Nesterenko and professional photographer Marina Levickaja.
You have to take a picture in nature, because it is much more natural and harmonious.
During the study, it is far more difficult for children to feel and relax.
It is recommended to choose a uniform dress style for the whole family, preferably in the same color game.
Alexander says, for example, that she chooses clothes for all six family members so that the clothes are no more than three-color shades and as few patterns as possible on the clothing.
Don't forget about it.
Make fun, laugh, play, but in no way denys and does not crave, if children are not as obedient as they would like.
And here’s the next advice from professional photographer’s pot!
You need to understand exactly what you want to capture during a photo session and tell the photographer about it.
Some will have beautiful, deaf children and an ideal family image; others will have a life of what it is – a desire to see true true emotions in the pictures, or the love of the photographer himself, the elusive back, the open eyes,
Of course, there may be someone who wants two in one, but it is rarely happening.
In any case, when you go to a photosession, you have to understand that it's just a couple of hours away from your life, and the less you're stuck, the better.
You are yourself - there is neither a strict mom who works, prepares to eat, grows and it is still, and not an ever-acquired dad who speaks on the phone constantly.
And it's not the man who lives behind you some unknown shell.
Be a family, remember how great it is to envy each other, to smile around and laugh.
And then the role of the photographer will only be to capture the real moments of emotions between you.
If you have chosen a photographer, trust him.
For more than 250 times, ask him to show what's here, listen to his advice in his choice of clothing, place for better shots.
Put and snug all necessary clothes in advance so that it doesn't have to deal with them any more on the day of the photo session.
Plan a route and think about how much time you need to get to the photosession site (especially when taking pictures at the studio and the time is limited).
If you have little children, then choose a photo series of time corresponding to the day-old regime so that it does not happen at the time when the baby usually sleeps.
And, of course, don't forget to take with the kids dishes, cookies, water and favorite toys (to use these and sweets only in extreme situations).
Dad is prepared that he may need to pull off his socks, but he does not usually write any of them, and only the photographers know what it is, Marina admits.
Do not drink plenty of water before taking a photosession and you will lie down well before that.
And it would still be advisable to do some entertainment together after a photo session.
Go to the theme park, eat some ice cream, meet the skates - which family would like more.
So at the same time you will get great pictures and pleasant memories of the day spent together.
Krasnopjorov and Fadejeva: Raising the minimum wage - a miracle or a break for the economy?
The issue of raising the minimum wage in public discussions is almost either the status of holy cow: either the promotion should be supported, or any inexpressive general phrases should be mentioned.
In view of the significant increase in the risk of economic stagnation (as we avoided technical recession), we believe it is important to stress that raising the minimum wage is not a miracle that will reduce income inequality with one hint, bring Latvia's wage closer to Western European level and fill the state budget.
On the contrary, if the minimum wage is raised too much, it does more harm than good because it reduces the competitiveness and employment of companies, particularly in sectors and regions with low incomes.
At first sight, despite several increases in minimum wages in the post-crisis period, the minimum wage in Latvia is not so high that raising for the usual few dozens of euros per year would significantly weaken the competitiveness of companies – only EUR 370, while in some European Union (EU) countries the minimum wage is about one and a half thousand.
However, a different picture appears when compared with the average wage in the country (%) - the minimum wage in Latvia (44%) exceeds the EU average.
As the share of minimum wage beneficiaries in Latvia is significantly higher than in neighbouring countries (17% in Latvia, 11% in Lithuania, 6% in Estonia), a similar increase in minimum wage is bound to most companies.
According to the results of the survey of Latvijas Banka companies, each fifth company replied that it was important or very important to increase the prices of products by increasing the minimum wage at the beginning of 2014.
This means that, firstly, the rise in minimum wages was partly financed by consumers (i.e. residents of Latvia); secondly, price increases for several companies meant a loss of competitiveness both in the domestic market and abroad (i.e. increased imports and limited exports).
Due to more competitive and smoking production it was important to lay off employees (which means more unemployment and emigration) for almost every 15 Latvian company.
In addition, almost every eleventh company replied that it was important for him to limit the recruitment of new employees as a result of the raising of the minimum wage.
It is worth remembering that in 2011-2013 the minimum wage in Latvia remained unchanged.
Therefore, even if, when assessing the 2014 minimum wage increase, each fifth company, as an important indicator for improving productivity, it does not yet mean that a similar result could also be expected in 2017 (four consecutive increases of the minimum wage could reduce productivity gains).
Another important result is that because of the rise in the minimum wage, it was also important for several companies to increase the remuneration of those who earn more than the minimum wage.
Thus, the impact of the minimum wage was substantial even for companies where none of the employees received the minimum wage.
In recent years, the increase in the minimum wage in all three Baltic countries exceeded the increase in nominal labour productivity (real productivity + inflation).
Thus, the further increase in productivity without an unjustified increase in the minimum wage (even though overall the rather low level in euro) would have a negative impact on the competitiveness and employment of companies.
When assessing the merits of raising the minimum wage, it is not enough to analyse the average economic indicators alone.
It should also be assessed whether the raising of the minimum wage is appropriate in sectors and regions where the minimum wage is most commonly used.
The results of the survey by the Bank of Latvia show that the employees with minimum wages are most concentrated in small enterprises (the number of employees ranges from 10 to 19 employees; 25%).
At the end of 2013, the share of workers with minimum wages was higher in industry and services ( 16% and 19% respectively) than in trade (15%), construction (11%) and financial and insurance sectors (2%).
On the other hand, for Latgale, where the minimum wage is 64% of the average wage (and more than two thirds of the average wage in the private sector), the further rise may be detrimental to reducing labour demand (i.e. maintaining already high unemployment) and promoting the resilience of the shadow economy.
Some indications suggest that the rise in minimum wage earners implemented in 2014-2015 (total of 27%) has slowed the development of Latgale.
For example, Latgale is the only region in Latvia where unemployment was higher in 2015 than in 2013.
It should be noted that Estonia and Lithuania do not have any region that would be so far behind the average wage from the rest of the country.
For example, in Estonia, the average wage in all regions is at least twice the national minimum wage.
In Lithuania, the lowest wages are in the Tauragian region, but also there was a minimum wage in 2015 of 54% of the average wage (after two rapid increases in minimum wages in 2016, this figure could reach 58%).
There is a lack of economic rationale in the public debate that has been called from time to time to raise the minimum wage to 68% of the average wage in the country (see, for example, here) and that is not feasible in the short and long term.
Firstly, such a high figure from the average wage or even so close to it is not in any EU country.
Secondly, it would mean raising the minimum wage above average wages in a number of economic sectors (which would mean bankruptcy and mass redundancies of companies in these sectors), such as clothing, leather production, fish processing, catering services and veterinary services; in addition, this is more than the current average wage in the Latgale private sector.
Raising the minimum wage from January 2017 to 400-410 euros per month, as currently offered by the Ministry of Welfare, would make the minimum wage in Latvia (% of the average wage) one of the highest in the EU.
If nominal productivity increases by 4%, but at least twice the minimum wage, it has a clear negative impact on the competitiveness and employment of businesses.
Such negative effects will be most common in sectors and regions where the current minimum wage levels are often used, for example, in Latgale.
The fact that a significant increase in the minimum wage cannot be tolerated at the moment means that other mechanisms must be used to support low wage earners.
An immediate effect can be achieved by travelling to the minimum non-residential income tax ( within the limits of the budget available).
Insufficient education, inadequate education and poor quality of acquired education, as well as unsatisfactory health status (often due to the cost of medical services due to expensiveness and long rows) are among the real causes of income inequality.
During the survey, 521 Latvian company's responses to the rise in minimum wage that took place in January 2014 were received.
The survey was conducted as part of the Wage Dynamics Network (WDN) project.
These figures shall represent undertakings with a minimum number of employees of 10.
This also explains the low proportion of employees with minimum wages in construction.
The 11 fires registered in Latvia during the last day have been demonstrated by the operational information of the State Fire and Rescue Service (VUGD).
In Latinity, the biggest fires were set up in Ogre region of Ogregala, where an area of 80 square meters of unmanaged housing was burned with a single-storey house and on the railway track in Jēkabpils, where, with an open flame, the barn was burned with an area of 30 square metres.
On Thursday, firefighters also made calls for waste, tyres, two light cars, the wall and ceiling of the building, sheds, the roof of the dwelling, and an unattended ground fired food.
The service also took part in 21 rescue jobs during the night.
Deaths, victims or saved people are not reported.
In total, within the last day, the VUGD responded to 38 calls, of which six were misleading.

The legendary editor of Huffington left the Huffington Post-1
Arianna Haffingtone, the co-founder and editor of the U.S. media holding - The Huffington Post, announced the departure from the company after 11 years of work.
The Huffington Post, which has been established in 2005 and which is awarded the Pulicer Prize, offers daily both serious political and economic journalism and entertainment reflections of internet sensations, is regarded as a driving force for the development of the media at a time of rapid development of digital technology solutions.
The media, starting in 2005, offered innovative and interactive content solutions for its time in a context where no Twitter existed, but feisbuk gained popularity only among students in the public colleges.
Shortly after the re-election by the representative of the Republican Party, George Bush, Haffington, did not conceal that the media journalists represented liberal values and that news was also produced with such a world view.
Now Hafington on Twitter has discovered that after leaving, she is going to start a new business - she is planning to create a startup – Thriive Global – that addresses the health and congestion of employees.
It is not yet known who could replace her under The Huffington Post.
During her life the portal refused anonymous comments, stressing to Haffington that freedom of expression is granted to people who are standing for what they say and who are not hiding behind anonymity.
Her leadership also decided in summer 2015 to publish news about the US presidential candidate, Donald Trampa, in the entertainment news section.
It is true that, at the end of 2015, indicating that Trump’s rhetoric is dangerous to U.S. society, odiozo candidates were again published in the policy section.
In 2011, the US Internet Media Group AOL decided to buy the fast-growing news website The Huffington Post, which was visited by almost 25 million readers each month at the time of the transaction.
The deal reached 315 million dollars.
In 2015, the telecommunications giant Verizon bought AOL for USD 4.4 billion.
Also “Verizon” bought, in 2016, Yahoo, parts of Internet business.
With these transactions, the Huffington Post, an influential and independent medium, became a small part of a giant corporation.
The current content of the famous brand media is available in nine international versions, with a total of 81 million visits per month.

Before that, one man died on Thursday in an explosion in the province of Trana, South Thailand.
Policys rescue the baby from overheating in a car; parents run the glass in danger of doing judicial work.
In Riga, yesterday the local police saved the baby from a hot car, while the parents threatened the police officers with the works of the court about the wasted car glass, the agency LETA informed the Riga Municipal Police (RPP).
Yesterday, a nervous man ran across the patrol, who said that a baby was in the parking lot of Spice shopping center.
On arrival, an eyewitnessed car was found in the parking lot in the sun.
The front passenger seat was equipped with a baby seat.
It was the sun beams that shined on the child.
The infant was loud and breathed intensely, and his bandage was red and bruised.
Given that the owner of the vehicle did not appear on the ground, a decision was taken immediately to swipe off the rear glass of the car in order not to endanger the health and life of the infant.
The child with the whole seat is highlighted from the hot vehicle and the medical staff called.
The child breathed shallow, the skin was red and hot, so until the medical officers arrived, they put cool compresses on the forehead.
The nurses and the parents of the child arrived almost simultaneously at the event site.
The father of the infant kept aggressive and kept the medicine behind his vehicle.
Discussions with parents have explained that children under seven years of age are not allowed to be left alone without supervision.
In addition, the child was left in a dangerous environment of health and life.
After discussions, the victims were examined and it was found that hospitalization was not necessary.
The parents of the child, on the other hand, strongly refused to provide any explanations about what had happened and threatened with judicial works on the glass of a lost car.
During discussions with your parents, there was nothing to suggest that they would be drunk or otherwise be harmful to the child, so an under four months’ old infant was taken care of both.
The file was sent to the Children’s Crime Prevention Unit, whose employees will assess parental responsibility.
RPP recalls that even if the sun is not very hot outside, the car is heated very quickly.
If such a car is left behind by a child or a domestic animal, it could endanger their lives.
LPF members could be asked to stop Pony.
The members of the Latvian Swimming Federation (LPF) could request the removal of the former vice-president Jānis Dzenis from the office of the President of the Federation of Latvia, LETA told the agency about the former vice-president of the Federation.
He stated that, in view of the criticisms of Pony and his activities in the Federation over recent days, several LPF members had signed a letter asking to convene the LPF Assembly, which is the highest federal institution, and it is entitled to decide on any question raised by the LPF Assembly.
The members of the Federation are not satisfied with the Sisters' style of leadership; moreover, she was going to the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, where she had not had the opportunity to go to the Latvian record of the swimmer Aļona Ribakova trainer German Jaculov, who had improved in Olympics, was rated as unethical and unworthy by the President.
He noted that LPF members as well as the Secretary General of the Federation, Aivars Platonov, had done a great deal of work for the development of the Federation and sports, but Mr.
The Gesens, who had worked for a long time in the Federation, explained that there was an attempt in the Federation to concentrate power in the hands of one person.
As a result, members of the Federation could also be required to amend the statutes governing LPF, which would exclude this possibility in the future.
He explained that there was a long period of dissatisfiance with Mr. Federium, but the events of the last days had served as the last castle, the members of the Federation, to make a decision.
Former Vice President of the Federation said that the work of trainers and the Council of Judges was greatly reduced during the Master's activity.
He explained that in order to ensure a faster process and decision-making at the federation, LPF members had decided in a general meeting to authorise the Board, which consisted of Sir and two Vice Presidents, to run the federation.
However, as Dean acknowledged, Mr.
The members of the Federation trusted Mr, believing that this would allow the Federation to take decisions more quickly.
“He defied the trust of his fellows, because he practically took power in his hands, making an unethical step, indicated Genius.
“This attitude cannot come from a person who should serve as an example for other sports people.
As a result, Mr President has tried to satisfy his ambitions, which, in turn, does not honor him as the President of the LPF.
LETA, the long-term secretary-general of the LPF, told the agency that a letter could be submitted to the Federation next week, which would require the LPF general meeting to be held within a month.
In his opinion, the general meeting should “talk all the pains that have occurred and decide on the next steps.
Mr. Friday had not yet been informed that LPF members were planning to convene a general meeting to decide on his dismissal.
So far, I do not know anything about calling such a meeting, so I have no comments.
Regarding the fact that my fellow members are dissatisfied with my work, there has been only one case so far, with the coach Jacukov, mentioned earlier, when there is some dissatisfiedness.
Before the London Olympics, when Ribakova was not approved among the participants, he complained to the International Federation of Water Sports (FINA) and invited Latvia not to send any athletes.
“After this case, Jacubovskis lost the position of the senior trainer of the sample because his actions did not follow the interests of the LPF, ” said Mr.
He also stressed that the meetings of the LPF members that had accounted for the progress had not received so far.
“On the contrary, we have received recognition that the quality of the Federation’s work has improved, ” said the President of LPF.
Mr. also explained that there was no reason to have fun at Rio de Janeiro's Olympic Games, but to work.
For a wider part of people in Latvia, it is not clear and they don't understand the functions of presidents of federations.
People do not understand that we are voluntiers in these positions, and, for example, unlike the leaders of the Latvian Olympic Committee (LOK), we do not get wages.
At the same time, we need to make sure that sports-type federations receive enough funding, because only 10% of the amount that is needed is received by the national LPF.
During the Olympics, I have had formal and informal meetings with representatives of the International Federation and various international programmes, including international sponsors.
“I have also entered into conversations and worked to see one of the stages of the World Cup held in Riga in 2018.
In 2015, the revenues of LPF totalled 249 444 euros, which is less than 36 000 euros more than in 2014.
About 40% of this amount last year was made up of targeted grants, which increased by around 10 000 euros compared to 2014.
Similarly, in the form of membership, accession and other annual contributions, LPF received approximately 43% more revenue or 109 442 euros.
In the form of donations and donations, the Federation received EUR 35 532 last year.
Last year, federation expenditure had increased by around 70 000 euros compared to 2014, with a total cost of 263 876 euros in 2015.
The largest expenditure was not related to cash payments to individuals, to tangible expenditure or to salaries - EUR 215 733 is reported as «other expenditures ».
Cash payments to individuals cost EUR 20 549, while salaries paid EUR 14 684.
LPF concluded with a negative balance in 2015 if it had concluded with a positive balance.
As reported earlier, the Ministry of Education and Science (ICM) requested clarification to the Latvian Olympic Committee (LOK) about the participation of the President of the LPF in the Rio-Janei Olympic Games, which, in turn, had not been left by the Latvian swimmer Ribakova coach Jakubovskis.
Latvian nationals have not suffered from the explosions in Thailand, as evidenced by the entry of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the social website Twitter.
The Ministry indicated that according to information available to the Honorary Consul of Latvia in Thailand Latvian nationals had not suffered in explosions.
LETA has already stated that the OSS invites travellers to keep track of the development of the political and security situation in the country on a regular basis, as well as of the security of the place of stay, indicating that there is a high terrorist threat in the country.
Latvian SJSC invites us to avoid gathering places, to be especially careful and attentive when staying in public places, and to follow the instructions of local authorities.
The Ministry of Travellers who are located in Thai resorts or are planning to go there invites them to contact tour operators or airlines to specify whether the journey will be carried out in accordance with the plan.
The Ministry also invites travelers to follow regularly information on the development of the political and security situation in the country, as well as to verify the security of the place of stay.
There is a high threat of terrorism in the country.
In view of the precarious security situation in the country, it is not recommended to go to Thailand and Cambodia's border area, as well as to the provinces of Thailand and Malaysia in the border area - namely, Jalal, Narathiota and Sonkhla.
In an emergency, the Ministry invites to immediately contact the consular department's daily depository by phone: +371 26 33 77 11 or e-mail: palidziba@mfa.gov.lv.
It also strongly recommends that anyone travelling abroad obtains life and health insurance policies, including repatriation in the event of sickness or death, as well as registered in the Consular Register.
However, we will not leave Argentina's football sample.
The superstar of football Lionels Mesi, after a short time of reflection, nevertheless decided to return to the State Union of Argentina, announced the player himself on Friday.
In July the Argentinian team failed the final of the Copa America tournament for the second year in a row, recouping Chile's superiority in the decisive match.
Immediately after the loss, the Messa announced the end of his career in the State Union, but then it was reported that he could return to the sample.
“I seriously considered leaving a sample, but my love for Argentina and my sample is too large, ” declared the 29 - year - old Messiah.
The Spanish granda Barcelona attacker Mesi has won 55 gates in a total of 112 games, which is the best indicator at all times.
Together with adult reading, the Mesi has not made great progress, although in 2014 Argentina became the world vice-cempions.
We're five times named the world's best football player.

The Olympic champion was crowned with the Géné, who distanced it in 19 minutes and four seconds, finish for 12 seconds ahead of the Iron.
The Bronze, however, was won by the Australian sower Deins Burrds-Smits, who lost Dzinne for 23 seconds.
The household's favorite, Kai Bonfim, corrected Brazil's record, but he lacked five seconds to climb on the honor's pedestal.
He received a bronze award in London four years ago.
He's also in the same distance two silver medals in the World Championships.
Judo coach Baskin: Nikiforenko isn't the real heavyweight.
Oļegs Baskins, the Latvian Jesuit coach, acknowledged in good faith that Arthur Nikiforenko in Rio’s Olympic family had hardly any chance of overcoming the worst Azerbaijann sportsman, Ušangi Kukauri.
In practice, there was no chance, only to a minimum if he could be caught in some way or in a cell.
We had already predicted that this would be the case.
He was well prepared, and the fight was correct, but the opponent was stronger.
The opponent was well known, because Nieforenko had fought against him twice already and both Arthur lost.
However, he's more severe.
Artourus has been artificially dumped into the heaviest weight category to enter the Olympic team.
The weight of up to 100 kilograms was already occupied, so Arthur used the European quota in the heavy weight category.
Artourus, weighing 100 kilograms, fought against a Judaism with a weight of 140 kilograms and has won serious tournaments a couple of times.
In the heavy weight category, at all, there is very little chance.
If in light weight categories there are all sorts of shifts, then in heavy - very rare.
To the question whether Nikiforenko in the future would better fight one grade in the lighter weight category, Baskins responded in a positive manner.
I think yes, Arthur would be better fighting in a category of up to 100 kilograms.
It's his real weight category.
He's not the real heavyweight.
65% of the Venezuelans want to stop Maduro, the question is whether they are ready to fight for it.
Two out of three Venezuelans want to stop President Nikolas Maduro, but the question is whether they are ready to fight for it.
Day after the National Election Board announced that “no time, no, this year, for the withdrawal of the vote, with which Chavismo will have power of beauty until 2019, people on the streets of Karakas continued their normal day-to-day course as if nothing had happened.
“I didn’t hear the news, ” said Rafael Deian, a 36 - year - old office worker who rested on Altamira Square on Wednesday.
The Altamir Square, located in the east of Karakas, was at the beginning of 2014 a sharp resting epicenter protesting against the Maduro regime.
However, now that the opposition must exert more pressure than ever in order to achieve a referendum this year, people are no longer capable of giving up such energy throughout the country.
\"I want a referendum, but for security reasons I will not participate in protests,\" said Dean.
Others, more informed ones, want to mobilise in the future, but admit that the Venezuelans are not so motivated.
Chairman of the Election Board Tibisej Lusen commented on the statement that the Government is hindering the withdrawal process.
I protest when the opposition calls for a protest, but I know that some of my friends are afraid, ” said Fox News Latino.
So, in addition to all the barriers that the government has built to prevent a referendum, the opposition is now facing a new challenge: to motivate people to go out in the streets and protest.
Until recently, the referendum initiative had a wide range of support: people entered an unprecedented collection phase.
However, when it comes to protesting against government moves to block efforts, the number of arrivals to myths is significantly less.
“Some people are focusing on the creation of food rows, others are afraid after the 2014 arrests and deaths,” said Cipriano Eredia, the legislator of the opposition.
After Lucena announced that until the next step of the referendum process - an even greater number of signatures to be taken across the country - they will have to wait until October, those against the Socialist Government say that President Maduro and his followers are simply trying to take away the courage of the Venezuelans, making them believe that voting this year is practically impossible.
According to the Constitution, if the referendum were to take place in 2017, Maduro could be suspended from office, but he would be allowed to name the next president.
If he were to be suspended today, he is obliged to hold general elections.
The US Department of State addressed this issue in a Thursday afternoon statement calling on the Venezuelan authorities to ensure that the constitutional rights of the Venezuelan people are respected.
\"The remaining steps for the implementation of the President's withdrawal referendum should be made clearly, specifically and immediately, thus contributing to a rapid and effective resolution of the country's current political, economic and social difficulties,\" it was written.
Luis Salamanka, a policy analyst who was a member of the electoral board between 2006 and 2009 that changes are not expected so soon.
“I think there will be no referendum this year unless social unrest and protests become stronger,” he said in the FNL.
He said that Lusen and the government violated the law, but they would result in their goal if people did not understand aloud.
The opposition in September called for wide manifestion. First in Karakas, to ask for an accelerated process so that withdrawal can take place this year.
We want people from all over the country to mobilise in the capital on this day.
The government will feel pressure, says Eredia.
Salamanka, on the other hand, believes that this situation cannot wait for so long.
\"They should respond to the Lucien Statement faster and stronger, as it actually kills the referendum,\" said expert FNL.
Congressman Eredia admitted that some opposition parties would like to see a manifestation taking place faster, while another group would want more time to organise.
The position now needs to be cautious.
If people find themselves insecure in this situation, there is a risk that the second collection campaign will be low, ” said Salamanka.
The referendum process, to be activated, must receive support from twenty per cent of the national voters, who are almost 4 million people.
Salamanka and other analysts are convinced that even if the withdrawal takes place in 2017, Chavismo will be sad.
However, some people are not so optimistic.
Our party wants political change today.
“If the government concludes the way to the elections, we will have to explore other legislative options, ” Eredia said to the FNL.
Director of the LNSC, A.Puķiti, shall be suspended for a period of time from office.

Ogres seniors sport is a festival.
Today, in Ogre District Sports Centre stadium, the Ogre Pensioners' Society Sport Festival was held.
Sanita Tauriņa, the organizer of the sports development work at the Ogres District Sports Centre, welcomed the stadium, which had prepared a special programme for participants of the Sport Festival.
This time individual results will not be evaluated, but participants of the sports festival will be divided into four teams.
“The sum of each participant as a result of the team will be added – explains S.Tauriņa.
Participants will have to perform four tasks - basketball highs, Eiffel tower building together with memory game, florbola workshop, summer skiing.
In order to successfully start all four disciplines of the festival programme, participants had to perform the freezing tasks - \"Tool circle - \"Rinkis dancius\" – \"Shipple – as well as three stafetes - riding with a horse, carrying out frisby and badminton elements.
All the tasks were prepared in attractive form, and participants of the sports festival made them with joy, smile and fun comments, mutually supporting.
Summer skiing was a source of special enthusiasm, which took place in the clothes prepared by the organisers.
The competition was followed closely by volunteers of Ogres District Sports Centre who conducted tasks, recorded results and did not hold back advice.
There was also an Ogres symbol of Čiekurs, who inspired the participants of the Sport Festival.
Ogres elders proved to be quite active, attractive and good in sport.
The representative of the Green Team Peter Zeps threw the ball into the basketball basket eight times in one minute, but only John Stauds, a member of his team, left one of the most effective shots.
In Ogre, pensioners are active.
The buses are always full of excursions, and around 300 people come to the parties.
“Every week we meet in family support centre premises, where we can play novus, table tennis, and use gymnastics – says Jānis Stauds, the Chairman of the Ogre Pension Association.
At the end of the sports festival, all participants received thanks for their participation at the Ogre District Sports Centre, but the greatest benefit is the movement in fresh air, a good mood and shared time.
In 2016/2017, Prime Minister No 19 West Bromwich Albion
Guardian journalists predict position 14 (Warning: it's not just Alan Smith's forecast, but the advice of our journalists in general)
Last season position 14
Prospects to win the League (by Oddschecker) 1000-1
Until last week it looked like a new season, such as the old Bromwich Albion: the 2016/2017 season will again be a struggle for satisfaction or stagnation, depending on how much a glass is, even more pragmatic under Tonya Pulisa.
But then Jeremy Piess sold 88% of his club's shares to Guochuan La and Pulis, in an archetyped safe hand, made by the bukmiekers immediately to the favorite first laid off manager's lot.
The situation has clearly changed in Balack Country - and not only in Hawthorns, but also in a few miles northwest Volverhampton, where young Chinese owners refused to provide the services of Kenya Jacetta without spending time.
Pulis, however, To confirm that his work is not immediately threatened, and the businessman has also expressed his wish not to change the club culture.
“I don’t want to change the club’s virtues or to start in an unsustainable way,” he said.
I want to be a good owner and invest in this club in the long term.
First of all, our goal is to ensure that we stay in the Prime Minister and then be even further, and I would like to see the club strengthened at the top of the Division.
I think it's the best league in the world, and I want to take this club as far as possible.
These are the achievements of Pulisa, and the first aspect should not be difficult.
The next objective is to break down to the top of the table, but it will be important for the new owner and the increasingly broken fan base to look forward to a quick break-down on the top of the table, in order to realise that this is an extremely difficult task, given the profound work recently invested in other adjacent teams in the table.
It will certainly be more necessary to go beyond the 14th place of last season to get up.
Only aston Villa, which is at the lower end of the table, shot fewer gates, and it is worth reminding that during Christmas, Albion, on average, did less than one blow in the gate for 90 minutes, almost the worst of a divinity.
They could not win 13 out of 38 games and hit more than one gate in only nine games.
Of their 10 wins in any game failed to win more than one gate, and the seven games ended with 1-0.
As expected, a dozen out of a total of 34 gates were derived from standard positions.
It's no wonder that the Hawthhorns team was dissatisfied, probably after the shocking 0-0 was not separated by Villa at the end of January, when the guestcomanda looked better.
On the other hand, only the six best teams had better security indicators - although no club has managed to add four centre semi-guards to the list.
These guards are often undervalued, especially Johnny Evans, to whom Arsenal is willing, in view of their recent crisis in the hands of the injured players.
The Northern Ireland International team had a great start at the European Championship, and Albion will have to spend a lot of time selling.
Ben Fosters is reliable in the gate, and they are well-completed on the average line.
Darens Flecher, much like Evans, demonstrated to a large extent that he was still able to play on a high level at age 32, and Claudio Jacobs was undervalued.
Disturbing to all sides is that the future story of Saido Berahino is still unclear.
When Pisam was owned, the rates from Stoke and Crystal Palace were refused, but they still remain peace and Mark Hugh is ready to wait.
After the last season, being close to liquidation, it is worth all the parties involved to act.
The attacker, of course, is talented, but, as Pulis has already mentioned it several times, when he extortioned it on the one side, here on the other side, it has been evident for a long time that such a relationship has not worked.
The Albion insists that it is necessary to sign the documents for the change before allowing a former English U-21 sampler to go, but their 15 million pound-valued march with Diaphra Saho collapsed a few days before the takeover, claiming that he had passed a medical examination and agreed on everything, but he had a back injury, which would mean that he would have to miss the beginning of the season.
This puts great pressure on the Venezuelan Salomon Rondon, who looked very hopeful last season, but he must improve his nine-gate performance, especially if Ricky Lambert continues to be so ineffective.
The decision to release Viktor Aničebi and Stefan Sesegnon also looks strange.
Pulis throughout his career is sadly famous with his slow new players moving up and three nets - Jonathan Lek, Sam Fild and Tyler Roberts's arrival in the last season of the last game with the undistinguished 1-1 with Liverpool, hardly becoming the norm.
He will return to the already tested and tested, but Leko is worth keeping his sight.
The 17-year-old attacker generally took part in five games in the previous season, becoming the first player born in 1999 in the Prime Minister, who is also highly appreciated in the English youth football system.
Met Phillips, with 5.5 million contract with Queens Park Rangers, will be quick, but he is the only new player who participated in the first race on the weekend.
This would not be too daring to say if the end could be rather urgent.
“All, ” the Pulis last month said Express and Star about what would be improved.
Each position you see.
We need to strengthen the rear players, the middle part of the field and those playing in front positions.
The objectives are, we know what we want.
Getting them appears to be much more difficult than intended, mainly due to uncertainty about the takeover processes.
Season could determine how they have started, with seven largely winning games before the complicated race with Tottenham, Liverpool, Manchester City and Leicester from mid-October.
The pressure on Pulis will then become less or unsustainable.
And who knows, maybe you've even found a new club in Berahino.
Tata Steel UK closer to the rescue transaction after authorised aid changes in pensions
The pension attorneys behind Tata Steel UK said that the scheme can be restructured without being involved in the pension protection fund (PPF), increasing the company's chances of entering into a rescue transaction.
The British steel pension scheme has a GBP 15 billion commitment and an estimated deficit of at least GBP 700 million, creating serious obstacles to the conclusion of a rescue transaction between Tata Steel UK and Port Talbot Steelworks in Wales.
Tata Steel is increasingly convinced of ensuring the future of the British business, which employs 11 000 people, following negotiations with the Minister of Economics and the pension regulator.
The company plans to combine its European activities, including the British business and ThyssenKrupp, German conglomerate.
However, the conclusion of the transaction depends on whether the British steel pension scheme will be restructured and the government will provide financial support.
Alan Johnson, the pension manager, said that this scheme could avoid the PPF if the benefits of the employees were modified.
Although well funded in comparison with the other schemes, with a deficit limited to GBP 300 million for individual measures, Tata Steel and ThyssenKrupp want to control their commitments.
Johnston said that the authorised entities acknowledge that it is not real, for the joint venture or any buyer of Tata Steel Uk, to assume responsibility for financing the current and future deficit.
The modification of the benefits of the scheme was much more binding than the accession of the PPF, and he added where workers should be disadvantaged.
The sources of Tata Steel warn that it would still be able to sell to Port Talbot.
The company has consistently refused to guarantee the future of steelworks since the start of negotiations on the future of its British business in March, and this has been used as a short negotiation with the British Government.
Kušik Čaterje, Executive Director of Tata Steel Europe, said that the Indian conglomerate wants to make its steel business more sustainable.
Speaking at the meeting of Tata Steel in India at the meeting of the year, Mr Chaterje said that negotiations on restructuring of pension schemes were progressing, but he insisted that the scheme was well financed.
“We are talking to a wide range of stakeholders, including the British Government and other stakeholders such as the Wales Government, etc.,” said Cherier, reports Times of India.
We believe that pensions have some impact on the business of goods like steel, so we need to find a structural solution that does not prevent business from moving forward.
The pension authority's willingness to cooperate in the negotiations on restructuring of the scheme will be supported by Tata Steel.
The potential change in the scheme involves directing the measurement of annual inflation-based increases in benefits from the retail price index to the lowest consumer price index and limiting future pension payments to the minimum required by law.
Johnston added: “Tata Steel has been provided by the body and its advisers, by the government and by the pension regulator, with evidence of the scheme’s ability to pay the modified benefits for an indefinite period and with a low risk level outside the Pension Protection Fund.
Our investment strategy has meant that the funding position of the scheme has not been affected by the fall in the last-time securities market in the same way as in other British pension schemes. We are still convinced of the ability of the scheme to provide benefits at a self-sufficient level.
CSB commentator mixed Michael Fellaps and Ryan Lohti all the length of the race
The commentator of the Canadian broadcaster CBC Olympics caused anger on Thursday night, mixing Michael Felips with his competitor Ryan Lohti.
Elliot Frīdman both made the whole 200 m of individual swimming in which Felps won his 22th Olympic gold medal.
When Felps crossed the line, Frydman held him up as Lohti, Felpsa people and already an ancient competitor on the top of the world swimmer top.
Freeman cried out: “As soon as he was done, he will do it.
Ryan Lohte will beat Michael Fellps in this race!
Felps might not even be sent to the courtesan.
But Felps won, but Lohte finish the fourth.
Immediately after Felps was at gold, silence entered into the CBS broadcast.
In a miraculous way, the Friesman immediately acknowledged his mistake.
I'm sorry, I confused the tracks.
Felp with gold, he said.
The Canadian commenter, whose professionalism was acknowledged on a broad scale by error, again acknowledged his mistake within an hour after the event and apologised to the viewers on Twitter.
I'm all sorry.
I was surprised.
“No excuse, ” he wrote.
In the meantime, Felps won a record 2 168 years old as the biggest Olympic winner ever.
The previous record belonged to Leonidas of Rhodes, who won more Olympic titles than anyone else in the antiquity Olympics.
Russian hackers attacked the computer of the former NATO Force Commander.
Hackers have published lists of General Filip Bridlov and data on the work of one of the Soros funds.
The same hackers who could have carried out and made public lists of US Democratic Party e-mails some time ago could also be blamed for a new series of attacks, report agent Bloomberg-
According to this information, these cyber attackers attacked the correspondence between the former NATO European Force Commander General Filip Brīdlov and the Open Society, the Institute's services as part of the millionaire George Soros's project.
The attackers have published the information gathered in a link to DCLeaks.com.
It contains Brudlov correspondence and data on the functioning of the “Open Society – Institute.
It is reported that hackers have had access to fund computers for about a year.
According to the news agency, this is about the same hackers who carried out the attack on the computers of the US Democratic Party and which are led by the Russian specsian.
A year ago, the U.S. intelligence alerted the High Officials of the Congress to the possible attack of hackers on the Democratic Party.
The news agency Reuters reports that it has information that it is paying attention to a number of politicians at that time - cyber attacks are coordinated by two Russian intelligence days or by organisations controlled by them.
But the congressmen could not pass this information on to the victims of cyber attacks because it was secret.
The report on attacks on Democratic Party computers began after some 20 000 e-mails were posted on the Internet, written by representatives of the Party during the presidential election campaign in the United States.
The party's candidate, Hilaria Clinton, announced that this mailing was organized by Russian specs.
The Secretary of the Russian President, Dmitri Peskov, has declared that Russia has nothing to do with cyberists.

In Liepaja, the insulation of the house will have to agree to two thirds of its population.
If the owners of apartments are very harsh and specifically talking about the condition of the building, if there is such an opportunity to receive support and arrange the building in every possible way, then it is quite easy not to use it.
One of the most important changes is that EU co-financing from this year can be received by any apartment house, but the condition is that the building façade must be warmed up.
In the past it was allowed to use only serial apartment buildings.
For managers of the largest worry houses, it provides the organisation of meetings of apartment owners.
A major problem, where the process is currently delayed, is that 67% of apartment owners' consent is required.
\"The previous programme required 51% – indicates Toms Cirulis, the project manager of LNA, Ltd.
“It is certainly very difficult to ensure this because in most of the general meetings such a number of apartment owners do not come up – says Gints Lochmels, the project manager of the company’s “Namu service APSE”.
The largest house operators in Liepaja - “Namu service APSE – and the LNA, which serves around 900 buildings, plan to renovate at least 50 apartment buildings by 2020 in the new planning period.
They do not exclude the possibility that at the beginning of the job it will be difficult to convince people to vote in favour of renovations, but each project should improve the public's attitude.
I also needed bank credit, and 76% of the home population needed it.
“Speaking, explaining what will – I still get their signatures – indicates the most energy-efficient building in Latvia, senior Vita Izalniece.
She agrees with John, who also lives in a warm-up building.
Well, you can't make it up, and the other side plus one man doesn't agree.
“No, of course, it’s important that everyone agrees with the whole event.
The change in such regulations was proposed by the representatives of the financial institution ALTUM.
They explain that with 51% of the votes in banks it is not possible to attract the necessary funding, which has also been experienced in the last programming period.
Most commercial banks require two thirds of the apartment owners' certification.
Anda Lagzdiņa, Head of the European Union Foundations Unit of the Ministry of Economics, as one of the recommendations to house operators, highlights the opportunity to present the citizens with the examples and various benefits of renovation of buildings, such as energy saving.
As a young man, Aaron was long angry with the world for the death of his mother.
In Canada, the detention operation of a potential suicide bomber was worthy of a press film.
It all started when the Canadian police received the video captured by the U.S. Federal Investigation Office.
Very early in the morning, the Canadian Royal Police have received reliable information from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Among other things, it contained a video that has been recorded by an unknown person who was clearly at the stage of preparation of the last attack.
“And he was going to do it with a self - made tension, ” said Mike Kabanah, Canadian Deputy Chief of Police.
In the video, a man dressed in black masks in English and Arabic threatened Canadians and promised to pay tribute for everything they had done for Muslims.
Through facial and voice recognition computer programs, the Canadian police have been able to recognize the man within about three hours.
It was the 24-year-old Aaron Drewer.
He was already under the supervision of the Probation Service for promoting terrorism and radical Islamic ideas on the Internet.
The judgment prohibited Draiver from continuing to do so and also from participating in any radical organisation.
However, the authorities did not believe until then that Draiver could pose some physical danger to the surrounding population.
When the police arrived in the town of Stratroi in the province of Ontario, the young man had left and sat in a taximeter.
The police tried to arrest him at that time. However, Draiver, sitting on the back of the seat, started a tension.
To prevent the detonation of another explosive, the police shot for the young man.
He's dead from the injuries he's got.
Taximeter driver is not hard.
In an interview with Canadian television, Veins Draiver, the father of an neutralized terrorist, said that his son had turned to Islamic teenagers.
This had originally helped him to cope with drugs and alcohol.
However, Aaron was a problematic teenager who had long been angry with the world for the death of his mother, adding his father.
Only when I saw the video today, I realized how far he had gone.
I had no idea he was so radical.
“And I didn’t know he was able to speak Arabic so well, ” says Aaron’s father.
The Canadian police admit that if they had arrived a few hours later, the developments could have been much different.
Radēviča will go to Rio as a tourist and support Latvian lighthouses.
The former Olympic woman and lighthouse Ineta Radēvičs in the LTV Olympic studio said that the performance of the seven-sex athletes Laura Ikauniece-Admidiņa Friday in the first two disciplines is not bad given that the athletes had trauma.
During the high-rise, Laura did the right-legged kick, not as usual with the left.
Radēviča pointed out that this was comparable - just as a person who was able to write with the right hand would suddenly be forced to write with the left.
Therefore, the result of Ikauniece-Admidiņa, given the injury, is not bad.
Radēviča discovered that she has not yet contacted Ikaunniece-Admidiņš in the past, but actively follows her starts and feels with her.
Ineta learned about Laura's injury recently and expressed support for the sportsman, stating that the lock did not begin to build himself a cushion, but showed the character and the spirit of the fighter.
On other sports, Radēvičs believes that the Olympic norms are very high, therefore one of the Latvian athletes has been accused of going to Rio as a tourist.
She remembered that herself was called a tourist when she was going to the first Olympics, where she won the 13th place, and that created negative emotions.
Ineta sometimes remembers its starts, not only the Olympics.
\"I like to remember my emotions, not the results, to remember my experience in sport, Radēviča opened.
She told me that it was always important that there was someone in the triples who would give us the energy of coping.
However, Radēviča will be a tourist this year - she will be travelling to Rio de Janeiro for next week to support Latvian athletes.
She points out that it is certain that she will go to the language race.
Ineta Radēvičs won the European Championship in 2010.
In 2004 she took 13 places at the Olympic Games in Athens at the remote jump and 20th position in the triple jump, but in 2008 the Olympics did not lighten because she was waiting for her son.
As noted in London, Radēvičs had 4th place at a distance.
The fair will show the film The Quanta Code, with the physicist Kashcheyev in the main role.
The film's annotation says that in parallel to cutting electrons into a laboratory, Kashcheyev is a dreamer, teacher, socially active and civic-thinking husband and father who is looking for a connection with Visvareno.
The character of the film in the Latvian Television programme “Rīta Panoramam” pointed out that he had an interesting experience to take the film.
I learned how to get a movie, how to film it, as a sound.
“And actually a fantastic job, ” said a physicist.
He admitted that the film was made in two years.
The biggest disagreements with the director were about the name of the film.
I am completely against this name.
There's no quantum code.
“No mystery that, while watching the movie, could and is clear, was added by an Associated Professor of LU.
Kashcheyev admitted that he likes the premiere of the movie at the Murjan Open Film evening.
They are organized by friends from the Foundation’s Easy and these events will take place every evening until 9 September.
Four people died in bombs at the popular entertainment places in Thailand
After the Thai people voted for the adoption of the Constitution supported by the military, on Thursday and Friday, in the five southern provinces of Thailand - popular tourist destinations - there were a number of bomb explosions, in which four people were killed and many injured.
The first two explosions took off at the seaside resort in Huahina on Thursday night, the next one - Friday morning.
The city is about 20 miles [200 km] south of Bangkok.
The police announced that in the first explosion one Thai woman had died and 20 people had been injured, 10 of whom were foreigners.
The authorities confirmed that other explosions took place in the southern cities of Phürt, Tran, and Surathan.
Two bombs exploded in the Phygite suburb of Patton, and another two in Phanna Province - in the tourist region north of Phürt.
In the last 24 hours, 11 bomb explosions have taken place in Thailand.
On Friday, Colonel Krisana Patanačaroen, a royal police officer in Thailand said that explosions were not associated with Islamic extremists and were considered to be local sabotage acts.
\"It is too early to draw conclusions,\" he said.
\"However, we certainly know that these incidents are not directly related to any type of terrorism, they are, in fact, local sabotage, and we are trying to find those who are guilty:
On 12 August 2016, following a small-scale bomb blast in Huahin, the investigators collected evidence from the scene of the crime.
On 12 August, officials announced that four people were killed in a bomb explosion in Thailand’s important tourism areas.
There are no conflicts in the country that could lead to terrorists in the country.
“We can therefore say that these incidents are not terrorist attacks,” he continued.
No group has yet assumed responsibility for the attack and the competent authorities have not accused any special group, but explosions occurred the same week when the Thai voters approved the new Constitution.
All three southern provinces - Huahina, Phürtet and Phanna - rejected the military-supported referendum, and the south-eastern Thai provinces, where the majority of the population of Muslims have been killed by more than 6500 people since 2004.
The explosions took place on the birthday of the Queen of Thailand, Sirikita, which is a national holiday in Thailand.
There is a royal castle in Huahina, Kali Kangwon, or “city far from the worry, ” where a Thai royal family often dwells.
King Bullibol Aduljad was the longest - known monarch in the world.

Porgie and Bess, what we deserve for years!
There are a lot of operas that have never tasted in Latvia.
There is something that sounds very rarely.
However, it seems strange if since the 1970s George Gēršvinas opus Porgijas and Bessa have not been either staged or played, if they do not count the periodic examination of chresomatic solo numbers such as Summertime (including the titled performance at Inese Galante's summer festival), individual student projects, guest shows and so on.
It has its own reasons - since Latvia is a civilised state of the Western world, it is bound by the rules of the family heirs of Gēršvina and copyright licences, which are in force for Porgia and Bessu until 2030.
The conciliation procedures are not simple.
In addition, the author wanted all fourteen soloists to be black when he made a full presentation.
In Latvia, of course, the existing discussions and contexts around this opera in the United States are little known and it would be difficult to fulfil the composer's wish to do so.
The Compromise concert tour with the help of four autistic black American soloists and their Latvian solo brothers and sisters on 6 August was brightly performed on the 10th anniversary of the Cēsu Art Festival, reminding the magic soundwrite of Gēršvina, which includes the European classical music traditions with American jazz rhythms, gosses, fashion dances of the beginning of the 20th century and memory-remaining hits, expressing the naughty U.K.F. Porg. and the love story of the taverinist Bessa in a musical quality that deserves documentation for the ancient music history of life.
Firstly, because of LNSO and conductor Andra Pog.
In spite of the complex spatial location of the concert performance in the open-air conditions of Cēsu Palace Park, the orchestra is located on the next stage next to the stage stage, on which soloists and singers (and great dance!) choir While the total sound was stylistically nuanced, contrasting rich and accurate both in static and metal blowing instruments and in the piano party (Mārtiņš Zilberts).
Second, because of the excellent solo team.
The heaviest dramatic bariton Lester Linch (Porgy) is a well-loved singer in Europe and the Americas, whose repertoire consists of both baritone and basbaritone parties, especially in Verdi operas.
Porgia has performed many times, several times also Kraunu - he felt like fish in the water in this opera and inspired the stage partners even in the concert presentation to pose the emotional atmosphere of solidarity of the poor population of the fishing village.
Letony’s Mour in his second Porgija and Besa concert (the first took place in 2012 no more, not less than with Berlin Philharmonics and Sir Simon Retlu) revealed as a vitally plastic combination of various vocal styles with a dramatic tone of thematic and fantastic pionus in the top register.
She is not for nothing one of the brightest sheep of modern times.
For Jermein Smith, who was once looked at by Andris Pogs in Boston, the image of the narcodiller Sporthiff plays a role on four continents.
In it he shows his simultaneous dancing and singing skills as a well trained musical actor.
Smit is one of the rare whirlwinds whose voice still seems to be hiding even more undiscovered vocal possibilities than 15 years ago, when the opera voice accidentally was found, crissuring it to mock peers.
Unbelievably, even from row 24 and relative darkness, Jermein Smith’s expressive language of gestures allows him to see the dust bag of happiness in his hands even if it doesn’t exist there.
How can the poor Bess not follow such a mephistopelist tempter who in an empty place makes him believe the illusion of a wonderful life in New York?
Rodney Clark, a generously equipped brother, portrayed the role of the disaster.
The biggest vocal surprise in the Latvian solo team at the Cesis was the Sirina, the most famous register of Sonoras Vaices, the skilful balancing between the text spoken and singing, correspondingly changing the voice position, the vocal acrobatics and dramatic performance, both in Sirina's mercy My Man is Gone Now, and in the stylized singer's imploration Oh, Doctor Jesus.
In Clara's role, the voice of Margarita Wilson sounded well, but at the very beginning, the iconic Summertime sounded a little loud and nervous, resulting in its true character in the raprry.
The parties entrusted to Mikhail Čulpaev, Rihardm Mačanovskis, Andrim Lapiņš (especially Krabju’s salesman placed on the castle ruins walls in response to the Soprane software by the Irma Savigor).
Spectacular characteristics in the paintings of Ilona Bagel, Rihard Miller, Emil Kivlenieks, as well as in the recorded roles where the investigator of Ivo Martinson and the head of the Cēsu Festival and activist Juris Žagars were suddenly presented to the audience.
In the spatial concept of the concert performance created by Viestur Kaišis, the choir worked on steps, soloists – mainly in the proscene, rarely coming or going along stairs.
A bit of comical situation was done in enough dynamic action by Latvian soloists to take off the folder.
There is a very prose explanation for their presence.
First, some soloists sang several intermittent role models (which at times made it difficult to track their stage identity).
Secondly, there is a lot of dialogue in Porgia and Besa, talking about a phrase, a replicate, which is easier to track with the naked.
In Cesis, a titrate machine helped the audience to look into the operational details of the action.
The weather did not publicise and the first part of the concert performance fell for quite a long time.
However, it did not stop most of the audiences remaining to the end in order to catch the artists.
Nine evenings though it is quite a late starting time for a full-length opera, especially if a longer home is expected from Cēsis, the opera Porgija and Besa are worthy of returning to the Latvian music scene and are likely to become one of the most bright musical adventures of this summer.
In Liepaja too, where it sounded yesterday and in quite other acoustic conditions.
In Riga playing field the man feared children with a barn.
Yesterday, August 11, about eight o’clock in the evening, the State Police received a message from the grandmother of a frightened child, who was worried that a man who had been abducted by children on Lomonosova Street, a children’s square.
The law enforcement immediately responded to the call and arrived at an event where he also met this man with a closet, who was in a very big spirit--3.07 promiles at the time of the event.
It was found that a man born in 1962 had frightened his children before, so that they did not noise.
However, this time, to scare children, the aggressive man used a child - withstood closet.
The man was arrested.
Criminal proceedings have been initiated against a serious disturbance in public order, which manifests obvious disrespect for society or shame, ignoring the standard of conduct generally accepted and hindering the peace of people.
In the case of such crimes, the term of imprisonment shall be for up to two years, or temporary deprivation of liberty, or by forced labour, or by a fine and subject to the supervision of probation for a period of up to three years.
The president of the Federations usually uses guest accreditation in the Olympic Games.
Presidents of sports federations usually arrive on the venue of the Olympic Games for a few days and use guest accreditations, which can change names, therefore they have several owners during the competition, LETA was told to the agency by the representative of the Latvian Olympic Unit (LOV) Marita Vilciņa.
On Wednesday, the extensive oustage followed the statements made by Aļona Ribakova trainer German Jacukovsky, who revealed that at the last moment he decided to go to Rio de Janeiro Olympics by the Head of the Latvian Swimming Federation (LPF) Mr.Kaspars, while the coach has to stay home.
Later, it became clear that Mr. Brazil came with a trainer's accreditation, for which the President himself expressed a surprise, because “there are no places in...
According to Vilciņa, the presidents of only two federations, as well as Guntis Zalitis, the Head of the Latvian Association of Athletics (LVS), lived in the London Olympic Games.
The Olympic village is home to athletes, as well as official individuals, including, for example, coaches, doctors, delegation administration.
As a result, it is likely that Mr. London also had a trainer accreditation.
“The other presidents of the federations come as guests and are subject to exchange of accreditation – they arrive for a couple of days and then use it for another.
Mr. Rio de Janeiro arrived already at the end of July and Brazil will be left in August 13, so it is likely that he will be the longest presidents of all national federations.
Significantly, only one day in 10th August was launched in Latvia's outskirts.
Latvia will be represented in 11 sports at the Rio Olympic Games, and LETA estimates by the agency show that six or seven presidents of federations will be taking part in the four-year major competitions.
On Saturday, the president of the Latvian Cycling Federation (LRF) Igo Japiņš will be on the BMX competition planned the next week, Ansis Dale, President of the Windsurfing Federation of Latvia, has planned to fly to Rio de Janeiro on August 16th, when Katie Birzule will start, and Dzintars Urbančiks, President of the Latvian Fight Federation, will be on the day before.
The next week, Kārlis Krēsliņš, President of the Latvian Shooting Federation, will also plan to arrive, when Dain Upelnieks will have started as well.
The President of the Latvian Federation of Judo Raimonds Rublovskis, at least during the Latvian athletes' competitions, did not appear in Rio de Janeiro, although his arrival was planned, the Latvian Federation of Canoe is not a president at present, but Latvian Olympic Committee is still in charge of the importance of Latvia's society.
Meanwhile, the President of the Latvian Volejbols Federation Atis Dārnietis and the Head of the Latvian Tennis Union Juris Savickis decided not to get used in Rio de Janeiro.
Vassiliev appreciates the natural breasts of Latvian women.
The world-famous Russian fashion historian, interior decoration, stage designer, book author, lecturer and collector Alexander Vassiljevs has often visited Latvia during the last years.
More recently, he «Miss un Misters Latvija» evaluated the contestants in final 2016 and acknowledged that natural breasts and lips, which have not been improved with silicone and botulinum injections, can be proud of Latvia’s beautiful representatives.
During the conversation, Alexander Vassiliev explained that for many years he has been the president of the jury in the popular, Miss Russia, a beauty competition.
This is precisely why he is also interested in the evaluation of the 2016 participants of “Miss and Mitsters Latvija”.
Asking about the differences in the standards of the Latvian beauty competition from similar competitions in Russia, Vasiliev stressed that Latvians and Russians have quite different figures: “Russian beauty contest participants have a richer breasts than Latvian competitors.
However, Latvian youth are beautifully dressed and encrypted, and can be proud of natural beauty rather than the miraculous works performed by plastic surgery.
That is why I particularly congratulate the participants of the Latvian beauty competition with their natural beauty.
In connection with its professional activities in Latvia Vassiliev has large plans.
Currently, the exhibition of the fashion historian’s collection “Adjudicated nature” is open at the Museum of Decorative Arts and Design.
In Ventspils, Livonian Order Palace, there is an exhibition by Vassiliev “Kazēri 1860-2010”
Vassiliev loved Ventspils so much that a couple of days also enjoyed the city’s hospitality and went for a walk along the sea.
I like it in Latvia.
Especially now that there is a threat of terrorism across Europe, here is a real paradise.
“It is a good pleasure to spend time and relax in Latvia, ” acknowledged fashion guru.
In addition, on 23 November, Alexander Vassiliev in Old Riga will open the private fashion museum.
Ask for help!
Please donate for the treatment of our son, brother, grandson.
As a family of Rinalda, we are grateful to fantastic people around and to God for being able to save Rinalda, but unfortunately, there is no way at present to fully bear the cost of medicine on our own.
Rinald Grinberg is an 11 - year - old tusk who was diagnosed with brain tumor at the end of July.
This year he graduated at grade 4 Millkalne primary school with excellence, a powerful sportsman and a very talented artist.
I think everything was in his hands.
Healthy, joyful, persistent, hard and active boy.
Always smiling and kind.
July 26 will be remembered for life in our family.
During the last few weeks, they suffered with nausea, headache, but the doctors wanted it to be a stomach virus.
And at first it seemed to be so.
For whoever could imagine that such innocent, symptoms to blame are more serious than those of an invincible mind.
On July 26, for diagnosis, Rinald has a brain tumor.
It is fast to accumulate fluid in the brain, but everything that doctors can help in Latvia is to carry out a bypass operation to remove excess fluid, because a tumor is practically not available for direct surgery.
It is also not possible to determine whether the tumor is benign or malignant.
The next state-paid plan: start radiationing and watch what is happening.
It's like a bad nightmare, we're going to experiment here, we're going to look at the results.
Fortunately, it was possible to show the results of the Rinalda examinations to the doctor in Spain.
He is the vice-president of the World Association of Neurology, one of the world's leading neurosurgs.
He took the opera, and it turned out that he had to go through immediately.
The tumour exerts enormous pressure on the brain and the risk of complications is too high.
Also, it is urgent to understand whether the tumor is benign or malignant to draw up a plan for further treatment.
Not for a moment, parents chose to go to Spain to save their son.
At fantastic speed, August 8, Rinald and Mom Evia were in Spain and were operated on August 9.
The surgery was very complex, more than 6 hours long.
The operation took place at Santa Elena, a clinic.
Most of the tumors were removed, pressure decreased, analytical samples were obtained.
Rinald is coming from the bed and like a good teenager, asking for potatoes for dinner.
Now we have to wait for the results of oncology tests.
Thank you to Dr. Araez and the clinic's management, who understood the situation and operated the operation urgently, without full payment for the treatment prior to the operation.
They trust that the remaining sum will be paid, demanded only a EUR 10 000 first contribution to operate and save the lives of Rinalda.
While €6 000 of parents managed to provide by selling machinery, the other necessary amount of travel expenses, accommodation, and the first contribution of the hospital was to borrow from relatives and friends.
But at least EUR 24 000 is still needed to pay for the first treatment in Spain and give back the money that we have borrowed for the first contribution.
Please help us pay back this operation of Rinalda's health so important.
Every euro is important to help cover the costs of an operation already carried out and to be able to successfully continue Rinalda treatment.
The signs of anxiety in Ukraine ask: What are Vladimir Putin's thoughts about?
There is evidence to suggest the truthfulness of these claims.
Ukraine denies them, while the USA and the European Union claim that Russia has not provided any evidence.
The Open Analysis Group, Digital Forensic Research Lab, has identified some signs of Saturday shooting, but very little to be able to hinder the big plans of Moscow.
Russia is known for its distortion or misinterpretation of events for political purposes, in particular in the context of the continuing conflict in Ukraine.
This does not mean that all Russian claims are unfounded.
The participants of the Ukrainian resistance forces damaged electrical castles supplying power in Crimea last year and some of them are also involved in criminal activities and human rights violations.
The attempted attack in the Crimean region is still a pressing issue, although there is little reason to suspect that the Ukrainian government would sponsor a scenario of such events.
However, the images found by the open source analysts show that Russia has been increasing its military presence since, at least, last Saturday - before the expected attack took place.
They show how heavy weapons convoy is moving through the peninsula, including shore protection missile systems.
Anescalation of the traumaticly known Russia
According to some reports, Russian forces in Crimea had already planned rotation around this time, which could help explain the activity, although it would be a very coincidence that it simply happened in one of the most stressful times since annexation in 2014.
Whatever is known at the end of the week, Mr Putin has undoubtedly made a greater effort in his statements in favour of Ukraine, choosing to use this episode, however real it may be, for a greater purpose.
The analysts point to the alarming parallels with Russia's behaviour just before the previous military action against Ukraine.
In February 2014, with similar speeches and military manoeuvres, it was ensured that the volunteers of the Crimean resistance took over the peninsula still controlled by Ukraine at that time, only to discover that they were in fact Russian special entities that launched the military occupation.
In August, when Russian-supported separatists were not involved in Eastern Ukraine, Putin deployed his forces along the border to warn that they might need the defence of the ethnic civilians of Russia, Ukraine, which he said is being attacked.
He organized an aid convoy to the region, which according to NATO information was only covered by Russian invasion forces.
What does Mr Putin plan to do in Crimea?
Some have raised whether Moscow alone is planning another military intervention.
The fight in Eastern Ukraine has been exacerbated, as it was before the invading in August 2014.
But this apparent parallel could be the point where fear of military action is to be introduced, not from actual action - that will give Putin a brief message in its relations with Ukraine and with Western countries.
Mark Galeoti, professor at the University of Nu York, who studies Russia, pointed out that Crimea would be of little importance as a starting point for military action against Eastern Ukraine, bordering Russia's part of the land, not the Crimea, and that the rest of the country is better protected.
“There is a rather small chance if the Russians really plan a large-scale office, ” said Mr Galeoti.
Rather, we can observe the creation of a classic Russian strategy-pression-
The international peace talks on Ukraine, which were once a mechanism by which Putin imposed contact with Western leaders who ignored him as a result of the annexation of the Crimea, are increasingly considered to be ineffective and irrelevant.
Noting that there is a danger that conflicts may rise again, Putin gives a new meaning to the negotiations: getting her off the edge of the pit.
“It’s standard Putin’s tactic - he wants to try to start from the position of strength, ” the Galeotis said about the next peace talks planned at the beginning of September.
\"And the only strong side is to say, \"If I wanted to, I could make everything much worse, much worse --\"
Making an Agreement with the West
Putin also said this week that during the Crimean tensions, it was not of great importance to continue the negotiations, convincing other parties to return to the negotiating table and reach the heart of the process.
What does that actually give him?
Firstly, it allows Russia to continue to emerge as a world superpower, even though its economies are smaller than Australia.
Secondly, it has placed Moscow as a member of the veto in relation to Ukraine's sovereignty, with some of the country under Russian control.
It can also benefit Putin's long loyal expectations of a large-scale agreement with the United States which would resolve their disputes on the Ukrainian and Syrian issue, with Moscow on favourable conditions, naturally - also by ending the West's sanctions against Russia.
Putin's hints of this objective since the deterioration of the state's economic situation in 2014, have been expressed several times, mainly due to the decline in the value of national oil and gas exports.
Since the invasion of Syria last autumn, he has repeatedly called on the Western powers to join him in the great coalition against extremists.
However, the Russian leaders can believe that it would be necessary for them to provide such an agreement before the end of President Obama's term of office.
The Russian authorities mainly believe that the next president will be Hillary Clinton, who is more hostile to Moscow.
Donald Tramps, though very friendly to Russia, is still considered unpredictable.
Obama, on the other hand, is considered to be one who seeks solutions rather than conflicts, ” said Galeoti.
So it makes sense to close the window of the possibility so that something is done quickly.
Meanwhile, if you fail to reach a wide-ranging agreement, Putin seems to be satisfied with maintaining Russia's weak neighbour by mentioning what goes on.
In the previous version of this article, the year when Russia anected Crimea from Ukraine was misunderstood.
This was the case in 2014 and not in 2013.
As the convention arrives at the impasse, the White House shifts the means to fight the Zico virus
The Obama administration said on Thursday that it would divert $81 million from biomedical research and anti-corruption and health programmes to pay for the development of vaccines against the Zico virus by resorting to emergency measures, because Congress did not approve new funding to combat the virus.
Silvia Metjs Barvels, Secretary of Health and Humanitarian Services, indicated in the letter to Congress that without a dedicated means, the National Institute of Health and the Biomedical in-depth research and development body would remain free of money to combat the disease transmitted by the punishment until the end of the month.
Therefore, it would be appropriate to stop the vaccine at an important time, with Miami increasing the number of cases of Zico in the country.
Last week, 7 350 cases of Zico virus were reported in the United States, mostly in Puertorico (based on disease control and prevention centres data).
Mrs Barvelas said that 15 infants born with a Zico virus had birth defects.
A virus can cause abnormal brain development and other serious birth defects in infected mothers.
The spread of disease in the continental part of the United States, when the first cases were registered at the end of last month, has increased the political rates for the reactions of the federal government.
Hillary Clinton stopped on Tuesday as part of the campaign in Winwood, in the area of Miami, where there was an outbreak of locally transmitted Zico virus, and put pressure on Congress to return from its five-week break to confirm the emergency funding for the fight against the virus.
President Obama and the Republics of Congress have been in conflicting minds for most of the year on Zico virus.
In February Obama claimed USD 1.9 billion for emergency funding.
It was suspended by the Republic of Lithuania by requiring a more detailed report on which money would be spent.
Legislators have been arguing for months about how much money should be spent and how it should be spent.
Last month, the democrats blocked the review of the measure proposed by the Republicans when it was given USD 1.1 billion to fight the Zico virus, but included conditions that would prohibit the allocation of funds to support family planning in the provision of contraception related to a virus that could be so transmitted through the sexual route.
Because of this stalemate, the White House in April was forced to redirect 589 million US dollars to fight the Ebola virus, to fight the Zico virus. About two thirds of the funding is to be used within the country.
On Thursday, Mrs Barvelas said that her department had spent most of the money and that it would be spent in full by the end of August.
“Inability to decide on emergency funding for the fight against the Zico virus has led the administration to choose between delaying the development of an important vaccine and getting involved in other valuable national programmes to avoid this suspension for a time, ” said Barvell.
Democrats have taken note of this statement in order to reject the Republicans with no extra money to fight the Zico virus.
During the news conference, the representative of Nancy Pelosi from California, the leader of the minority, invited the representative of Paul D.Raien, the Spyker of the House of Representatives, reminding Congress of the transfer of this event.
“All the opportunities are exhausted, and now we turn to the National Institute of Health, ” said Mrs Pelosi.
Mr Raien's advisors say that dedicating funds is a step that has been taken a long time ago, and what Obama's administration has been delaying in exerting maximum political benefits from the problem of the Zico virus.
Last week, the National Health Institute announced the launch of vaccines against zico virus clinical trials in 80 people, and hopes to start the second phase in the countries with the zico virus epidemics at the beginning of 2017.
However, as the officials claimed on Thursday, without immediate additional funding, the study will stop.
Barvela said that she would channel Zico virus to the search for 34 million US dollars from the National Health Service for medical remedies against other diseases, including cancer and diabetes.
An additional 47 million will be transferred to the Biomedical in-depth research and development body supporting the development of medicines and vaccines in response to public health emergencies.
This money will come from multiple accounts, including $19 million from a programme to grant fuel oil subsidies to low income families and $4 million from substance dependence programmes such as opioid dependence.
Even as Barwell said, the extra money will only be sufficient for the following month when the agencies have to cut down their activities, fight the Zico virus, if the Congress does not act.
In the last four months, the Disease Control and Prevention Centre has spent USD 60 million to help the States protect pregnant women, USD 25 million to strengthen their preparedness and preparedness for the Zico virus and plans to fight against it, as well as USD 16 million to help it set up data collection systems to quickly detect the microcephaly and other symptoms associated with the Zico virus.
Thailand's leader links attacks on tourist popular places with constitutional changes
The Thailand junta leader called on the people of the country on Friday to be patient until the investigators find out what is behind this week the deadly bomb explosions series that have occurred in Thailand.
General Prajut Chan-och, Head of the junta and Prime Minister, said that criminals were “bad people” protesting against the new Constitution, which was confirmed by voters in a referendum that took place on Sunday.
\"There are still bad people, and they were running before the referendum,\" he said.
Four people were killed in five provinces of bombs on Thursday and Friday, including Phuket and Huahin, among the tourists in popular places.
The power authorities claim that the attacks of incinerators elsewhere are related.
According to analysts, bomb explosions have not been aimed at killing many people, but at damaging the tourism sector, one of the bright points of the Thai economy.
At least nine foreign tourists were injured in Huanchin.
“What are the motifs, explosions, and the attacks of the combustion plants that overturn the junta’s claim that the post-referendum situation will be stable, ” said Sunai Fasuks, senior researcher of Human Rights Watch.
These attacks have negative consequences for the authorities, terrorise society and harm the tourism economy.
Photo by Thai rescue staff cared for Friday at bomb explosion in Huahin.
The police claim that, in their view, these explosions are not related to international terrorism or long-standing Islamic unrest in southern Thailand.
They regard attacks as 'local sabotage', not terrorism.
The time and location of the attacks selected is a powerful political symbol.
The speculations took place on Friday, when people were prepared to celebrate the birth day of Queen Sirrikita, which in Thailand is considered Mother’s day.
Four explosions were demolished in Huahin, about 125 miles from Bangkok, where most of the injured.
The Constitution prepared by the military will reduce the influence of political parties and give military authorities more powers, even if the government is once again under civilian control.
Hunta helped to secure its victory by preventing opponents from campaigning against it.
Murray Hibert, a South-East Asian expert at the Strategic and International Studies Centre in Washington, has pointed out military suspicion that the attack was committed by dissatisfied people.
The guess was “directly coordinated, but apparently focused on creating fear and anxiety rather than mass damage and damage and injury, ” he said.
Last year, 20 people were killed at the popular Erevan temple in Bangkok, mostly tourists from China.
Thai officials tied bombs with Uighur fighters who were dissatisfied with the return of more than 100 Uighurs to China.
General Preyet, who has run the juntu since 2014 when the civil government was actively suspended, said that this week's explosions - hurt the hearts of the Thais -
Why now that the country is better when it goes better, and the tourism industry is better, he said.
We need to ask why and who.

When I started my fight tonight, I was trying to remove from my shoulders the weight of the black community, which is something I don't have with myself simply in this position.
I hope, however, that this will all be gone.
I am more than glad that I can serve others as an inspiration and hopefully diversify this sport.
At the same time, however, I would like to have a day when we have more, and it's not Simone, a black swimmer, because the sign black swimmer makes it look like I shouldn't be able to fight a gold medal or that I shouldn't be able to beat the records.
That's not because I work as hard as everyone else, and I love sports and I want to win the same thing as everyone else.
Fight about the protection of students - lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (L.G.B.T.) - in Colombia
Two years ago, Serge Urrego, 16 years ago, fell down from shopping center in Bogota, leaving a message about her suicide in a Facebook record, quoting Pink Floyd’s song “Goodbye Cruel World, ” from Ardiev’s wicked world.
His death was the beginning of the contradictions that arose this week in Colombia, where the rights of L.G.B.T. were viewed in the broadest political struggles that have divided the country into two camps.
After his death, Urrego's mother Alba Reijesa, brought an action before the court against school officials, blameing them for the exclusion of her only son, when it was found that he and his classmate had an intimate relationship.
A year later, the Supreme Court of Colombia gave her a favourable ruling calling on schools throughout the country to develop clearer policies to prevent discrimination.
The decision was part of a series of legal victories of the gay movement of Colombia. This movement was celebrated this year in the light of the decision on the legalization of single-born marriages.
However, this week they faced a barrier in their struggle for equality, because Jean Perody, a minister of education who has been openly gay, found himself scandalous about the application of this rule in the scandal.
The scandal began when the social media began to circulate sexually open content from the pornography magazine, spreading talks that it is part of the instruction published by the Ministry of Education.
Perody's been active at attacking it.
Although the Ministry offered schools assistance on issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity with the idea of helping them pay attention to the rule, it is not an attempt to impose standardised rules.
“What we want for schools are the tools for resolving conflicts, ” said Mrs Perdodis during a Thursday interview.
The debate began before the national debate on the future of the country where the peace talks are conducted between the government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or the FARC, the Partisan Group.
The political coalition in the government opposition and the leaders of the Catholic Church have mobilised extremely quickly indicting the government of Prezient Huana Manuel Santos for a union of one sex and the promotion of gender transformation.
In order to make everyone even more complex, the government delegation negotiating with the FARC in Havana recently reached an agreement on gender and L.G.B.T. equality, which calls on the government to adopt more inclusive policies.
Government criticism and peace talks in the 42-year-old Perody, the emerging star of Colombian politics.
They demonstrated their pop-up posters and some of them also threatened to target violence against him and her partner, Ms Alvares-Korrea Glen, former Minister for Trade.
Perody kept an amazing peace for a whole week of anxiety, trying to correct the mistake and resume the debate under constructive conditions.
\"Some things that make me stand and keep my head clear are knowing that there are children who are still to be revealed,\" she said.
This is a very tense field of work and a very lonely time.
She also referred to the link between the peace process and the debate on L.G.B.T. students.
While the columbians continue to assess the benefits of the deal with the FARC, which would be like a turning point for the earthquake in the country, they have to think about the origin of the conflict, she said.
“A country of peace is one that promotes inclusion or exclusion; whether it is one that all has the same possibilities: she asked the question.
Although this week she has not been pleased to be the target of insults and accusations, she is pleased that today's gay students can take an example from her and think that they too can try to become ministers one day.
\"It is very important to me that they are calm and aware that they can fully realise their potential,\" said Mrs Perody.
We cannot expect a new suicide to start changing something.
Save the vote cyberlying - The New York Times
“USA is looking for ways to keep hackers away from the ballot urns” (communication article, August 4)
The Minister of Internal Security, Jeh Johnson, says that the Obama administration is thinking of extra protection of the security of the national electoral system.
These changes may be necessary and should be considered immediately.
The cyber threats in various manifestations and the recent discovery that the external forces, perhaps the national states, are increasingly interested in the influence of our elections, require the federal government to pay further attention to the delivery of our electoral system and perhaps consider it to be part of the vital infrastructure of our country.
Johnson should immediately contact thousands of national jurisdictions that assist in elections and offer the help, advice and leadership of the Internal Security Department.
While the diverse and diverse nature of our voting infrastructure hinders efforts to ensure this, it tells us that the process should start as soon as possible.
The writer, the democrat of Mississippi, is a member of the high-ranking National Security Committee.
A boy wounded in the pensilvani, this week already in the third case of attractions in the parks
On Thursday, a boy was injured and taken to the hospital in Pittsburgh. The emergency service and park officials say that this week this is already the third accident in the United States in children's parks.
A child whose name is not discovered has only taken about 50 miles (80 km) to the children’s hospital in Pittsburgh west of the Aidlvald and Soukzon Park in Laidjonier, Pennsylvania, said a representative of the Rapid Assistance Services in the Westmurland region.
The three-year-old boy who visited with his brother while he was in the field was in touch with him, informed Jeff Krushor, who was at the e-mail.
The Shrub said that the roll-Coaster attraction would be closed for the investigation of the event.
Children shall be accompanied by adults for at least 3 feet (91 cm) in order to be able to visit the carousel and under 4 feet (122 cm).
According to the information published on its website, the attraction was built in 1938 and the State Department of Agriculture stated that it was inspected in August.
The hospital representative refused to comment on the condition of the boy’s health.
On Sunday, a 10 - year - old boy died from the hump of the world's highest water hill in Kansassistia, Kansas.
On Monday three 6, 10, and 16 - year - old girls, who dropped from heights of more than 30 feet (9 metres) on a panoramic wheel basket during the fair in Grinville, Tennessee, reported to the local media.
Japan’s Prime Minister Abe on the Second Year of World War will not visit a temple that honors the memory of those who fell into war:
The news agency Jiji reports that the Japanese Prime Minister, Sindzo Abe, will not visit the controversial Tokyo temple on the second anniversary of the World War, where the memory of those who died in the war is honoured.
On Thursday, Jiji reported that Abe was still planning to send to Jasukuni a ritual gift for the occasion of the anniversary on Monday.
The temple also honors the memory of 14 Japanese commanders, who were sentenced as war criminals, and China and South Korea view it as a symbol of Japanese wartime militaryism.
Abe has not visited the temple since December 2013, when he declared that he visited it to show respect to those who died for their homeland.
The New Japanese Defence Minister, Tomomi Inada, did not answer the question as to whether she would visit the temple, explaining that it was a matter of conscience.
Inada - close associate of Abe and supporter of the amendment to the Japanese pacifistic constitution - has regularly visited Yasukuni in the past.
The news agency Kyodo reports that the Minister for the Reconstruction of Japan’s Victims of Disaster in Japan has visited the temple on Thursday and has said that she has prayed for the peace and prosperity of Japan.
Relations between China and Japan, the two largest economies in Asia, have become more severe after the increasing presence of the Chinese coast guard and other national ships in the vicinity of the contested islands in the South China Sea, which is called Senka in Japan and Diouja in China.
Two suspects were arrested in planning the terrorist attacks on the Rio Olympic Games:
On Thursday, the police arrested two people suspected of supporting the Islamic group in planning the attack on the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
The police had already detained 12 persons before the operation on Thursday, all suspected of cooperation with the Islamic State fighters.
The Brazilian federal police reports that three more persons were interrogated and subsequently released.
Both of them are Brazilian on Thursday, but the police do not reveal their names and other information.
Although there has been no conflict with known militia groups in Brazil's history, the government reports that the Olympic Games have made the country a more relevant target, in particular by participating in the games in countries fighting the Islamic State.
These fighters control certain territories of Iraq and Syria, and the U.S.-led coalition has carried out air attacks against them.
The group has supporters around the world who have carried out civilian shootings and bombings.
The murder of the new suspected French priest formally charges charges charges
As part of last month's investigation into the murder of the French priest against a man arrested on Monday, Rauters reported a source of information in the police on Friday.
An investigation into cooperation with terrorists is being carried out against 21-year-old suspects, and he had planned attacks on people, a source of information.
The man was in phone contact with Adel Kermič and Abde Malik Petitjan who stopped church church service in St. Petersburg on 26 July and turned over to the 85-year-old Roman Catholic priest, Jacques Amel.
Both police shot.
The suspect had arrived from his home near Toulouse, to the Sentejen du Ruwe, and spent the night there in the days before the attack, and the source mentioned.
The young man who had not previously been criminalised acknowledged that he had spent the night there, but said to the investigators that he had left the following day because he had no good relationship with Kermitch and Petitjan, he was a source of information.
The investigators are trying to find out whether Kermitch and Petitgian were part of France and were associated with the Islamic country that had assumed responsibility for the attack.
A pre-trial arrest was applied to Petitjan’s cousin at the end of last month.
Dorus de Vriess undergo medical examinations before going to Celtic
Nottingham Forest club goalkeeper Dorus de Vriess has arrived in Glasgow, for he hopes to conclude a transfer agreement to Celtic.
De Vries was photographed at the entrance to the hospital in Roshol prior to medical examination after Hoops agreed on the terms of the Sky Bechampion Club.
The manager of the Parkhead Club Brendan Rogers is looking for an experienced centre guard so that the current first room, Kreiga Gordon, can compete.
However, Rogers trust in the 35-year-old de Vries because he and the Dutch have worked together in the Swansea Club.
He played 51 games in Swansea, which they led Rogers in 2011 won the right to move to the Prime Minister.
That summer he changed the Welsh form to join “Vilks, ” and since 2013 there is City Ground.
He also played in Scotland after the Diunfermline season, after he moved back in 2006.
His stay ended with disappointment, but when Pars experiences a double agony, he was sent out in exile from the highest before he lost in Celtic Scotland cup.
Under the contract, the guard was still a year left in the Forest, and it was reported that Celtic would only have to pay the nominal fee to obtain his signature.
Macy's gonna close 100 shops.
On Thursday, the giant of the supermarket Macy has announced its plans to close 100 shops, which is a dramatic step towards helping the chain of shops to get forward from the potentially darkened problem: in America, it claims to be in the age of online shopping too.
Macy's regularly reduces its store portfolio, often closing several dozens of underprofity shops immediately after the annual holiday fever.
However, with its summer statement that it will close 15 percent of its 728 shops and store chains, it seems to have taken a much more aggressive stance than many similar representatives from the retail sector in terms of reducing the number of its stores, adapting to a highly changing shopping environment.
Walkers and buyers go past Macy's store in New York.
Retail giant states that it is planned to close 100 shops.
Macy's has many reasons to try what to change: many of its stores are located in small regional shopping centers, as the number of buyers has been particularly affected by the prosperity of e-commerce.
In the supermarket category, it is generally more difficult to find time, as buyers are increasingly choosing retailers at a lower price, such as T.J.Max and fast fashion players like H&M, for example.
These factors, combined with the short-term difficulties such as the growing number of international tourist spendings and seasonal weather conditions, which Macy's has put itself in a precarious situation that has lasted for more than a year.
On Thursday, the company announced that its comparable sales volume had fallen by 2.6 per cent in the last quarter, a rather weak indicator, which was nevertheless an improvement due to the very poor 6,1 percentage points drop in the year, which was found in the previous quarter.
Retailer income was $5.87 billion ($7.64 billion in Canada), a 3.9 percent less than in this period last year.
Macy's said that closing shops would cost it about $1 billion in terms of annual turnover.
And at the same time, the closure of such a large number of shops could be regarded as recognition of the defeat of the retailer.
However, the value of the company's shares dropped by 17 percent on Thursday, which shows that investors perceive this move as a pro-active event that tells of a stronger future for Macy's.
In some respects, the fact that Macy's reduces the number of shops should not be a surprise.
Terry Lundgren, Director-General of the retailer, said earlier that the chain simply had too many shops.
The senior leaders have for some time said that they have adopted a new strategy, where a particular emphasis is placed on 150 of its most profitable shops, seeking to increase sales in the already advantageous outlets.
Jeff Jenette, Director of Macy's, appointed instead of Lundgren since 2017, said in his statement almost all the shops that the company plans to close are those where sales volumes and profitability are moving downwards.
“We are aware that there is no adequate return on investment on these outlets yet, and often there is no level of customer shopping experience that reflects our efforts in connection with Macy’s brand,” said Janete.
The company announced that it would present a list of the stores that would be closed later.
Macy's said that still being decided on lock-in shops and that therefore it is not yet clear exactly how many workers will be laid off.
The retailer will not be completely out of the main markets where it currently has shops, but it will think about closing out those shops that are less active.
This move will most likely be a dislike for shopping center managers, who will count on large tenants such as Macy's to attract and hold other smaller shops in their shopping centers.
Do your water bottle contain dangerous bacteria?
According to a new study, drinking from refilled bottles can be “a little worse than launching your dog’s toy, ” taking into account the number of bacteria that will come into contact.
Website Treadmill Reviews asked EmLab P&K to check 12 different types of water bottles - with screw cap, with flip-off cap, with flip-off cap, and with straw.
Each bottle of athletes had taken a week without washing.
Your refillable water bottle can be as dirty as the dog’s toy.
“On the basis of 12 of our tested water bottles, we found that there may be an alarmingly large number of viable bacterial cells in the reused pots: more than 300,000 colony forming units per square centimetre (KV/kv.cm.), ” says Treadmill Reviews.
The highest amount of microbes was found in the bottles with opening lids, more than 900,000 colony forming units per square centimetre (KV/h.cm.)
The bottles had microbes which could lead to skin infections, pneumonia or blood poisoning.
The bottles with pressurised corks were the next ones with 162,000 CFU/ sq.cm., while screw-in cork containers only contained less than 160,000 CFU/h.cm.
“It may be worse to drink water from such bottles than to eat from your pet’s container,” says the website.
A better picture is seen in bottles with straw, where only part of the other bacteria in the bottles was found - only 25 CFU/h.cm.
This could be due to water falling down to the lower part of the straw, rather than sticking to its edges, thus attracting moisture-loving microbes.
The microbes in straw are described in the bottles as \"most harmless\"
“On the basis of our test results, we recommend choosing a bottle with straw, because of the small number of bacteria and the lack of harmful microbes, ” says the website.
We also know that when it comes to bottles and bacteria, stainless steel is a better choice than plastics.
In addition, water bottles with no cracks and hard to clean will have fewer microbes.
The website advises readers to wash bottles after each use, ideal for a weak bleaching solution.
Religion must become modern or be forgotten
In the United States, the Democratic Party recently nominated Hillary Clintoni as its presidential candidate.
If the results of the last surveys prove to be true as well in the elections itself, America will inaugurate its first president, a woman, in January.
Last week, over the ocean, British Prime Minister Tereza Meya discussed the withdrawal of Britain from Europe by the German Chancellor Angel Merkeli.
Women educated in Western societies are raised in such a way as to be aware that they can be competent and successful in any area of professional activity through education, ambitions and hard work.
And today, new girls can target on a number of existing role models, working in the highest sphere of leadership.
So, does the long and heavy struggle for equality between women end?
Hillary Clinton is ready to become a President of the United States at any time, but women's leadership in religion remains a contentious issue.
Okay, not completely.
In religious terms, women's leadership remains a controversial issue.
Last week Pope Francisco announced the creation of a new commission to assess whether women would be consecrated in the Catholic Church.
The Church of England consecrated Libya Lane as the first woman-bishop in January 2015, but it was only after a failed attempt in 2012.
Since the early 1970s and the conservative move since the early 1980s, women have still had a very strong resistance to the concept of rabin in the orthodox Jewish order of women.
In November 2015, the American Orthodox Rabbit Council, in its third attempt to stop the increasing wave of support for the appointment of female Orthodox women to rabbi, published a rather harsh message that the concept of woman-arabine was contrary to the law.
Not far from irony, when Hilary Clinton was nominated as President of Democrats, the American leading Orthodox Rabbi, who oppose women's coordination, launched a series of debates on this contentious issue.
Why is this difference between secular and sacral?
The orthodox Judaism, like most other religions, seeks stability in what it sees as long - standing traditional values.
This is reflected in the ability to resist pressure to adapt to a changing society.
Those who oppose female coordination shall do so on the ground that this is not traditional.
However, taking on a tradition in this way is a price.
And the price of such unilateral thinking can paradoxically undermine the tradition of itself by subtracting the traditional community of oxygen that it needs to maintain its life.
In the book “Agust firearms, in the military history of World War I, Barbara Tačman emphasises the dangers of giving priority to the tradition of the one that has become known as “red-brick tragedy”.
Until the beginning of World War I, when the war passed from being ward in the close distance to a more severe artillery, which is being broadcast from a further distance, it became profitable to hide the soldiers as long as possible.
The British and German armies responded to these changes by changing their bright uniforms against the boring gray and brown.
French soldiers, however, still worn the same red hats and trousers that made them an easy target.
The proposal by the French Minister of Military Affairs, Adolf Mesiime, that the armies under his authority should act in the same way, was treated with ridicule and resistance.
Red pants reflected the pride and prestige of the army, and the military were not prepared to abandon it.
In Parliament, Etjen, former Minister of War Affairs, spoke on behalf of France.
“Stop red bixes, he cried out.
Never!
«It was not a expressive and idiotic attachment to the most visible of all colours,’ he wrote at the outset in the Messiah,“it was to have evil consequences...
Faith leaders who fight to involve women in the leading religious roles could fall into the same trap.
Focusing on “traditional ” religion rather than asking the important question:“ What changes are needed to make religion flourish, they risk losing some 50 percent of their followers.
They also take away the talent, skills and enthusiasm of the entire community otherwise provided by women.
To insist that men continue to wear trousers when it comes to religion, it may be traditional, but as shown by the destruction of red bees, it may not be worth it.
Dina Breivere is a founder of JOFA, a founder of the women's orthodox feminist association, and a student of orthodox rabinism in New York.
The children of the Roya District have acquired new skills in the camp.
From August 1 to 6, the Rojupe Children and Youth Initiative Centre hosted a camp called \"Varaviksne Bridges\", where participants showed creative expression, sport and acquired new skills.
We arrived in the camp on the final day, when children painted glass jars with great passion.
Māra Folkmane, youth specialist at the Rojupe Centre for Children and Youth Initiatives, said that this was one of the activities that participants liked most.
A visit to Einar Kalniņa’s “Mazbebrens ” site was also a great joy.
Most children liked laser engraving because it was possible to see how a drawing, which is in the computer, is gradually applied to the board.
E. Kalniņš explained what subjects should be taught at school if he wants to work in a desk, namely, the main thing is mathematics, especially geometry, computer science, as well as technical drawing and finding.
He also stressed the need to work more on this profession with the brain rather than the muscles.
In a small shop there are individual orders, and it is important to schedule everything first.
In order to get to know each other better, when the camp started, the participants participated in various games, as well as together formed camp «herboni».
On Wednesday, there was a sea march from Roja to Jocene, and on the way, natural materials were collected, which were later used to make the cards.
Sport games were also held, which are especially important for the participants.
We went to apartment houses, where we had sports and leisure grounds, we played football and a network ball.
Children like sport activities, we have many boys playing football, basketball, and each time they demand something sport.
Girls like quieter activities.
On another day with self-sustaining mass, decorative jars can be used as pencil holders.
There was also a talent evening, the children chose which they would perform with, and one evening was dedicated to the performances.
The table games were also played, each one was able to show his knowledge during photo orientation, where the pictures had to find objects and take a picture of them.
The task was to get a different picture from each one.
We also painted the mandala - some of it liked more, some less.
There will never be one lesson that will love everyone - the next one is sport, the other creative classes.
“Now everyone seems to be very passionate about painting glass, ” explained M. Folkmane.
At the end of the camp diplomas were awarded about creativity, sport as well as assistance - several children helped directly in economic works.
The camp was founded by the participation of children from three associations, the Centre for Children and Youth Initiative in Rojupe and Blacksila, as well as the Multifunctional Centre for the Roja District of Strops.
These are united bridges.
If there's something faster to figure out, we borrow ideas; if not, they borrow from us.
We share our experience.
This year, 30 participants – the children who were active during the year – took part in the camp.
“We had expected 30, and it also came, ” says M. Folkmane.
The camp has been held for five years.
This began in 2010, when the social services of the Roja District decided that many families of children and children of poor families need to organise camps during the summer.
In the meantime, however, the situation in Paradise has improved, and the camp is now aimed at the residents of the region who are coming and operating in youth centres.
The goal is to spend free time in a meaningful and comprehensive manner.
Two camps took place in the past and 20 children participated in each of them, and now that the country as a whole has fewer children, only one camp is held.
Similar activities take place in the course of the following year.
The children drew the glass in the villages came Einārs Kalniņš, who taught the burning of wood, machine building from wood, with figure saws of different shapes.
There is also a new technique - anchoring, it is painting with hot wax cream.
Teacher Ilze Shelkov was led by classes from polymer material, heels, and containers.
We produce paintings from natural materials, interesting mandala from beans, peas, linseeds, we collect leaves from autumn.
Let's try to use what's around us.
The Youth Centre works in winter from 15.00 to 20.00, while in summer - from 14.00 to 20.00.
“ On average, 15 children visit the Youth Centre on the route a day, ” says Folkmane.
She emphasises that there is great support from the Roja District Council, which understands the need to allocate money to children, because they shape our future.
Charlton Athletic fans can get a seasonal ticket only if they sign a behavioural contract and agree not to critique the club in social media.
While we acknowledge that everyone has the right to his or her personal opinion, publishing confusing comments on such websites is not a good thing.
The fan working in the administration was then told that he would have to receive a ticket personally from the former police officer Klyf Iger, who joined the club last month after 35 years of career in the police force.
In the following letter, “I must inform you that the seasonal ticket will be renewed for you, provided you sign a ‘Harmonised Treaty of Conduct’ (ABC), which will stipulate that in future you will refrain from publishing depreciating or confusing comments on people representing a club or club on all kinds of social media websites or any other kind of behaviour that might be considered antisocial, social, social or social
Regarding Daily Telegraph, the fan described how he called the club after the seasonal ticket payment, which it was never received, and two days later he received a letter by post.
Yesterday he went to a meeting at the club and said: “They told me that I was too “twined ” when he too much had been given to others who were ridiculous.
Cycling holidays on the shores of Dalmation
What do you mean by the word “digestion ”?
I was driving here from all the power, ” said Colin, the former US Navy Commander who had just driven a 25-mile wheel along the central part of an uneven Croatian island, leaving nothing there except the Spanish voice of Swedes and Swans sailors, scattered in hostile mountains.
Some cyclists sing hymns or a number of kindergarten poems to make it easier to be in the mountain.
“ The Little Egine That Cook, ” says the friend Petie.
Others count or simply suffer in silence, thinking what it requires of a trance in a state similar to that spoken of by hardened cyclists.
Collina laminates poisonously rather than multifaceted.
Going through some yards in front of her is as if she was driving at the beginning of the movie-Chetra wedding and one funeral.
Her mission and my mission are a week-long-loop yacht and cycling along the coast of the northern part of Croatia and the islands organised by Freedom Treks.
Walking over a steep mountain site like Croatia may not be in line with each one's understanding of luxury, but it is said that the North House is easier to drive than the South House, our blankets are soft, and when we filled in the forms of booking, freely and convincingly before all those months, there was a box that we didn't mark, which could have provided us with a battery-charged e-wheeler.
The luxury part of the transaction is our floating house for a week, brand new – Melody –
At the end of the journey, we can throw our bikes in a whirlwind near our guides Ivan and Ivan and on the ship’s astray in blue water, without facing sea urchins, sharp stones, and other people on the narrow rock bars, which Croatians call the beach.
In June the sea temperature is perfect, all agree: cool enough to cool up but not cold.
On “Melody ” there are masks and respiratory swabs and some kayaks when someone feels energetic after a heavy morning on the duvets.
Instead, most of us will return to our cabs with air-conditioned rooms where Helena, the massier of the ship - I'm not joking - will have covered our beds, supplemented our minibars stocks and left a new chocolate box on the table.
Ivan says that riding after cycling is very important, and in the afternoon we learn to ride on our beds or cushioned rest chairs on the upper deck together with the barman Antonio, who is always ready to prepare one of his cocktails.
“Melody – 42 m long with 15 cabins and half-decks of crew, not a famous superjacht, but a stylish small cruise ship.
It turns to a small island port between fishing boats and fleet holiday yachts, and we are proud to belong to it.
Kolina and Petia belong to a group of meetup.com friends from Washington (Columbian Region): to sports and social activists after 45, as they call themselves.
Last year's heavy-duty and cycling holidays in the Netherlands had been so successful that they decided to try something else richer, and so they are in Croatia.
The competing capel from their church is on boating and cycling holidays in Provence, and every afternoon the air thickens the competitive Facebook publications pingponga rally.
The element of holiday adventure can be exaggerated, because our timetable is nothing if there is no specific regime.
“Brokastis and dinner are in eight, ” Ivan announced to the new members at the opening meeting, when we started our way from the beautiful old Trogiras port near Split.
One sign of the ship’s bell indicates that the buffet is open, while the other end of the meal invites you to keep quiet and listen carefully to the information provided.
“Good morning, there is a cultural context that is probably lost everywhere, but not in a British contingent.
What difference - fun has already taken speed, joki is becoming a horn of abundance, while Ivan is giving off day tours, but we all pretend that it frightens us by kissing, contouring and profiles with rises and falls, although anything else would be a surprise on Croatia's bicycle journey, which begins and ends at sea level.
“It’s like a heart monitor, ” says Ivan.
Total plainness is not recommended.
Ivans conducts the information meeting in parallel, moving freely from English to German.
There are weeks for him to deal with a dozen different nationalities, but we are a simple group - the Swiss, the Germans, the Americans and the British, who sit down easily at the tables during their meals, where the two speak English and the German - one at the same time.
On the road we are all friends.
Cycling promotes membership, and the only competition is within itself, i.e. by itself.
I do not remember when the group's dynamics would have been more harmonious and relaxing.
Soon we're looking at Ivan's wave.
A small climb is a slope that should not be confused with a roughness, which is a good thing.
Matadaths are serpentines and in direct forward means straight: simple, but not always easy.
The driving instructions are always the same:
Meet me on the shore in nine.
Okay, five pairs, I forgot you're on holiday.
Take a lot of water with you.
We go from Trogira to the cruise to the north of the Kornati archipelago, where we are going almost all along the way to the Dugi Otok - Croatian language, the Long Island - and, after a small handful, we will walk along the Telašcica nature park, admiring the steep rocks and salt lake, where seawater flows through the underground canal.
It is said that those who float in it are younger than they are thanks to their strength.
If we do, will our legs feel younger and stronger?
On the small island of Moldah, we turn south again, moving from the continent to the nearby islands seemingly by accident.
Most of our travels are on empty, small roads outside the country with extensive sea views and a wide range of vegetation: olive balds, vineyards, sharp plant leaves, Mediterranean fragrances in the air, and countless butterflies in the flight.
As we move forward, there is always a mob, but when Ivan stops, there are always big shadows, and the small moss are like a prize for those who have come faster.
Sport and social activists have a lot to do on cycling weekends, and they know the rules of conduct by sending warnings along a line and leaving free places for motorcycling manoeuvres to be carried out more safely.
“Two almost or down, ” one wheel says to the other after the truck driver decided to carry out the coup manoeuvre in an opaque curve and quickly fell off.
Fortunately the brakes were in operation.
Ivan divides us into three groups every piece of short sections for travelling on major roads, with Ivan at the rear, to encourage and “give pace, ” as Ivan says.
If we have to cross the main road, we all come together, get down from the bikes and after we move with our bikes on the other side, as we have been instructed, not before.
“Do you think Ivan is aware that he doesn’t talk to a group of children? A Swiss cyclingman asks us when we stand on the road and wait for the signal when we can cross it.
Not all afternoon we can spend some time with our laisc rest.
The Roman forum and the organ of the sea, playing music that sounds like the sound of the inmate marine monster, built through stones into the promenade and open in the water, were revealed at the city’s visit in Zadar.
The famous sunset of Zadar perfectly falls between the main course and the pudding, and after the darkness of the day, we return to the marine organ and watch the wave-powered lamp games in the glass trotuary, which is actually a dance floor.
When “Melody, the first morning of the week begins on the road to the rosy Biograd resort, the organ song is no longer more than a swarm.
On the fifth day, we are completely free from cycling.
A trip up the estuary of the Krka river to see its waterfalls; then a afternoon tour in Sibenika, where we visit the Cathedral of Thought, the master's work of Dalmation Renaissance, as well as a walk of the chair's time on the peaceful island of Zlarina, looking for its local treasure, makes this day interesting.
Lurda is going to host the pilgrims in the shadow of attack
People gather at the Our Lady’s temple in Lourdes during the annual Catholic pilgrimage.
The French security forces are on the high level of alarm, as thousands of Catholics gather at the Lurda temple on the annual pilgrimage in the shadow of several terrorist acts.
On August 15, each year tens of thousands gather at the foot of the temple on the Mount of Pyrenees to mark Mary’s virgins ’ heavenly welcome.
This year's pilgrimage takes place at a time when Catholics have been shocked by the murder of an older French priest on July 26 by two Islamic extremists who, during the Mass, invade the church in the north of France and turned his bell.
Jacques Amela's murder took place two weeks after a Tunisian-investigator claims to have radicalized his Jihadist's on-line video material-- was hit by a truck in the Master's Day in the city of Nica of Rivier, killing 85 people.
After three large-scale attacks over 18 months, many people in France are cautious about attending public events.
The number of tourists declined sharply, and the authorities were concerned that this year’s number of pilgrims could fall sharply.
However, the fear of mass withdrawals did not materialize -- and some organizers say that even the influx of visitors' applications has been observed at the last moment.
About 25 000 believers are expected to arrive, including large groups from Italy and Belgium, and a delegation from some 200 branches of Christianity in the East - Orthodox representatives.
Many saints have declared that they will not be allowed to threaten.
“We don’t think about stopping living, ” said the 66-year-old visitor Christian AFP, describing prayer as the only weapon in the fight against violence.
“It is important to show that life continues, ” said Matier Gvinārs, one of the coordinators.
We will not give up our faith, our beliefs, and our way of life simply because some fanatics are trying to sow fear.
Due to concerns about security in France, a number of large-scale measures have been lifted since the attack in Nice, including a huge stock market in the northern town of Lille and a European road map on the road map to be held in Nice in September.
“Last week I lived in fear of calling my phone in one call to withdraw my applications, ” said Fabjen Lezène, the priest responsible for the conduct of official pilgrimage last week.
On the contrary, it seems that attacks have mobilised believers,\" he said and announced the influx of recent applications.
Christian Gel, head of the local hotel staff trade association, confirmed that there was an increased interest in pilgrimage after the attack.
There were extremely strict security measures around the temple where the virgin Mary appeared in the grotesque of Bernadete, Bernadete, in 1858.
Approximately 250 policemen and two dozen soldiers have been assigned to protect the site, including bomb neutralization experts and experts with explosive detection dogs.
On the entrance of the temples, the bags were tested, and the number of access points was reduced from twelve to three.
Catherine Simoxa, who traveled from northeast England to Lurda at the beginning of this month on a pilgrimage, described the enhanced security measures.
“Until Thursday morning, the temples were guarded, and then the gate (with metal barriers) could only enter one by one, as well as searched bags, ” she said.
“This all frightened my three children, who are used to Lurda, and it was hard to do not scare them when they asked why it happened,” she said.
It did not ruin my impressions, but I was sad about it, and I realized that many people were comforting about it.
The opening route of Friday is also shortened, so that instead of starting in Lourdes city and going on to the temple, it will start and end in the temple.
Other measures include closing of the airspace for flights over Lourda, closing the streets near the temple and replacing the waste caves with transparent plastic bags.
French Minister of Interior Bernārs Kazenev will examine security measures on Saturday.
About six million people a year go to Lourdes, making it one of the largest Catholic pilgrimage destinations in the world.
Many visitors marry relatives who are sick or disabled and who come to swim in a cave where Bernadete had seen Mary, believing in the healing properties of water.
Timie Castio, one of the organisers, described this year’s meeting as a little unusual in view of the threat that the roots seem to be looking for in France.
However, he claimed that this would not affect the quality and depth of their experience.
Francisco, a 58 - year - old volunteer who helped sick pilgrims, admitted that she believed that the presence of soldiers dressed in civil raids was “a little depressing. ”
However, if it all calms down, it's good.

The opening of the deep waterbird hunting season.
Every second August, a waterbird hunting season is opened.
This year it will start at 16:00 on 13 August, so the State Police invites both hunters and citizens to be especially careful and comply with security regulations.
Waterbird hunting takes place not only in hunting areas, but also in public water bodies, and while weather conditions do not allow the seed to fall on as from other years, it is permissible for the resters to use it together with the hunters.
The call for hunters, restorants, and bodies of water to be especially careful in the vicinity of lakes and rivers and to comply with safety rules, thus not threatening themselves or others.
Since it has been observed in previous years that during the first days of the opening of the season a large number of hunters are involved in the hunting of birds, the State Police, in cooperation with the State Forest Service, will also exercise enhanced control over hunting.
The law enforcement will focus on compliance of arms and ammunition with the rules of the law, as well as monitoring that hunting takes place without the influence of alcoholic beverages and adjudicating substances.
The police recall that the use of semi-automatic firearms in the hunting of waterbirds, the total capacity of which is more than three patrons, is prohibited, including the amendments to the Law on the Movement of Arms and Special Means, in particular Article 22 (91), which states that persons who have record of spirit-to-street firearms or large-energy pneumatic weapons for hunting or sport, and during a short stop of up to two hours when these weapons are carried on or from hunting, have the right to hold the weapon and ammunition in the vehicle during the hunting, but must be placed as safely as possible, so that a futrate or other packaging containing ammunition or weapons is not visible from the outside of the vehicle, the door is locked and be equipped with an alarm alarm device, thereby ensuring that they are not in the hands of persons who are not being taken by accident.
The police call for the safety of their own and of their fellow human beings during the hunting season and, if you commit offences or any safety hazards, we invite you to report immediately by calling 110.
In the event of any threat, the law enforcement is ready to respond to the information provided by the population.
New Caledonia coasts are shattered by 7.2 magneous earthquakes
On Friday, the New Caledonia coast was shaken by the 7.2 - magnanith earthquake, told seismologists that there was no threat to the tsunami.
The Earthquake epicenter is located nine miles [109 km] east of New Caledonia Ilanthera at 1.26 p.m., Grinich time (4.26 p.m.), announced the U.S. Geology Research Centre.
The Pacific Tsunami alert centre indicated that there are no warnings or recommendations at this stage of the possible tsunami threat to the region.
“Emestries in the region are known to be unusual, and activities are not unusual lately,” said Chief Seusmologist Phil Kamins, a research centre called Geoscity Australia.
Potentially, it could be felt in Vanuatu or New Caledonia, but I doubt whether it is strong enough to cause damage.
New Caledonia is located in the “Uguns” area of Pacific tectonic activity, where earthquakes and volcano eruptions are common.
Colombia and Venezuela agree on the opening of the border.
Colombia and Venezuela agreed to open control points at the border between the two countries, which were closed a year ago at the initiative of Venezuela, on Thursday, told the Presidents of Colombia and Venezuela, Juan Manuel Santos and Nikolas Maduro.
The starting points of the border will be open only to pedestrians.
From Saturday, every day from 8 a.m. to 20 p.m. five border posts will be opened.
The opening of the border for transport will be possible after the conclusion of certain international agreements on security, trade and energy, the President indicated.
In August last year, Maduro ordered the border to be closed in response to an attack by the Colombian fighters on the border patrol in Venezuela.
Three Venezuelan soldiers were injured in this attack.
This July, Venezuela unilaterally opened the border twice as a result of the severe economic crisis - the Venezuelans, in poverty, tried to break through the border in order to buy the first-needed goods at the border shops.
This opportunity was used by 200 000 Venezuelan citizens.
This time is the time for one of our pride in Latvia, for the sympathetic Madara Palameika.
Madara Palameika was born on June 18, 1987, in Talsos.
She's a Latvian lighthouse that kicks into the betting race.
Her coach is the father of Gint Palameix.

“Facebook” applies for a fight against advertising lockers.
The most used social network in the world Facebook has been sent such as a warning shot, implying that blocking advertising banners using special tools is not acceptable and that the users will also have to watch ads.
Special advertising blockers are becoming more popular, but this means that companies with direct advertising as their main source of income are declining.
Facebook has now made it known that the harmful nature of advertising banners is well understood, but users will also have to live with them.
True, they will be provided with tools to choose the type of material they are showing, reports BBC.
“As we give people more and more control possibilities, we will also start to show ads to those using advertising blocking software,” said Andru Bosworth, the Vice President of Facebook advertising business.
In other words, users will be able to choose what type of advertising they see by selecting brands and industries that seem interesting to them.
“People don’t like to see advertising that doesn’t concern them, or interfere with content enjoying, added Bosworth.
Advertising blocking tools do not usually work on mobile devices, from which Facebook receives the largest visit, but the resulting reduction in banner exposure is also measured in billions in monetary terms.
According to BBC information, approximately 200 million people use advertising lockers.
In the last quarter of the business year, Facebook’s revenue from advertising was already reported to be USD 6.2 billion, or EUR 5.55 billion.
It must be said that this is not the first time that Facebook is actively involved in identifying what network users see in their news.
As one of the last steps, Facebook has just started to take steps to remove or at least limit the news from the stream, i.e. the headlines behind.

This month, the State Police (VP) Anti-Economic Crimes Administration (ENAP) seized 130,000 from Riga Commercial Company accountant who has worked in the company for 20 years, BNS informed the VP representative Gita Gžibovska.
Current information shows that the suspect woman has been committing the illegal activity for several years and has made a total loss of over EUR 130,000 to the company.
Given that company officials had not followed the cash flow carefully and trusted their employee, they only learned about the machinations that were taking place after several years.

In Estonia, zico virus antibodies have been detected in nine people.
In Estonia, nine cases of Zico virus antibodies, which means that they could come into contact with the infection, are reported by the Estonian public service broadcaster ERR.
Information provided by the laboratory suggests that this year the zico virus tests were carried out on 121 samples and nine of them were positive.
From Estonia, the first cases of Zico have been reported in Finland and Sweden.
According to the Estonian Health Authority, no acute cases of Zico virus infection have been reported in the country and people do not need to have a Zico virus test in case of flu-like symptoms, but should seek medical attention from their family doctor.
We have found IgG (Imunglobulin G class) antibodies that show that the subject is infected with a zico or similar virus at some point.
“This does not mean that the patient has a Zico virus, ” explains the laboratory “Synlab, head of the infectious disease department Paul Naber.
The zic’s virus transmission is carried by the Aedes.
There is a problem with the development of quality car purchase in Latvia, BNS said Vice President of the Auto Association Ingus Rūtiņš.
Whether there are any dumping problems in purchases in the car sector, Rutiņš responded in a affirmative manner.
Of course.
Car purchases are, however, different from service purchases where price manipulation is easier.
As a result of the end of the vehicle, a fixed amount must in any case be paid because it must be purchased from the manufacturer.
However, the problem is and can be classified in two groups.
Either the contracting authority is incompetent or unable to produce quality procurement, resulting in a lack of awareness on its own.
“Will very conscious procurements be built to get something concrete, and then all kinds of miracles can be seen,” Vice President of the Auto Association told.
He pointed out that it was now popular to talk about moving away from the lowest price offer to the most economically advantageous tender as the criterion for determining the winner of the procurement, but some companies still have a misconception about these cases.
Now it is very popular: let us go from the lowest price to the most economically advantageous offer!
However, the criteria should be laid down in both cases and, when they have been taken into account and evaluated, the decision will nevertheless be taken on the basis of the lowest price.
The technical criteria for quality procurement should be very precise and market-compliant.
In turn, points do not need to assess anything that can be expressed in monetary terms.
Points do not need to assess fuel consumption, the extent of emissions, services and similar matters.
The foreseeable life cycle, mileage, etc. of the car must be known, so it is easy to count everything together.
“The matter is then only about where the customer himself is interested in from the scenarios – explained Rūtiņš.
On the other hand, project manager Pēteris Rubulis noted that problems were linked to the fact that often the same person makes purchases for cars, work gloves and food, and these purchases are derived from one example.
We also have access to consultations on spare parts of the procurement models, which were difficult to name otherwise than for a detailed absurdity.
“The problem is that the author of the procurement very often lacks any understanding of the subject matter of the procurement and the requirements are simply copied from some places.
Rūtiņš added, the smaller the structure that announces procurement, because there may be more problems.
\"It seems that this is precisely because of the lack of human resources and expertise, said Vice President of the Associations.

Turkey seeks missing diplomats after the coup attempt
Turkey is looking for at least 32 diplomats who returned to the withdrawn staff after the coup attempt on 15 July.
Foreign Minister Medvits Čavušogs said on Friday that 208 employees of the Ministry of Turkey were withdrawn from the workplaces around the world for the trial of the coup attempt to investigate the coup to Ankara, and 32 had disappeared without permission.
Around 18,000 civilians, military leaders and academics have been arrested or withdrawn from their positions in Turkey, as the government considers them to be the loyal US official, Fetul Gulen, who is accused of instigating a government rescue plan.
Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania, is Turkey's most sought-after people.
Kavosoglu said that the team of the U.S. Department of Justice later this month will arrive on a visit to Turkey to discuss his possible extradition.
This issue has become a problem in the United States' relations with Turkey, a member of NATO.
The U.S. objected to the strong tactic of the violent armament of Turkey's President Redžeps Tajjip Erdogans after the coup, and Turkey responded by seeking to establish closer ties with Russia.

The organizers of the Olympic Games try to clean up the green backgrounds of diving pool
The Olympic kidneys that were to be trained on Friday arrived at a closed pool because the organizers needed more time to clean up greenish water before the first individual race in Rio Olympics.
Water suddenly changed color on Tuesday, in the middle of the synchronized dive competition.
The organisers claimed that the water race was safe even after the larger adjacent pool for water pool and synchronised swimming, also the greening was easy to paint.
Diving was not yet possible when athletes came to the morning to warm up, although at last the pool was opened 13.00 at local time - only 2 1/2 hours before women's 3 meter race.
The color of the water seemed closer to its normal colour, but still with a green color.
The American naughter Ebija Jonston, who competed for the trampling, told her that she only came to ice to find out that the pool was closed without any warning.
She wrote on Twitter that –#FixTheSwamp (talk the bog) should be fashionable.
Tom Dale, the British naughter, who won the bronze in the synchronous diving platform, also commented on the status of the pool in a Twitter record.
Hopefully, this means that we have not been furious in the last few days as bad!
Mario Andrad, the main speaker of the Committee of local organisers, stressed that the pool of competitions was safe by giving green light to the 3 metre foreheads.
He agreed that some athletes had been disturbed by water, but he said that it was the result of a pool cleaning effort.
“We repeat several times what we have said all the time - water does not in any way endanger the health of athletes,” he said.
On the first day of such water situations, one or two athletes complained that they were disdained by their eyes.
It was the result that the first reaction, when we saw how water becomes green, was to use one of the chemicals - chlorine - it is used in swimming pools very often.
We immediately cut the amount.
We checked the water again, and it fully met the parameters.
Simon Langford, the main speaker of the Mary Polish Watersport centre, said that the pool was closed to carry out additional cleaning work.
He said that the decision was supported by the world’s leading body, FINA (International Swimming Federation).
“The reason is that water must be calm so that the pool can return to its blue colour as soon as possible, ” Lengford said in his statement.
Andrad said that the deterioration of the swimming pool was surprised by the unprepared organizers.
“Chemia is not a precise science, ” he said.
Some things that you can see go on for a long time.
In the last few days, the extraction of rainwater in the normal state made it even more difficult.
“It doesn’t work well, ” Andrad said.
He added that the athletes had access to dry workout in the morning, although he acknowledged that it was not perfect.
He explained that the change in the colour of the swimming pool was due to the increase in alkalin levels, just as the aquarium water could become green if not properly monitored.
When we started doing something about the prevention of green color, we had discussions about the best chemicals.
We cannot use too many chemicals in the water, because athletes are training there, ” said Andrad.
We could certainly have done better at the beginning to avoid water becoming green.
When it became green, we made a mistake again.
AP sports surveyors Jay Koen and Steve Wade in Rio de Janeiro participated in this action.

Taiwan has not recognised the agreement reached in 1992, which strengthened the principle of a single China since the new leader Tsai Ing-ven entered office in May, which has led to the suspension of communication and consultation mechanisms.

“We have an active and open attitude to the exchange of experiences between cities on both sides,” said the MA stressing that the nature of cross-border relations and the exchange of experiences between cities should be interpreted correctly.
