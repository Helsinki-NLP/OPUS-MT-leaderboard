Celebrate with Alstera-Lambretta
In the 7th century, fashion culture satellites were invariably replaced by ‘Lambretta’.
A group of Italian motorists are trying to preserve the spirit of those times.
70 years after the establishment of the first Alster-Lambrett club, about 100 motorists from the United Kingdom and Ireland gathered in Fermana County this weekend.
One of the first two members of the club was Chris Wilson, the first to acquire Lambretta, about £40.
“I was just a motor vehicle, but I learned that I could use it in other ways.
It was some kind of sport.
I didn't engage in fashion culture, and now I'm probably too old,\" he said.
“It was quite cheap and quite reliable, and you could buy it at an affordable price, and by acquiring something more than just moving from point A to point B.
He attended the Lambretta race at a separate startup stage in the Art Isles TT ring.
The first Alster-Lambretta club was founded in the early 1980s and was transformed 12 years ago.
“In 1971 motorcyclers and other forms of transport were increasingly interested in people, and the clubs were affected at all because of the turmoil, so I thought: “Everything, it’s the end,” said Chris.
“At some time, interest came back and seemed to grow more and more. ”
Philip Steele is a member of the club of Alsterio-Lambretta, which currently has 97 members, and is responsible for the membership of the club.
“All the motifs vary.
Some members were influenced by a fashion culture because almost everything started from it.
Others are racing enthusiasts or rockers – there you will find all sorts of people.
There are also people who are just interested in the landscape.
Many of the scooters have been modified, so there are no two identical ones.
It is possible not to change the engine and to drive quietly 35 or 40 miles per hour, adapted to the narrow streets of Italy, but some members have improved.
Some of the far-changed motorists could probably reach speeds of up to 100 miles per hour --
There were failures during the weekend, some of which had to be pushed by the engine.
Although the weather in Northern Ireland is not always as pleasant as the ‘Lambretta’, Italy’s home country, this time the cyclists in Fermana County were lighted by the sun.
Ruth Davidson asks for the sector's silence – Brexito
Ruth Davidson asked her colleagues for a ‘period of limitation’ for the Prime Minister's agreement on ‘Brexit-
The Scottish director said that two years after the EU referendum, there was time for a debate.
She expressed her opinion after Boris Johnson's words on the Prime Minister's plan, which he called \"a crazy and totally absurd one.\"
She stated that it was time to support the presidency.
At the party conference in Birmingham, the Torah activists said: “In the past two years we have had time to debate.
Former Secretary of Foreign Affairs has held office in one of the best offices in the country's history and during that period most of the current plan, which was already recognised in November of last year.
The conservatives now have to support the Prime Minister, allow her to complete the deal and help her implement plans in the country.
I think the period of silence would be very useful.
Her comments followed a sharp criticism in the ‘Brexit’ debate, which was not first announced by the former Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson.
In an interview with the BBC journalist Andrew Marro, Theresa May later assured that she believed Brexitu’s plan and that her office could ensure a favourable free trade deal with the European Union.
Mr Davidson also claimed that by participating in other elections he would have promised to prevent the second referendum on independence in Scotland, because in 2014 ‘the said ones promised that this would be the only one of their generations’.
When asked about a possible repeat referendum on “Brexit”, she replied: “If we talk about Scotland’s history, I repeatedly state that you cannot repeat the referendum if you are a nationalist and the result does not satisfy you.
I would make it more difficult to say that another referendum could be held on \"Brexit\" because I expected another result.

Christine'a Blasey Ford's friend confirmed the statement of sexual abuse suspected by Britta Kavanaugh
Lelanda Keyser, who was in high school friend of Dr. Christine'a Blasey Ford, accused of being a candidate for the Supreme Court, the sexual abuse of Britta Kavanaugh when they were both teenagers, wrote a letter to the Senate Court Committee and explained that although he did not remember the party's home, during which the attack may have occurred, but believed in Ford's story.
In the past, Keyser, through his lawyer, made a statement that he did not remember the party mentioned, and he did not even know whether he had met Kavanaugh.
In a statement against the Committee on Justice on Thursday, Kavanaugh often mentioned Keyser's statement as proof of his innocence, but he did not mention Keyser's statement that she believed in Ford's words.
President Trump asked the FBI to carry out a study a week, when Republican Senator Jeff Flake and other moderate senators asked to give time to the study and delay the entire vote of the Senate on the Kavanaugh for a week.
On Saturday, Keyser sent a letter to the Committee via her lawyer, stating that he wanted to “as far as he could contribute to an additional FB study on the Kavanaugh.
“However, as my client has already explained, she does not know the judge Kavanaugh and does not remember the party or gathering in which he would have been with or without Dr Ford ” – says Kayser in her letter to Howard Walsho.
The letter goes on to explain that Keyser-negot Dr Ford's account and has already said to the press that she believes in Dr Ford's testimony to the
‘However, the simplest and irresistible truth is that it cannot confirm it, because it does not remember the above-mentioned incident’ is continued in the letter.
Mr. Mark Judge, a friend of Kavanaugh, allegedly close to the attack, also claimed to contribute to the FBI investigation.
Chicago's illegal residents tell about life with a corrupt policeman and his gang
The Chief Prosecutor of Illinois is trying to change the history of the Chicago police after a dark period.
An unscrupulous policeman is believed to have exploited innocent social housing residents and to have apprehended countless people.
42 people who have been convicted illegally have so far been justified.
At the location of the social housing project of the Ida Bells project, there is only an empty space at the moment, and before that, there was nothing to fear of being exploited by corrupt Chicago policemen for more than a decade.
They were led by Sergeant Ronald Watts.
The inhabitants accused him and his tactful army of extortion, counterfeiting and rape of police reports and charges.
Willie Martin and Cleon Glover are two of those convicted who were still justified by Kim Foxx, Prosecutor General of Cook City.
“If you didn’t work with him, you ended up bad.
You were his enemy.
You prevented him from operating and earning, – Cleona Glover told of Watts.
“I was very afraid.
I wanted to escape from that area,
But I didn't have to go anywhere – – said Willie Martin.
The lawyers of the Foxx Ethics Division review further 30-40 Watsu cases.
Ida B. Wells, resident of social housing, Landon Allen, said that many people decided not to love about Watts.
“Many things did not have sex, ” he said.
“But it wasn’t important ”
According to another resident, Clarisa Baker, no one believed in the people’s words about the Sergeant in an official position.
“He has his own gang.
Who Will Believe in Us
Baker said.
Joshua Tepfer, working at Chicago University, says that no one really believed in them until now.
“It lasted because these people did not seem important or careless, because they are black people living in social housing, so they thought they had done something wrong anyway,” said Tepper.
“Serjant Watts was sitting in prison for 22 months in 2013 to steal the FBI informant for the trial.
Marteza Wise is also in prison, thanks to Wattso.
I just had a son.
For four years, I couldn't be with him.
He almost didn't know me because he was just born, so I had to reconnect with him – – said Wise.
“I lost four years without the matter, ”
72 years of Fidellity – believed in the success of block chains, virtual realities and artificial intelligence
“Fidelity – the potential of block chains has been noticed before 2018, when all corporations started talking about this technology.
Abby Johnson, Director General, led investment in the cryptovulite, the most risky and volatile asset class of recent years.
“About two years ago, I was just curious about what was happening, especially in the bitcoins market, for me and other senior managers, ” said Johnson.
We started to talk and understood that we had to figure out.
The pity moved me to start with ‘bitcots in the New Hampshire unit, when the price of this cryptoviolet was about $180.
In December last year, the price reached almost $20,000, and “we took care of it, ” says Johnson,“ when the price rose, we started to earn money, even though we never expected it.
It did not indicate how much bitcoins were harvested or how much Fidellity was produced
“Fidelity – employees are clearly interested in these technologies.
A block club for workers called “Biths and Blocks” now has around 2 600 members, organising seminars and meetings with professionals.
The company agreed with Coinbase, which gave Fidelity’s customers the opportunity to check the cryptoviolet balance using the Fidelity’s mobile app.
In 2015, it has been possible to donate funds through bitcoins.
According to Johnson, the company rejected most of the other possible uses of bitcoins or for at least a short period of time.
We're trying to monitor the market.
And so far, Katie Chase, the senior Fidellity, a strategy of the Centre for Applied Technologies and the Head of the Block Chain Incubator (which is part of the FCAT), are looking for ways to use the blocks used by the public and business.
Chase could not comment on specific projects, but it showed that it received considerable interest from customers, partners and employees.
\"It's all very new.
If you're interested in information, you'll understand that you're still trying to find evidence of the concept,\" said Chase.
We have tried to apply block chains to various situations and learned a lot, but technology is not yet so advanced that it can solve these problems.
So far, in her opinion, the group is focusing more on trying to understand the nature of these obstacles.
They are trying to understand how to calculate the value of physical objects, such as works of art, by chips or by using block circuits in the supply chain.
“For now, this is not at the centre of attention, but I think it will end up with interest, ” said Chase.
‘Fidelity’ will be prepared for this
As an example, it indicated ‘Pebble’, which had failed in its trading standards but finally repaid ‘Fidelity’.
Her group has developed an app for a smart watch that is stopped three years later, after collecting millions of ‘Kickstarter’s pooling funding project.
The Apple Watch-Fidelity market was ready.
It quickly adapted the ‘Pebble’ app for the new Apple product.
“We were not blind to the fact that the “Pebble ” clock was popular, but we wanted to be ready if people liked smart clocks,” she said.
“We gathered knowledge and were ready when smart clocks were released on the mass market ”

Californian students wear T-shirts with racial notes
As the CNN branch at KGTV reports, the Union of Schools in Escondidated this week confirmed that around 10 students took a poorly thought-out decision to demonstrate racism at an event aimed at high classes.
“We are proud that all of us are accepting diversity in our school, ” said Adriana Lepe-Ramirez in the report.

Usually, the school confirms the notes in advance, but after taking the official picture, some students choose their words.
According to the Union report, such behaviour ‘not compatible with the culture, values or history of the Escondial high school’
“We have to understand the impact of our words and actions and take responsibility for the decisions that we make every day,” said Lepe-Ramirez.
“Escondial secondary school will continue to foster family values and unity-based culture throughout the community”
The former student, Cade Pannella, said to KGTV that he had seen an offensive photograph in the social media angry with him.
“It hurt me personally, ” he said.
“ It may have seemed funny to them, but it is not.
Only the inexperienced can laugh from such things

Elizabeth Warren claims to the mayor of the presidential candidate following the mid-election of the term of office
“The time for women to march to Washington to correct the corrupt government, to which women have to lead,” said a democratic senator speaking to a crowd gathered in the Holjok City of Massachusetts.
\"So I promise you this: after 6 November, think well about whether or not it is worth standing for the President's membership.\"
Warren, trying to defend his post in competitions with the Republican representative of Geoff Diehlu, said earlier that the presidents would not stand for work in the Senate.
\"It is very important to focus on mid-elections and to stop acting as if the only important thing was 2020,\" she said to the reporters in August, speaking a speech at the National Press Club.
“The most important fight is the mid-election of the term of office, and not only in Massachusetts, but also throughout the country.
Warren has long been seen as a potential candidate for democracy in 2020, which can compete with President Donald Trump.
However, they would expect a difficult initial election struggle, possibly involving other well-known democrats – Joe Biden, former Vice President Kamala Harris, and Kirsten Gilliband, an senator from California, New York.
A famous mental health clinic brings together a third riddle death in less than a year
“ The Mail ” states that a third person committed suicide in a luxury psychiatric clinic in less than a year.
Shaquelle Vidal (23 C.E.), daughter of the TV comician, died on 7 April, having spent nearly a month voluntarily at the Nightingale Hospital in West London, Marylebone.
Her boyfriend James Lyle (57) is a manager of a hedge fund, a millionaire and a former Conservative party sponsor, paying the cost of its supervision for five years.
The future chief chef died almost six months after the disappearance of the highness Daisy Boyd (28), the grandson of Rose Grey, one of the founders of River Café.
D. Boyd, the heir of the publishing company, who suffered the death of Dan Macmillan (43), died on 5 October, under the influence of cocaine, illegally brought to the clinician.
Two months ago, artist Alan MacDonald (61 C.E.) withdrew from his life when he was released from the hospital for four days.
In May, the Monitoring Quality Commission criticised Nightingale’s clinic as it had not sufficiently worked to prevent illicit substances being introduced.
Avo Vidal’s daughter in Shaquelle’s clinic registered on 11 March in the “Mock The Week” of the BBC program.
Last week at a preliminary meeting of the Westminster Coroner Court, Royal Associate Katie Gollop stated that Shaquelle disappeared from AWOL on 29 March and returned to a misunderstood mental state after the week.
Mr. Gollop, acting on behalf of Avos Vidal, said: “My client wants to find out what happened to Shaquelle, who she was dealing with and what she was doing...
Mr. Lyle she called Shaquelle a boy
Unofficial Shaquele’s stepfather, John Gordillo (52), said: “I know Shaquell continued to communicate with James Lyle, and he was in New York at that time.
At a meeting in Gordillo, he discovered that Shaquelle called him on 4 April and said he wanted to buy and drink cyanide, and he called the clinic more than a dozen times after 20 minutes from this call, but no one responded.
“ It seems to me that further events could have been avoided if someone had responded, ” he added.
On 5 April, the clinician found Shaquelle’s mental condition to be extremely poor.
In less than 48 hours, she followed a notebook.
The representative of Nightingale expressed his sympathy with his family and friends and said: “Our clinics are aimed at providing high quality care in a safe, medical-friendly environment.

The Court of Appeal rejected the judgment in 2016 that the group did not copy the name of another group ‘Spirit’.
In 2015, the application was lodged by Michael Skidmore, the trustee of Spirit-Gytarist.
It seems that the litigation against ‘Led Zeppelin’ song to Stairway To Haven’ will last long – just like the song itself.
The group will rise up against charges of stealing the guitar reef of the 1971 ballad.
The US Court of Appeal rejected the 2016 ruling that the group did not copy the start of the hit from the music group ‘Spirit’.
It is claimed that the judge made mistakes, for example, to inform jurys about copyright laws.
The case was returned to the court.
‘The first action was brought in 2015 by Michael Siddmore, the trustee of Randy Wolfe.
Police gangs in Michigan ended when the policeman ran to them a suspected murderer who was shooting them.
Mičigan, a suspected murderist of his girlfriend, was arrested after police gangs that ended when he crossed a police car.
It is suspected that in 33 C.E., Adam Nolin shot her girl in Wjominge on Thursday in Michigan, Tia Mae Randall, 27 C.E.
He was taken to court on Friday at a hospital where an officer took him over by police SuV car, because Nolin shot at a police station trying to escape the highway where intensive traffic took place.
Nolin has been accused of five serious crimes, including an attack to kill and flee from the police.
\"Calling in the hospital is not common, but this is not the first case,\" said James Magufee, Commander of the Vajoming Police.
\"It needs treatment, but the justice process must also continue.
Judges often adapt in order to achieve this
Nolin’s girl’s body was found on Thursday in a mobile cottage in the area of Creekside Estates
Two children were shot with one shot and the police immediately identified Nolin as a suspect.
The police then issued a public warning regarding Nolin and gave a brief description of the black Dodge and his pickup in 1996.
The man was seen on his pickup and headed to the U.S. 131 Highway when the police tried to stop him.
Nolin hit the concrete wall with his pickup, then left the car and left off the motorway.
In the run, he shot out at the busy cops.
One police officer was in the police SuV car and drove Nolin from the back.
The observer took the video.
Nolin was taken to a hospital in a difficult but stable condition and would remain there until it was written out and moved to Kent's prison in Kent County.
“This event has shown that Western Michigan policemen put their health at risk in order to protect the community,” said Magufee.
“They were arrested fairly quickly and by appropriate means, and we are proud of them ”
A total of two charges were presented to Nolin in an attack to kill him, he was also accused of fleeing from the police, carrying a hidden weapon and committing a serious crime involving the use of a firearm.
He's not yet guilty of murder for his girlfriend, because an investigation is still ongoing.
“We are still carrying out a murder investigation that we are about to finish so that we can submit it in good time to the Prosecutor of the Kent County,” said Magufee.
The judge praised a brave man who had cast his teeth into his house for an invading thief
The judge did not regret the greatest praise for a courageous man standing before the two criminals who tried to break into his home.
Although one of the hackers tried to steal him a wooden board, David Oldham was not afraid of it in 63 C.E.
A man working as a overseer of the University’s territory was defending, struck both criminals and beat their teeth.
The captives fled, but after the fighting on Mr. Oldham's blood remained, in which Craig Ford was detected and arrested after four months.
Adjudicating judgment against Ford, who lost his tooth in trying to invade Mr. Oldham's 400,000 £ individual house in Ormskerke, Laurashire, royal judge Clement Goldstone, said: “You probably didn't expect such a reaction from Mr. Oldham – when he was caught up to see the eyes and noses, he hit him at home, and he hit you.
He also struck your companion, who tried to break into the second high, and jumped from the roof.
On Friday, he sentenced Ford to three years and four months in prison, saying: “I believe you have learned two lessons.
The first is that we do not have to become nervous to David Oldham, and the second is not to start with the police.
For your crimes you now have one tooth less than before and you biteed a dog.
This is yet a little punishment!
He added: “I want to praise Mr. Oldham for his reaction to your actions.
Prosecutor Derek Jones stated that ford was already sentenced to another hack in 2016 and had been held in prison for three years, but was released on parole.
Mr Oldham told the Royal Court of Liverpool that he was jumping when on April 5, about 19.00, he heard noise at home.
Mr Jones said: “Oldham, who is a rich man, courageously left home and opposed his accused.
In fear of his safety, he struck his face, hit him, and put his teeth out.
Then another intruder jumped from the roof in front of Mr. Oldham, who instinctively hit him in his face.
According to Mr Jones, the fellow took a wooden board and tried to steal Mr. Oldham, while Ford said: “Call him, he beat me with his teeth. ”
The associate said to Mr. Oldham: “If you let us go, we will go out, and with Ford has fled from the place of the crime.
On 2 August, police caught Ford on a raid in a house in Wavertree.
Ford kicked the police dog, then he bit him in his shoulder.
The second hacker is believed to be still in the wild.
Ford confessed that he was guilty of hacking, slaughtering and dangerous driving, although it was prohibited and he did not have a driving licence.
Torah activists meet the criticism expressed to Johnson by the critique
Torah activists humiliated Boris Johnson today when he was liberated “a humiliated and aggressive man. ”
Mr Johnson, trying to please the ordinary people in his uncompromising language on ‘Brexit’, received a strict assessment from former Minister for Trade Digby Jones, which was also supported by the participants at the Birmingham conference this afternoon.
Mr. Johnson was also attacked by David Davis, because the headlines are concerned about this, not a strong policy.
Speaking to “MillOnline” Mr. May ally in the ministerial office added that he simply “trouble” because he was not able to be a full leader.
A countering reaction came when the former Foreign Secretary again attacked the plan of the Prime Minister-Chequers, and liberated it from an insane and totally absurd.
Mr Johnson also added that he sincerely believed in the project, and here she opposed the withdrawal in a referendum two years ago.
It also called on the government to support ambitious projects such as the construction of a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland.
However, Mr May has prevented its critics from playing political games and has argued that they are not bluffing and prepared for difficult negotiations with the EU.
Ms May, in an interview with Andrew Marro BBC on the launch of the Conference of Employers, she said: “I believe in ‘Brexit’
Lord Jones, a former leiborist minister of trade, who is now independent, has received the support of the crowd in praise to the Brexito.
People were spreading when he expressed his opinion on Mr Johnson, who allegedly replied to the concerns of the concerned businessman:
Not specifically named Johnson, Lord Jones made it clear that he was “a little man and an aggressive man. ”
“ Business is very important, so by saying “sweep business, the former Foreign Secretary has shown that there is indeed a small and aggressive human being, ” he said.
“I do not fully agree with him ”
Lord Jones also praised his speech in the hall by watching Mr May’s reaction to the EU leaders’ “cattles” at the Zalzburg Summit.
Ruth Davidson, head of the Scottish Sectors, was also criticising Mr Johnson in the past, recalling that he was a high-ranking government official in the negotiations on ‘Brexit’.
Mr May ally in the Cabinet of Ministers said that intervention is not very serious and Mr Johnson does not have enough support for the director in the parliament to be able to drive out the Prime Minister.
They said: “Now such news is not very dangerous.
He noises, but has no sufficiently supporters in the parliamentary party and knows that himself.
We see a strong contrast between David Davis, who is respectful of his opinion, and Boris, who meets his personal ambitions.
Secretary of Business Greg Clark criticised Mr. Johnson, who attacked sceptically the “Brexit” entrepreneurs.
Speaking at the sector conference in Birmingham, Clark said that Mr Johnson was \"fully wrong\"
He said: “I am surprised that someone in general might think so.
The world does not have a successful economy that does not have successful start-ups
In an interview entitled ‘Sky News’, the ‘Ridge on Sunday’, Mr Davis acknowledged that the months to come would be difficult, as the EU will try to force the United Kingdom to grant a lot of benefits.
However, he believes that the government should not give up on a similar agreement to the Canadian agreement, rather than being proposed by the Cabinet of Ministers.
The question of how Mr Johnson was to lead the tower did not give up the opportunity for the former Foreign Secretary to inhale.
He highlighted Mr Johnson’s suggestion to build a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland, saying: “One of the British policy weaknesses is that of a policy with fantastic ideas.
He added: “Our communication is chaotic, and many of his ideas apply to headlines but not to politics.
Bulgaria has spent £80 million in European taxpayers' money on poor restoration
Bulgaria has spent £80 million on European taxpayers' funds for the poor restoration of antiquity castles, which now seem to be built from ‘sourcing and cardboard’
The Balkan country has spent £80 million on the European Regional Development Fund.
Instead of returning the former majesty, the restoration was aroused.
The local government in the areas adjacent to Krakra’s fortification promised to turn unbelieving works into work.
The Bulgarian Government has released tens of EU millions of non-paymentous medieval castles for the restoration of castles.
The Balkan country has spent £80 million on the European Regional Development Fund to restore ancient castles and fortifications, but rather than returning their former greatness, it has been hurried by construction works.
The relics, after an expensive reconstruction, seem to be built out of the ‘sourcing and cardboard’, thus no longer attractive to tourists.
For example, the monumentists were surprised that in the Middle Ages of the Western city of Pernic, Krakra, and the Roman Fort Trayanovi Vrat, near Ihtiman, were reconstructed using polymeric concrete, most commonly used for the construction of the floor.
According to The Telegraph, the EU and the Bulgarian Government have agreed in private that this failure requires lessons.
“The strength is in a perverted state” said the architect and monument guard Stella Duleva about Trayanovi Vrata.
It lasted for 16 centuries, and now it’s broken
Such reactions occurred after the restoration of the Krakra fort in Pernique, and therefore the local government promised to remove the parts delivered in 2019.
Pernica fortification of unbelieving modifications
The Byzantine Yailata fort was described as a “sour fortress ” because it was rebuilt from the smooth white blocks, which are not suitable for façade affected by weather conditions.
These failures coincide with the new doubts that have emerged about the European Union's use of development funds.

If at least 50 million users' accounts are broken, Facebook will have to pay £1.25 billion in fine
Using the security gap, the criminals could reach at least 50 million Facebook's accounts.
However, large-scale hacking was only reported after three days on Friday.

“In the MG Baltic case, the following records are being heard: the accused discussed Gabrielas Landsbergis
The hearing was opened in November 2015 between Raimonds Kurianski, former Vice-President of MG Baltic and Vytautas Gapši's record.
When listening to the record, it is difficult to understand exactly what the people who are currently accused are talking about.
It is true that the record says that Kurliskis and Gapšys are talking about the Christmas festival, that several times the name of Gabriel Landsberg, the current conservative leader, sounds, but it is difficult to understand what exactly is being said.
Indictment to natural or legal persons
In political corruption cases the accusations were submitted to three legal and five natural persons: Labour and Liberals Movement parties, MG Baltic Group former liberal and employment leaders E. Masiulis, Vytautas Gapšis, former parliament liberal Š. Gustainis, Seimas member G. Steponavičius and the former MG Baltic Vice President R. Kurlinski.
The Labour Party is suspected of the effects of bribery and trade, Liberal Movement is suspected of bribery, trade effects and abuse, and MG Baltic is suspected of the effects of bribery and trade.
Officials suspected that politicians had started or talked about bribes with the then Vice President of MG Baltic, Mr Kurianski, and later proposed or supported the Group's initiatives in the Seimas and other institutions.
The former Chairman of the Liberal Movement, E. Masiulis, is suspected of the effects of trade, bribery and illegal enrichment, suspicions of abuse by former Vice-President Steponavičius of this party, former member of the City Council of Vilnius Š. Gustainius.
Mr Gapšys has been suspected of the effects of bribery and trade, Mr Kurianski, on bribery and trade.
Survey: who has the biggest chance to win the second round of presidential elections?
Four candidates on the top of the rating were included in the survey regarding the second election - economist Githanas Nausė, Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis who had not announced the candidate, and two candidates of the Homeland Union - the Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) Party who participated in the initial elections - Seimas Member Ingrida Šimonytė and diplomat Vygaudas Ušackas.
It was clear on Sunday that TS-LKD support was received in the elections by Mr Šimonytė, while Ušackas withdrew from the election struggle.
According to the figures, if the elections were to take place in the near future, in all cases G. Nausėdė would win the second round, but “Vilmorus is the head of Vilnius,” sociologist Vladas Gaidys says that it is too early to draw conclusions.
“It is very important to look at whether the parties speak about or about people, what dynamics exist.
This was a doubling of Shimonytė from one study to another, and Nausėda had stopped growth, and Ušacko even had a decrease.
It’s important to you, ” says sociologist.
Moreover, it is obvious from the survey's point of view that a significant percentage of people have not yet made a decision, are voting for, or are thinking of not going to elections at all.
If I. Šimonytė and S. Skvernelis were interrogated in the second presidential election, the fight would be tense - for I. Šimonytė to vote 32.7%, for S. Skvernelis 30.9%.
True, even 36.4% of people said that they would not vote for any of these candidates or did not know who they would vote for, or would not vote for.
Sociologist V. Gaidys once again stressed that we have not seen a picture yet, because all the candidates who applied to the less successful elite in Lithuania have not yet announced it.
\"If we look at the elections last year, there are many parties in Lithuania, where are their candidates?
For example, where was a candidate for social democrats? For 30 years he was a candidate, is there not now?
When it comes to publishing, you will see how you are looking for it with the other candidates.
So the Lithuanian side, which is less successful, is still less reflected – - said V. Gaidys.
In turn, the political scientist of Vilnius University Institute of International Relations and Political Science (VU TSPMI) Mažvydas Jastramskis says that it is still very early to draw conclusions, and all three candidates who have rejected V. Ušackas who has left the fight seem very close.
‘I can say from the experience of my research that these differences do not mean anything.
The difference of 5 percentage points does not really represent any advantage of the applicant.
The only thing I could see is that Nasė would look good against Ushak (...) again, in view of the fact that those people would actually vote.
The Nausė v. Skvernelle also looks good, but we compare now apples and potatoes, because, for example, Nausė has already declared that he will be present, Skvernelis has not announced.
In addition, the survey was conducted before the initial conservative elections, as it would look after them, ” says a political scientist.
According to him, Mr Nassė has a small plus, but once all the candidates have announced, he can dissolve.
\"The situation is quite equal.
Nassė, Skvernelis, Shimonytė - the results are rough.
I would like to remind you that half a year before the 2003 presidential election, Roland Paks had a 5% vote in favour of it and then won the election.
It's not possible to make any predictions,\" said Mr. Jastramskis.
DELFI recalls that candidates in presidential elections are already Economist G. Nausė, Member of the Seimas I. Šimonytė, philosopher Arvydas Juozaitis, economist, Member of the Seimas Aušra Maldeikienė, Member of Liberals Movement Petras Auštrevicius, Member of the Seimas Naglis Pueikis and Member of the European Parliament Valentinas Mazuronis.

The man was constantly rehearsed until the ambulance arrived.
The club's staff immediately called for emergency medical help, which arrived within 5 minutes.

Gražina lost her son in Norway: he replaced even four families and stopped speaking Lithuanians
According to the LNK press report, the Lithuanian Government lost the right to guardianship of the son four years ago and see it in the judgment of the Norwegian Children’s Rights Service “Barnevernet” and the court judgment.
A woman’s history caused a almost international scandal followed by all the media.
Nationals prepared pickets for the boy's return to Lithuania for his grandmother in Lithuania and Norway.
Publicity, however, has not helped the Greeks and her family to recover the son of Lithuanian citizenship.
Today, a woman tells of how she and her child have been separated from her son for the past few years, and how two years from time to time meetings are held between her and her child.
When Gražina lost her right to look after her son, the boy was 8 years old, and today she's 12 years old.
For the first two years, Gražina never saw her son, which was forbidden.
Later, the Greeks were granted the right to see their son twice a year, only one hour later.
The last meeting of the court, which took place a few months ago, increased the number of dating sessions for Lithuania to three times a year and increased to two hours.
Meetings with his son are each time reminded of dates in the strict slashing prison - watched by officials, while going to them - the secret operation.
“The son has replaced even four families and no longer speaks Lithuanians ” – Gražina will open her heart this Tuesday evening, her story will be on LNK show.
Eligijus Masiulis will not be returned personal money collected through the search
On Tuesday, the Court of Appeal declared that it rejected the appeal of the accused lawyer.
The order shall be final and not subject to appeal.
In a political corruption case, E. Masiulis, former head of the Liberal Movement, applied to the Appeal Court for a refund of any personal money - money taken through him and his spouse's money.
All in all, more than 242 thousand euros were taken from E. Masiul.
These sums are subject to temporary restrictions on the right of ownership and are regularly extended.
The last time Vilnius Regional Court extended it on October 15.
Mr Masiulis did not ask the Appeal Court to refund all the money - he wants to get back from the spouse's wallet EUR 800 and his wallet EUR 690, GBP 130, USD 1600.
Former politics says that the latter money was devoted to a planned journey in the United States.
Ms Masiul's lawyer, Mindaugas Bluov, at the Appeal Court on Monday, asked for the refund of this money because the spouses had a well-paid job and had the opportunity to have such amounts.
Prosecutor Justas Laucius brought an action against the court.
‘The judgment of the Vilnius Regional Court is lawful and well founded, there is no limitation on any of the assets indicated in the accusations submitted.
The court rightly held that there were grounds for confiscation of property, as well as for extended confiscation of property, - Mr Laucius said at the hearing.
On October 15, Vilnius Regional Court decided not to return more than 242 thousand euros to the accused of political corruption in E. Masiulis.
This money was found during the search for accusations of corruption in the home and car of the former politician.
The Chamber of three judges stated that it is clear from the case file that the right of ownership is restricted to the funds constituting the subject of criminal offences which are incriminated by Mrs Masiulis.
\"Considering the extent of the restriction, it can be concluded that the right of ownership of the accused is not disproportionately restricted or that the restriction is extended for too long,\" says judges of Nijolė Žimkiene, Jurgita Količienė and Fire Trumpul ruling.
The judges pointed out that in the case of E. Masiulis, criminal proceedings are large and complex, and therefore, in order to ensure possible confiscation of property and extended confiscation of property, it is necessary to extend the time limit for the accused’s temporary restriction of property.
The prosecutors say that the former Vice President of MG Baltic gave a bribe of EUR 106 thousand to E. Masiulis for taking the Group’s useful decisions in the Seimas.
Both accused persons believe that the money found with Mrs Masiulis - EUR 90 thousand - was a loan from Mr Kurlinski.
According to the case, a total of 242.4 thousand euros, 130 pounds of the United Kingdom and 1.6 thousand dollars were found during the search at E. Masiulis.
Mr Masiulis and his lawyer repeatedly tried to recover the money, but their applications were rejected by the courts.
A former policy has said that some of these funds belong to other persons and were used to invest in real estate or his family money.
He also argued that there is no evidence that the funds would be criminalised.
In the past, the Court of Appeal has stated that the accusations made by Mr Mašiulis indicate that these funds could have been obtained by accepting a bribe of over 100 thousand euros.
The legal authority claims that the remaining cash collected through the search could have been derived from undeclared sources of income, undeclared, documented and possibly not legal income.
In political corruption cases the accusations were submitted to three legal persons – Labour Party, Liberals Movement, MG Baltic
In addition to E. Masiul, in the case the accusations were submitted to the former-workman – Vytautas Gapš, the former parliament liberal for Šarūnas Gustainius, Seimas member Gintaras Steponavičius and former-MG Baltic Vice President R. Kurianski.
Mr Kurianski is accused of giving bribes to former Parliamentaries E. Masiulis, Š. Gustainius and V. Gapši.
The Americans have captured dangerous maneuvers from the Russian fighter
After 25 minutes of takeover, the US Navy stated that the Russian Su-27 rushed straight ahead of the plane.
The Russian plane flew through it for the second time, making use of the traction acceleration, and made a turnaround.
Passengers have reported a sense of turbulence at the time of the first approach and tremor during the second approach.
Russian troops have the right to exercise exercises in international airspace, but this interaction was irresponsible.
We expect international standards that ensure security and prevent incidents that are consistent with behaviour, including the 1972 Agreement on the Prevention of Incidents at Sea and the Sea (INCSEA), - said in our report to the US Navy.
“Insecure action increases the risk of misuse and of possible collisions” is noted in the report.
The Russian Ministry of Defence acknowledged the incident, but hoped that Russian Su-27 held a safe distance from an American plane.
Parents’ costs continue to decrease: spending on class activities is just up to €50 per month
According to a survey carried out by the market and public opinion research company Baltic Studies, at the end of August, a third of its parents spent less than EUR 100 this year on buying their children of school age, a fifth (21%) spent between EUR 101 and EUR 150, three out of ten (29%) - from EUR 151 to 200, and less than one fifth (18%) of their children spent more than EUR 200 at the end of summer preparation for school.
Parents whose children started to go to the first class this school year spent an average of around 220 euros on their children’s school basket, while other parents whose children had already completed their first class spent a smaller amount on their children’s training, on average around 160 euros.
However, as the school year progresses, the costs are not getting worse, as parents often have to pay money to groups of children and coletters.
Depending on the nature of the activity, the price per unit may vary from 20 to 100 euros.
Parents with school-age children were asked to say what amount of the average one month they planned to spend on the under-age employment of their own child.
One quarter (23%) of those surveyed had planned to spend up to 20 euros per month for after-school activities, another quarter (26%) said they paid up to 50 euros, three out of ten (31%) spend between 50 and 100 euros per month on extra-curricular employment, while a sixth (17%) parents said that they would spend 100 euros or more.
It is true that in Lithuania, a basket of non-formal child education is used for school-age children, which is made up of 15 euros per month.
However, this money can only be used in one unit, and if the price is higher, the difference must be borne by the parents.
In the case of a child attending more than one group or having several school-age children, the cost of after-school activities may double.
As the consumer loan company Vivus.lt says, the marketing manager Justina Ambrasienė, a small or medium-sized family, can become a challenge, especially when a family has several children.
From the early school year onwards, parents turned their heads to get money for exercise, office supplies, or new sports clothing.
Now, the main concern is how to take children after school without spending a bunch of money.
We note that the cost of parents increases particularly in August when preparing their parents properly for the new school year, but still remains higher later than in the summer season, as parents tend to invest in employment for their children.
Often, when they lack the funds and evaluate their opportunities responsibly, they are determined and borrowed,\" says J.Ambrasienė.

Kaunas is delighted by the fourth trained trolleybus
Today the fourth exhibition of the mobile street “Atia seniena, good news ” appeared in the streets of Kaunas in a drawing and a note in the inscription “Sienographer’s inscriptions” was decorated with an old trolleybus.
The city of Kaunas was informed about the new funny trolleybus.
“This old woman, Škoda, also changed her slightly boring green color into a much more colorful and brighter clothing.
It also presents “The Old Age, Good News, ” a participant in the exhibition, with pictures written by the representatives of the municipality.

“ You wanted to instill a trolley bus.
This picture looks very funny, especially because it matches the wheels of a trolleybus.
When the wheels turn, it seems to be part of that car.
When we cut the wheels white, we made them like a retro style, it sounded like a whole combination.
As long as the tires of the trolleybus were not painted, it really didn't seem as admirable – as before, the street artist spoke to the portal.day.lt.
And on October 27th, a perfect drawing lay down on the third trolleybus.
It is decorated with white, yellow, orange, brown, but mostly blue.
This color is dominant.
On the left side of the trolley bus there is one K.Donelaičio street house, on the right - central post.

“Kauno Day ” reminds us that last week Kaunas public transport company-Kauno buses-with Polish company Solaris Bus & Cook S.A. signed a 29.4 million contract stating that Kaunas will buy 85 new trolleybuses.
\"Caucasians invest throughout their history the highest amount for the renewal of public transport.
This agreement will allow all of us to replace the old ones that have served for many years – Škoda – brand trolleybuses and offer the most comfortable services to passengers.
New low-based, state-of-the-art trolley buses will have more seats, effective cabin conditioning and heating, high-quality information systems, video surveillance cameras and ergonomic driver's workspace.
New equipment and parallel repair of the contact network and street repair will make trolleybuses more reliable, much faster.
And, of course, the modern design of trolleybuses greatly decorates the city – - at that time, the director General of Kauno Busi was Mindaugas Grigel.
The first new trolleybuses in Kaunas will reach August next year, and all old trolleybuses will be replaced by December.

Prime Minister: teachers' salary increased by 117 euros after introduction of the fourth payment
Since September, the introduction of the ethical payment model has resulted in an increase of 117 euros in the average wage of full-time teachers, approved by Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis.
“It is too early to say how much it (new order - BNS) has advantages or disadvantages.
The fact is that those people who have full workload - their salaries have grown more than 117 euros on average - on Monday the government said to journalists Mr Skvernelis.
He referred to the plans of the Lithuanian Education Workers' Trade Union (LFDPS) for the execution of a strike for ethical pay as “democratic right” but stressed that the strike should not interfere with the education process.
“In a democratic country, all forms of protest are permitted, possible.
If you think we need to strike, it's their right to self-determination.
Only again would it not like children, schoolchildren, to suffer in this area.
If the strike is there, it must be done in accordance with the laws in force-- said Mr Skvernelis.
The Seimas confirmed the model of ethical teacher pay in June, it is introduced in stages from September.
The training of teachers was changed by hourly payment - the teacher's poster is 1512 hours a year.
The teacher’s working hours are divided into three parts: contact hours, training, preparation for them, and community work.
This reform, called the trade union under Andrius Navicko, is absurd, blasphemies that it is adopted on the \"buldozer\" principle and declares on the 12th of November on an open-ended strike.
The GPS requires immediate withdrawal of this-minute-wage system and the introduction of an ethical model with no more than 18 contact hours per post.
It is also about increasing the steady-state wage ratios by 20% and reducing the number of children in the classrooms.
Among other innovations, the introduction of a new methodology for distributing teaching funds is criticised, as trade unions say that there is insufficient funding for home education, the division of classes into groups, qualifications, education aid, and the classes in large cities, as they have been, have been overcrowded.
The Ministry of Education and Science stated that the ethical training of teachers will enable adjustment of the workload of teachers and the reimbursement of all work for the school community.
It is expected that the work of the teacher’s post will be up to half of the total number of hours per year for the community and up to 40% of all hours for the first two years of work.
The weekly working time of teachers shall be set at 36 hours, of which no more than 24 contact points per week shall be required to teach on a compulsory basis (for Members).
About half a hundred general education schools, kindergartens and non-formal education institutions contributed to the two-hour strike initiated by the Lithuanian Ministry of Education.
Overall, there are about 53 thousand teachers in Lithuania.
Encouraged to be prepared: the crisis can be expected within 2-3 years
The slowdown in economic growth and even the crisis can be expected in the next 2-3 years, but both the Bank of Lithuania and the Government of Lithuania are much more prepared for these processes than in a decade ago, the interview “Know Radio” show “Verslo Position” said Vitas Vasiliauskas, Chairman of the Board of the Bank of Lithuania.
\"I would certainly not be able to say that the crisis is behind the corner, but there are signs of a slowdown in the economy.
This year, our country's economy has grown by more than 3 percent, and we are planning a growth of 2.8 percent next year.
The key message I would like to say to society and business - let us be ready for everything - said Mr Vasiliauskas.
In his view, there are no uniform crises and therefore need to prepare themselves in different ways.
The difference between the decade-old crisis is that at that time the government thought the income generated by the growing economy would be forever, and the planned expenditure.
As a result, the crisis in 2008 led to very drastic cuts in expenditure.
Now, according to Mr Vassiliou, the situation is different and the crisis is better prepared.
“The fact is, we can see that the situation of the Bank of Lithuania and the Ministry of Finance is different.
We believe that we are already beyond our potential and need to press brakes.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Finance does not think so – - said the Chairman of the Board of the Bank of Lithuania.
V. Vasiliauskas values 7 out of 10 points in the preparations for the forthcoming crisis in the country's institutions.
According to him, a small and open economy, such as Lithuania, is heavily affected by external factors.
The current push for the large elephants - the US, China, the European Union - will certainly touch us.
We must therefore be very careful.
In a small economy, we can, but I do not believe, say Mr Vasiliauskas.
What can be expected for those who have taken out large loans in the future?
According to Mr Vasiliauskas, the European Central Bank has clearly set up a short-term strategy, and decisions on interest movements can be expected not earlier than the summer of the following year: \"At present, the main objective is to try to manage expectations.
The trend, which is most worrying for the Head of the Bank of Lithuania, is a decrease in working hands in our country.
\"The fall in the hands of the labour force is also, to a large extent, leading to a decrease in the competitiveness of the economy.
It is also a decline in the number of bread-eaters.
Migration this year has allowed some balance to be found in this process, but does not know whether it is a long-term trend - my V. Vasiliauskas.
ELTA recalls that the Bank of Lithuania and the Ministry of Finance predicts that the country's economy will grow by 3.4 per cent this year and then by 2.8 per cent next year.
The Swedish Conservative leader will try again to form a government
On Monday, Sweden, which has been in a political impasse for two months since the elections, will receive a second chance from the leader of a conservative moderate party to form a government.
The moderate party of Ulfo Kristerson belongs to the four centre-right party, Alliance, which received a slightly smaller vote during the 9th elections than the previous ruling centre left coalition.
It has been difficult for both blocks to bring up a majority when they refuse to negotiate with the Swedish anti-imimigative Democratic Party, which is the source of the neo-Nazi movement.
The first Christersson attempt on 14 October to build a government was unsuccessful.
On October 29, Stefan Lofven, the outgoing Prime Minister, announced the failure of his test.
In an attempt to force the parties to agree, the President of Parliament, Andreas Norlen, said that next week he would propose to Mr Kristersson's parliament as a candidate for the Prime Minister, thereby pushing the first vote from the beginning of the government's efforts.
“It is not clear in advance whether different parties will accept Ulf Kristersson as a Prime Minister, ” said Norlen.
However, he stressed that \"the process must move forward and the dynamics between the parties must change...
\"The negotiations between the Communities must be concluded\" he added.
Parliament's voting date is not yet clear, but Norlen said that there is 14 November among potential dates.
In Sweden, the President of Parliament can four times instruct a candidate to form a government with which the parliament would agree.
If all four attempts fail, the country has to hold new elections.
The current appointment of U. Kristersson is the third attempt by A. Norlen.
Some groups of Christian Democrats from the moderate party and the Alliance's partners press Mr Christersson to accept the support of the extreme right-wing Swedish Democratic Party, but he is still denying this possibility.
The Swedish Democratic Party, which has received 17.6% of its votes in the elections and is the third largest party, ignores all the main power stations for a long time.
The Ultradash party, which has been successfully used by the voters in the elections for their anger on immigration, after almost 400 000 asylum seekers arrived in the country since 2012, demands influence on decision-making in exchange for support.
However, the Liberals and Centralists of the Alliance strongly contradict this idea.
Since 2014, the Swedish Social Democratic Party (SAP) which managed with the support of the Greens and the informal Left has allowed cooperation between the blocks, but only if it maintains the Prime Minister's post.
The Alliance and the Swedish Democratic Party rejected this opportunity.
A delegation from the Afghan Government will participate in the peace negotiations in Russia
The Kabul Government delegation will participate in international talks in Russia on peace war discipline in Afghanistan this month, with officials announced on Monday.
The Taliban in turn continues to consider whether to participate.
On Saturday, Russia announced that such a conference would be held in Moscow on 9 November, although the United States is currently trying to enter into bilateral negotiations with the Taliban on the 17-year-long resolution of the conflict.
The High Peace Council of the Afghan Government, which is responsible for the efforts of reconciliation with the fighters, will send four representatives to the meeting in Moscow, said Sayyed Ihsan Taheri (Sajid Ihsan Taheris) to the news agency AFP.
However, the Afghan Ministry of Foreign Affairs was reluctant to answer whether it would send a delegation to this conference, which would focus on initiating peace negotiations between Kabul and the Taliban.
We are still in agreement with Russian officials - said Sebagtula Ahmadis, representative of Sebakhtullah Ahmadis. - Congratulations to any peace efforts led by Afghans.
Taliban representative Zabiullah Mujahids said that movement is still under consideration.
Moscow also invited representatives from the US, India, Iran, China, Pakistan and five former Soviet Central Asian Republics.
Pakistan, who has long been accused of supporting the Taliban in Afghanistan, “needfully participated” said AFP, representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mohammed Faisal.
The US Embassy in Kabul has not yet replied to the request for comment.
Initially, the meeting was scheduled for September in Moscow, but was postponed on a call from Kabul to lead the process by Afghans.
The negotiations will take place in the early stages.
The newly appointed US peace messenger Zalmay Khalilzad is trying to convince the Taliban to agree to negotiate the conclusion of the war and fearful that a multilateral meeting in Russia could destroy these efforts.
One US government supervisory authority last week indicated that the Kabul government in Afghanistan weakened in recent months.
The President of Cuba met with the North Korean leader in Pyongyang
The North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and the President of Cuba Miguel Diaz-Canel, who are both looking forward to the abolition of U.S. economic sanctions, agreed to expand and strengthen the strategic relationship between their countries, informed North Korean public media on Monday.
Mr Diaz-Canel, who came to Asia on his first international journey after coming to power in April, went to Pyongyang with his wife on Sunday.
Kim Jong Unas met him at the airport, and the leaders joined the city through the crowds that greeted them.
North Korean public media reported that leaders held negotiations at the national guest house Paekhwawon stressed the overall social history of their countries and promised further solidarity.
Official media did not provide many details, but indicated that the negotiating atmosphere was friendly.
The meeting with Kim Jong Unu could be seen as a warning to Washington, whose efforts to achieve significant progress on North Korea's denuclearisation are increasingly stressful.
Pyongyang, who recently also tried to win Moscow's favour, tightens up his rhetoric this week before the planned US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, and the North Korean Chief negotiator, Kim Yong Cholo, in New York.
The weekend, Pyongyang, through his official media, criticised the United States for its irrevocable sanctions - a political tool that Washington has also used extensively against Cuba and Russia.
North Korea has mentioned the possibility of further developing its nuclear weapons programme if Washington does not change the course.
Sanctions are an important item on the Diazo-Canel agenda.
Last week, when visiting Moscow, Diaz-Canel discussed the arms contract with Russia of almost $50 million (EUR 43.8 million) and received a similar pledge from Vladimir Putin to expand political, economic and military relations.
The two Presidents then issued a joint statement condemning the United States – the interference in the internal affairs of sovereign states –
The US economic embargo on Cuba, originally introduced in 1958 and subsequently extended, remains valid.
Russia's painful US and European Union sanctions were imposed due to the annexation of Crimea and support to separatists in Eastern Ukraine.
Mr Diaz-Canel has to leave Pyongyang on Tuesday.
He will still be in China, Vietnam and Laos.

Inga Valinskiene connects to the closet team, which is entrusted with one of the most important roles of the work - a woman of course will play Juliet’s narration.
Povil Meškėla also became an important part of the team, who would take care of the singing of the performers.
“I think love has been created since Shakespeare’s time for many and very beautiful, but “Rome and Juliet ” will probably always remain a symbol of these stories and will be built on different scenes for a long time.
It will be interesting to become part of one of these things, ” says I. Valinskiene, who is behind the new test on the shoulders.
Although a known woman is well - known on the stage, has played a number of role in various plays or musicals, her education has not yet flown.
\"The time for playing Juliet has already passed, - smiles I. Valinskienė.
- In my time I would probably have accepted a proposal like that.
True, a school character in Shakespeare’s drama is no less important, some critics are even considered to be the most important.
The victim is not only the mediator, the helper - her way and the tone of speaking, the woman's attitude towards feelings and the resulting solidarity with the lovers of the plot give more and more colours.
It was also important because she was one of the two women in the drama “Rome and Juliet ”
“The figure is not very close to my style and style, but sometimes only more interesting.
To create a character different than the one you own - a part of a fun creative process.
So far I do not know what the final result will be, because it will depend not only on me, but also on the interpretation of the director, - says Mr Valinskienė and reveals that being Juliet's sitter would probably be the same.
- I think she raised her heart.
Most women are acting in this way.
That'd probably be what I'd do.

Parents who are against children's choices have always been and will be.

“The corner presents a song whose video has already refused to show one TV
This year and again, the group “Rangour” started to develop music intensively to commemorate its 20th anniversary.
Having announced on 26 December the only anniversary concert at Vilnius Siemens Arena “Skamp20” presents new works one by one.
This time it is “Love Me Like There’s No Tomorrow” and a bold song video.
“This work is about love, so I thought that all types of relationships in the clip should be eternalized, regardless of age or sexual orientation” – reveals the idea of new songs and video clips by Erika Jennings, who is convinced that any manifestation of homophobia is not normal in 2018.
New songs \"Love Me Like There's No Tomorrow\" have been filmed in ten different orientations and age pairs in the video: \"We have always supported LGBTQIA communities, and we believe that one day we will not need to discuss it anymore\" - says Viktor Diawara, who created music in the beginning of the year during family holidays in Israel.
It is true that this video “Skamp” has already had negative reactions - he does not want to show one of the most popular shows in the country.
This tells a lot about our society.
Television will not show up as it is where people kiss and it's supposed to be inappropriate for children.
And the fact that when the television is switched on at any time of the day, you can apply to the battles on the screen and to other forms of violence is a good content - - the rhetoric is asked by Mrs Jennings.
Erica’s anthrin and Willius Alessius: “I would like to see more people who share their hands and kiss them, regardless of their social status, gender, or age.
We raise our children and want them to grow in an environment where there is as much tolerance and as much discomfort as possible.
The new song and video clip we want to spread out at least a little bit on the day of our listeners and give them a smile
From 1998 onwards, the “Skamp“ group has been famous for its bold songs with unpopular or optical themes.
All the best songs - old and new - will sound loudly and widely in the “Skamp20” concert already on 26 December in Vilnius Siemens Arena.
It awaits everyone with their families, and children under 10 years of age are free of charge.
A traffic accident at the clinics: a person who has suffered as a result of cycling
Several minutes later, the 9-hours portal battle.day.lt version reached the readers' information about police and hospital emergency crews traveling towards Kaunas clinics.
The causes of this movement were revealed when the interest occurred.

Presidency: LRT is not political property
As the Seimas intends to return to the discussion of the conclusions of the Commission, the Presidency is afraid that the ruling authorities simply seek to gain more political control of the public broadcaster.
“The public broadcaster is not political property, and the fundamental principle is to maintain that independence from the politicians,” explained the president’s advisor to the Radio of Knowledge Mindaugs Lingė.
However, the counselor highlighted the opposite process.
“It is possible to see that these (political. - ELTA) influence wants to have more.
We appreciate it quite critically,\" said Lingo.
According to him, the proposals of the LRT Commission, operating in the Seimas, are questionable and questionable, because of the peace of the broadcaster's independence.
While Mr Lingau has stressed the need to improve the management of LRTs, this should be done on the basis of expert assistance and the search for specific aspects of the smooth functioning of LRT.
He stressed that international institutions already stressed that the activities of LRT should be supervised by competent authorities rather than political ones.
On Tuesday, the Seimas intends to take a decision on the conclusions of the panel which examined the activities of LRT.
These conclusions have been a lot of criticism.
Very sceptically, the proposals to change the governance of the LRT are to reduce the powers of the Council and to associate its members with the terms of office of the appointing authorities.
In this context, the European Broadcasting Union expressed its concern.
In January the opposition group of Seimas Members addressed the Constitutional Court regarding whether the special parliamentary commission for investigation of activities and finances of LRT does not conflict with the Constitution.
Working abroad - good news from Mr Carbauskas
The Seimas started to consider amendments to the Law on Declaration of Place of Life by Senior Minister Ramūnas Barbuskis of the Lithuanian Peasant Popular Union Group, according to which citizens who work and pay taxes outside Lithuania would be exempt from paying compulsory health insurance contributions.
On Tuesday, the draft was supported by 56 Members of the Seimas, before being 9 Parliamentaries abstained.
After the draft discussion in committees, it is planned to discuss in the Seimas plenary sitting on 6 December. The Seimas also decided to request the conclusions of the Government.
According to the proposed project, persons who pay social insurance contributions in the Member States of the European Union, in the states of the European Economic Area or in the Swiss Confederation shall be exempt from paying compulsory health insurance contributions in the Republic of Lithuania by a decision of the State Social Insurance Fund administration.
Living and working outside Lithuania, the data submitted and validated by the State Social Insurance Fund Board “Sodra” and the State Tax Inspectorate would be considered as leaving Lithuania.
This is about services that a person does not use.
There is an additional possibility to fix the fact that a person has left – - R. Carbuskis explained from the Seimas Tribal.
Such proposed regulation, in the opinion of the Conservatoire of the Seimas, would be unfair towards citizens living in Lithuania and paying taxes.
“Part of the Lithuanians living abroad abuse it, ” noted A. Matulas.
Social Democrat Algirdas Syss believes that in this way we are calling on citizens not to comply with their obligations.
In his view, it would make it possible for tricks to use their healthcare system free of charge.
Upon the adoption of the proposed amendments to the law, persons who have left for residence in other countries shall pay social security contributions, no accumulation of debts, and the burden of managing the debts of “Sodros” will be eased.
Currently, Lithuanian citizens who have actually left Lithuania but have not declared in accordance with the procedure laid down by legal acts in the Residents' Register are entitled to monthly contributions from the Compulsory Health Insurance (PSD) and, if they are not paid, accumulated debt.
Mr Duonėla has been convicted of fraud, but justified by fraud
Vilnius Regional Court has maintained a sentence for attempting to cheat on former well-known sportsman Alvydas Duonėla who has been convicted, but he has been justified for falsification of documents.
The judgment judgment judgement published on Monday came into force immediately.
A. Duonėla was sentenced by deprivation of liberty for a period of half a year and the execution of the sentence was postponed.
This year Vilnius City District Court sentenced the multiple hibernation champion of Lithuania.
He was sentenced to five and a half years in prison.
Having examined Vilnius Regional Court the case according to the sentenced person's complaint, the Vilnius Regional Court removed one charge, but the sentence remained the same.
A former sportsman will also have to pay almost €760 to the Crime Fund.
Prosecutor's Office A. Duonāl was accused of counterfeiting a note from his former wife, Dalios Burokaitė, under the supervision of the dental office Dalicia, that he lent LTL 200 thousand (about EUR 58).
The spouse only learned about this in December 2016 when she received requests to pay for debt.
The former spouse said that he never borrowed from a husband for the purposes of a money clinic and that he never signed a vase.
According to the judges of Vilnius Regional Court there is no objective data in the case proving that A. Duonėla would have recorded data that were not relevant to the reality that it was the UAB “Dalecija” – the debt of A. Duonėlai LTL 200 thousand.
The arguments put forward by the sentenced person and his defender in the complaint are accepted, and the case does not contain objective data to support this.
Thus, having stated that Mr Duonėla had only used a false true document for fraud and found that this feature - the use of a false document - was a composite part of fraud (in the case under examination - an attempt to cheat), A. Duonėla was justified in accordance with Article 300(1) of the Criminal Code without demonstrating that he had been involved in committing a criminal offence – - according to the judgment of Vilnius Regional Court.
Firefighters headed the cats buried with the earth – they heard it three days
As announced by the Fire Rescue Board of Kaunas County, it was reported that for three days the cat was buried after the heat mains change.
When the firemen came, they also heard the roaring of a cat.
It was found that a few days ago, heat track repair was carried out here.
It is assumed that when the road was buried, two cats could have been closed by the earth.
The firefighters buried the heat line at a depth of one and a half metres, and put a hole in it for cats.
The son of Antonin Scalia says that the liberal protests against the Kavanaugh of his father's unseen
On Sunday, the son of Helion Supreme Court Judge Antonin Scalia said to the agency Fox News, that protest against the nominated judge Brett Kavanaugh by his father's unsurprising extreme forces, because Scalia believed that the Supreme Court was too involved in the affairs of the modern world.
“In general terms, he would not be surprised by the noise resulting from the nomination to the Supreme Court because a lot of people refer to Roe v Wade, at least to the left,” said Christopher Scalia, reminding him of the famous case in 1973, which established the constitutional right of women to abortion in certain trimesters.
The Roe case, in one instance, annulled all state rights to regulate abortion itself and some states, in response to this decision, immediately tried to restrict their right to abortion.
“My father often said that Roe v Wade and other cases the court actually tried to solve cultural problems, even though they were to be resolved during elections and the legislative process,” he added during the show “Fox & Friends ”
“In order to speed up proceedings, the Supreme Court brought even more damage, so nominations to the Supreme Court and disputes on approval give rise to a more severe reaction because judges play a role in the legislators”
The Nebraska senator, Republican Ben Sasse, at his meeting this month on the approval of Kavanaugh, expressed a similar view, repeating that Congress often gives too much power to executive authorities, which are in principle not accountable to anyone, but leaves the resulting bureaucratic questions to the Supreme Court, which requires judges to take up a job that the senators refuse.
The Capitol Hill Police arrested and accused hundreds of protesters about the illegal interference in the approval process of a candidate.
Asked whether Kavanaugh could avoid a hostile reaction to the unwarranted accusations of sexual misconduct that he was committing several decades ago, Scalia stated that it would probably not be possible to avoid noise.
In response to statements that Kavanaugh should not be in office in the Supreme Court, because on Thursday during the senators' poll responded hotly and sometimes – presumptuously, Scalia questioned whether all judges were in a quiet character.
“Judges often get angry, ” said Scalia when talking about the abusive disagreements that sometimes arise in contradictory cases.
“The truth, judge Kavanaugh must have responded more aggressively, but this was not the case.
He tried to defend his good name from unwarranted accusations...
On Thursday, most of the party votes in the Senate Courts Committee (11 v 10) allowed Kavanaugh to participate in the entire Senato vote.
The senator of the Republicans of Arizona, Jeff Flake, declared a dramatic moment to give his decisive voice to Kavanaugh only if the FBI had been given a week to investigate the alleged violations of current accusations brought to Kavanaugh.
The study is still ongoing, and President Trump said that the Agency was given a wide range of powers and that it was able to question – whenever he wished –
“Schiaparelli – made-up clothing collection – fantastic finishing
Is it possible to embody surrealism?
“Schiaparelli ” tried to answer this question.
The Paris fashion home, which was founded almost a hundred years ago by Elsa Schiaparelli, presented its first collection of ready-made clothing and handholds.
This collection is almost as incredible as the famous batter of Elsa Schiaparelli's inverted booth.
A long - centered fashion home has also shown itself to be very modern.
In aesthetic decisions you will find sensitivities, lobsters, hearts and eyes.
Schiaparelli created his first combination of music in 1930 and was the first designer whose models were podium by music.
She and her friend Salvador Dali have decided to reconcile art and fashion, and now this idea has been taken over by Calvin Clein and Rafa Simons, who collaborated with American artist Sterling Ruby.
Sklando's legend is that Dali, together with Schiaparelli's and the lobster's motive, wanted to wear a real mayonnaise before the demonstration, but he did not get the support.

Photograph: “Schiaparelli –
“We wanted to return to the idea of co-operation, which is inseparable from “Schiaparelli” history,” said Bertrand Guyon, a creative director in the last three years, who spoke at the home salon of fashion at Vandom Square.
In creating a collection of ready-made clothes, he referred to Schiaparelli’s relationship with Man Ray and, in cooperation with My Ray Foundation, created clothes according to well-known works of art.
The famous picture of the artist’s near-eyes, the visual tears, appeared on the shirts covered by Perspex, and the red lips from the “Observatory’s time: in love, the silky-printed shirt with a cord on a true silute dress.
My Ray’s “Stikle tears ” on the collection of shirts
One of Elsa’s strange things was a superstitious urge for the letter S. Her branded colour – “Shaking Rosary ” – inspired her perfumes – The rosary –
The first curated by Guyon – Schiaparelli – handbag with key hole named on the buckle – Secret –
Its retail price will also be fantastic – 5000 £.
Yesterday, on the left side of the ancient bank, a temporary store was opened, showing the surreal side of the Paris Fashion Week and for 100 € it was possible to purchase Virgil Abloho's carpets from the upcoming Ikea - collection.
The half hour before the opening, more than 500 young Abloh’s fans lined up in a row on the quay, were eager to purchase one of his works at more favourable prices than his creation, “Louis Vuitton, male clothing.
The project helps Ablohui reach wider audience than the one with luxury fashion or furniture designed by designers.
“No one has any property anymore, but knowledge of a certain chair can help to make a conversation at the dinner table.
That's how the millennia once thought, ” he said recently.
The audience in Marais district realized that this festival in the garage would not be the norm when models began to run through the skateboards.
The collection of the free collection of colorful male and female coats of the Westwood man designer Andreas Kronthaler was based on portraits of Jessica Fulford-Dobson Kabul skaters.
Some sandals in the high - height sandals (and several men) served as skateboards, but the platform boots themselves.
When Westwood was watching the show in the first row and wearing a collection dress with a horse’s motif and an orange sword fused across the waist, he joined the final bow on the podium with his husband who gave it a flower bouquet.
Strong twin link in photos
Peter Zelewski, born in Detroite, who lived in London, had already established himself as a street photographer when he started taking pictures of twins four years ago.
“ As a photographer and a man of portraits, I always admired twins and their extraordinary connection, ” he says.
The photographer did not plan to create the whole project, but, according to him, “I became dependent after having taken a picture of the first twins and had stopped my road back.
In the near future, 44 photographs and stories of identical twin couples will be printed in the book “Twos. ”
The project is more visual, he says: “It is not a documentary or a scientific project – I wanted to take a picture of affected and sensibly portraits of people.
Nursing nurses expressed distrust in a trade union negotiating wages
Members of the Royal Hospital College, dissatisfied with the trade union deal with the National Health Service for salaries, made a declaration after the vote of distrust of the Union and accused it of distorting the demands on the increase in remuneration that had been expected.
This unprecedented decision was taken after a lengthy discussion at the Royal College of Nursing when his former Secretary-General, Janeta Davies, admitted a false promise to the members that their salaries would immediately increase by 3% this year, when the 1% salary limit is lifted.
In the absence of a expected salary rise, members were angry and forced to leave office by Davies, then presented a petition and held an urgent meeting in Birmingham on Friday, which followed by a declaration of distrust by the college council.
“The fair and open debate in Birmingham helped clarify the relationship, so the college will only grow stronger,” said Maria Trewn, Director of Royal Care College.
“The talk is clear and the council and management of the Royal Care College understood the message sent to her.
The Council has already sought change in the organisation in recent weeks and has tried to listen to and incorporate the names of its members; we will continue to do so.
The meeting will take place next week and it is expected that the members of the Royal Care College will withdraw.
\"The basis of the care is trust,\" said the national health services nurses in the newspaper \"Guardian-1\"
“The actions of the Royal College have undermined her confidence and must withdraw from the Board.
I hope that she will act in a respectful manner and listen to the request.
I wonder if the other trade union members will also seek reform.
The General Trade Union State Officer at the National Health Service Rachel Harrison said in August “Guardian ”: “The national health service’s employees from all over the country understood that they had not received a chance to raise their health skills.
They were angry.
Before the unusual meeting, the Royal College of Care acknowledged that it had made mistakes in the negotiations on remuneration in 2018 and had not properly reported about them.
However, it is also claimed that the Royal Care College campaign to abolish the wage restriction forced the government to abandon this restriction and commit itself to gradually increasing wages by 6.5% in three years.
The vote was held after an independent investigation which established that the college tended to descend into negotiations and Davies was accused of not taking a thorough assessment of the deal.
It is argued that the Royal Care College provided factually inadequate information and therefore the members were unable to take a reasoned decision on the transaction and did not consider the alternatives.
The college has announced contradictory information as to whether all employees will receive an increase of 3% of their salaries.
In a short report before the college meeting, it was wrong to say that \"a 3% rise and an increase were planned in the progressive implementation of the reform\".
Indeed, salaries had to be gradually raised to 3% and only some of the highest wage earners would have had to get an immediate increase.
‘Almost all the information provided to members after the meeting on the implementation of the transaction was incorrect (in parallel to the attempt to simplify it)’ – said a representative of the Election Reform Office who carried out the investigation.
‘The parties considered that the differences between the existing system and the proposed transaction were not understood and concisely explained and did not explicitly mention the main advantages, including the 6,5 and 29% calculations, as mentioned in the campaign, so that a reasonable solution could not be taken.’
The decision to express mistrust was supported by 78% of the votes and 3.74% of the members of the Royal College of Care participated in the vote.
Lindsay Lohan jumped by the Instagram, a live broadcast to viewers, trying to garner their children from their families
Lindsay Lohan was criticised for the fact that the “Instagram ” was a direct broadcast through which she followed the family of the homeless on the street and tried to separate her son from her parents.
In fact, the actress initially offered to provide the family with a night’s place, but the situation was complicated by direct broadcasts that are likely to be filmed in Moscow (by Lohan’s earlier update, Instagram).
“Good for everyone! I want to show what family I met,” she said to the viewers, “I am very concerned about refugees from Syria.
They really need help.
Do you want to come with me?
May I take care of you, ” she said to the family before turning to one of the children: “Would you like to stay in the hotel?
See the movies?
After all, it would be fun to watch a movie through TV or a computer.
When the parents refused, Lohan responded in a hostile manner.
\"Your children should not be on the street, you should work hard and do everything for them to improve their lives.
\"If someone offers them a home and a place, as I am now, you should agree.
They'll be back to you.
I'm not going anywhere without you.
I know who you are now.
Don't laugh with me.
When the family tried to withdraw from Lohan by going to the street, the actress followed it by continued live broadcasting through “Instagram ”
“Look at what's happening – it's a trade for children, so you're damaging the Arab culture.
You fucked your children, though they don't want to go with you.
Boys, don't worry, I see you and now the whole world sees us --
Translatation ended with physical confrontation – it seems that Mother hit Lohan.
Video clips spread to the social media and some users were interested in whether this could not be treated as an abducting.
“The Independent ” contacted Lohan's representative for its comments.
A third of the British believe that they will never pay all the debts they have held
Almost a third of the Britons believe that they will not be able to cover their debts during their lives, and one in 10 believes that they will not even be able to reduce them.
“A study by Equifax and Gorkana, the results of which were only disclosed to the Independent, showed that the British, especially the 18-24 age group, think that they will have debts throughout their lives, and only half hope to get out of them.
Last year, a report published by the Institute of Fiscal Research shows that graduates remain in debt of about €46 000, while the poorest students remain in debt of more than €57 000.
The majority of graduates (81%) will never pay the entire debt, so the first 30 years of work will be forced into debt.
Public debt is growing: according to the National Statistics Department, UK family debt is in record size and the British spend on average 900 pounds more than they earn each year.
But is it worth worrying about this terrible statistics?
Is lifelong debt simply a new routine way of life for young adults (and society as a whole)?
An example of this is the purchase of cars that are another major purchase, if successful.
“Auto Trader ” estimates this week that in a decade, all new cars will be purchased on a pay-out basis, which will be the usual means of purchasing vehicles.
“EQ Investors – Director and certified finance planner Jeannie Boyle believes that expectations have really changed.
“At present it is really normal to have debt: credit cards have become popular, interest-free refinancing, student loans and fast loans” she said.
“For our generation of grandparents, it was embarrassing to have debts ”
Today, student debt and house price debt have become normal.
This statement is supported by Moira O'Neill, head of the Personal Finance Department, who believes that the results can be worrying.
“If you borrow a huge amount four or five times your income, you may find that extra debt will not mean nothing,” she explained.
And so people get into trouble.
The interest rates have been low for many years, so people with large loans or other debts have to think about security if the rates rise.
It should probably not be surprising that the commentators in the financial industry have no doubt.
Brian Broadie, CEO of the Fraedom Finance loan agency, says: “Schools are not taboo.
The last exit is no longer considered to be a loan for home repair or new car.
At low interest rates, many people have helped to save in fixed-term deposits with higher returns, but not so easy to achieve savings.
As a result, the middle class is lending more and more.
Over the past six months, around half of the new loans have taken on a good creditworthiness assessment:
“Equifax, Head of the Finance Problem Resolution Division at TDX Group, believes that such expectations – not getting out of debt – are really worrying.
He says: “In August inflation was the highest in six months (2.7 percent), interest rates rose and the rate of debt grew to a low level, and the decision of many people to borrow without a realistic plan to repay debt is worrying.
Our analysis has shown that this year the number of personal bankruptcies will rise by 17%, the main determining factor being record borrowing by consumers.
Schools may not be a cause for much concern as a person works and earns, but it is not clear how lifelong debt will affect his well-being in his old age.
The research carried out by the Centre for Economic and Business Research together with the experts on mortgage lending from More 2 Life showed that over a third over the past four years, unguaranteed people's debt increased more than twice the national average over the past four years.
This age group typically borrows on credit cards and spends 30 percent more monthly than earned.
Boyle adds: “The increasing number of people in the age of 55 choose to pay their debts from pension funds, which will affect their lives at retirement.
Most often, they are the only savings they have to save.
In addition, people think that using the property will pay off later, but changing the existing property to less expensive does not generate as much money as they expect.
If the price of the asset falls, the situation will only get worse.

Tennis donkey shared a clip on its Instagram page and explained that the video was designed to encourage women to check their breasts.
“In this month of the fight against breast cancer, I wrote the divinyls, a version of the world hit ‘I Touch Myself’, to remind women of their regular self - examination, ” he wrote to Williams.
“So I came out of my comfort zone, but I wanted to do it because this problem affects women of all races around the world.

I hope that I can remind women of this.
Williams continued: “This music clip is part of the project “I Touch Myself Project, which implements the famous Chrisy Amphlett honor – she died of breast cancer and gave us her hit to remind women first of all about their health. ”

The video that the tennis star announced in his Instagram account received more than 1.5 million views and many praises from fans for the way the tennis player played a song.
“The warmest wishes for this clip and your courage to do so.
Thank you, Seren, ” wrote one fan.

I got breast cancer 20 years ago, and I found the node myself, even when my momograms didn't show anything.
Just check it out.
Thank you for not afraid to leave the comfort zone – you're a real dance-
“For the ‘I Touch Myself Project’, the Berlei also released a new snake skin vest, the Chrisy, inspired by the rock star.
100% of the profits from the sale of the bra will be donated to the BCNA.
In checking themselves, it is important to know what signs and symptoms need to be sought.
Signs of breast cancer are not only nodules, but also changes in the size or shape of the breast, rashes or wounds, discharge from the acne, skin surface pits, persistent pain or skin texture changes.
In addition, swelling at the arm of the arm or at the cervix, swollen vein, and stabbed nipple may be warned of cancer.
It is recommended that women check their breasts every month.
If you notice any signs of breast cancer, you should contact your family doctor immediately.
If your family doctor if you are looking at you, decide that your symptoms should be further evaluated, he will send you to the breast cancer clinic.
Adam Driver forced the entire SNL movie group into quatatis
Adam Driver was the guest star of the Saturday Night Live this week, and he actually tried to mock everyone.
The best piece of jokes is usually not related to a specific current event – just as the new exhibition titled “Career Day ”
The day of the American high school, when the students bring their fathers, and the teenager Pete Davidson reluctantly agrees that his father, the old oil magnet Abraham H. Parnassus, would give a speech.
In Lazdele, a reassuring Parnassus whose megahuman personality could be inspired by Daniel Day-Lewis' character Daniel Plainview, from the film “Bus Blood, ” relates the manner in which the oil industry was conquered.
“ I grew up seven months too early, ” says Parnassus, a student.
“The incubator technologies have just been invented, so I was put in a cast iron pot and heated in a pizza oven until I was able to walk.
My bones didn't harden like this, but not my spirit!
Be strong and crush your enemies.
Davidson and his colleague, SNL actress Aidy Bryant, playing the teacher, barely laughing, and cannot look at the Driver.
However, the “Star Wars ” are the jokes of the actor that are on the rise, and he begins to talk about the personal war with another oil magnet H. R. Pickins.
“I’ve had your granddaughter ” – he’s a stink
“I filled her belly with seed that was working and ruined your boy, which is my ultimate avenge, H. R. ”
Parnassus has become an as memorable character of Adam Driver in less than five minutes as Kylo Ren from two films.
“Be cursed, H. R. ”

On Saturday, eight unheard of tracks were on the Internet, with parties dated SZA, Busta Rhymes, Jay'us Rock, Isaiah Rashad and Abi Soul.
It is not clear where the song spread, nor is the title of the collection ‘Bad Kid Hill City EP’, and the cover illustration (which is likely to be created by the fan) not official.
It is possible that only those versions of demonstrations and unfinished songs could be released, sounding as if different career periods were recorded in Lamara.
‘Gang Member-1 could belong to ‘Good Kid Mail City’, and to ‘Heroin’ would be combined with a SZA similar to the sound track ‘DAMN./Black Panther’.

Living room furniture in Kaunas
The website can be called a representative home area, where we spend time with our friends, accept guests, etc. Therefore, it should be equipped in such a way that it is convenient not only for the owners of the apartment or the house, but also for the guests.
Depending on the size of the site, walls, ceiling decoration, the taste of hosts, the appropriate furniture should be chosen.
The website should not only be beautiful, but also comfortable.
It is best to invite an interior designer to help you complete the space optimally, so that it is not overloaded or, vice versa, too empty.
It is suggested that you first set out the main point of the site, i.e. the subject to which the furniture and other details are to be combined.
This can be a fireplace or other important highlight of the website's interior.
It would also be good to create a chat area where guests can communicate in a comfortable way, so that they do not interfere with furniture, etc.
Sofas, chairs should be located close to each other, so that your guests can sit down and talk.
The arrangement of furniture must therefore encourage communication, unite people, and not extend them away.
Keep your furniture out of the wall.
The distance from the walls depends on the size of the room.
Although the room is small, leave at least a little room from the wall, do not push the furniture close to her.
If there is a large room space, leave even more room from the walls.
Indeed, the longer the distance is, the better.
Place furniture to create a balance
Consider the size and location of the various details that will be on your website.
All elements shall be compatible with each other.
Site furniture must be compatible with interior details.
A small contrast is possible.
He will enliven the interior of the site, but it should not be too large, because the interior will become unscrupulous.
We advise you to always consult interior designers.
By creating the interior of the website itself, if you do not have the necessary knowledge, you risk moving to extremes: or creating boring interiors, because you are afraid of experiment, error, wrong choice or trying to improvise.
Suitable lighting
This is a very important thing.
After all, different light reveals the space in different ways.
Lighting needs to be arranged at various levels: ceiling lamps, wall lamps, lamps on the floor.
Prosecutor’s Office has appealed against the Judgment to the Heads of the LCF
Vilnius Regional Public Prosecutor’s Office has appealed against the judgment of Vilnius Regional Court against former heads of the Lithuanian Basketball Federation (LKF).
As announced on Monday by the Public Prosecutor’s Office, the complaint states that the Municipality of Panevėžys did not have a legal basis to contribute to the reconstruction of a private hotel in Panevėžys with cash funds.
During the pre-trial investigation it was established that in order to be able to finance the reconstruction of the hotel, a service contract was concluded in 2010 between the Basketball Federation of Lithuania and the Municipality of Panevėžys City.
The prosecutors claim that part of the services which the federation was required to provide to the Municipality of Panevėžys under the above contract were not intended and could not be provided, since the planned services had already been financed by the State and by the sponsors, some of the planned events had already taken place before the signature of the contract and had already been paid out from other funds, and some of the events had already taken place after the issue of VAT invoices - the money under the invoices had been transferred for the outstanding events.
Vilnius Regional Public Prosecutor’s Office states that it disagrees with the judgment of the Court of First Instance that the State itself has ordered and ordered the Municipality of Panevėžys to undertake the reconstruction of a private hotel, because there was no obligation of the State regarding a particular hotel, only the offer expressed to Panevėžys City Municipality to resolve the issues of the development of hotels necessary for the championship as soon as possible.
In the opinion of the prosecutor's office, the court has unwarrantedly stated that the leaders of the municipality of LKF and Panevėžys have tried to fulfil the obligation of the State without having to have the right roads, because the data in the case show that it was possible to hold European Basketball Championship team events in other cities, without prejudice to the laws.
By way of appeal, the Office of the Public Prosecutor of the Vilnius Region asks that the court of the first instance should annul the lawful judgment and, in this case, take a new, accused judgment on seven natural persons and one legal person.
On October 15, all incriminated crimes were fully justified by the General Secretary of the LKF, Mindards Balčiūnas.
This case concerns preparation for the European Basketball Championship for men held in Lithuania in 2011.
Mr Balčiūn has been accused of abuse, fraud and other crimes.
Prosecutor's Office M. Balčiūnas was accused that in his position as Secretary General of the LCF he had agreed with the Federal Chief Financial Officer and Managing Director that the performance of works which are not in line with reality on behalf of the Federation would be recorded - transfer acts and other documents and accounts of services provided to the Municipality of Panevėžys were entered in official accounts.
According to the figures of the medical investigation carried out by the officers of the Special Investigation Service (STT) Panevėžys Board, funds of Panevėžys City Municipality could be fraudulent and falsified for the benefit of LKF and later used for reconstruction of the company Via Unica – Hotel-Romantic.
Head of the hotel Dalia Kukleerienė accused of shopping - suspected that she gave Balčiūnas a TV as a bribe.
All persons who have been tried with Mr Balčiūnas have been justified.
The indictments in this case were submitted to eight natural persons and one legal person - the Lithuanian Basketball Federation.
Remote workplace - like the Bermuda triangle
The number of people injured or killed in the work in Lithuania, from 1992 to now, has already exceeded the total population of Alytus and is estimated to be about 83 thousand.
If requirements for a specific physical place of work and its security are clear, then a new Bermuda triangle chooses to work remotely - from home, public spaces or even other countries.
According to insurance specialists, although the Law on Safety and Health at Work provides for the establishment of health and safety conditions for workers who work at a distance from other employees of the company, the diversity of modern forms of work can lead to a number of questions, written in a press release.
In the event of an accident at home, the employer pays compensation for the first two days of unemployment, starting with 80%, and for the rest of the period - \"Sodra -\"
If it is found that the accident occurred during work - from the first day of incapacity for work - Sodra - compensates 100% of the wage.
When assessing statistics presented by the State Labour Inspectorate and the damage administered by BTA, it is obvious that the absolute majority of accidents and various injuries occur at work in the workplace.
Most often these are a range of physical activities where the risk of injury is higher: carelessly dealing with appliances or equipment, loss of concentration or co-ordination.
However, the offices where the majority of the experts who are most in demand, who are the best paid, are now faced with their own challenges that employers offer and the freedom of mobility enjoyed by their employees,\" says Jevgenia Krikščiūtė, Head of Human Resources Management Department of the BTA.
In the legal acts in force in Lithuania it is recommended to clearly regulate employee's duties and limits of liability, to define working time, place and functions, as well as to form work at a distance.
If this is done, it is easier to determine whether an accident occurred at work or not.
Situations and nuances are certainly different, each case being examined individually.
Workers are often heard about the fact that when you go to or out of work or when you go to working meetings for an accident, the employer is responsible.
However, there are really many nuances and reservations in this case, so I would encourage both the workers and employers to initiate conversations, to clarify and to the most clearly and to the most acceptable extent acceptable on both sides what situations are actually considered to be accidents at work and to which the status of domestic injuries will already have to be addressed by a specialist.
Mr Crikščiūtė states that, in these times, when computer and mobile phones and stable internet connections are often entirely sufficient for the performance of job functions, the worker will not necessarily work at the place indicated in the agreement and at the specified time.
Workers are mobile, they can choose to work today, not at home, but at coffee while enjoying the sun in a coffee or in a park.
It's gonna be a place of work or not?
What if the working hours already discussed are not in line with the agreement?
A specialist may say that there are really no obvious situations, the circumstances of which help to clarify the investigation being carried out, initiated by “Sodros” or “National Labour Inspectorate”.
According to her, in financial terms, the main difference between an accident at work and a household is the amount of the disability benefit.
Krikščiūtė admits that I had informally heard unpleasant experiences when employers tried to hide the real circumstances of accidents or injuries and tried to persuade workers to approach doctors outside of work, take responsibility for themselves, thus undermining the financial situation.
This is an unfair, disrespectful view of the employee and it should not be tolerated.
On the other hand, the mobility of people already mentioned encourages the search for additional instruments that could help businesses in similar situations: the employer's liability insurance for damage to workers, the acquisition of injury insurance, disability insurance and even death insurance, as well as health insurance - - says Mr Krikščiūtė.
Mobile Signature System Reacted

For Lithuanian regbio team - Polish lessons
The European Trophy – Division of Debiting Lithuanian Regbio collecters are so far difficult to level against higher levels of rivals.
“The Trophy – division on the Old continent is the third in its capacity after the Six Nations tournament and the European Championship.
There are 13-18 rating-based continental teams.
Lithuanians started the competition in October in a solid victory in Šiauliai 30:10 v Czech team.
Last weekend, the Lithuanian national resident was in Łódze, where 0:33 (0:12) was not equal to the Polish national.
Although Lithuanians fought for themselves, the rules were often violated in the battles, and Polish Regimen broke the ground with fine blows.
For a total of 3, 10, 27 and 37 minutes, the fine shocks were realized by Wojciech Piotrowiczius, who gave a weight of 12 points.
In the first chair 10 minutes, Lithuanians had to play without a yellow card from Tautvydas minor.
In the second row, guests have organised several attacks, but they have not been able to complete them effectively.
At that time, the Poles succeeded in breaking the defence of our fellows.
Mateusz Plichta executed the ball in the recording area, and then - Kriystian Pogorzelskis and Mateusz Adamskis.
In addition to the Lithuanian team coach played by several key players, the Par Ntando Manyosha recognised the advantage of competitors and claimed that such a game had provided a great deal of valuable experience.
“The Poles played very well and were interested in all the components of the game.
Our goal was to keep this game as long as possible.
We've just got up to this higher level and we have to get to know it.
We won the first match against the Czechs, but now we met very powerful rivals and had to recognise their advantage.
The Polish team provided us with useful lessons - said a specialist from the PAR who has been standing next to the Lithuanian team for four years.
The next game “Trophy“ will be played in two Lithuanians on April 6, 2019 at home with Portuguese or Romanians.
The Dutch and Swiss teams competed in this division.

Japanese Coast Guard actively looking for missing islands
Esanbe Hanakita Kojima - this name was given in 2014 to a very small island in the north of Japan.
A small, meaningless and unvalued island, which was essentially inappropriate for life, was very important for Japan.
So important, that the territory that is now gone to it is intensely rehearsal - maybe it will still be?
Why does Japan need this island?
It's not getting any trouble.
It is likely that ice and underwater landslides once and for all, even though it was nearly 200 feet [2 m] above the surface of the water.
It is almost certain that the island simply broke, but at least its traces are expected to be found.
When the island disappeared nobody knew exactly - it was so useless that no one was afraid of it.
Probably the first to learn about the disappearance of Esanbe Hanakita Kojima was Japanese fishermen who sometimes used the island as an auxiliary visual navigation aid.
It is not a tragedy even for these fishermen, as there are better ways to catch where they can fish, and where Russian waters start to argue.
That is what Esanbe Hanakita Kojima meant.
This narrow strip of the earth was the western edge of the Curel Island.
This island chain, which Russia calls as Kuri Islands, and Japan as Northern Territories.
The conflict has continued since the mid - 19th century, but the full - force force has gone into the 20th century.
There are natural resources in these areas, but also in historical terms Japan believes that the islands should belong to it.
The fact is that the Japanese have been studying these islands since the mid - 17th century.
They first made a map, took a more detailed study, recording a large number of small halls.
The agreements signed between Japan and Russia in 1855 indicated that the latter was Sachalin and Japan was the whole of the Cureles.
Thus, these two countries survived until 1905 when Russia’s Imperiya ward Sachsen lost to Japan.
In 1945 the Soviet Union used the situation in Japan and opened the Courilla Islands.
Japan, by the way, does not mean major claims on the whole of the island, even though it was the first, but would like to have four islands - the Italian, the Cunish Islands, the Chikotan Islands and the Chabomai.
Japan feels that it has a historical right, since the islands were the first to examine and Japan was also party to the 1855 agreements.
In 2009, Japan offered Russia the four islands to share equally, but Russia did not even consider accepting such a proposal.
Japan is quite close to the northern territories, but now the missing island has lost this geographical link.
That physical marker about Japan's presence in those waters disappeared.
It is a great loss, which is why the island remains to be searched for.
However, even if they are found by Esanbe Hanakita Kojima does not meet the simple definition of the island - it must be drought.
This means a slight decline in the territory of Japan and a significant decline in the Exclusive Economic Zone, calculated from the shores.
It is just interesting what the island search mission expects - because it will not really be lost or taken away.
Unbelievable drama in the double of Lithuanian and Polish boxing sets
For more than a week, we had to wait for the final judgment of judges who became the winners of a cross-border meeting between Lithuanian and Polish boxing teams.
Nine Polish and Lithuanian fighters were held in Poland.
The four eyeatian won the Lithuanians, the same - and Poles.
On the other hand, the decisive end of the battle was the result of long-standing discussions by the Chamber of Judges and the final decision of the meeting secretariat.
The election meeting started with the victory of Lithuanian boxers.
Multiple Lithuanian champion Marius Vyšniauskas (weight category up to 52 kg) won Jacube Surma with a sure 3:0 victory, soon after a hardening battle, Edgar Skurdelis (up to 60 kg) won Radomir Obrushniak.
Then followed two victories: Damian Durkaz (up to 64 kg) 3:0 defeated Manta Dozin and Philip Wachala (up to 69 kg) 2:1 beyond Simon Bani.
Vytautas Balsys (up to 75 kg) restored the victory to the Lithuanian national team.
Lithuanian 2:1 defeated Bartosz Golebiewsky.
In the next battle Piotra Szczukowski (up to 81 kg) in the third round, a clear victory over Eiger Kasmotai was over, and the result again became equal to 3:3.
The brothers, James, followed in different ways.
Robert Jokulys (up to 91 kg) 3 0 won Andrzej Colton, and Arvydas Jokulys (over 91 kg) had already at the first round recognised Adam Kulik’s advantage.
The fight against Tado Tamašausko (up to 91 kg) and Michalo Soczynski was the main cause of the debate.
It was its cross-border meeting that took more than a week to deliver the final result.
One judge gave a victory to the Polish, two judges to the Lithuanian, but due to a technical error, the point of one judge was taken into account by Mr Soczynski.
After a long time of dispute, the Polish boxer has been left behind - 2:1.
At the meeting of Lithuanian and Polish national teams, the winners won the result 10:8 (two points are appointed for victory).
They managed to renovate the Lithuanians for the last tributary defeat suffered by each other.
In 2015 at a meeting held in Marijampolė, Lithuanian boxers won five of six fights and won the result of the victory 10:2.
The leaders of the Lithuanian team meeting in Poland was a general rehearsal before the Lithuanian boxing championship in Šilutė on 14-17 November.
After the country's priorities a new Lithuanian boxing team will be formed, which will defend the honor of the country in the World and European Championships to be held next year.
How does the dog determine, by trace, the direction in which the man went?
You already know that a dog’s berry is extremely sensitive.
They can smell hidden explosives, drugs, blood, and other animals, and some even recognise diseases by smell.
Dog trackers well known in movies, but their work is much harder than you thought.
How do they determine the direction in which the owner of traces went?
In fact, this question is much more complex than you think.
The tracer tracking consists of three stages - detection, direction determination and tracking.
The second stage is much more severe than the other two, because, upon the end of the trace, it is difficult to decide which direction a person took.
After all, there is not a second between the different steps, so their smell does not differ greatly, is it?
Not exactly.
In 1990, a study by Oslo University, published in Oslo, described the experiments, during which the dog was at a 90 - degree angle to the human trajectory.
Tests are carried out on grass and asphalt.
And in many cases, dogs easily set the direction of human movement, even when he tried to mislead them by passing through the vice versa.
Can you imagine the complexity of this task?
The difference between the smell of the adjacent traces is very small and, in time, it decreases even further.
However, scientists say that it is not so strange that dogs could say which part of their foot touched the earth first.
This is because their uliple is an incredible tool.
The dog's brain is dominated by ossian areas (as our brain is dominated by regions responsible for vision).
Dog nose has 125-300 million smell receptors.
In general, dog ooze is at least 40 times more sensitive than humans, but even more important is their ability to interpret different smells.
Researchers then carried out similar experiments and traces left by their bicycles, but it was much more difficult for dogs to follow their direction.
This is due to the fact that the bicycle cancer is not segmented as traces of a person, so it is more difficult to isolate different sites for comparison – it is not natural for dogs, so it takes more time.
True, dogs are not owners of the strongest ulip one.
This title is likely to go to the bears.
The white bear males follow a few miles [100 km] of preparation for their puppets, while the brown bear smells a pasteurised animal even 30 km away.
In private forests promise to regulate crossings
The Minister of Environment Kęstutis Navickas will explain the deforestation at the Seimas on Tuesday.
At the end of August, there was public displeasure about the forests that are being crossed in the Labanora Regional Park.
The felling of these forests has been suspended for a month.
The Minister has acknowledged that research into gangs in Labanore has shown that no serious violations have been committed.
However, the Ministry of Environment has already introduced restrictions on part of the work group's proposal to tighten down the deforestation in state-owned forests.
The Minister promises that other legislation to correct deforestation will be prepared by the end of the year.
The same limits as are imposed on felling in state forests, as well as on private forest holdings.
Agnė Jagelavičiūtė revealed strategy, how he formed 170 thousand followers
You need to give people what they want and share what they want with you on the LRT TV “Culturally With Nomeda, ” says Agnė Jagelavičiūtė.
According to the stylists, she gradually built a huge crowd of fans.
“In the beginning, you hug a man’s taste, you draw to yourself, and in time, in time, the taste is improved, ” says A. Jagelavičiūtė.
Jagelavičiūtė has over 170,000 followers in her feisbuk’s account – it has reached a certain number by means of a strategy: “In the first place, it uses the human taste, its pace, and, in time, the taste is improved.
Stylist Jagelavičiūtė claims that the uncertainty does not go beyond, so shows her face as it is - authenticity and the ability to find the best way of presentation are the most important criteria of popularity in social networks.
She notes that human culture is no longer in the social media, because many boardings are coming to them in order to be angry with someone else or to read the comments of other dissenting people: “For example, there was a time in my teen years when I wanted to break up with everyone, and I don’t have the desire to do so anymore.
“Incredible life is the worst thing.
And there's a lot of this on social networks.
In Feisbuk, far less than the instagram, - it is spoken.
A. Jagelavičiūtė, who holds the education of interior design and painting, says that she sends a specific message to social networks - a message about women's emancipation.
It also promotes magazine production and sees creatives in its work.
“I can’t claim that the fashion magazine is an expression of pure art, but I know that there is a lot of it there.
I believe that there is a lot of creativity in my work, as is vanity.
It's my key to those huge numbers.
I don't want to create a false life.
It is much better to give people what they want, and to quietly stick to what they want to do – to the faith of A. Jagelavičiūtė.
One of the most difficult events to attract young people is classical music concerts.
Their popularity was enhanced by known people in life - style stories, such as backstages, failures, and life - style events, thus remaining authentic.
It is such a strategy that Mr Jagelevičūtė proposes to apply to all culture.
According to her, she has no cultural opportunities, no entertainment and no real values.
“How is a bored teacher against students – is there a chance?
If we do not find a certain way of presenting that art, advertise it without advertising, you will still find nothing.
When we're real, we're gonna catch the reader -- maybe something's gonna change.
One time, the other, the third - and already the addiction - it shares the insights.
Three people disappeared after the helicopter Lituya in the Gulf north of June
On Saturday, after the helicopter crash to the north of June, three people were searched in Alaska.
One man was saved after the Friday disaster and the other three could not be found.
The helicopter crashed near the Gulf of Lithuania, northwest of June.
According to Airbus H125, it was a long journey to Grand Prery-Texas.
Aircraft scraps were detected at 100 ft from the coast on Friday.
According to the Associated Press, one rescued person was 14 years old.
It was reported to have experienced mild hypothermia, but there were no other problems.
Two adults and two adolescents were on the fall helicopter.
According to KTVA, David King (53), Josh Pepperrd (42) and Andrew Pepper (11) disappeared.
Senior Pepperer was identified as the director of Davis Constructions & Engines, an Alaskan construction company.
I don't know what the accident was about.
The National Transport Security Council stated that an investigation had been initiated.
“I will break up a helicopter that was completely new – just received from the factory, flying two adults and two adolescents – according to a report from coast guard officers, based on the CPC.
The pilot was identified as having 40 years of experience in the operation of fixed wing aircraft and helicopters, including flights in Alaska.
“Anchorage Daily News, a family friend, Jeff Broadsky said that the loved ones “have not yet lost hope of a miracle to happen...

“I have suffered sexual violence ”
On Sunday morning, the president's adviser, Kellyanne'a Conway, revealed the experience of sexual violence.
Conway commented on the fierce disputes between Judge Bretto Kavanaugh, who is applying for the Supreme Court, and Dr Christine Blasey Ford, his accused.
Conway was thrilled to discover that he was a victim of sexual violence and to defend B. Kavanaugh against his predecessor Jake Tapper, claiming that the judge was accused of sexual violence by ignoring the facts that were unfavorable.
“I feel very much the victims of sexual violence and violence.
I’ve experienced sexual coercion – – Conway said on CNN Sunday release at the State of the Union
“I am a victim of sexual violence and do not think that Judge Kavanaugh, Take Tapper, Jeff Flake or anyone else is responsible for this.
We ourselves should be responsible for our actions
Conway claimed that the news network should be ashamed of comparing Kavanaugh with Bill Cosby, who last week was sentenced to prison in Pennsylvania for between three and ten years.
Conway also criticised the Senate Court Committee because it was unable to remove former President Bill Clinton, who engaged in oral sex in his office and lied to US people.
The survey showed that the demonstrations of Kavanaugh and Ford shared U.S. society
The Americans disagreed with the demonstrations by Brett Kavanaugh and his accused Christine Blasey Ford, who claims the judge was sexually attacking her when they were teenagers.
Thought that Ford or Kavanaugh lied, the number almost coincides: 38 percent of those surveyed say that Kavanaugh was likely or undoubtedly lied to give evidence, while 30 percent said the same about Ford.
The senate court committee heard both parties when Ford sent a letter to senator Dianne Feinstein with detailed accusations to the judge.
When the letter was published, and Ford, and Kavanaugh said that they were ready to speak against the committee.
At the beginning of the 9th century, Ford said to be 100 percent real, she was trying to attack Kavanaugh at the party.
In 51 C.E., a woman felt a civil duty and could not be silent.
“I’m really scared, ” she said.
“I’m here because I think it’s my civic duty to tell me what happened when Brett Kavanaugh and I went to high school ”
Kavanaugh, who denied sexual abuse against Ford and two other women, said that “there was nothing sexually attacking at high school, college, or ever later ”
“All of us tried to find someone who would prevent voting for my nomination, no matter how unrealistic or disgusting it is,” he said.
“It’s the simplest laughing last minute ”
On 27 and 28 September, the results of a survey conducted by YouGov, which surveyed 2607 people, were not surprising: the people who felt about different parties were divided: the democratic supporters believe in Ford (73 per cent), and the Republican Kavanaugh (74 per cent), although more Republicans believed in Ford's statements than the Kavanaugh – the Democrats (14 per cent, compared with 11 per cent).
Founder of Body Worlds, called Doctor Death, wants to be cut and displayed at his own exhibition
A German scientist who invented the plasticization wants to become an eternal part of his Body Worlds.
Guntheris von Hagens has developed an innovative method that enables to demonstrate the bodies, bodies and bodies at the world-wide exhibition, which has received both admiration and controversial assessments.
In 73 C.E., a cancer - suffering husband instructed his wife to plasticize him after death to become a permanent exhibition at “Body Worlds, ” which will be opened in London this week.
“In a sense, it will be the completion of his life.
Now I understand that I will have to do this, because I will express my recognition and love in this way – Angelina Whalley said to the newspaper The Observer
She said that her husband gave strong instructions on what to do with his body, and the whole process would take about a year.
Muscles, nerves and arteries must be wrapped out and silicone should be injected into the body and placed in the right position.
“ He told me: “Angelina, may freeze me to – 25 degrees Celsius for a year, but then you will have to add your hands, or else I will freeze ”
So I'm going to be able to be grievous for years, and then I'll have to do it.
Then, in the best case, he will join the exhibition at the London Pavilion near other bodies that are stagnant in the times of steep postures, such as riding a horse or playing cards.
Won Hagens became famous in the United Kingdom for having performed a traffic on British television directly (this was the first public broadcast in 170 years).
“Body Worlds has seen over 47 million people around the world since 1995.
“Body Worlds London, founder Peter Tabernalis told the Guardian that 100% of the exhibitions, covering about 28,000 square feet, were presented by exhibitors who had given their consent, because they wanted to help the living, light them, and help them to see possible problems ”
“We read and read so much that we were afraid of death.
None of us will avoid it, death is common to all of us, and I think “Body Worlds” shows that we should not be afraid ” – Tabernalis said.
Ronald's lawyers are threatening a court action against the rape of charges
Portuguese football stars, Cristian Ronaldo, told the lawyers on Friday that the German magazine that published “an obviously unlawful form of claims that Ronaldo had raped her in 2009 would bring her to justice.
One lawyer, Christian Schertz, stated that the article in the magazine “Der Spiegel ” was “an unacceptable statement of private accusations, and that it will seek to remunerate the magazine’s client by legal means.
The application was sent to the Reuters, the representing company of Ronaldo, in response to a request to comment on the article ‘Der Spiegel’ published on Friday.
‘Gestifate’ did not answer specific questions about the content of the statement of ‘Der Spiegel’, which ‘Reuters’ could not verify on its own.
‘Der Spiegel’, first declared the accusation in April 2017.
One of the most popular athletes in the world, Ronaldo five times earned the title of the best player in the world.
This summer he went to Italy to Juventus, from Real Madrid, the Italian Club refused to comment on Der Spiegel.

However, Stovallas said to Der Spiegel that he had lodged a civil complaint in order to cancel the confidentiality agreement.
Mayorga’s “Der Spiegel ” magazine said that she felt that the contract was no longer binding because she felt the consequences of the nine - year - old night.

Sustainable business to ensure the independence of creators
Are you ready to try “Self-Publishing 3.0-1?
The new White Paper published today by the Union of Independent Creators on the site#selfpub 3.0-8 explains for the first time how to join other business creators, become independent and start a sustainable creative business.
Founder of the Union of Independent Creators Orna Ross, who has not been recognized for the first time in the publication of one of the 100 most influential people, will explain at the conference \"Digital Book World 2018\" why the creators should allow \"Self-Publishing 3.0-1 methods.
Development trends such as increasing personal brands, responsible use and mobile phone reading, together with digital publishing technology create the most favourable conditions for creators’ businesses – says Ross.
However, these opportunities can only be used by independent and creative thinkers who understand the value of intellectual property.
‘#selfpub3.0’ encourages developers to create several sealed biosources through websites that create the conditions for successful publishing and media.
It is possible to earn from direct sales, subscription models, concentrated aid, broad distribution models and other sources of income such as online training and the related entity’s activities.
“#selfpub 3.0” also encourages the distribution of books in a wide range of formats to the broadest possible audience through retailers and other services.
The main objective of#elfpub3.0 is to encourage change of mind and learn to manage your creative business so that intellectual property, which is the most important creative property, is not deliberately transferred to another enterprise, such as a specialised publishing house or an independent publishing service provider.
According to Ross, this is how creators can increase their income, influence and impact, and these methods must be interested not only in every creator of the digital age, but also in publishers; it also stressed that the real independence of creators, like other people, is guaranteed by commercial and creative freedom.
The future is here.
And its prospects for independent creators are now the best.
The book \"Self-Publishing 1.0\" describes computer publishing and printing based on request.
“Self-Publishing 2.0 – The topic is the sale of e-book readers and telephone books in online book shops.
Now the new Self-Publishing 3.0-era, where independent publishers will be trained to start up promising and sustainable business.
The Union of Independent Creators is the only worldwide non-profit organisation that brings together writers who produce independent books.
The Union's objective is to develop the skills of independent publishers, promote ethical activities, help beginners sell books and encourage developers to carry out a sustainable digital business that will ensure their independence.
The Presidents of the Party and the Central Bank warned the Italian Government of their planned deficit
Following the plans of the populist government to significantly increase deficit expenditure in the following year, the Italian President and the head of the Central Bank of Italy on Saturday warned that the country's debt should be managed.
On Thursday evening, the Management Parties (the opposition of the Five-Star Movement and the North-right League) submitted a deficit proposal for 2019 at a deficit of 2.4% of gross domestic product (GDP) and three times above the objective of the previous administration.
This report on Friday confused the market and led to the sale of bonds and struck the banks' shares.
Moreover, such plans are not harmonised with the European Union, applying and supervising EU fiscal rules.
Addressing the audience in the Presidential Palace, which mentions 70th anniversary of the Constitution, President Sergio Mattarella mentioned that according to national framework laws, “the budget must be balanced and the debt must be managed.
“Let’s protect our citizens’ savings,” he said.
A little later, at a conference in central Italy, the President of the Italian Bank, Ignazio Visco, said that it is no longer possible to further increase the country's debt, which is the largest of all the major economies of the European Union and represents 131 percent of GDP.
\"Italy must give priority to public and private investments and manage and reduce public debt\" said Visco, according to the State Knowledge Agency
‘The school must be progressively reduced’
The head of the Northern League and Deputy Prime Minister Matte Salvinis replied to the words of Mattarella that the debt increased due to the year of Brussels's strict demands.
“Still, Mr. President,” said Salvinis in his statement.
“The public debt has grown up due to the European budget imposed for the year. Finally, we change our plans and aim for a better future and growth”
Earlier, before Mattarella or Visco spoke, Commander of the Five Star Movement Luigi Di Maio said that the money that had been stolen before would be returned from the budget to the people, but added that the government was not trying to oppose the EU or the financial markets.
The ruling party pressed on the support of Giovannis Trina, non-group economy minister, to support their planned deficit expenditure.
The Italian media stated that Mattarella supported the Tria's failure to maintain a budget deficit that would not reach 2 percent of GDP.
The Presidents of the Party and the Central Bank shall have no direct influence on economic policy.
The President of the 77th century can reject the law and return it to Parliament, but only once.
Parliament can then reinstate the unchanged law and legitimise it.
Official information: Indonesian tsunami sensors released a huge wave
The Indonesian geophysical agency withdrew its warning of the tsunami 34 minutes after its release, and then there was a severe earthquake, sending huge waves toward the northeast coast of the Sulawesian island, where hundreds of people died and thousands were left without their homes.
The cars are due to the tsunami of Palu, Indonesia, 29 September 2018.
At least 384 people died during the Trolley and Tsunami of 7.5 points, which hit about 1 500 km (940 miles) from the Palu city in Jakarta.
The officials said on Sunday that the number of victims would likely increase.
On Friday, many people gathered to the festival on the beach in Palu, where many deadly waves of height of six feet (18 feet) were hit.
The Geophysical Agency BMKG received Saturday criticism in social media: many people were wondering whether a warning regarding tsunami was withdrawn too early.
The Agency stated that it had carried out the standard procedure and decided to withdraw the warning according to the data of the nearest flood sensor about 200 km (125 miles) from Palu.
‘We do not have surveillance data from Palau.
Therefore, we had to make a decision based on the data that we had,\" said Rahmatas Triyon, Head of the BMC Centre of earthquakes and tsunamis.
The nearest wave counter, which saw a change in sea level, found only, according to him, “a marginal wave of six inches (2.5 inch) and did not observe huge waves at Pala.
“If we had a wave counter near Palau or got data from there, of course, the situation would be better.
We have to think about this in the future – – said Triyon.
According to officials, the tsunami struck Palau and the surrounding areas at a great speed – hundreds of kilometres per hour, but it is not clear whether it occurred before or after the notice was withdrawn.
The residents check the Livonons on the street in search of their family members after the tsunami in Palu, Indonesia, 29 September 2018.
“On the basis of the videos distributed to the social media, we believe that the tsunami took place before the formal cancellation of the warning,” said Triyon.
The worst damage was the 9,5 - point earthquake on the second Christmas day of 2004, causing an enormous tsunami killing some 226 000 people on the Indian Ocean, including 126 000 victims in Indonesia.
The picturesque city of Palu, home to 380 000 people, is near the narrow bay mouth of the island of Sulawesi in the northeast.
According to the Indonesian National Disaster Reduction Agency (BNPB), tsunamis destroyed the city in 1927 and 1968.
According to Baptiste Gomberbert, a geophysical researcher at Oxford University, the earthquake should not have caused a tsunami.
Friday earthquake was caused by a horizontal break – adjacent tectonic plates moved horizontally, not vertically as usual for tsunamis.
“It is believed that there had been a landslide, causing plenty of water and a tsunami in the sea, ” he said, adding that the wave force on the shore could have concentrated in a narrow bay.
The spokesperson of the disaster relief agency Supo Purwo Nugroho told the correspondents that his team “shall be ready to send easily understandable public warnings – when a warning about the tsunami was suddenly withdrawn.
According to the Ministry of Transport, text messages with warnings were repeatedly sent to the inhabitants, but Nugroho said that due to the earthquake, the power and communications lines were cut off and there were no Sirenes along the coast.
The Indians in the social media questioned whether the BMKG had to revoke the tsunami alert and were blaming that the information had not been provided on time.
“I’m disappointed... The warning was cancelled... And the tsunami was still...” – “Twitter” sent a direct message to @zanogucky to the BMKG.
Golf: duet-Mollywood – is going to beat the ticket sales record
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who won the fourth match on Saturday, became the first two out of Europe to win all four pair matchups, and will likely be recorded in history because representing Europe is already leading the 10:6 v Ryder Cup final.
Having won the result of Tiger Woods and Bryson Dechambeu at 5:4, they became the first European couple who won all four wallets.
Only the Americans Larry Nelson and Lanny Wadkins managed to do this in 1979.
The threefold results – 3:1, 5:4, 4:3 and 5:4 – show not everything.
A couple of times won the 14 important titles Woods and won twice against Patrick Reed.
They also won a victory against Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, the U.S. team this week, winning another three competitions.
Molinaris and Fleetwood will have the opportunity to become the first Europeans winning five points out of five potential.
Fleetwood has already earned most of the points in the Ryder Cup matches as a newcomer for Europeans.
The couple, which a large group of young fans called “Mollywood”, did not seem to be able to lead the European team at first glance.
Newcomers from the Ryder Cup, such as Fleetwood, are not expecting such a performance, and Molinari won none of the previous six matches and landed for the rivals in four.
But there was hope: Fleetwood last year was the first in Europe, knowing “Le Golf National ” as his five fingers, and here in 2017 won the French Open – tournament and demonstrated decisive temperament during this year’s “U.S. Open ”
Molinari is a new British Open champion and is regarded by many as the most consistent gamer of the European tournament, a useful feature of the square where tall grass can lead to destruction, as the Americans have demonstrated.
These gameplay features and harmonious game in the square made them insurmountable.
“Now I feel a little sensitive and just a Saturday, ” said Fleetwood, a proud Fleetwood who played all weekend with a wide smile in his face.
This afternoon we turned out well, played stable and good.
If we sign up to history together, it will be a special achievement.
I'm just glad we tried the team...
The Molinaris also rejoiced.
“It was great playing with Tommy,” he said.
“We have to do our job, not just go to record books, so we have to fight hard tomorrow because of the 4.5th point we need to win; it will not be easy to get there. ”
Ritter hot!

The two-fighter swords during the Middle Age Fight Festival in Claregalway Castle in Golvey, Ireland, 29 September 2018.
The fully restored Anglonorman House with the tower yard is turned into a medieval battlefield, where many enthusiasts from all corners of the world restored to its trifles contact battles and games that were popular centuries ago.
On September 29, 2018, Dornan and the ferry fighting suit wear Donna Dornan patrol the Claregalway Castle in the Great Art at the Middle Age Fight Festival in Golvey, Ireland.
“It’s a great weekend and something unusual – – said Denise Fitzgerald of Kerry’s county, who had become a tavern host of taverns for the weekend.
“We have thus returned to the simplest things.
I'm trying to do the right thing,\" said a theatre worker who first took part in an armed fight festival.
Officially armored fighters played out, and while their swords were besieged, some helmets were folded, and one wounded the lip.
The riders demonstrated their skills by riding and cutting cabbage and eggplants in half.
Clothes metal castings bitch guns, spices merchants prepared medication, while the craftsman weeped and painted wool.
Those who are seriously inclined, and those who are beautiful, have tried to get involved in roles.
“I think anyone can wear a suit, but it’s an art of empathy,” said Helena Rockpool, who played Eleanor Fitzgerald and had a unique opportunity to use his fashion design knowledge.
“All suits are handwritten.
I have already been wearing my belt for two years, and now I have a dress and a hand of 800 pearls on it alone.
It's important to me,\" she said.

FBI turned to the second woman who accused of the candidate Kavanaugh
FBI agents investigating the case of a candidate for the Supreme Court of the United States of America in Bretts Kavanaugh appealed to a second woman who accused him of sexual assault – this was revealed on Sunday by the woman's lawyer.
According to a report by John Clune, Advocate of Deborah Ramirez, the investigation of the Kavanaugh case by the FTB will include not only separate accusations of rape by Dr. Christine'a Blasey Ford, the Conservatory Conservator of the Federal Court of Appeal, at this week's dramatic session by the Senate.
Ramirez accused Kavanaugh of showing her her his penis at the party where she was drunk, and which was held at the University of Yale when they both studied there.
U.S. President Donald Trump put pressure on the moderate Senate republics and ordered the FBI to carry out a study after a Thursday session of the Senate, where Professor Ford of the University of California had made detailed accusations that Kavanaugh tried to rape her at the party in 1982, when they both studied at school and were teenagers.
“NBC News ” reported on Saturday that the White House limited the scope of the FBI study.
The short message was denied and said: “I really want all the people I need to be questioned at my discretion.
Raja Shahas, representative of the White House, said that the Senate has determined the extent and duration of the FBI investigation (the investigation must be completed within a week).
“The White House allows agents to do what they have been trained ” said Shah.

Europe recovered the ‘Ryder’ cups in unit competitions
Francesco Molinari, on Sunday, deserved fame by returning the “Ryder ” cup to Europe: Italians defeated Phil Mickelson at the 16th well and earned the necessary 10,5th result.
Mickelson put the first ball in the water at the room, and Molinari, who was able to survive, became the first European to win all five matches a week, even though none of the previous six had won.
The European victory has already been ensured that the Italians launched a blow from the starting ground and the continent's victory lacked one point, while Henrikas Stansons and Sergio Garcia's predecessor mače had hit at least half of the point.
At the beginning of the day, they had the first result of 10:6 and had to earn four and a half points from the possible 12 to be able to recover the trophy and to consolidate their sovereignty at home, which has continued since 1993.
Before that, the team only twice succeeded in overcoming the four-point difference and winning the unit matches: the U.S. team in Brooklyn in 1999 and Europe in 2012 “Medina wonders” competitions, but no one expected yet another striking return.
Justinas Thomas, Webb Simpson and Tony Finau gave Jim Furyko a chance to win the first match, but then the European team's points went over the square.
Thorbjorn Olesen defeated Jordan Spieth, and his teammate newcomer Jonas Rahms – Tiger Woods: 14 important titles earned a sportsman four times out of four.
The best player of the Ryder Cup, recognised by Ian Poulter, received probably the most wins this week, when the world's best player Dustin Johnson landed on his 18th rollground and brought Europe closer to the victory.
Then it was only necessary to wait for the match to end first, and it was Molinari's game, which caused a wave of joy in the crowd, which was the biggest in the history of the event.
“RT World News“: German police who protect Erdogan used the neonocio name as a code name
According to the local media, secret officials in eastern Germany, who kept Turkish President Erdogan this week during his visit to Berlin, used the name of the sadly famous neo - Nazi extremists.
The Ministry of Home Affairs of the region claimed that the criminal police in Saxony, East Germany, are investigating two members of the elite anti-terror group, SEK.
The men were meant to keep Turkish President Rezez Tayyip Erdogan on his long-awaited journey to Germany.
Officials were required to work in secret and were obliged to use a code name according to the protocol.
They chose the Uwe Boehnhardt, a disloyally famous neo-nonacoce belonging to the Group of National Socio-Socialists (NSU), who killed eight immigrants from Turkey, one Greek citizen and a German police officer at the beginning of this century.
The local media report that a strange code name was known when two policemen asked for permission to access the internal documents needed to fulfil the task.
The officers quickly cancelled the police.
The first criminal police commander in Saxony, Petrica Kleine, responded to the news.
He said that the decision to use the name of the Boehnhardt was “must have been the stupidest thing ” and so,“ the sacrifices and their loved ones were clearly ignored.
Roland Weller, Minister of the Interior of Saxony, agreed with this statement and called the decision a \"sshout, terrible and totally unacceptable\"
The Erdogan visit to Berlin on Friday caused many controversial assessments in Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel was criticised for accepting a leader accused of growing authoritarianism.
Merkel stated that this visit was very important, ‘since, in the event of disagreement, it has to be decided upon by meeting personally ...
The public first heard of NSU in 2011, when Boehnhardt and his associate Uwe Mundlos' bodies were found in a trailer house burned in eastern Germany.
One of them was believed to have killed another and then killed after failure of an attempt to rob the bank in the city of Eisenach.
A third member of the Neonic group was soon arrested and the rest of Beate'a Zsheepe lives.
In July of this year, the German court sentenced her to death for 10 accusations of murder.
She hated the murders, but her lawyer said that the accused felt morally guilty because she did not try to stop the murders.
After the NSU scandal, the German security agencies have been faced with many criticisms.
Lawyers, activists and relatives of the victims believe that the group had many more associates.
It also showed that BfV, a German internal intelligence agency, infiltrated a large number of informators into the NSU and constantly prevented the investigation of group-related murders, attempts to kill and robberies.
Muskas takes off the responsibilities of the head of “Tesla” and will have to pay a fine of $20 million to the Securities and Exchange Commission
Elona Muskas agreed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to sue him for Fraud Twitter, in which he claimed he would do “Tesla is a private company.
Muskas will have to withdraw from the position of head, but the Director General will remain.
The text of the Agreement states that Muskas must leave the office of Chair of the ‘Tesla’ Board of Directors within 45 days and will be prohibited from returning to this office for three years.
In addition, he will have to pay a fine of $20 million.
Everything started with Twitter – a message that was too careless or deliberately written misleading, so Muskas will have to obtain confirmation before someone said or posted about Twitter in any format, including, but not limited to, entries in social media (e.g. Twitter, company website, press releases and calls to investors).
“Tesla ” will have another $20 million due to the failure to check Musko’s initial Twitter messages.
In the complaint of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Muskas was accused of misleading investors on 7 August to Twitter, in which he claimed that he had found funds to do ‘Tesla’ a private company whose share would be worth $420 – the company’s securities were worth more than 10%.
Musk soon withdrew his words by saying that “Tesla ” would remain public and angered investors.
The Securities and Exchange Commission concluded that Musko’s initial statement was wrong and misleading because it had not taken into account the facts.
Muskas himself explained in the blog that this error could be justified: after the meeting with the representative of the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund, he had the impression that he had managed to agree on the funds.
It was reported that Muskas and the Securities and Exchange Commission had approached the lenient penalty – Muskas would have had to give up its President's position for only two years and should not be guilty, but Muskas refused this agreement on Thursday.
On Friday, ‘Tesla’, the price of the securities fell, which is probably why he changed his opinion and agreed to a tougher deal.
However, under the new arrangement, like the old one, Musku does not have to face the guilt of misleading investors.
Alexandrian patriarch committed himself to supporting the canonical church of Ukraine and urged orthodox to unite
Theodore II of Alexandria stated that it was based on the canon Church of Ukraine, which belongs to the Patriarchate of Moscow.
He argued in response to the separation between the Russian Orthodox Church and the Patriarchate of Constantinople.
Theodore arrived in the city of Odessa on Thursday II, in the south of Ukraine, and met the highest church representatives and believers orthodox.
The patriarch of Alexandria is one of the most respected orthodox hierarchys that descend only into the ecumenical patriarch of Constantinople.
“I came to tell you, don’t give up orthodox churches and canonical churches, ” said patriarch Theodore II.
Before visiting Odessa, he met the Polish orthodox church metropolis Saveva, which also supports the canonical church in Ukraine.
They also called for the prevention of conflicts arising from attempts to legitimise the autonomy of the Ukrainian church.
“ We will always support those seeking orthodox unity, ” said Theodore II.
The Orthodox Church has recently gone through a major crisis following the decision of the Constantinople Patriarchate to recognise the independence of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.
The latter belongs to the Russian Orthodox Church, also known as the Patriarchate of Moscow.
Constantinople decided to send the exarchies to Kiev, in breach of a rule prohibiting one orthodox church from interfering in another's affairs.
The Eczarchs are the special patriarch's formally higher position than the metropolis Onufray, who is the current head of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church in Moscow.
Moscow’s Patriarchate responded badly to the actions of Constantinople and cancelled all general church services and membership in organizations led or co-chaired by representatives of Constantinople.
It is claimed, however, that Konstantinople was warned by this judgment not to engage in other hostile acts and that it was not considered that the two churches had completely ceased the bonds.
From the three churches in Ukraine, other churches recognise only one church, owned by Moscow patriarchate of Ukraine.
Most Ukrainian clergy recognise her authority, but the government has always openly supported one of the secluded churches – Kiev patriarchate of Ukraine's orthodox church, which was born in the 1990s.
This religious movement even has a patriarchal head of Filart, who has announced that he is seeking the official recognition of the Orthodox Church, his complete independence and his equality with the Moscow patriarch.
Damascus opened for the first time in three years a major trading passer in Syria-Jordan
According to the State News Agency SAA, the Syrian Government has claimed that the crossing of the Nasib border which is adjacent to Jordan, has been closed for three years due to the war in this area.
This can be done because the fighters on the Syrian side left the lands near the city of Daraa.
The Nasiba is the most important trade interconnection not only between neighbouring countries, but also between Lebanon and the Gulf.
Key Thoughts From Lavrov’s UN Language
During his visit to the UN Minister for Foreign Affairs, Sergey Lavrov attacked the West for “political blackmail and brutal force ” and said that diplomacy should not give up to the dictatorship and unilateral sanctions.
Minister at the UN General Assembly on Friday, said that some Western countries are putting pressure on others in an attempt to maintain “their own position as world leaders.
He did not name countries, but he said that they were using \"political blackmail, economic pressure and brutal force.\"
The world must pay a high price for the selfish ambitions of a small group of countries.
Lavrov, who represented Russia in the UN for a decade, said at the meeting that the culture of diplomacy and negotiations is being replaced by dictatorships and unilateral sanctions applied without the UN approval.
Minister said that the sanctions imposed on a number of countries are “unlawful or ineffective ” and recalled the blockade which had been applied for many years in the United States to Cuba.
“But history has taught us nothing, ” Lavrov said, adding, “Artistants in the West tend to blame only if it is “very likely ”
We recall the fact that such unjustified accusations justified interference and wars, such as the 1999 bombings in Yugoslavia, the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the 2011 interference in Libya.
Of course, Lavrov did not mention all Western invasions and reminded us of the war in Syria of seven years as one of the most recent cases.
Unable to attempt the extremists to depress the Damascus regime could have been disastrous for the whole country and open up opportunities to settle for the terrorist kalfifate.
Lavrov commended Astana's peace process initiated jointly by Russia, Turkey and Iran, and argued that this process helped to prevent an Islamic State (IS, previously called ISIS) and other groups that wanted to attack the whole of Syria.
The most important thing now is to rebuild the war - ruined places in the country and help refugees return home safely.
Lavrov returned to the struggle of great forces and said that the UN was truly founded “after learning from World War II ”
The Russian Foreign Minister recalled that in 2018 80 years have come to pass since the 1938 Treaty of the Rooster - Munich Treaty, in which France and Great Britain agreed to allow the Nazis to annex the Germanly populated part of Czechoslovakia to calm Hitler.
Although the then British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain said that the Munich Treaty – bringing peace to these times – the war began a year later.
“München’s betrayal” shows how far the egoism of the parties and the disregard of international law can be led,” Lavrov said.
‘The dictatorship and collage of the colonial era must be put in the history archive or waste bin’
Moscow believes that constructive dialogue can solve all the problems of the world, says Lavrov.
“If you have questions or prejudices, sit down and talk, reveal the facts, listen to colleagues’ arguments and try to reconcile interests.

“RT World News”: Israel’s nuclear weapons are mistled, and Bibi’s finger falls to Iran
The Israeli Prime Minister, in a speech by the UN General Assembly, argued that Tehran had secret nuclear weapons.
It may be that Israel, who blames others, is hiding something himself.
“It was presented as the favorite Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made news on Thursday, showing photographs taken from high - ranking photographs containing places where Iran allegedly considers nuclear materials.
Tehran soon replied that Tel Aviv would rather take care of its ‘ programme of undeclared nuclear weapons’
Although Israel never admitted (but did not deny) nuclear weapons, RT journalist Murado Gazdiev tried to find out if Tel Aviv should actually search for a log in his eye.
Scottish Government: no complaints before January regarding Alex Salmondo
The Scottish Government claimed that no complaints had been made against Alex Salmon by January of this year.
The former minister had two accusations of sexual harassment in January, which he strongly denied.
He was informed of the investigation in March.
Salmon, who resigned from the Scottish National Party, would register with the Scottish Government for a complaint process against it.
In response to the claim that one complaint was first dealt with in 2013, the Scottish Government underlined that no complaints had been recorded by January.
The Scottish Government’s representative said: “The Scottish Government received two complaints in January regarding Alex Salmondo.
We could ignore them or hide them.
The former Deputy Minister of the Republic of Lithuania received no complaints about Alex Salmondo and, as we have already said, the first Minister heard about the investigation from Alex Salmondo in April 2018.
We are convinced of the legitimacy of our processes and will insist on our position.
The Scottish Government will try to obtain as much information as possible within the time available.
However, as we have already said, for legal reasons we cannot comment more on the situation of Mr Salmon:
Alex Salmondo's representative said: “We will not comment, because our petition against the permanent secretary is now under trial and we hope that a decision will be taken shortly.
We'll talk to the court.
Our aim is to prove that the Scottish Government's complaint procedure against Alexa is illegal

Glazg has regained the title of winners “Guinness Pro14” by earning additional points in the league and winning “Dragons – Scottstoun stadium, and Dave Rennie, a coach, does not hide satisfaction, but believes that the game could be more accurate.
After the unexpected defeat of the \"Southern Kings\" team in Port Elizabeth last Saturday, Rennie asked for a lot of changes in his team to work out and even though she was able to gather the right points to survive the A conference at the top, windy and rainy air-played match was certainly not smooth.
“I think tonight we were fighting well, playing on the right side of the square and our strategy was good.”
\"We have to play more precisely and have been able to take advantage of more opportunities.
The conditions were unfavourable.
We have created many opportunities and are happy about that.
We need to play more precisely, but 40 or 50 points earned today would not have been a good result.
We had to try.
We won additional points, but next week we have to do more to play at home with Zebre and next week with Saarcens in Europe

The disappointment lasted a long time: the left pillar, Olis Kebble, broke in the middle for the fourth minute, and Adam Hastings easily caught the drop.
“Dragon ” reduced the difference when Arwelas Robson received a fine, and safe put another player immediately after 20 minutes in sign, and the Welshs scored a point.
The match on the first half of the day was almost reached by the half hour: the Glasgian attackers consistently attacked the Dragons line, then the judge from South Africa Stuart Berry punished the Jews on the side of Hastings for 22 minutes.
“Warriors ” went to the fall, but lost the ball after a smooth transfer, because the left side of a few strokes had not been able to control the ball and it was passed on to the left.
The second test was carried out two minutes after the interval: Hastings beat the Dragons line and wisely passed the ball on to the released Lee Jones.
The ball was returned to Hastings in his position and the result halfway through the match became 12:6.
Glasgui the second half of the first minute was a great success: Lee Jones caught the ball of Alex Dunbart, while Hastings helped him.
However, Warriors, after failure, took the ball in the middle of the square just four minutes and Dragon, the center of Adam Warren took it away by the gate, earning points and later took it over by Josh Lewis after an open game with Robson.
“Warriors – soon returned to the lead position and at 54 minutes after the fourth test earned additional points when Huwas Jones ran right and Hastings failed to pass the ball (it was the third failure of the four tests).
The Glazgs maintained the convenient higher position and carried out the fifth test a few minutes later – Dunbar passed the ball after the fall with George Horne, and Hastings scored the points.
Keyble was announced as the best match player, but Rennie praised Hastings.
“They obviously prevented us from playing, but we opened up in the middle,” said the coach.
“He lacked a few meters, but he was skied and managed to distance it.
He's in good shape and trusting in himself

I'm glad we got the first points.
It wouldn’t have led to anything, but it was important for us to win the victory.
Rudden sent the ball to Patrick Brough in the middle of the second chair of the gate line, when Diamond Petravičius slowly kicked the ball over the goalkeeper Neil Parish.

Mr Trump and Mr Kim argued that they would pursue the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula, which they discussed at an unprecedented meeting in Singapore this year.

Cross of Svernelle for Shimonyte: all the decisions were made by the Party-Greek-
Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis says there was a lack of democracy in the conservative internal elections, and the party leadership actually appointed Ingrid Shimonytė as presidents.
‘The ‘democracy itself’, however, was a strange event, when the cream of the lot was mildly chosen and actively supported by a candidate.
Probably the second candidate had no chance of winning even theoreticals – - the journalists in the government said to Mr Skvernelis
“Conservatorys have appointed their candidate, and we congratulate them on this,” the Prime Minister added.
“The national Greens – delegated Prime Minister said that I. Šimonytė should be evaluated by voters who remembered her work in the government of Andrius Kubilius.
Mr Skvernelis does not comment yet on whether or not he will participate in the presidential elections.
Lithuanian Peasant Popular Union intends to approve its candidate next year.
Ramūnas Barbuskis, the leader of the reigning nations, called the conservative elections a failed experiment because of the inactivity of the parties.
“First of all, we need to welcome an experiment that has failed absolutely.
Only 55% of the party's members took part, and a total of only 20 thousand voters.
Knowing what money was needed to organise those elections, it is quite clear that this has not worked out – - the news portal delfi.lt said to Mr Carbuskis.

During the weekend of the internal elections, 79 percent of the conservative members and their supporters voted for Mr Šimonytė's candidacy.
Lithuanian salaries joking Estonians: one area can change everything
Baltic Salary Survey (Baltic Salary Survey) data from this year's Baltic States survey showed that wages increased mostly in Estonia.
Lithuania and Latvia have fallen short of their neighbours, according to the press release of the company.
“After listening to 850 companies and examining the changes in remuneration in the Baltic States, we can see that the monthly pre-tax salary increased by 81.8% of the employees in Lithuania this year, and on average increased by 7.7 percent, while the annual salary with accessories increased by 10.5 percent.
Latvia has slightly overturned us - there has been a slight increase in the annual remuneration, but, like Estonia, a smaller number of employees compared to our country - says Povilas Blusus, a representative of the company that organises the salary surveys and adds that, in the light of such wage growth trends, account should be taken also of the general economic indicators of the country that dictate them.
In Estonia, wages grew at the fastest rate
Although salaries in Latvia and Estonia were lower for the proportion of employees than in Lithuania, the increases were higher.
In Latvia, the annual wage increased by 71% of the employees of the companies surveyed, and reached a slightly higher rate than our country, by 11%.
This year, 73% of the employees in Estonia were paid and 13 percent on average.
Changes in employment also have a major impact on wage growth, as changing jobs can generate much higher wages than previous jobs.
For those who have not changed their jobs in Lithuania in recent years and did not lose their jobs, the annual salary has increased by 8.8% - here it is more common than other Baltic countries to pay the additions.
In neighbouring Latvia, the annual wage growth for such employees was only 3,6 percent.
Estonia remains the leader in the Baltic States not only as the average wage-generating new, but also long-term employees.
For those who have not changed their place of employment or their duties, the pay here was the fastest: 6% per month, and 9 percent per year, including annexes.
These trends are often dependent on, according to an employee of wage research, or share the country’s general economic indicators: inflation or GDP growth, their forecasts, its monetary policy, prevailing market mood.
For example, forecasts of the approaching economic downturn encourage more careful and less investment.
The dominant and fastest growing sectors of the country, such as information technology, construction, and pharmaceuticals, may also suffer from general statistics and take over smaller changes.
Latvians bear the greatest tax burden
In comparing wage growth, it is also important to take into account the different tax systems in these countries.
In Latvia employees pay the largest share of taxes depending on remuneration - as much as 31 or 34 percent, which may increase to 42.4% for more earners.
In Lithuania, for example, a stable 24 percent rate exists, so in the case of higher wage growth in Latvia, employees can obtain the same or even lower tangible gains than in Lithuania.
Estonia has a similar tax rate to 23,6 percent in Lithuania, so we can find the most favourable taxation of labour in the Baltic States.
IT - the most competitive salaries
According to a study carried out in all the Baltic States, the position of IT specialists remains among the best paid positions.
The opposite situation in retail trade is the market indexes for positions in this area, which means that employees earn less than the average market income.
Compared to the previous year, the fastest wage growth was made by engineering professionals holding higher positions, as well as risk management professionals.
This increase in remuneration this year did not go beyond certain IT positions - a significant part of the organisation's information for security professionals increased monthly salaries by up to 14 percent.
Meanwhile, wages remained almost unchanged in the retail sector.
However, some companies have successfully restructured their remuneration systems, leading to an annual bonus salary of around 2 per cent.
According to the remuneration specialists, there is a trend that wage growth dictates the need of the best specialists - system analysts continue to grow in the Baltic States.
Ariana Grande again suffers: the former fiancée continues to mock
After the divorce with Ariana Grande, Pete Davidson disgusts his pain by creating jokes about their relationship.
He took part in the Saturday Night Live, and he chose to make fun of how he was too quick to attack serious relationships.
The fans say that it's true that just three weeks ago Ariana and Pete cancelled their engagement, which took place just a few months later.
Pete has tried to create a scenario that mentions his failed relationships, but it will happen a little later on screens.
There's some rumors that humorist in his former relationship screams Aryan himself.
Such jokes are also painful to her and not to her heart.
At least this was the case with the foreign news portal, TMZ was told by secret sources.
White or brown: Which sugars are recommended by dietologist
White or brown?
Which sugars to choose?
During the survey in supermarkets it became apparent that although Lithuanians still have a traditional choice of white sugar, the fact that many people in the country refuse this Baltic death ingredient at all.
That the volume of brown sugar sales is growing, as is the case with the sales networks.
According to the “Maximos“ representative, brown sugar is becoming more and more popular and is being bought by the people of the country, even though conventional white sugar is still the top.
Organic sugar sales are also growing in specialised organic shops.
One of the most popular products there is coconut sugar.
According to the nutritionist Dalios Vaitkevičiūtė, the main difference is the price, and the harmful effects on health can be both.
“The red unrefined sugar is three times more expensive, but from a health point of view, it is harmful to the body when it is multiplied by the sugar that they consume,” said Mr Vaitkevičiūtė.
For those who cannot live without sugar, a dietist advises them to reduce their daily intake gradually.
If this is done - the benefits are total - will fall and undesired kilograms, improve and improve health.
A month’s consistent use of sugar will also help to eliminate it in its entirety.
“Every habit we form about a month’s time, so if we do such an experiment, let’s say, a month’s time to drink a sugar-free product - coffee or tea, we’ll see how this works, and I think that everyone can give up a little bit of hard work,” said an idetologist for advice on how to give up sugar.
Doctors claim that white blood sugar has been described for no reason - abuse of sweets can be a cause of obesity, diabetes, cancer and other diseases.
It is therefore appropriate to try to reduce its consumption, especially as many foods, including bread, are added in addition.
One more “Lietkavel” – step: Lipkevičius borrows the other unit of LKL
The team of Panevezys-Lietkabel - said goodbye to Vytenis Lipkevicius - the attacker is borrowing Prienai-Skycop - crews.

The 41 Latvians played in the 2005-2006 season Vilnius-Lithuania in the morning – and in 2014-2017 worked as a senior coach assistant in this club's system.
In the last season, S.Buškevica trained a team of Jēkabpils-Jekbpils.
Sports director Jonas Vainaauskas invited Stepon Babauskas to the room, but he is still going to continue the basketball player's career.
The invitation was also received by Vytenis Jasikevičius, but no agreement was reached between the two sides.

Latvis will join “Lietkabel” on Tuesday and will “Cido” on the Arena during the FIBA Champions League match with Dijon JDA, but we will not see it on the bench as registration expired 24 hours before the start of the match.
Biofuel price cuts will not like everyone
In 2019, in order to reduce biofuel prices, more leaf trees will be crossed in Lithuania, says the Minister of the Environment.
According to Kęstutis Navicko, the idea is to influence the prices of biofuels.
\"We have a large stock of certain species.
Need to balance (...).
The concentration of soft foxes is there, because we can also have some effect on biofuel prices - on Tuesday, Mr Navickas said, presenting the situation of deforestation.
According to Mr Navicko, this year, the price of wood in Lithuania has risen by about 20 percent.
According to the Minister, next year the pines will be cut as much as this year and the spruce will be cut to about 80 hectares less.
According to him, wood is cut off more in Lithuania because of the favourable natural conditions.
\"It shouldn't be next year,\" said Mr Navick.
Now 10.2 million ha of forests are state-owned and 800 thousand ha are private.
The fight against food prices is a questionable obligation: it will only encourage purchasing in its own area
Among the measures proposed by the Ministry of Economy, the proposed obligation to purchase 50% of food products from local producers is published news portal 15min.lt.
‘The law would apply not only to small-scale traders operating in the regions, but also to other suppliers of goods and services.
For example, printing services or office supplies to the buyer in municipalities could also be supplied by local companies that won tenders – Minister of Economy Virginijus Sinkevičius said to the portal.
Egidijus Mockevicius, president of the meat processors association, has no doubt that this provision would discriminate against some entrepreneurs, and it would be difficult to control the non-resellers' use of the legislation.
The measure on inconsistencies is criticised by the Head of Business Confederation Valdas Sutkus.
Macron urges Europe to defend itself against Russia and the US
French President Emmanuel Macron called, on Tuesday, for the creation of a “real European army” capable of protecting against Russia and even the United States
Mr Macron, who has been calling for the creation of a common European Union force since his coming to power, says that Europe needs to reduce its dependence on American military power.
He has recently gained a strong argument, when US President Donald Trump announced that Washington would withdraw from an important Cold War treaty on nuclear weapons.
\"We have to protect ourselves from China, Russia and even the United States,\" Macron said to the radio \"Europe 1-10
This is the first interview given to his radio since the start of his work in the president's post in May 2017.
\"When I see President Trump declaring that he is coming out of an important disarmament treaty created after the 9th decade of a missile crisis in Europe, who will be the main victim? - Europe and its security,\" said the leader of France.
The aforementioned missile crisis was triggered by the ongoing non-strategic development race for nuclear weapons during the end of the Cold War, through which the United States deployed ballistic missiles in Europe.
This crisis was a key factor in encouraging the US and the Soviet Union to conclude the Mid-range Nuclear Force Treaty (INF) in 1987.
\"We will not protect Europeans unless we decide to have a real European army,\" said Macron, in his interview on Monday night in Verden, north-east France, on his visit this week to the battlefields of World War I to the 100th anniversary of the end of this conflict.
According to Mr Macron, “when Russia, which is at our borders, has demonstrated that it could be a threat... we need a Europe that defends itself better, not just that that is dependent on the United States...
The French leader has become the main initiator of the project of the creation of forces from nine European countries capable of holding a joint military operation, evacuations from the military zone or assistance in the event of a natural disaster.
These nine Defence Ministers will meet in Paris for the first time on Wednesday to discuss the details of how these forces will function.
The European Union has also set out to significantly increase its defence budget since 2021 and allocate around EUR 13 billion over seven years to research and development.
The current EU defence budget is less than €600 million.
However, Professor Bruno Alomaras, a French military school of high ranking officers, said that the Macron vision of a closely united European defence is difficult to implement.
\"The idea of creating a culture of a common strategy is not bad,\" he said to news agency AFP.
- However, there is a huge gap between the defences of Europe that Emmanuel Macron has dreamed of and the reality - the very big disagreements between Europe's partners -
Lukashenko threatened NATO with missiles: we're not idiots
On Tuesday, President Lukashenka announced that his country would need a new armament if NATO continues to deploy forces at the western border of Belarus.
\"If NATO continues to frighten by stationing bases in Poland or even more, Belarus will need a more effective weapon, especially missiles,\" Mr Lukashenka, who met with the American analysts in Minsk, quotes the State News Agency BelTA.
The Head of State also noted that Belarus already has its own missile manufacturing industry.
“Recently - you noticed, and we are not hiding - we have built our missile industry and made our own highly precise (suitable) missile weapons,” the President stressed.
Last week, Lukashenko said that Minsk and Moscow were looking for an appropriate and inexpensive response to the plans to build a base in Poland and that she should be named after the President of the United States, Donaldo Trump (Fort Trump).
\"We are concerned about this, of course.
If, let's say, in Poland, they say that they are ready to spend millions of dollars in order to deploy (...) some Short Fort, of course, we are not idiots and, of course, we respond to this -- - said Mr Lukashenka, during the discussions in the main group of the Munich Security Conference in Minsk.
\"We are discussing with our main ally (Russia) how to respond to all of this and how to find the appropriate response to the minimum costs,\" he added.
POB: Simferopol (Russia)
Their contacts also underscore Moscow's role in the Syrian conflict and this year's struggle in Great Britain, as it is believed, the attempt by the Russian special services to poison the former double agent Sergey Skrypal's nerve paralysing material.
The tension between Moscow and Washington was further exacerbated by October D. Trump when he announced that he was planning to withdraw from the Cold War contract on the regulation of nuclear weapons.
Russia warned that this step could undermine the global security system.

Alabama-Hurts - can no longer make use of the suspension
Alabama fallower Jalen Hurts will not be suspended for this season after this Saturday.
Hurts is part of the top-rated Crimson Tide, a Saturday match against the weaker Louisiana team, which is the fifth player match this season.
This year the NCAA has applied a new rule: it is possible to suspend a player who has taken part in the four matches.
This month, Athletic, reported that Hurts had planned to do so because of conflicting expectations and the team's team's staff's response to them.
Tua Tagovailoa replaced Hurts at the beginning of the season, but Crimson Tide, a coach Nick Saban, said that he was still planning to exploit Hurts' skills.

Owens: Desas must immediately sign a contract
Desas Bryanth, former attacker of the Dalas - Cowboys, said he was about to return to the NFL.
Terrell Owens, a member of the Šlove Museum, said that Bryantu would be late.
In response to a question asked by Twitter about when he was going to sign a contract with a team, Bryanth announced on Friday a message from Twitter: “Simmerly...
Three times selected to the ‘Pro Bowl’ game, Bryant does not belong to any team since he refused to be in the middle of April in a dispute concerning remuneration.
Bryant, possibly refusing to contract with Baltimore-Ravens, and constantly linked to Cleveland-Browns, said he wanted to improve before signing a contract with the team just a season ago.
In August, Owens, who is still talking about returning to the NFL, said TMZ that Bryant should try to return to sport as soon as possible.
“He has to join the team and prove to everyone what he can, ” said Owens.
“All the surveyors think that he is no longer a successer, and he is no longer as good as he thinks.
Now he has to go to the team for any salary, accept a one- or two-year contract – no matter what – and show everyone what he does.
In 2017, Bryant caught the ball 69 times, ran 838 yards and scored six times.
In 29 years, the player did not miss 100 yards in his career – 23 competitions.
After a $70 million contract for five years in 2015, Bryant did not run 1,000 yards in any season and did not get more than eight points of ash ball.
“If your CEO or owner thinks that your skills are deteriorating, you can’t guarantee or accumulate the amount you want, ” said Owens.
He also warned that Bryant had to get to the team as soon as possible, because later on it could fail at all and said that it would be possible to return to the Cowboys-Cowboys--
“I don’t know if their relationships were broken, ” said Owens, who scored 38 times points for three seasons by playing in the Dalas team.
\"In the case of Dezo, if Cowboys take it back, I think it will be of benefit to Deas and Franshitz.\"
Considered establishment of CERN Business Development Centre in Lithuania
Representatives of the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) who visited Kaunas last week assess the possibilities to establish a CERN business development centre in Lithuania.
Today, there are ten business incubators in Europe where businesses get help in commercialising CERN technologies, developing innovative products and adapting them to the needs of society.
Although Lithuania only became a member of CERN last year, the establishment of this organisation's business incubator in the country has already been paid.
CERN representatives visited Lithuanian University of Health Sciences (LSMU) and Institute of Materials Science and Biomedical Engineering of Kaunas University of Technology (KTU).
At the meeting, the guests together with KTU, LSMU, Vytautas Magnus University, the Lithuanian Energy Institute, the Lithuanian Academy of Sciences, the Ministry of Economy and business representatives discussed the Kaunas innovation ecosystem and opportunities for young innovative businesses.
The visit of the CERN delegation is very important because, if the CERN Business Development Centre is established in Lithuania, it will be the only one in Central and Eastern Europe and will have a major impact on the region's scientific and business innovators.
“This incubator would encourage solutions to important problems of adaptation to CERN’s accumulated knowledge and technology, such as new technologies and artificial intelligence used for diagnosis and treatment of diseases, processing of large data,” says Dr Leon Balashevičius, Research and Innovation Officer of KTU.
CERN incubators, like other young business development centres, provide assistance in business development - providing information and expert advice to adapt technology to product design and help in finding sources of funding.
The only difference is that the CERN incubator is more science.
Such centre includes experts from various fields included in Lithuania: information technologies, materials engineering, as well as specialists from the medical field.
The organisation CERN is best known for the largest and most powerful particle accelerator in the world in Switzerland.
However, CERN research is conducted not only in quantum mechanics, but also in other areas, from cryogenics (very cold temperatures for substances) to particle monitoring and radiation testing.
These technologies and the work carried out by scientists have an impact on many areas of public interest: medicine, safety and industrial development.

STT detained R. Ača - Business news
Remigijus Ačas, former Parliamentary and former Head of the Raseiniai District Municipal Administration, is suspected of bribery.
He's arrested.
Special Investigation Service (STT) reports that Šiauliai Board officers conduct pre-trial investigation on possible corruption conducted in Raseiniai district municipality.
“The director of R. A. (Remigijus Ačas - red post post post) of the Raseinių district administration is suspected of bribery.
The circumstances under examination concerning the public procurement performed in a non-transparent manner, R. A. acting as the director of the municipality are likely to be of exceptional favour to one private company to conclude a public procurement contract with an enterprise managed by the Raseiniai district municipality.
It is suspected that Mr A. accepted the bribe for it (more than 250 MGL) \" - says the STT press release.
BNS adds that the company - “Raseiniai Bus Park”
On Monday, officials also stopped the corruption alleged by the Raseiniai municipality company Raseiniai Bus Park, head of Vladislovas Šiaitis.
This BNS confirmed the STT representative for the press Renata Endružytė.
The STT report states that two company representatives who directly bought Ača or participated in masking bribes in various financial operations were also suspected.
All suspects are detained, searched in their workplaces and at home.
Stopping LSDD membership
Remigijus Ačas was the director of the administration of the Raseiniai district municipality for some time, but he lost this position in the absence of his report by the April council.
He was also mayor of this district in 2011-2012.Mr. Mr. Ačas, a long-standing member of the Seimas, has been elected to the parliament since 2004 as a candidate for the party “Turk and justice”.
However, in 2013 his roads were separated, and in 2016 he was unable to win his mandate independently in the Seimas elections.
Now Mr. Ačas is dependent on the social democrats and the newly founded Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party (LSDD) under Gediminas Kirkilo.
Shortly after this news appeared, the President of the LSDD, Kirkilas, informed the press release that Mr Ačas had suspended his membership of the party until the investigation took place.
“The actions and suspicions of the Special Investigation Service to Remigijus Ačui are an unpleasant surprise for us, but in all cases the law enforcement must carry out all the necessary steps to be able to find the truth.
R. Ačas suspended the membership of the party until the pre-trial investigation is held,\" says Kirkilas, the leader of the LSDD.
In 2003, Mr Ačas was the Head of a group of advisors of the then president, Roland Paks, who was subsequently removed from office by impeachment, on national security issues.

Neither Raseiniu district mayor Algirdas Gricius nor the current head of municipal administration Liudas Kavaliauskas BNS said on Monday that they do not have any information on which specific purchase may be accompanied by a law enforcement investigation.
Meras Gricius argued about Mr. Acho's detention as a result of the media.
“I really can’t say that we were very disfellowshipped by function, I worked as a mayor in my work, he (Ačs - BNS) - the administrative work, and I couldn’t tell you, either for what reasons or what procurement was done in this case,” the mayor said on Monday.
He also argued that for the same reasons he did not want to assess also Mr Acho’s former municipal administration.
I would be afraid to say something that I could value his work, because I did not directly control his administrative work, as far as I was presented with public procurement, because of the competitions, because such and such public procurements, such tenders, then those that were seen in public spaces, contracts that I already saw as a mayor.
Therefore, I cannot describe how he led the administration at the time, as her director, - Mr Gricius spoke.
He said that he himself did not intervene in public procurement and that he did not influence them.

S. Gentvilas: The inoperative GPIS business is threatened with fines of EUR 90 million
Simon Gentvil, Vice-President of the Seimas Committee on Environmental Protection, says that due to poor functioning of product, packaging and waste accounting information system (GAIS) Lithuanian manufacturers and importers may have to pay fines of almost EUR 90 million at the end of the year.
\"The systemic crisis in the packaging management sector is becoming a more realistic scenario when the end of the year and when the ADR system is not operating normally.
Informally speaking, certificates confirming the handling of packaging waste have been issued only 1% of the planned recycling tasks, according to Mr Gentvilas, the press release.
On 7 November, the Seimón launched an extraordinary meeting of the Committee on Environmental Protection to discuss the situation, to find out why the functions of this programme are not being carried out, why the programme module is not actually implemented and how the Ministry of Environment intends to solve the problem.
\"Without the necessary legislative or legislative changes initiatives, manufacturers and importers are at risk of getting huge environmental taxes again at the end of this year,\" says Mr. Gentvilas.
In his view, the shortcomings and inaction of the ADR accounting system point to a serious crisis in the packaging waste management sector, which can be compared to the Metrail crisis.
Anxiety about tasks
A number of experts have also been warned about the fact that some businesses may not be able to cope with the recycling tasks set by the State for packaging waste in 2018.
After seeing the recycling indicators for the first half of the year published by organisations, professionals confirm that there is a reason to worry that part of the organisations may fail to manage the required amount of packaging waste in 2018.
As a result, some businesses may no longer benefit from the tax exemption and would be taxed on a certain amount of their annually marketed packaging.
The GOA wrote that two out of the three current producer organisations rejects such concerns, and one does not comment.
Kęstutis Pocius, the Director-General of Green Point of the largest organisation in the public sector, has said that, at least formally, the success of the tasks depends on the resolution of the product, packaging and waste information accounting system (APOIS) problems.
“Green point” means that all types of packaging, except glass, are expected to be out of order this year.
Although the green - point glass task will fail this year, the organization promises to compensate the members for the loss they will incur.
Experts question the benefits of food vouchers
Experts are questioning the value of such a innovation when the government plans to divide coupons on food for less well-off people and thus encourage family or farmers to trade.
They agree that the new system would create an additional bureaucratic burden.
Marius Dubnikov, head of the Tax Commission of the Lithuanian Business Confederation, says that coupons are obsolete and problems persist, and the government should focus on increasing people's income.
“The system looks quite strange and like it is taken from older textbooks.
If we want to help the public to buy something or to have more purchasing power, we need to channel all our capacity to increase people's income and people themselves must decide whether to buy in one store or another – BNS said Mr Dubnikov.
According to him, the government would make use of food vouchers for people on lower incomes.
“Of course, for people on low incomes, like a voucher on the pallet that would be written, so we, this government, gave you a voucher, and be in favour of us.
This sounds like some pre-election promises, where you want to write your signature very clearly to them -- said analysts.
He said that the food voucher system would require additional investment and that it would increase the administrative burden because it would be necessary to monitor who allows them and how they can protect them from counterfeiting.
Nerijus Mačiulis, the chief economist of Swedbank, says that with one tool to achieve both objectives - to support low income populations and small entrepreneurs - would not succeed.
‘If this is support for small entrepreneurs, the aid to vouchers compensates for price differences and allows the population to buy more expensive goods in smaller shops, which compensates the State for the difference in prices from the budget.
Then it's support for business, but not support for the population – BNS said Mr. Mačiulis.
In his view, such a system would probably not have a significant macroeconomic impact and would not substantially alter the competitive position of small shops, but, on the contrary, create an additional bureaucratic burden and could make it more difficult for new entrants to enter the market.
“It would seem that it would be a rather bureaucratic instrument with high administrative costs, and it would also be quite uncomfortable for the population, and they should shop in some larger shop with a larger range of houses, but look for a few specialised stores with a smaller range of ones,” said an economist.
According to him, coupons are used in other countries when the volume of goods or services is limited and must be provided in the same way for all, or for some social group.
The residents then get their coupons free of charge and can spend them on food.
According to Mr Mačiulis, they are also used in the labour market by granting temporary tax relief to businesses, employing long-term unemployed, or, for example, former prisoners.
This practice, in the words of Mr. Mačiulis, has also been successfully applied in Lithuania.
Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis said on Monday that the new food voucher system under consideration by the government would help the poorest people, increase competition, encourage small businesses or farmers.
First-time advisor Skirmantas Malinauskas BNS said on Monday that the idea is most focused on farmers and family businesses, and buyers with vouchers could get a discount of 20-30 percent.
According to him, the number of vouchers would be limited in order to prevent farmers from being abused.
According to him, the 3-5 coupons would allow a person to benefit from 10-15 euros per month.
According to him, although the funds for the programme have not yet been provided for in the state budget, it could be financed from this source, perhaps also from European Union funds.
“Not everything currently provided or foreseen in the budget will be in the final, but he will change the Seimas, so happens, there may be funds transferred from one line to another, and from ministries, things can change.
It is always a priority which is the decision - whether by refusing something, finding another additional source of income and so on - on Tuesday BNS said Mr. Malinauskas.
So far, it is decided what scope and when innovation can be applied from now on.
