Members of the Assembly of Wales (AM) are concerned about the possibility of being 'perceived as a mermaid'
Some members of the Assembly are concerned about the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The reason for this is plans to change the name of the Assembly to "Welsh Parliament".
A.M., across the political spectrum, is worried that this could make them a laughing stock.
One of the Labour Party's AM explained that their group is concerned about "the echoes of the names Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside of Wales: in Welsh, "twp" means "victim", while "pwp" means "kaka".
The party Plaid AM pointed out that none of the group "was not satisfied" and has suggested alternatives.
A Conservative MEP from Wales said their group was ready to consider changing the name, but added that the MWP was "very similar" to Muppet, which means "the eagle".
In this context, it should be taken into account that the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similarly to the English Yorkshire dialect "u".
The Assembly commission, which is currently drafting a bill to change the name, said: "The final decision on what terms will be used to designate the members of the Assembly is, of course, up to the members of the Assembly themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which gained broad support for the change of the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
As for the name AM, the commission preferred the Welsh Parliament Member (WMP) but MWP received the most support in the public consultation.
The AM clearly suggests alternative options, but the fight for a deal could be a headache for the Speaker of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a bill on changes in the coming weeks.
The draft law on changes will also include other changes to the work of the assembly, including the laws on the disqualification of HEs and the structure of the committee system.
The final vote on what they will be called will take place after they have discussed the laws and regulations.
Macedonians vote in referendum on change of country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether their country's name will be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia".
A referendum was held to settle decades of disputes with neighbouring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour gives the impression of claims to its territory and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia's request to be admitted to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, one of the opponents of the plebiscite on changing the name, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name is simply a matter of accession to the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin’s Church go silent as the churches of Harlem struggle for existence.
“As the old people I’ve talked to tell me, they used to have a bar and a church on every corner,” Mr. Adams says.
"Now there is neither one nor the other."
He admits that the disappearance of the bars is understandable.
“People are socializing in other ways these days,” he said.
"Bars are no longer neighbourhood living rooms that people visit regularly."
Speaking even to the churches, he worries that the money he receives from the sale of the property will run out sooner than the leaders hope, "and sooner or later they will be back to the starting point."
The churches, he added, may be replaced by apartment buildings with apartment properties that will be inhabited by people who will not help the remaining shrines in the area.
"Most of the people who will buy apartment properties in these buildings will be white," he explained, "and thus the day when these churches will be closed forever will come closer, because it is unlikely that most of the people who will move into these apartment properties will become members of these parishes."
Both churches were built by the White Congregation before Haarlem became a black metropolis—the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin’s 10 years later.
The original White Methodist congregation left the building in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by a black congregation that had worshipped nearby.
St. Martin's church was taken over by the black congregation during his blessing by John Howard Johnson. He led a boycott of working retailers on 125th Street in Harlem, who had refused to hire or give them a promotion.
A fire in 1939 seriously damaged the building, but because of Father Johnson’s plans to renovate the building, they ordered a bell game.
His blessing David Johnson, son and successor of his father Johnson in the parish of St. Martin, proudly called the bell game "the bells of the poor people."
The expert, who played this call game in July, used other words: "cultural treasure" and "an indispensable historical tool".
Expert Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan added that it was the first bell game in the world played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger bell game at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's Church did not replace him.
The events of the last few months around St. Martin’s Church reflected a mixed relationship between architects and contractors, some of whom had been attracted to secular power, and others by the episcopal diocese of the church.
In July, the council, made up of secular leaders, wrote to the diocese concerned that the diocese would "try to pass on the costs" to the council, even though the council was not involved in hiring architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some members of the congregation complained about the lack of transparency in the work of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old teenager at lobster fishing site
Shark on Saturday in California attacked a 13-year-old boy who was diving for lobsters and injured him. It was the first day of the lobster season, the services say.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m., near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel informed KSWB-TV San Diego that he and his friends had been diving for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy calling for help, and then ran up to him with the group to help pull the boy out of the water.
Hammel explained that at first he thought it was simply a delight to catch a lobster, but then he "realized that the boy was screaming "I'm being bitten!
I'm being bitten!"
The whole of his key bone was torn open,” said Hammel, who noticed it immediately when he got to the boy.
"I'm screaming everyone to leave the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" added Hammel.
The boy was taken by air to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition was found critical.
The species of shark attacked is unknown.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles briefed the media that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was acknowledged that it was not a dangerous species for humans.
Giles added that the victim had been injured in the upper part of his torso.
Officials closed access to beaches from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Encinitas for 48 hours for the duration of the investigation and for safety reasons.
Giles pointed out that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous to humans.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is on the offensive against Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with department store-style beauty racks and trained salespeople.
As part of a significant investment in the UK’s <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow despite falling sales of fashion items and home items, 11 stores across the country will be testing larger rows of beauty shelves and, if things go well, there will be more next year.
The beauty industry invests when supermarkets look to use shelves previously reserved for TVs, microwaves and home goods.
Sainsbury's said it would double its beauty offering to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and, for the first time, Dr. PawPaw.
Existing lines from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive more space with brand zones like those in Boots stores.
The supermarket is also re-launching its "Boutique" line of make-up, where most of the products will be vegan-friendly — increasingly demanded by younger shoppers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will test the concession at two Sainsbury's stores, the first opened last week in Croydon in the south of London and the second in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and the switch to small daily grocery shopping in local shops mean that supermarkets need to invest more to persuade people to visit them.
Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe has said that outlets will become more and more like department stores as the chain struggles with discount stores Aldi and Lidl, offering a wider range of services but without food.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos in several hundred stores and has opened several Habitats since it bought both chains two years ago, which is said to have improved sales and made the purchase more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to improve its beauty and pharmaceutical departments ended in defeat.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with the Boots in the early 2000s, but the union broke up after a dispute over how to distribute the proceeds from the drugstores to supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
According to this plan, the task of Lloyds will be to replenish the assortment with a wide range of exclusive skin care products, including Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director at Sainsbury’s, said: “To improve the environment for consumers, we’ve redesigned the shelving of our beauty products and the impression they make.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will always be ready to make a recommendation.
Our brand range is designed to meet all needs, but the attractive environment combined with convenient location means we are now a delightful destination on the road to beauty, a destination that challenges past shopping habits.”
Peter Jones 'Rageful' After Holly Willowby Refuses 11 Million Pounds Deal
"Dragon Den" star Peter Jones "took over in a fit of rage" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby scrapped an 11-million-pound deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willowby has no time to devote to their home clothing and accessories brand "Truly".
The couple's business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop.
This Morning’s 37-year-old TV presenter used Instagram to announce that she was leaving.
Holly Willowby has left Dragon Den star Peter Jones in a frenzy as she left their lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute to focus on her new huge contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was “frozen” when a TV golden girl told a tense meeting on Tuesday at her business empire residence in Marlow, Buckinghamshire that her new contracts, worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million, meant she no longer had time to devote to their home gown and accessory brand, Truly.
The company was compared to Gvineta Platrova's brand Goop, and according to hints, it will double the wealth of Willowby, estimated at 11 million pounds.
When Willowby (37) used Instagram to announce that he was leaving Truly, Jones took off from Britain for one of his holiday homes.
According to the source, “Truly was the most important of Holly’s priorities.
It should have become her long-term future, to which the next decades would be devoted.
Her decision to withdraw surprised all involved unprepared.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday: everything was so close to a start.
In the center of Marlow, there is a warehouse full of ready-to-sell goods."
Experts believe that the departure of this morning’s driver, one of the most financially profitable stars, can cost the company millions, as a huge amount of money has been invested in a variety of products, from pillows and candles to clothing and home goods, and it will be even more delayed in bringing them to the market.
And this can mean the end of a long friendship.
Willowby, the mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have maintained a close relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for 10 years.
Willowby Truly and Kep formed in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as chairman in March.
The two couples spend their holidays together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willowby is set to become M&S’ ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as head of ITV’s I’m A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said yesterday: "We don't want to comment on his business dealings!"
Serious conversation "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he would receive from news companies for commenting that some might consider "indecent to the president" and about being so positive towards the North Korean leader.
Why is the President giving up so much?
Trump said in his fake "news announcer" voice.
"I did not give up anything!"
He said Kim had shown interest in meeting again after Trump acknowledged their initial meeting in Singapore in June as a major step toward North Korea’s denuclearization.
However, negotiations on denuclearisation have stalled.
More than three months after a summit in Singapore in June, Ri Yong Ho, one of North Korea’s top diplomats, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a US “response” to North Korea’s initial steps toward disarmament.
Instead, he pointed out, the US continues to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining tensions.
Trump was much more optimistic in his rally speech.
"We have a great relationship with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim had yielded positive results, including a halt to missile tests, assistance in the release of prisoners and the return of the remaining American soldiers to their homes.
And he defended his unusual approach when it comes to his relationship with Kim.
“It’s easy to make the president look like he’s in there, but instead of standing 10,000 people outside trying to get into this tightly-populated area, we’re 200, right here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake devastate Indonesia, killing hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lombok population was displaced, the state of the national disaster was not declared, but it is necessary to propose foreign aid.
"Unfortunately, on many occasions they made it very clear that they were not asking for international assistance, so this is a certain problem," said Ms Sumbung.
Although Save the Children gathers a group to travel to Palu, it is still unclear whether foreign workers will be allowed to work there.
Mr Sutopo of the National Disaster Agency explained that Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see whether international agencies will be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
In view of the fact that earthquakes occur regularly in Indonesia, the country is still extremely unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been established in Aceh, they are rare along other coasts.
Palu’s death was likely also caused by the absence of tsunami warning sirens despite the warning.
Even in the best of times, moving between Indonesia’s many islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The hospital ship, which had anchored in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake, is now heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the victims of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo had made the improvement of Indonesia’s shattered infrastructure a focal point of his election campaign, and has allocated large sums to roads and railways.
However, the lack of funds has plagued Mr. Joko’s administration and he is expected to run for re-election next year.
In addition, Mr Joko has to contend with the long-standing problem of tensions between sects in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority has adopted one of the conservative forms of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands driven from their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets using machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
Watch: Liverpool player Daniel Starredge restores balance in match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League by scoring in the 89th minute in a Saturday game at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Starij received the pass from Xherdan Shaqiri, being about 25 meters (30 yards) from the Chelsea gate, when his team lost 1:0.
He moved the ball slightly to the left of himself and then took the ball to the far end of the goalpost.
In this attempt, the ball flew high over the field, reaching the upper right corner of the net.
The ball eventually flew over the head of Kepa Arrizabalag, who was in the jump, and fell into the net.
“I was just trying to get that position to get the ball, and players like Shaq are always playing as far ahead as possible, so I was just trying to get myself as much time as possible,” he told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching, touched the ball, and, without much thought, took the ball."
In order to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market, the Commission should be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.
The Blues forward made the pass back to Mateo Kovacic before turning to the midfield and making the quickest possible run to the Liverpool side of the court.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> made a quick pass and got the ball back in the middle of the field.
Then he made a beautiful kick between the players, allowing Azardam to get into the zone.
Azard beat the defense at speed and finished the hand, with his left foot kicking into the farthest pole network, past Liverpool's Alison Becker.
In the group stage of the Champions League of "Liverpool" on Wednesday at 15.00 "Stadio San Paolo" in Naples (Italy) will fight with "Napoli".
Chelsea will meet Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
Indonesia tsunami death toll reaches 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has reached 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday.
It was reported that many people were trapped in the rubble of buildings after the 7.5-magnitude earthquake that struck the country on Friday and caused waves as high as 20 feet (<0x7E>6.0 m), agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, home to more than 380,000 people, was covered by the rubble of collapsed buildings.
Police suspect 32-year-old man arrested for stabbing woman
The murder investigation began after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old stab victim was found at 7:55 a.m. on Grayson Mews, John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police have asked people in the area who have seen or heard something to report.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation has just begun, but I would like to invite everyone on John Street around Birkenhead who saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also invite everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something in their car's video recorders, to contact us as they may have information relevant to our investigation."
A police spokeswoman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead, and she was found in her possession.
This afternoon, friends who think they know a woman have come to the crime scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and, according to police, they are working on informing the nearest relatives of the victim.
The taxi driver, who lives in Graysonmusee, tried to get back into his apartment, but the police told him that no one should enter or leave the building.
He could not say a word when he learned what had happened.
Citizens are told that it will be hours before they are allowed to return.
It was heard a policeman tell a man that the whole area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman in tears appeared at the scene of the crime.
She continues to repeat: "It's so terrible!".
At two o’clock in the afternoon, there were two police vans inside the cordon, and another was parked right next to the outside.
Several police officers were stationed inside the cordon and controlled the apartment building.
All who have information are asked to use DM <0x40>MerPolCC until September 30, call 101 or contact "Crimestoppers anonymously" on 0800 555 111 calling 247.
Cromwell statue in parliament becomes the latest "rewriting of history" scandal
Abandoning it would be ethically justified, given the Taliban-like activities that resulted in his fanatical Puritan followers destroying so many monuments of English culture and religion.
The Cromwell Society, however, described Mr. Crick's proposal as "foolishness" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "Given the ongoing debate about removing statues, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside of Westminster Castle would also become a target.
Cromwell himself neither ordered nor carried out the destruction of icons during the English Civil Wars.
It is possible that the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed because of the actions of his predecessor, Thomas, who lived a century earlier.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s magnificent depiction of Cromwell speaks volumes about the 19th century and is part of a historiography of a person that many believe is still worthy of honor.
Mr Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was seen by many – probably more at the end of the 19th century than today – as a defender of parliament against the external pressure that, in his case, was, of course, a monarchy.
Historical discussions continue on whether this is really a perfectly accurate depiction of the theme.
It is clear that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century determined the further development of our nation, and Cromwell as such is a recognizable personality representing one of the sides of the divorce of that time.
His accomplishments as Lord Treader are worthy of praise and mention."
Pig-killer to death tore farmers in China
According to local media, a pig in a market in the south-west of China attacked a farmer and killed him.
A man, identified only by his surname Yuan, was found dead with a torn artery all in one blood at a pig house market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer intends to inject pigs into a pig house in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, on 30 May 2005.
He and his cousin are reported to have arrived Wednesday from neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found the man dead and found that the door of the nearby pighouse was open.
He told me that there was a large male pig in the pig barn with blood on its mouth.
According to the information, a forensic medical investigation confirmed that a 550-pound (<0x7E>249 kg) heavy boar had torn a peasant.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and mutilated," he said, referring only to his surname Wu, according to the Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera material showed how Yuan enters the market on Thursday at about 4.40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan did not belong to him or his nephew.
The market manager informed Evening News that the hog was turned on to prevent its attacks on others while police were gathering evidence on the scene.
According to information, the Yuan family and the market leadership discuss compensation for his death.
Although such cases are rare, other attacks of pigs on humans are known.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and a man on their farm in Massachusetts, resulting in critical injuries to the man.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig in Wales kept a farmer on a tractor until his wife chased him away.
After farmers in Oregon ate his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that the pigs were generally not aggressive, but the taste of the blood could act as a "pistol shot".
"They're just playful.
They like to tweak, they are very inquisitive... they don't want to harm you.
You just have to show them enough respect," he said.
The conclusion of the Orcan Rose brings a wide and powerful case in the south-west of the United States
Hurricane Rosa is expected to weaken as it passes the coldest waters off Mexico’s northern coast.
Rose, however, will bring flooding rains to northern Mexico and the south-west of the United States in the coming days.
At five o'clock in the afternoon (North American Eastern Time), Rose's gusts reached 143 km/h (85 mph), corresponding to a Category 1 hurricane, and its point was 620 km (385 mph) southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rose is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure depression is formed over the Pacific Ocean, moving eastwards toward the east coast of the United States. As Rose approaches the Baja California peninsula with a tropical storm force, on Monday it will begin to push moisture masses deep from the tropical belt northwards toward the south-west of the United States.
Rose on Monday in the part of Mexico will bring up to 10 inches (<0x7E>25.4 cm) of rain.
Then, the tropical humidity interacting with the approaching low-pressure depression will create a wide area of heavy rainfall in the Southwest over the next few days.
1 to 4 inches (<0x7E>2.6 to 10.2 cm) of rain will cause dangerous sudden floods, mud currents and possibly landslides in the desert.
Humidity deep in the tropics will cause rainfall that will reach 2-3 inches (<0x7E>5.1–7.6 cm) per hour in some places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Some parts of the southwest, especially most of Arizona, are expected to be up to 24 inches (<0x7E>5.2–10.1 cm) in rainfall.
Sudden flooding with rapid deterioration due to the dispersion of tropical rainfalls is possible.
It is very undesirable to go to the desert on foot because of the threat of tropical rains.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into rapid rivers, but thunderstorms will bring local gusty winds and sandstorms.
A low-pressure depression approaching will bring a local heavy rain to part of southern California's coastline.
Rainfall of more than half an inch (<0x7E>1.3 cm) is possible, which can cause small mud flows and slippery roads.
This will be the region's first rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, before the rains take over the wider area late on Monday and early on Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread across the Four Corners region (DR Colorado, DA Utah, NA Arizona and DR New Mexico) on Tuesday and last all Wednesday.
In October, there may be intense temperature fluctuations throughout the United States, as temperatures are dropping in the Arctic, but the tropics are still quite warm.
Sometimes it causes dramatic changes in temperature at a short distance.
This is an example of dramatic temperature differences on Sunday in the central part of the US.
The difference between temperatures in Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and Saint Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, varies by nearly 20 degrees.
The next few days will try to form and expand the long summer heat.
It is expected that in large parts of the central and eastern United States the beginning of October will be warm, with temperatures reaching 80 degrees and more (Fahrenheit; <0x7E>27 degrees Celsius) in large areas from the southern plains to part of the northeast.
The temperature in New York City could reach 80 degrees Fahrenheit (<0x7E>27 degrees Fahrenheit) on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate projections point to a high probability that temperatures in the eastern United States will be above average in the first half of October.
More than 20 million watched the Brett Caveno case
More than 20 million people watched with excitement on six television channels on Thursday, according to Supreme Court nominees Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Caveno of sexual harassment that she claimed happened in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political standoff continued as broadcasters cut off their regular broadcasts to report on the latest developments on Friday: Arizona Senator Jeff Flake's deal to have the week investigated by the FBI.
Ford informed the Senate Justice Committee that she was absolutely certain that Kaveno had embraced him drunk and tried to take off his clothes during a high school party.
Cavano was adamant that he was absolutely convinced that this had not happened.
It’s not the first time I’ve heard of it, but it’s the last time I’ve heard it.
CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC recorded the average viewer interest.
The data of the other broadcasters, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, which demonstrated it, were not immediately available.
And "Nielsen" usually has problems counting the number of people watching what's going on in the offices.
To get a better picture, this is the same as watching the playoffs or the Oscars.
The Fox News Channel, whose commentators have strongly supported Kaveno's nomination, had the highest viewing figures, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day-long audition, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS raised 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The interest remained high even after the audition.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican team had published a statement that he would vote for Kaveno’s appointment, the senator noticed CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning as he, accompanied by the protestors’ outrageous cries, tried with an elevator to get to the Justice Committee hearing.
On live CNN, he stood stabbed for several minutes.
"I'm standing here right in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told that "you belong to power, so long as so many women are powerless."
Flake explained that his team had made a statement and informed him before the elevator door closed that he had more to say during the committee hearing.
Cable networks and broadcasters broadcast live several hours later, when the Justice Committee was about to vote on Kaveno's nomination to the Senate.
But Flake said he would only do so if he knew the FBI would look into the charges against the candidate next week, as demanded by a minority of Democrats.
Fleisch was partially persuaded by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Koons and several other senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was important because it was clear that the Republicans would not have a vote to approve Caveno without an investigation.
President Trump has ordered the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh.
I’m not sure if I’ll be able to do it again.
Prime Minister Theresa May accused people critical of her plan to leave the European Union in an interview with the Sunday Times of "political games" about Britain's future and undermining national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, right next to an interview with her on the front page of the newspaper, May’s former foreign minister Boris Johnson continues to attack her Brexit plan for Britain’s future relationship with the European Union, the so-called Chequers plan, stressing that the suggestion that Britain and the EU use each other’s tariffs is “absolutely absurd”.
Type Sims Shooting: Police Arrest Ditheon Simpson, Suspected of Killing an LSU Player
Police have arrested suspects in the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and charged with second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge police station said.
The officials released a video showing Sims’s encounter with the Simpsons, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
WAFB, a subsidiary of CBS, reports that police found the glasses at the scene of the crime and that Simpson's blood was found on them.
After Simpson was interrogated, the police informed him that he had confessed to shooting Wade.
According to the lawyer, he was given a security deposit of $350,000.
A forensic team from the East Baton Rouge Parish released a provisional report on Friday saying the death was caused by a shot in the head that hit the neck.
The department thanks the Louisiana State Police’s refugee search team, the State Police’s Forensic Laboratory, the Southern University Police, and the area’s residents for their help in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked the territory's law enforcement for their "care and work in the name of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The six-foot-six-inch (<0x7E>1.98 m) long forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball at the LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points per game and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade announced that the team was "shocked" and "shocked" over Wade's death.
"That's what a man always worries about," said Wade.
A volcano spits ash across Mexico City
The ash that rises from the Pocatépetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhood of Mexico City.
After activity was monitored and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours, the National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday that they should not approach the volcano.
The center observed multiple hoarseness and trembling.
Images on social media showed that car windshields around Mexico City, such as Hochimilco (Xochimilco), are covered with a thin layer of ash.
Geophysicists have noticed the activation of a volcano 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a 7.1-magnitude strong earthquake rocked central Mexico in 2017.
The volcano, also known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police conflict with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with police and thousands joined anti-establishment demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarising secession vote.
A group of masked secessionists, held back by the public order police, slapped them with eggs and sprinkled powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets that would normally be full of tourists.
Disagreements arose later that day, and the police used batons to prevent fighting.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted "Don't forget and don't forgive!" in a confrontation with pro-unity protesters who chanted: "Long life for Spain!"
According to local newspapers, 14 people were given medical treatment for minor injuries sustained during the protests.
One year after the referendum held in Madrid on 1 October, which was declared illegal but praised by Catalans, the idea of independence remains under severe pressure in the region.
Voters spoke out strongly in favour of independence, even though turnout was low and those who were against secession boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan officials, almost 1 000 people were injured last year when police tried to stop voting at polling stations across the region and violent clashes broke out.
The independence groups were on duty Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place, but the demonstrators were forced to take a different path.
Narciss Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hoped Catalonia would gain independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents' eyes filled with tears of joy that they were allowed to vote, but now everything has stopped," he said.
Although the pro-independence parties won a small but significant victory in last year's regional elections, they have fought to maintain momentum this year as several of the most prominent leaders have either emigrated or been arrested and are awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
The 42-year-old mechanic Joan Puig, who was filming on the phone in support of the protest police, said politicians on both sides had been heating up the conflict.
"The tension is getting worse," he said.
On Saturday, one of nine Catalan leaders, Oriol Junqueras, who has been incarcerated pending trial since last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament next year.
"Candidation in the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression that the Spanish government has imposed on us," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after crashing into a building
Three men (aged 33, 34 and 39) were arrested after a car was repeatedly hit against a building in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7.30 p.m. BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemings said the gate and the building itself were damaged.
It is possible that a crossbow was shot at the same time on the car.
Menga's blow allows "Livingston" with 1-0 to win the "Rangers"
The first goal of Dolly Menga secured a victory for the Livingston.
The band's support of the Livingstons stunned the Rangers, securing Steven Gerrard's second loss in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's blow turned out to be decisive, as Gary Holt's team leveled the situation with the Hibernian.
The Commission shall be assisted by the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed established by Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs (OJ L 139, 30.4.2004, p.
It’s a great way to get to know each other better.
In addition, the European Commission has launched a public consultation on the future of the EU’s Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and the European External Action Service (EEAS) on the future of Europe.
"Livingston" does not seize the opportunity against dull guests
Holt's direct game, which in many ways made it difficult for the Rangers, had to be in the lead long before they got the names.
Scott Robinson broke out, but delayed his rehearsal in front of the gate, then Alan Lithgow's attempt to prevent Craig Halkett from hitting his head across the goal line after slipping into his feet was unsuccessful.
The owners let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they will be able to stop the guests in the planned places.
That’s how the final gate came in.
The Rangers allowed the free-kick, and Livingston used the corridor, Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up to give Meng a chance to score from the middle of the zone.
At this stage, the Rangers managed the ball, but the defense of the guests turned out to be impenetrable, and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not particularly disturbed.
This continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos ordered Kelly to save the gate.
Scott Pittman's rehearsal was interrupted by the skill of Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor, and Litgov threw the Livingston combination past the goal.
In the Livingston area, centered bombs continued to appear, but two calls for a penalty were turned down — after Halkett's fight for the ball with substitute Glenn Middleton and for hand-playing.
"Phenomenal" "Livingston" performance - analysis
Scottish BBC Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal "Livingston" performance and result.
Each of them was excellent, continuing to beat expectations, constantly improving performance.
Their playing style and personalities have hardly changed since they returned to the top echelon, but Holt deserves a lot of praise for the way he has teamed up since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
While Captain Halkett was great at maintaining first-rate organized defenses, Menga made sure that Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall remained vigilant.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
No matter how good Gerard was at times, they were far from these standards.
Their last ball was boring -- only once they broke into the part of the master field -- and it's basically a call to wake up, "Rangers in the middle of the table.
Erdogan meets with mixed feelings in Cologne
On Saturday (29 September), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin, there were a lot of smiles and blue sky.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which was aimed at re-establishing relations between NATO allies.
They have disagreements on various issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
After that, Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new gigantic mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish community outside Turkey.
Police blocked a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque for security reasons, but many of the supporters came nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, also expressed their disapproval of Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him.
The protests between the two sides reflect the contradictions created by a guest some German Turks see as a hero, while others despise as autocratic.
Road traffic accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies in a collision with a car
It’s a great way to get to know each other better.
The collision took place at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a section of the road with heavy traffic in Deptford, south-east of the city, at about 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped, and medical assistance was provided, but the man died at the scene.
The crash took place several months after another cyclist died on Childers Street, about a mile from the Sunday crash site. The driver then left the crash site.
The police service of the capital city said that police officers are engaged in identifying the man and informing their relatives.
There are closed roads and diverted buses at the scene, but car drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin prison: six employees injured during riots
The Prison Office reports that six prison staff members were injured in riots in a men’s prison.
The riots broke out at HMP Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire around 09.30 BST on Sunday and are still ongoing.
In order to prevent riots involving eight inmates and confined in one wing, the employees of the special service "Tornado" were involved
The workers were treated for mild facial injuries at the scene.
A spokesman for the prison service said: "Specially trained prison staff were involved in resolving the incident at the HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six staff were provided with medical assistance due to injuries.
We will not tolerate violence in our prisons and say clearly that those responsible will be handed over to the police and will probably spend more time behind bars."
The HMP Long Lartin prison has over 500 inmates, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison chief was being treated in a hospital after an attack by a prisoner.
And last October, the staff in charge of controlling the dumps were sent to prison to deal with the serious disorder in which the staff had been attacked by billiard bombs.
Orcan Rose Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City are threatened with flash floods (probably benefiting drought-stricken areas)
Arizona rarely suffers from tropical depression, but this is what is likely to happen early next week, when Hurricane Rosa will push its remaining forces across the desert southwest, creating the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning about flash floods on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rose is expected to make her way across Phoenix on Tuesday, arriving with rain late Monday.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix said on Twitter that since 1950, only "ten tropical cyclones maintained the status of tropical storms or depressions within a 200-mile (320 km) radius of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was an orc 40 miles (65 km) from the AZ borders."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict a 2-4 inch (<0x7E>5.08–10.2 cm) rainfall, reaching up to 6 inches (15.24 cm) in some places.
Other areas of the desert south-west, including the central part of the Rocky Mountains and the Large Basin, are likely to receive 1-2 inches (<0x7E>2.54–5.08 cm), reaching up to 4 inches (<0x7E>10.2 cm) in some places.
For those who are not at risk of sudden flooding, Rose's rain can be a blessing because of the drought in the region.
Although flooding is a very serious concern, some of the rainfall is likely to be beneficial, as the south-west is currently suffering from drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Control (Drought Monitor), just over 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the second-highest category, according to weather.com.
First, the path of the hurricane Rose leads to Baja California, a peninsula in Mexico, where it will reach the coast.
Rose is still with the hurricane force on Sunday morning at a maximum wind speed of 85 miles (137 km) per hour, is located about 385 miles (<0x7E>620 km) south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico, and moves north at a speed of 12 miles (19 km) per hour.
The storm collides with the cooler waters of the Pacific Ocean and, as a result, calms down.
Therefore, it is expected that the hurricane will reach the coast of Mexico with a tropical storm force on Monday afternoon or in the morning.
Rainfall in parts of Mexico can be severe, posing a significant risk of flooding.
"The rainfall is expected to reach 3 to 6 inches (7.62 to 15.24 cm) from Lower California inside the southwestern Sonoran, with precipitation possibly reaching 10 inches (25.4 cm)," weather.com reported.
Rose will move north, across Mexico as a tropical storm, and then reach the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then move across Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The main threat to be expected from Rose or her remains is very heavy rainfall in Lower California, Sonora in the northwest and the deserts of the United States in the southwest," the National Orcan Center said.
This rain is expected to cause life-threatening flash floods and mudflows in deserts and landslides in mountainous areas.
Attack on Midsommer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
The injured teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at about 4.00 BST.
He was taken to the hospital, where his condition remained "stable".
Police said 17-year-olds and two 18-year-olds, as well as a 20-year-old man, were arrested overnight in Radstock, Iowa and Somerset.
The police have called on anyone who might have a mobile phone material about what happened.
Trump Says Kaveno Suffers From Democratic Party's 'Evil and Anger'
“The vote for Judge Caveno is a vote to reject the Democratic Party’s cruel and violent tactics,” Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump stressed that Kaveno had suffered from the Democratic Party's "evil and anger" throughout his nomination process.
Kaveno was witnessed in front of Congress, where he energetically and emotionally denied any accusations of sexual harassment by Christine Blasey Ford decades ago, when both were teenagers.
Ford also testified during the hearing about his accusations.
The President said Saturday that the day "Americans saw" Caveno "excellence, ability and courage."
"The vote to approve Judge Caveno is a vote to approve one of the most educated lawyers of our time with a brilliant history of serving the nation," he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
President Kaveno mentioned the nomination round about the importance of the activity of the republicans in the mid-term elections.
"Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
I was not a candidate, but I was actually a candidate," he said.
"That's why I go everywhere, fighting for great candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats had taken on a mission to "protest and resist."
The first major vote in the Senate on Kaveno’s nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, CNN reported a senior aide to the Republican Party leadership.
Hundreds killed in an earthquake in Indonesia, and it is clear that the number of victims is growing
Officials said on Saturday that at least 384 people were killed, many simply washed away, when giant waves hit the coast after a powerful earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in Palu, when up to six metres (18 feet) of high waves hit the shore in twilight, flushing many to death and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami erupted after a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
“When there was a tsunami threat yesterday, people were still running on the beach and not running straight away, and they became victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for India’s disaster mitigation agency BNPB, told a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not arrive alone, it brought cars, logs and buildings, it dragged everything on the ground," Nugoro said, adding that the tsunami had crossed the sea at 800 km/h (497 mph) before hitting the coast.
"Many people climbed trees to save themselves, and survived," he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Photos taken on the disaster agency's flight show many homes and shops destroyed, bridges deformed and collapsed, and a water-encircled mosque.
Aftershocks continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in the area with a population of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian technology assessment and application agency BPPT said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times greater than the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The location of the city at the end of a long, narrow bay probably reinforced the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shops and hotels had collapsed.
He said the bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho admitted that the number of victims and damage could be higher along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Dongala (Donggala), which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
"The communications were completely destroyed, no information was received from Dongalas," Nugroho said.
The Red Cross said more than 300,000 people live there, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but things could have been even worse," it said.
The agency was widely criticised on Saturday for failing to report that the tsunami had hit Palu, despite officials claiming the waves arrived at the time of the warning.
A video distributed on social networks says that a man on the top floor of the building is desperately calling people on the bottom of the street that a tsunami is approaching.
In a matter of minutes, the water wall crashes against the shore, washing away buildings and cars.
The news agency Reuters was unable to immediately confirm whether the material was real.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a serious loss of power, which cut off communications in Palu, making it difficult for officials to coordinate rescue efforts.
Officials said the army had begun sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuees were still in dire need of food and other basic necessities.
The city airport is only open for assistance measures and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami exceeds 800.
That's very bad.
Mr. Doseba told us that World Vision employees, who successfully reached the town of Palu from Donggala, and now live in awnings in the office yard, passed the scenes of devastation along the way.
"They told us they saw a lot of buildings that had been destroyed," he explained.
That's very bad.
Even when the relief teams were determined to organise relief for the victims of the disaster, some complained that foreign aid workers with a lot of experience were not allowed to go to Palu.
According to Indonesian legislation, the funding, resources and personnel of overseas organizations will only be allowed to arrive if the disaster area is declared as a national disaster zone.
This has not happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government announces, 'OK, this is a national disaster,' we will be able to accept international aid, but that status has not yet been determined."
When Palu came on the second night after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, the friends and family of the still undiscovered people continued to hope that their loved ones would become miracles that brighten up the gloomy life in times of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the gutter.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped under rubble for two days, next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had prepared two of the missing Asian paragliding games that took place earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others of those trapped at Roa Roa, including Mr. Mandagi, were their students.
"As an experienced paraglider," he said, "I am taught to carry the load of emotion."
Mr. Gendon recalled that after the news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse spread among the paraglider team, he had been sending messages of "WhatsApp" to the participants of the Palu competition who participated in the beach festival for hours on end.
However, the result of his reports was only one gray mark, not two blue marks.
"I think it means that the messages did not reach the addressee," he said.
Thieves abduct $26,750 during ATM refilling at Newport on the Levee Complex
According to a statement from the Newport Police Department, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink’s employee on Friday morning, filling an ATM at the Newport on the Levee complex.
"The driver emptied the ATM of the entertainment complex and was ready to fill it with more money," detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
While the driver was busy, another man ran up to Brink’s employee from behind and stole the bag with the ATM money.
According to the press release, the witnesses noticed several suspicious persons leaving the crime scene, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact the Newport Police 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Je
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
In announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "A creature who previously knew as Kanji West."
41-year-old West has been called Je for some time, and used the nickname as the name of his eighth album ("Ye"), which was released in June.
This change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album, Yandhi.
The creators of the show say that he replaces singer Arian Grandi in the show, who stopped work on "emotional causes".
West has said that this is not only an abbreviation of his current professional name, but that it also has a religious meaning.
"I believe Ye is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West explained earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boi.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
At first there was Kanje, which means "only one, followed by "Ye", which is a reflection of the good and the bad in us, of our confusion, of everything.
The album is more of a reflection on who we are."
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs, previously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he declared his preference for the words Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who had previously collaborated with Vesta, also has and has not used a dash of thought and capital letters.
President-elect of Mexico vows not to use army against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians at a time approaching the 50th anniversary of the bloody retribution of students.
Lopez Obrador on Saturday told the Tlatelolco Plaza "never use the army to oppress the Mexican people."
On 2 October 1968, a peaceful demonstration was shot by army units, killing as many as 300 people, as left-wing student movements spread throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has vowed to support young Mexicans through monthly student grants and the opening of more public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities drag young people into gangs of criminals.
U.S. should double funding for artificial intelligence
As China becomes increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount that is spent on research in this area, explains investor and artificial intelligence practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments were made following the announcement of artificial intelligence by various US government bodies, although the US as a whole lacks a strategy for artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China launched its plan last year: it aims to become the main country in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
“A doubling of the AI research budget will be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind the U.S., and the next milestone in AI is expected,” Lee said.
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee said that doubling the funding could double the chances that the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence will take place in the United States.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the executive director of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China’s leading artificial intelligence companies.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked to create an artificial intelligence system that beat America’s best player, Othello (Reversi), but later he was the CEO of Microsoft Research and president of Google’s China branch.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be ready to identify people with ideas for the future."
"Scientists in the United States often have to work very hard to get government grants," Lee said.
"It is not China that lures the leading scientists, but the big companies," he said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university stars to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
He said that changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. improve its performance in artificial intelligence.
“I believe that green cards should automatically be awarded to people with a PhD in artificial intelligence,” he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China published its plan for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence.
Lee explained that China's National Science Foundation provides funding for people in academic institutions, much like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations provide funding for US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint artificial intelligence center to bring together partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month, DARPA (the Central Organization for Research and Development of the U.S. Ministry of Defense) announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
The National Science Foundation is currently investing more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, US legislation, which was tasked with establishing the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, has not been in place for several months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on change of country's name
Macedonians voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that will avert decades of disagreement with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's European Union and NATO membership requests.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, stresses that its northern neighbour's name implies claims to its territory and has vetoed Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but opposition nationalists insist the change will undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, and the campaign calling for a boycott has raised concerns that the turnout will reach at least the 50% required for a referendum to be valid.
The referendum bulletin asks the question: "Are you in favour of membership in NATO and the EU by concluding an agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying on the way to Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the break-up of Yugoslavia, becoming an organisation such as a member of the EU and NATO.
"I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely, under the cover of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us," Skopje, 79, said.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of MPs have announced that they will take into account the outcome of the vote, which will become decisive.
In order to change the name, a 2/3 majority will be required in the parliament.
The National Electoral Commission informed that no irregularities had been reported until 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the previous parliamentary elections, which saw 66 percent of registered voters.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Josje Tanevski, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko handed over their votes in the referendum in Macedonia on the change of the country’s name, which will open the way to NATO and the European Union, to Strumica on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov, prepared a small stage and arranged chairs next to tents set up by those who boycotted the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to stand with our heads held high, not through the servants' door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a small country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China or Russia, and become part of the Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev claims that NATO membership will trigger the necessary investments in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate exceeds 20 percent.
"I believe that the majority will cast a vote in favour, because more than 80"percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," said Zaev after the voice cast.
He said that the result "yes" "confirms our future".
A poll published by the Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research last Monday showed that 30 to 43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum — less than the required turnout.
In addition, a survey conducted by Macedonia’s Telma TV found that 57 percent of voters planned to vote on Sunday.
70 percent of them said they would vote in favour.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the turnout must be 50 per cent and a second vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first serious blow to the Western-oriented government that came to power last May.
See: Manchester City Sergio Aguero passes through all Brighton defenses to score a goal
Serhio Agvero and Raheem Sterling beat Brighton to a 2-0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Agvero gave the impression that his goal score in the 65th minute was ridiculously easy.
The Argentine forward received a midfield pass at the start of the hand.
He ran between the three Brighton guards and rushed into the freefield.
Then four green shirts besieged Agwero.
He overturned the ball to one defender, then beat several more on the side of Brighton.
Then he made the pass to the left, reaching Sterling.
The English centre striker used his first touch to pass back Agwero, who used the right football boot to beat Brigton's goalkeeper Matthew Ryan by striking the ball on the right side of the net.
"Agvero is struggling with foot problems," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We discussed the game with him for 55, 60 minutes.
That is what happened.
We were lucky that he scored at that time.
However, it was Sterling who secured Sky Blues' initial advantage in the Premier League.
The goal was scored in 29 minutes.
Agvero received the ball deep inside the Brighton area.
He sent the ball with a beautiful shot along the left leg of Leroy Sane's eggs.
It’s a great way to get to know each other better.
The Sky Blues center striker easily put the ball into the net just before crossing the border.
"City" fights with "Hoffenheim" Champions League group matches on Tuesday at 12.55 on Tuesday at the "Rhein-Neckar-Arena" stadium in Zinsheim, Germany.
It’s the same with the rest of the world.
Since the Nationals do not play in the playoffs, there was no reason to re-enter.
However, Scherzer, who is always ready to compete, hopes to take a chance against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the Rockies have a live playoffs. And the Rockies in the Western group of the National League are in the lead with one game against the Los Angeles Dodgers.
The Rockies have squeezed out at least a white card with a 5:2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but have still not won their first title in the division.
"Although we play just like that, at least we can have fun knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team is likely to be the worst I'll ever experience this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to compete?”
The Nationals have not yet announced who will start the game on Sunday, but they are ready to let Sherzer take the shot.
In addition, it is important to note that the use of this product is not recommended for children under the age of 2 years.
The right hand of Washington is 18<0xE2><0x88><0x92>7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 straitjacks for 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump to hold rallies in West Virginia
The President roundly mentioned the situation in which Brett Caveno, the Supreme Court candidate of his choice, has entered, at the same time talking about the importance of the activity of Republican voters in the mid-term elections.
"Everything we have done in November is under threat.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
It's really very, very serious — I'm not a candidate, but I'm actually a candidate, and that's why I'm everywhere and fighting for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "You see this awful, awful group of Democrat radicals taking action right now.
And they are determined to regain power, using all possible means to achieve the goal. You see evil, disgusting actions.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to overstep in order to gain power and control, that's why they want power and control, and we won't give it to them."
Democrats, he said, have taken on the mission of "protest and resist".
"And you have seen it for yourselves in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "rogue, evil, nasty and untrue."
He named Dianne Feinstein, a senator of the Democratic Party of the Senate Justice Committee, to whom viewers responded with loud exclamations.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Hmm, what are we talking about?
No, hmm, wait — it was really bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer prepared for diversity.
It is intolerant of the open
It was no surprise that the Momentum activists in my local party wanted to subject me to censorship.
After all, I am the last in the line of Labour MPs to date to be told that he is not desirable - that is all, because we are not hiding our opinion.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way because she was resolute in her opposition to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the movement for censorship criticised me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
For the importance of economically responsible politics, for national security, for Europe — ironically, but these were issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
A statement on the Labour meeting in East Nottingham on Friday said that 'we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive'.
Most of the meetings that took place during the career of my eight local Labour MPs were exactly that.
Unfortunately, the atmosphere of many meetings today is different and the promises of a "kinder, more gentle" policy have long been forgotten, if ever there were any.
It has become increasingly clear that the Labour Party does not want to tolerate different views, and any view is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
It started shortly after Jeremy took the lead: colleagues who I think share our political views began to expect me to turn 180 degrees and accept opinions that I would never have accepted otherwise, whether it was for national security or a single EU market.
When I speak in public – and it doesn’t matter what I’m saying – there’s a tirade about using social media to call for a ban on running in the next election, denouncing the center’s policies, claiming that I don’t have a place in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments made against me are usually political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who are confronted every day with a stream of sexist and racist insults, but never shy away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how normal exploitation has become.
Jeremy Corbyn announced last week that the Labour Party must cultivate a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer an organisation that is prepared for a multiplicity of views, and with every expression of distrust or change in selection rules, the party is shrinking.
Over the past two years, I have often been advised not to jump on harrows, think about what I am talking about, and then "everything will be fine" with me.
But that's not why I decided to get involved in politics.
Ever since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a student in response to the negligence of the Thatcher government, which literally led my integrated school class to collapse, I have set myself the task of fighting for better public services for those most in need, both as a local councillor and as a government minister.
I have never concealed my political views, not even in the previous elections.
No one in the East of Nottingham had any reason to doubt my position on political issues and in areas where I disagreed with the existing government.
To those who pushed forward the proposal on Friday, I can only say that, at a time when the country is moving decisively towards Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But basically, the only thing I want to say is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether or not they are Labour: I am proud to serve you, and I promise you that no threats of exclusion or reminders that no one is irreplaceable in politics will stop me from doing what I think is best for all of you.

"Ayr" 38 - 17 "Melrose": Unspoiled "Ayr" reaches the top line in the table
The last two attempts may have somewhat confounded the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserve to triumph in this amazingly exciting Scottish Championship game today.
Now they're at the top of the table, the only unbeaten team of ten.
After all, it was both their excellent defense and a much better use of the opportunities that drove the hosts, and coach Peter Murchie has every reason to be satisfied.
“We have been tested in all our games and we are still not defeated, so I have to be happy,” he said.
"Melrose" Robin Christie: "With all due respect to Ayr, they took their chances better than we did."
Grant Anderson's 14th minute attempt by Frazier Climo raised Ayr, but the yellow card to Scottish captain Rory Hughes, where the Warriors had been awarded to the game, changed Melrose's numbers, and Jason Baggott (Jason Baggott) changed the ball.
Klimo increased Ayr's lead with a penalty, right at the end of the halftime, he scored points, then realized a solo attempt, so "Ayr" went on a break of 17-5.
However, Melrose started the half-time with a good game, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, made by Begot, reduced the lag to five points.
Then came a long break, as Ruaridh Knott was severely injured and taken to a stretcher away from the field, but when the game resumed, Ayr made rapid progress when Stafford McDowall made a rehearsal for Klimo.
Ayr's captain Blair Macpherson then received a yellow card, and again, under intense pressure, Melrose used a redundant player, a Bruce Colvine rehearsal that was not carried out.
However, the owners got upset, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for intercepting Klimo without a bomb from the penalty corridor, McPherson made a knockout at the back of the Ayr jetty.
Klimo made the ball, as before, almost from the very beginning, after Kyle Rowe intercepted David Armstrong on the pitch and sent the winger Gregor Henry on his fifth attempt.
"Still Game" Star Seems to Be Planning a New Career in the Restaurant Business
The star of the comedy series "Still Game", Ford Kieran, seems to be planning to engage in the hospitality business, after it was revealed that he was named as the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, which he co-creates and stars with his longtime partner in the comedies Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the next ninth season will be the show's last, and K<0xC4><0xAB>rnan apparently plans his life after Craiglang.
According to official information, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a Scottish Sun source noted that Kiernan planned to engage in Glasgow’s “blooming restaurant business.”
"The sea belongs to us!": Bolivia, stranded on land, hopes that the court will open the way to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrolled the encircled Naval Headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings have raised the blue flags of the ocean.
Naval ships from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are adorned with the motto: "We have a right to the sea.
It is our duty to recover it."
In the landlocked Bolivia, the memory of Chile's lost coastline in the 19th century's bloody resource conflict is still alive, as is the longing to sail again in the Pacific.
These expectations are probably at their highest for several decades, as Bolivia is awaiting a ruling by the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years of scrutiny.
"Bolivia is evolving, it is united in spirit and peaceful, and of course with positive thoughts awaits the outcome," Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla said.
Many Bolivians will be watching the judgment of the International Court of Justice on large screens across the country, hoping that the Tribunal in The Hague will decide in favour of Bolivia's demand that, after decades of intermittent negotiations, Chile be obliged to negotiate a sovereign sea exit for Bolivia.
Bolivia's charismatic indigenous President Evo Morales, who is facing a controversial re-election battle next year, is also keenly interested in Monday's verdict.
"We are close to regaining the Pacific Ocean," he tweeted at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that a court ruling in Bolivia is unlikely and, if passed, will not bring about any major change.
The Netherlands-based UN body does not have the authority to grant Chilean territory, and its representatives have said that they will not determine the possible outcome of the negotiations.
The fact that the International Court of Justice's ruling comes just six months after the final hearing shows that the case "wasn't complicated", explained Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, an international regulatory expert from Chile.
And the last four years have not pushed the Bolivian case forward but, on the contrary, delayed it.
"The question of access to the sea has been misappropriated by the existing Bolivian administration," Zarate said.
Morales' belligerent rhetoric has stifled the rest of good will in Chileans, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the negotiations once and for all, but it will be very difficult to hold a discussion after that.
Both countries have not exchanged envoys since 1962.
The Bolivian representative in The Hague, former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, disagreed that the court ruled unusually quickly.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile" and an opportunity "to put an end to 139 years of conflict for the benefit of both sides," he said.
Kalzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, used the problems of the sea as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"This decision is an opportunity to realize what needs to be done to overcome the past."
North Korea will give up nuclear weapons only when it can be trusted with the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his nation would never be the first to dismantle its nuclear weapons if it could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to honour the promises made at the meeting of the leaders of both countries in Singapore.
His comments came at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared ready to resume stale diplomatic efforts to prevent a nuclear war, more than three months after Singapore met with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
Ri says it is a "fantasy" to hope that the continued US sanctions and reluctance to declare the end of the Korean War will ever force North Korea to kneel.
Washington is wary of agreeing to the declaration before Pyongyang takes significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
However, many are sceptical about whether Pyongyang really wants to give up armament, which the state probably considers the only way to guarantee its own security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for Kim’s next meeting with Trump.
Paris fashion show presents the latest massive headdress line on the way to your nearest High Street
If you want to increase your collection of hats or completely block the sun, then you are in the right place.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of absurd, huge head-wearing items in the spring/summer 2019 collection that dazzled against the backdrop of the style set by Paris Fashion Week.
Strongly impractical hats have flooded "Instagram" this summer, and these designers have sent their staggering achievements to the fashion show.
Valentino’s most outstanding creation was a magnificent beige hat decorated with a feather-like wide edge that swallowed his heads.
Massive accessories included precious watermelons, a magic hat, and even pineapple — but not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also showed a strange selection of masks, just before Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had lips sewn on, and they were more like Hannibal Lecter’s than the high fashion.
One of the formations resembled a diving of breathing minds, with a tube and glasses, while the other resembled a cone of melted ice cream.
And if you want to continue with massive fashion, then the time has come.
Style watchers believe that huge burrows are probably on the way to your closest High Street.
Large hats immediately became popular after "La Bomba" appeared — straw hats with two feet (<0x7E>60 cm) wide edges seem to have worn all, from Rianna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The status of a very impractical hat as a cult object in all social networks led to another big creation on the tongue — a straw beach bag almost as big as a model in a swimsuit carrying it.
A red-yellow raffia bag, finished with raffia fringe and equipped with a white leather handle, took a special place in the "Jacquemus' La Riviera" spring/summer 2019 season collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage explained to FEMAIL: "I expect big hats and beach bags to appear in central business street stores next summer, because the designer has left such a big impression that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for huge-sized accessories."
John Edwards: Language skills are vital for global citizens
The Scottish Independent Schools have a reputation for outstanding educational institutions and have maintained this reputation in 2018, when once again outstanding exam results were obtained, which are further enhanced by individual and collective achievements in sports, arts, music and other community events.
These schools, with a total of 30,000 pupils in Scotland and represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the best level for their pupils and their parents.
Independent schools have set themselves the goal of preparing their students for further and higher education, for their chosen careers and for their lives as citizens of the world.
As an education sector that can design and implement specific school programmes, we see that modern languages are still a popular and desirable subject in our schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a person in a language he understands, it stays in his consciousness.
If you speak his mother tongue, it stays in his heart."
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot simply rely on English when we want to build relationships and gain the trust of people from other countries.
With the recent results of this year's exams, we can see that languages are at the top of the league tables with the largest number of exams passed in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who taught foreign languages achieved the highest score of A.
According to the Scottish Council of Independent Schools, in 74 schools, 72 percent of the students received the highest grade of A in Chinese, and 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent of those who learned French, and 63 percent of those who learned Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language as an optional subject is now as highly valued in the independent school curriculum as in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) group.
A 2014 survey by the British Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17 percent of employers cited a lack of language skills as a reason for not being able to fill vacancies.
As a result, language skills are increasingly becoming a must in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
With the increase in job opportunities that will require language skills, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of their chosen career, learning a foreign language will give them the real advantage of such a long-term skill in the future.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically improve the competitiveness of a multilingual speaker.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent did not speak a foreign language well enough to keep a conversation going, while French was the only language spoken by a double-digit number, 15 percent.
That is why investing in language teaching is important for today's children.
Multilingualism, especially in developing countries, will give children a better chance of meaningful work.
Schools in Scotland differ in the languages they teach.
Some schools will pay more attention to the most common modern languages, while others will teach languages such as Chinese and Japanese, which are considered the most important for Britain’s future, according to plans for 2020.
Whatever your child’s interests may be, independent schools will always have a choice of several languages, and teachers will be experts in the field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a language environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future may be.
Currently, in the global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still vitally important for the future of the country, so this fact must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be considered as "skills for international communication".
Independent schools will continue to offer Scottish young people this choice, diversity and excellence.
Il faut bien le faire (It must be done).
John Edwards is Director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council.
It’s the same with the rest of the world.
The Los Angeles Lakers are set to play the first game of LeBron James.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play against the Denver Nuggets in a preseason game against San Diego on Sunday.
But it remains to be decided exactly how many minutes he will play.
“It’s going to be more than one, but less than 48,” Volton told the Lakers on their official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said on Twitter that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
James was asked about his plans for a series of six pre-season games for the Lakers.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need pre-season games to prepare," he said.
It’s not just a matter of what you do, but what you do.
President Donald Trump today kicks off a series of rallies in Wieling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five Trump rallies planned for next week, including a stop in friendly places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Since the vote on his selection to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court has been suspended, Trump’s goal is to win support in the upcoming interim elections, as there is a risk that Republicans will lose control of Congress after the votes are cast in November.
When will the Trump rally in West Virginia take place today, and how will you be able to watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wieling, West Virginia is scheduled for seven in the evening, after ET today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online on YouTube.
Trump is expected to speak about this week's hearing of Supreme Court candidate Brett Caveno, which has been made tense by sex crimes allegations, and is expected to be voted on by the Senate to postpone confirmation for a week while the FBI investigates.
However, the main purpose of this rally is to help improve the situation of the Republicans, who are expected to vote in November.
As a result, President Trump’s campaign shows that the five rallies next week aim to “activate volunteers and supporters while Republicans seek to protect and increase the majority they hold in the Senate and the House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
"Congressional control is so important to his agenda that the president will visit as much of the state as possible as we enter an active campaign season," a Trump campaigner who did not want to reveal his name told Reuters.
This evening’s rally, which is planned for the Wesbanco Arena in Wiling, will likely attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be reflected in Pittsburgh’s media, West Virginia Metro News reported.
On Saturday, it will be the second time in a month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won with more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Senator candidate Patrick Morrisey, who lags behind according to polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisy that the president should come to help improve his polls,” said Simon Haeder, professor of political science at West Virginia University.
Rider's Cup 2018: The US has demonstrated its determination to fight to keep high expectations for Sunday's singles
After three sessions "in one word" Wednesday afternoon game "foursome" format probably was exactly what is needed for this Rider Cup.
Athletes love to talk about fluctuations in luck, and really believe this, especially in competitions such as these.
So, which side do they think is winning now?
“They were in the lead with six points, but now with four points, so I think that’s kind of what it means to be successful,” said Jordan Spieth.
Europe, of course, has priority, because it is leading with 4 points, and 12 more will be played out.
Spite explained that Americans believe that the wind blows in their sails and they have reason to be optimistic, of course, also in the person of Spite and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each of them can boast three points out of four.
Spit has been destructive from the first blow to the lawn, and is an example of a winner.
Those butt-welcome shouts of victory became louder as his round continued, and a decisive punch was made in the hole to equal the number of beats four times when he and Thomas were two strikes behind.
His punch in the hole, which won their victory 15 , was perceived with a similar cry, from them, for his belief that the American team has not yet been pushed out.
“You really have to dig deep, and worry about your match,” Spite said.
That's all that's left for these players.
18 holes for good luck.
The only players who have scored more points than Spite and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who will undoubtedly go down in the history of this Rider's Cup.
Europe's strange but attractive couple is four points behind and will not be able to do any harm.
Mollywood was the only couple to do without a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and in the last nine holes on Friday morning.
This process and the way in which their energy flows to and from this raging crowd convinces them that they are the players to be won on Sunday, and Fleetwood and Molinari will be the most popular players who can secure a potential European victory when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time in different pits.
However, the talk of a European triumph was premature.
Babba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly dealt with this morning's hero in the format of fourballs Sergio Garcia, who played with Alex Noren.
Bogy and the two double front nines led the Spaniards and the Swedes into trouble, and they were not even close enough to get out of it.
On Sunday, however, there is no one who will help to cope.
Games in the fourball and foursome formats are so exciting to watch in the vicinity because of the interaction of couples, to watch what advice they give and what they do not, and how strategy can instantly change the situation.
Europe has played better as a team so far and is far ahead of the day, but this competition in a foursome format showed that the US team is determined to fight, which many, especially the Stateside, have questioned.
It’s the same with the rest of the world.
The European team will kick off the last day of the Riders Cup with a pleasant lead after Saturday's fourball and foursome matches ended in a lead with 10-6 against the United States.
Inspired couple Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two wins over hardworking Tiger Woods, who increased the score to four for Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team to keep the trophy lost to the Hazeltine two years ago dominated over the inaccurate American team in the morning competition in the format of fourballs, and the result of the series became 3-1.
The U.S. resisted more vigorously in the Foursomes format, winning two games, but was unable to eliminate the deficit.
Jim Furyk needs 8 points in 12 singles on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European first-timer to score four consecutive points with Mollinar, nicknamed Molliwood after a sensational weekend, and is only the second pair in the history of the Rider's Cup to score four points in the first four matches.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs, they beat the tired Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with an even more sensitive 5&4.
Woods, who won two games on Saturday, sometimes scored a great game, but he has lost 19 of his 29 games in fourballs and foursomes, seven in a row.
Justin Rose took a break before the morning game of the fourballs, and returned to partner Henrik Stenson's foursomes to defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka in 2&1.
Europe did not manage to achieve its full potential, even though the day in south-west Paris was pleasant and a light breeze blew.
The three-time winner of the most prestigious golf competition, Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas, set the standard for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They ousted 2&1 against Spanish John Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs and returned later to defeat Polter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 fursomes after losing their first two dimples.
Only twice in the history of the Rider's Cup, the team has played 4 points in singles, but as the owners, the Farika (Furyk) team only has a draw to keep the trophy.
After being in second place for two days, the Sunday counterattack would seem to be problematic.
North Korea says it will “never” disarm unilaterally without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions had deepened its mistrust of the United States, and North Korea would under no circumstances unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho informed the organization’s annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “significant steps of goodwill” over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site and vowing never to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“However, we do not see an adequate response from the United States,” he said.
“If there is no trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our country’s security, and under these circumstances, we will never unilaterally disarm first.”
While Ri reiterated North Korea’s well-known accusations of Washington’s opposition to a “gradual” approach to denuclearization, according to which Korea would be rewarded for taking gradual steps, his statement left an impression because it did not automatically reject unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang had done before.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at a meeting in Singapore on June 12 between the first US president and the North Korean leader, when Kim promised to work for the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" and Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has attempted to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has stated that Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease tough international sanctions on North Korea.
“The U.S. insists that ‘denuclearization must come first,’ and raises the level of pressure from sanctions to achieve the goal by force, even opposing the ‘declaration of the end of the war’,” Ri said.
"The idea that sanctions could put us on our knees is an empty fantasy, cherished by people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions only deepens our mistrust."
Ri was not talking about the intentions regarding the second time Kim met Trump, which the US leader had specifically mentioned in a speech to the United Nations this week.
In his speech, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: "If South Korea were on the other side of the issue of denuclearisation rather than the United States, the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a deadlock."
However, Ri's tone was dramatically different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korea would target the US mainland after "Evil President Trump" called Kim a "missile" on a suicide mission.
This year, at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps toward disarmament, but stressed that more needs to be done and that sanctions must be maintained until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had not scheduled a specific time, stressing that “it doesn’t matter whether it takes two years, three years or five months.”
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its efforts.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the implementation of Security Council sanctions must be vigorously pursued, without mistakes, until a final and credible denuclearization has been achieved."
The Security Council has unanimously tightened sanctions since 2006 in an attempt to reduce funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic weapons programmes.
Pompeo met Ri outside the meetings of the UN General Assembly, and was then informed that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip was not successful.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying progress had been made, but hours later North Korea accused him of "gangster-worthy demands".
During a meeting with Moon earlier this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle the weapons range and the nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
According to him, Kim had informed him that the "appropriate measures" North Korea wants to see are the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard University students will learn a subject about how to relax enough
A new subject at Harvard University this year has made students sleep more, and it’s an attempt to tackle an increasingly popular culture of brutality that includes caffeine-filled study all night long.
One professor found that students at the best universities in the world often do not even have a basic knowledge of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the subject which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to create a new subject after speaking about the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
"In the end, a girl came up to me and asked, "Why am I only being told this now that I'm in my final year?"
She discovered that no one had ever explained to her how important sleep is — what surprised me, he told the Telegraph.
Launched for the first time this year, the subject provides students with basic information on how good sleep habits contribute to learning and sport, as well as improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to introduce a course after learning that students were suffering from a serious lack of sleep during the study week.
The hour-long training process includes a series of interactive exercises.
One of the parts is a picture of dormitory doors where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how performance in sports is affected by lack of sleep and the importance of a bedtime routine.
In another part, students are informed about how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
Then the map of the campus with interactive icons invites participants to reflect on their daily routine.
"We know that this will not immediately change the behavior of students.
But we believe they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know how cigarette smoking will affect health," added Professor Chaser.
He said that a culture that prides itself on being able to study all night still exists and added that modern technology and increasing pressure on students meant that lack of sleep became an increasingly serious problem.
He explained that providing enough quality sleep must be a “secret weapon” for students to fight stress, burnout and anxiety, and even to prevent weight gain, because lack of sleep switches the brain into fasting mode, making them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chaser develop the subject after attending one of his lectures last year, Harvard First Course.
He said the subject opened his eyes and inspired him to make the course available to the entire campus.
He hopes that the next step will be a request for students who obtain a post-graduate education to master a similar program before going to enjoy the competition.
Professor Chaseler advises students to set an alarm not only for the time they get up, but also when they go to bed, as well as keep in mind how people are harmed by the "blue lights" emitted by electronic screens and LED lamps, as they can disrupt the circadian rhythms, making it difficult to fall asleep.
It’s a great way to get to know each other better.
The Rangers had another disappointing game when Dolly Menga beat Steven Gerrard's bewildered team to a loss of 1-0 against the Livingston.
The Ibrox team had hoped to make their first away win since the 4:1 St Johnstone victory on February 1, but Gary Holt's team made Gerard his second loss in 18 games since he became the club's manager, and his team is 8 points away from Scottish Championship leader Hearts.
Menga scored the ball seven minutes before the end of the half-hour, and the Rangers' lack of inspiration didn't seem to come from trying to equalise the result.
The rangers drop to sixth place, while the Livingston advance to third place, ahead of the Hibernian in goal difference.
And the Rangers may have another problem, because Judge Assistant Kalum Spence needed medical attention for a head injury apparently caused by an object thrown from a farthest end.
Gerard made eight changes to his team, which quickly left Ayr behind, reaching the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same 11 Livingston players who took away one point from the Hearts last week, and he would be happy as his well-trained team repressed opponents in every episode.
It is possible that the Rangers managed the ball more often, but the Livingstons made better use of what was their behavior.
They were supposed to score two minutes after Menga's first hand sent Scott Pittman towards Allan McGregor's goal, but the center missed his big chance.
Keaghan Jacobs's free-kick then reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his defending partner, Alan Lithgow, was only able to shoot the ball far past the rear post.
The Rangers took control of the game, but there was an impression that the last third of the game was expected, not believed, to be played.
Alfredo Morelos doubtless believed he should have had a penalty kick in the 15th minute after he had collided with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian's call.
The Rangers only hit two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not particularly bothered, neither Lassana Coulibaly's head-on, nor the modest end of Ovie Ejaria's attack.
In addition, the European Commission has launched a public consultation on the future of the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP).
The Rangers once again did not cope with Jacobs planned a long combination.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher fired a bomb on Scott Robinson, who kept his balance and chose Menga for a simple ending.
Gerard replaced Kulibali with Ryan Kent during a break, and this almost immediately affected the game, as the midfielder sent the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly from his line immediately rushed to block.
But Livingston continued to make the guests play as they like, with Litgov and Halkett taking one long shot after the other.
Holt's team could have continued to lead the final stage, but McGregor played well, stopping Jacobs before Litgov hit the head from the corner.
Glenn Middleton, a replacement for the Rangers, requested another penalty shootout late in the game after he collided with Jacobs, but Tomson again ignored the request.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now the page from our "Sunday Morning" almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today... one day in Germany Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born, who grew up into a physicist.
Geiger developed a method for determining and measuring radioactivity, the result of which, after all, was a device known as the Geiger counter.
In science, the surviving Geiger counter has also taken its place in pop culture, such as in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, in which the main roles were played by the inconclusive cowboy-type scientists Roger and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the fuck is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you'll be able to hear the atoms that are released as a result of the radioactivity produced by these minerals."
Evans: "Yes, it really does!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention named after him continues to live.
A new cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to "see" the evil cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" the evil cells and kill them
As part of the vaccine therapy, the immune system is taught to recognize the evil cells
In this method, the cells of the immune system are extracted from the patient, which are transformed in the laboratory
They would then be able to "see" the protein, which is typical for many malignant tumors, and will be injected back into the body
The pilot vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of malignancies.
A woman who was treated with a vaccine that teaches her immune system how to recognise bad cells experienced ovarian cancer that went away for more than 18 months.
The technique involves extracting cells from the patient's immune system, converting them into a laboratory so that they can ‘see' the HER2 protein, which is characteristic of several cancers, and then injecting them back into the body.
In Bethesda, Maryland, US National Cancer Institute professor Jay Berzofsky said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 “facilitates the growth of several types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung, and colon and rectum cancers, explained Professor Berzovsky.
A similar approach, where immune cells are extracted from the patient and trained to attack malignant tumour cells, has been shown to be effective in one type of leukaemia.
Canie West attacked Trump's critics after visiting the SNL, dressed in a MAGA hat.
It didn't end well
Kanye West was snatched from the Saturday Night Live show after an incoherent performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and announced that he would run in the 2020 presidential election.
After finishing that night's third song, titled "Ghost Town," during which he wore a "Make America Great" hat, he began to flaunt loud phrases about the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"So many times when I talk to white people, they ask, "How can you like Trump? He's a racist!"
Well, if I was worried about racism, then I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
"Saturday Night Live" began with a parody of Matt Damon in the lead role, in which a Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Christine Blasey Ford's sexual assault accusation.
Although it was not broadcast, the material with the West's lamentations was uploaded on social networks by the comedian Chris Rock.
It is not clear if Rock was trying to ridicule West in this way.
And West complained to the audience that he had been mistreated behind the scenes because of his headband.
"They laughed at me behind the scenes!
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat on your head."
They laughed at me!
And they said I'd lost touch with reality," West said, according to the Washington Examiner.
Vest continued, “You want to see what happens when you lose touch with reality?” and promised to put on “your Superman cape” because that means you can’t tell me what to do. Want the world to move forward?
“Try love!”
"Variety" reported that his comments caused whistles from the audience at least twice, but the members of the show team looked embarrassed, and at least one person told the press: "There was complete silence in the studio."
Vesta had been invited at the last minute to replace singer Ariana Grande, who had died a few days earlier from a friend of rapper Mac Miller.
West confused many with the song (I Love it) that he performed in a champagne bottle costume.
The vest was backed by Candace Turner, leader of the conservative TPUSA group, who tweeted: "To one of the strongest men in the spirit: THANK YOU FOR NOT PUTTING!"
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply "who he was, and that's wonderful."
"But I choose not to reward a person (by buying his music or clothes, or by supporting his 'art') who I believe supports and bars himself with an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And we, too," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he had now become "a being previously known as Kanji West".
He is not the first artist to change his name, and acts like Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, used to be Snoop Lion, and of course the late music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol, but then to "a stage artist who used to be known as Prince".
It’s not just a matter of how much money you’re spending.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The police said the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be dealt with by the Public Prosecution Service.
"Game of Thrones" star Kit Harrington turns against toxic masculinity
Kit Harrington is known as the sword-wielding John Snow in HBO's brutal medieval fantasy series The Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor has turned to the stereotype of the brutal hero, saying that such characters on the screen often make young boys think that they need to be strong to be respected.
In a conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit explained that he thought there was a "problem" and asked how to deal with toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Other, who recently married his "Game of Thrones" partner Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, admitted that this problem is important to him.
"I can't help but think about the mistakes we've made with masculinity," he said.
"What do we teach young men in the face of this problem as they grow up in the face of the existing problem?"
Others believe that television, with its very masculine characters, may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity.
He continued, "What is innate, but what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the streets that makes young boys feel like they need to be treated like men?
I think that is one of the most important questions of our time: how can we change this?
Because there are clearly problems with young men."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in any sequels or prequels to the Game of Thrones, after the series ends next summer, stressing that "the battlefields and horses are fed up."
Starting in November, Kit will play the lead role in Sam Shepard's restored True West, the story of a film producer and his brother-robber.
The actor recently admitted that he considers his meeting with his wife Rose as the best thing that happened to him as a result of the "Game of Thrones".
“I met my wife on this show, so it kind of secured my present family and my life from then on,” he said.
The Rose Emmy Award-winning fantasy series was played by Igrita, the beloved Igrita of John Snow, the other character.
The couple married in June 2018 on the property of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China announced that the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS has risen sharply by 14%.
Health officials report that more than 820,000 people have been affected in the country.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases were the result of sexual intercourse, indicating a change.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of the transfusion of infected blood.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has dropped to almost zero, health officials in Yunnan province said at a conference.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased to 100 000 from year to year.
HIV transmission as a result of sexual intercourse is an acute problem for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be common.
Given the conservative values of the state, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have had sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the cases of transmission of sexually transmitted diseases are the result of insufficiently protected sex in this relationship.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of measures to address the problem.
Max Waters denies employee leaked Republican senators' data, sharply turns to "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
US House of Representatives Maxine Waters on Saturday denied claims that her staff member had published personal information from three Republican senators on Wikipedia.
The Los Angeles Democrat insisted the claims were being spread by "ultra-right" newsrooms and websites.
“Lie, lie, and more despicable lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information reportedly includes residential addresses and phone numbers belonging to U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information was released online on Thursday by an unknown congressman during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct by Supreme Court nominee Bret Caveno.
The leak occurred some time after three senators had questioned Caveno.
Conservative, Internet sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the origin of the recordings was linked to Waters cabinet, and revealed information about Waters staff, Hills reported.
“This unsubstantiated claim is absolutely false and utterly false!” insisted Waters.
"A member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised by these fraudulent and false allegations is not in any way responsible for the information leak.
This unsubstantiated statement is absolutely false and utterly false!"
Waters' announcement soon sparked online criticism, including from the former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This is an angry denial," wrote Fleischer.
"This leads to the conclusion that her temperament does not correspond to a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, that person should not be angry.
He must not be belligerent.
He may not speak on the accuser's motives.
He must be calm and calm."
Fleischer's task was to compare Waters' reaction to the Democratic fall for Judge Caveno, who was accused of being too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate who is standing to get Waters to lose her seat in the midterm elections, also expressed his views on Twitter.
"Great if true," he wrote.
Waters said in a statement that her cabinet had warned officials and law enforcement agencies of the allegations.
“We will ensure that those responsible will be identified,” she continued, “and that they will be held legally responsible for all of their actions, which are destructive and dangerous for any of my staff.”
"Johnny Anglis 3" review — halfway through Rovan Atkinson's parody of spy movies
It has become customary to look for an association with Brexit in every new British-flavored film, and this seems to apply to this one, too, which has revived the Johnny English comedy-adventure franchise, which began in 2003 with "Johnny England" and was reborn in 2011 with "Johnny England Returns".
Is a toothless satire about ourselves, about how obviously hopeless we are, a new export opportunity for our nation?
In any case, incompetent Johnny Anglis, with his eyes and unusually moving face, has the right to create a mess after the second revival — his name more than anything else signals that he is a wide-ranging comic character, designed for territories where consumers do not speak English.
He is, of course, the silly secret agent who, despite his strange claims to charming sophistication, is a little Kluzo, a little bit Mr. Bean, and a little bit of that guy who plays one note in the music of the "Chariot of Fire" theme at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
He is also based on the traveler and international, incomprehensible character that Atkinson once portrayed in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, in which he left chaos on his way.
The latest Johnny English adventure has at least one or two nice moments.
I liked the place where Johnny Anglis goes to a helicopter dressed in medieval armor, and the propeller blades for a moment slap against his helmet.
Atkinson's ability to visually make a comic impression is well seen, but the humor is rather weak and strange superficial, especially because "serious" movie brands such as "007" and "Mission Impossible" themselves confidently use comedy as one of the components.
Humor gives the impression that it is dedicated to children rather than adults, and in my opinion Johnny English’s absurd troubles are not as creative and purposeful as Atkinson’s silent film tricks in Bean’s skin.
As usual, everything is based on the fact that Britain is in serious trouble.
The hacker has hacked into the UK’s super-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all British agents in the field, disdainful to an active agent — a wretchedly small role played by Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the prime minister, the pompous and conflict-ridden person, who has already lost all political popularity: Emma Thomson is doing her best, with characters partly similar to Teresa May, but there is not much to work with in the scenario.
Her intelligence advisers say that since all the active spies have come to light, she will have to call someone who has already retired.
And this man is inept Johnny Anglis, who now works as a teacher in a fine educational institution, and quietly teaches how to work as a secret agent (a couple of fun jokes), because Anglis offers to learn the spy profession from the ground up.
The Englishman is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and is reunited with his former victim-assistant, Bo, again played by Ben Miller.
Bo is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, a fun character that only becomes important at the end of the film — a role in which Vicki Pepperdine has not been fully exploited.
And so Batman and Robin are back in Her Majesty’s Secret Service and meet Olga Kurylenko’s portrayal of the beautiful, fateful woman, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime ministers are dangerously bewitched by the charismatic technology billionaire, evil Jason Walt, portrayed by Jack Lacy, who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer mess.
England and Bo begin their odyssey of wild fun: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a fine French restaurant; they create confusion to sneak into Volt’s luxury yacht; and England unleashes absolute chaos, trying to use virtual reality on the head display to explore the interior of the Volt building.
Everything possible is done for the ending, but no matter how attractive and crazy the film is, it contains a lot of elements of children's television.
Lots of moderate elements.
As in the case of other Johnny English films, I cannot help but think that the British film industry could give Rovan Atkinson a role that would take full advantage of his talent.
Labour denies plans to work four days a week, but gets paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is about to discuss a radical plan under which Britons will work four days a week and receive a salary of five.
It is reported that the party wants business leaders to use the AI revolution to save money by giving employees another holiday.
In this case, employees will be able to enjoy a three-day weekend while receiving the same salary as before.
Sources say that the idea will "respond" to the party's economic agenda and plans to change the economy for the benefit of the workers.
The transition to a four-day working week has been supported by the Trades Union Congress, which sees it as an opportunity for workers to benefit from economic change.
A senior Labour official told The Sunday Times: "The policy changes are expected to be announced by the end of this year.
"It won't happen in one day, but the four-day working week is an idea that fits the party's goal of balancing the economy for the benefit of the workers, as well as the party's overall strategy for the industry."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party had already promised to introduce a four-day working week in the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party as such does not support these aspirations at the moment.
A Labour spokesman said: "The four-day working week is not part of party politics and the party is not considering it."
Shadow Cabinet Minister John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to give shape to his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. MacDonald explained that he was determined to take away power from the "mass of directors" and the "speculants" of the public service companies.
The shadow cabinet minister’s plans also mean that the existing average owners of shares in water companies may not recover their entire package, because the Labour government could implement a “deduction” due to the injustice.
He also approved plans to incorporate working company boards and create exclusive Ownership Funds to allocate 10% of the capital of private sector companies to employees who receive up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 in dividends each year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy answer '60 Minutes', could the FBI's investigation into Caveno change their mind
The FBI investigation of the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least one week, raising the question whether the office's findings could lead a Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview Sunday, 60 Minutes reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could uncover anything that would force them to change their minds.
Kennedy left the impression of a more open person than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, of course," Kennedy replied.
"I said, turning to the hearing procedure, I said that I had spoken to Judge Cavano.
I called him after it happened, when the accusation became known, and I said, "Did you do that?"
He was determined, direct and unambiguous."
It’s the same with the rest of the world.
"I have made a decision on Bret Caveno and a devastating indictment will be needed," he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but here’s what I know: Brett resolutely denied it,” Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of her named were able to confirm it.
The event is 36 years old.
I don’t think there will be any changes.”
What is the World Festival of Citizens and has it done anything to alleviate poverty?
This Saturday, New York City will host the World Citizens Festival, an annual music event with an impressive number of stars and an equally impressive mission: to reduce poverty in the world.
This is the festival’s seventh year, with tens of thousands of people attending the World Citizen’s Festival, not only to enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson’s, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event’s true purpose, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
Launched in 2012, the Global Citizen Festival is an event created by the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by attracting more and more people who are actively fighting poverty.
In order to receive a free ticket to this event (unless there was a desire to pay for a VIP ticket), concert attendees had to complete a number of tasks or “activities”, for example, to do voluntary work, send an e-mail to a world leader, make a phone call or any other important activity to raise awareness of ending poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen movement been, with 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way to persuade people to take action, or is it just another case of so-called "cligivism" where people feel they really have a say in signing an online petition or sending a Twitter message?
The Global Citizen movement claims that since 2011 it has registered more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, trying to achieve various goals.
It reports that these actions have helped world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group referred to 390 commitments and statements resulting from its activities for which at least USD 10 billion has already been disbursed or funded.
The group estimates that the funds allocated so far have directly affected almost 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include "The Power of Nutrition", a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers committed to "helping children grow up to maturity", pledging to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, other governments and citizens of the world like you, we can leave a legacy of malnutrition in the history of social injustices,” said Tracey Ullman of The Power of Nutrition at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 measures had been launched calling on the UK government to provide mothers and children with better nutrition, the government had announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will provide nutrition for 5 million women and children.
Answering one of the most frequently asked questions on your website - "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen commented: "It will be a long and long road, where we will stumble and fail at times.
However, just as the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us have done, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are some of the artists who will perform at this year’s event in New York, hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use its war fleet to block Russia’s energy exports, Interior Minister says
"If necessary," said US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke, as quoted by the Washington Examiner, "Washington could use its war fleet to thwart the entry of Russian energy into the market, including in the Middle East."
Zinke argued that Russia’s activities in Syria, especially in places where it operates under the legitimate government’s invitation, are a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reason it is in the Middle East is that it wants to supply energy in the same way as it does in Eastern Europe, in the southern part of Europe," he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means of dealing with it.
"The United States, through its navy, can ensure that maritime routes are open and, if necessary, block them so that Russia cannot bring its energy to the market," he said.
Zinke turned to the public who had come to attend an event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organisation that calls itself the "voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with the situation in Russia and Iran, stating that they are in fact the same.
"The economic opportunity for Iran and Russia is more or less the use and replacement of fuel," he said, while referring to Russia as a country whose economy depends mainly on fossil fuels.
It is claimed that the Trump administration is promoting liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia as the cheapest option for European consumers.
For this reason, Trump administration officials, as well as US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, would make Berlin "independent" from Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which would double the capacity of the existing gas pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin believes that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is simply based on economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we agree that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose a supplier," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The United States has expressed its opposition to Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), has called on the US to refrain from engaging in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem if a third country interferes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider her candidacy for the 2020 presidential election
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she was seriously considering running for president after midterm elections.
During a council meeting in Holoka, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering running for president.
"It's high time that there were women in Washington who would 'restore' the incomplete government, which includes female presidents," she said in a statement carried by The Hill newspaper.
"After November 6, I will carefully consider my candidacy in the US presidential election."
During the council meeting, Warren referred to President Donald Trump as "leading this country in the wrong direction".
"I am deeply disturbed by what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren has openly criticized Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Caveno.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said: "Of course, we need an FBI investigation before the election."
However, a survey published on Thursday revealed that most of Warren’s supporters do not believe she should run in the 2020 election.
According to a poll conducted by the Center for Political Research at the University of Suffolk/Newspaper Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of the "possible" voters in Massachusetts claimed that a senator should not stand for election.
Thirty-two percent supported this decision.
The results of the survey revealed that former Governor Dewal Patrick received more support, receiving 38 percent for standing for election and 48 percent against.
In addition to the potential candidates for the 2020 election, high-profile Democratic Party figures include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
The Associated Press reported that Biden had pledged to make a formal decision by January.
Sarah Palin quotes Trek Palin at PTSD Donald Trump rally
Trek Palin spent a year in Iraq following his conscription into military service in September.
On Monday evening, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through, what he is going through after he comes back, I can extend to other families facing the consequences of PTSD and a certain amount of vulnerability that our soldiers are returning to," she told the audience at Donald Trump's rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "an obvious problem that everyone pretends not to see" and said of his son and other war veterans that "they come back a little differently, they come back fortified, they come back wondering if what their fellow soldiers and pilots, as well as all the other members of the military, have given to this country is respected."
According to Den Bennett of the Vasil Police Department, he was arrested on Monday in Vasil, Alaska, on charges of domestic violence against women and possession of a weapon while intoxicated.
18 States, District of Columbia Challenges New Asylum Policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the legal challenge of a new US policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the District of Columbia provided a brief statement to a court advisor in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker who faced obstacles posed by the policy, NBC News reported.
The applicant’s full name, Grace v. Sessions, in the case brought by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy in August, is not disclosed.
She claimed that her partner "and the sons of his violent gang companion" abused her, but US officials rejected her request for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
State attorneys supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, where a large proportion of U.S. asylum seekers come from, as countries where gangs and domestic violence are a common problem.
The new U.S. asylum policy changed the 2014 decision of the Immigration Appeals Board, which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney Carl Racin said Friday that the new policy “ignores the national, federal and international laws that have been enacted for decades.”
“Federal law requires that all requests for asylum be dealt with on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the claim in question, and such an obstacle violates this principle,” the court advisor said in a brief statement.
In addition, the lawyer stated in his presentation that policies that deny immigrants entry into the country harm the US economy, because these immigrants are likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary workforce".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions asked immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang abuse.
“Asylum is available to people who leave their home country because of persecution or fear related to their race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion,” Sechon said in his 11 June policy statement.
Asylum has never been designed to solve all the problems, even all the serious problems, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts Palu, the number of deaths doubled in the search for survivors
The situation for the survivors became more and more difficult.
"The situation is very tense," said 35-year-old Reese Kusum, consoling her hectic baby in the evacuation centre of the devastated town of Palu.
“Every minute, the ambulance service brings in new victims.
Clean water is a deficit."
The inhabitants were visible as they returned to their destroyed homes, sipping their water-soaked belongings and trying to save everything they had found.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals affected by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had a fractured spine and shoulder, were sleeping outside Palu Army Hospital, where patients were being cared for outdoors due to the persistently strong aftershocks.
His eyes filled with tears as the powerful earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to escape.
I think I was printed in the ruins of the wall," Harry told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the city for the wedding.
"I heard my wife call for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they are safe."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of Attempts to Intimidate Us by Using Propaganda Advertisements
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad highlighting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to an addendum paid by the China Daily to Iowa's best-selling newspaper, the Des Moines Register, accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 US Congressional elections, but China denies it.
Trump's indictment that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US election marked what US officials told Reuters was a new stage in Washington's growing campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is perfectly normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently mired in an escalating trade war, with the result that they impose a series of tariffs on each other's imports.
At the beginning of the trade war, China's repressive tariffs were directed against exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported the Trump Republican Party, said Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former long-term governor of Iowa, a large exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote an opinion for Sunday's Des Moines Register claiming that China "now doubles this intimidation by placing propaganda ads in our own free press."
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America’s tradition of free speech and free press by placing a paid ad on the Des Moines Register,” he wrote.
"On the other hand, you will find a limited number of dissenting opinions here at a regular Beijing news kiosk, and you will not see the true reflection of such dissenting views that Chinese citizens may have about China's worrying economic trajectory, given that the media here are under the strict control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most influential Chinese newspapers avoided publishing" his article, but he did not specify which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn of Republicans alienating female voters from mid-term elections involving the Kaveno scandal
As many leading Republicans support and defend Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, against whom several allegations of sexual violence have been made, analysts have warned that they will face a negative reaction, especially from women, in the upcoming mid-term elections.
The emotions associated with it have been extremely high, and it can be seen that the majority of Republicans have already been ready to give up their voice.
Such cases cannot be reversed, "Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill newspaper on Saturday.
Richard doubts that Senator Jeff Flake’s (R-Arizona) last-minute encouragement to investigate the FBI will be enough to appease angry voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday, and they won't forget it tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and representative of the MoveOn progressive movement, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters in the Senate entrance hall demonstrated "November is coming!" when the Republicans in charge of the Judiciary Committee chose to continue with Kaveno's nomination despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"The level of democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be very high," independent political analyst Stu Rothenberg told the news site.
"People say it's already at a high level, that's true.
But it could be even higher, especially between fickle suburban voters and younger voters (aged 18-29), who often don't go to the polls even if they don't like the president."
Even before Ford’s public testimony, in which she made allegations of sexual violence from the Supreme Court candidate, analysts cite the possibility of failure if the Republicans continued to nominate this candidate.
"This has become a mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, according to NBC News earlier this week.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote, or whether Caveno is going to be convicted, it's also about how the Republicans have handled the situation and how they have treated him," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, told the news channel.
However, it seems that the Americans are somewhat divided about what to believe, according to the testimonies of Ford and Cavano, a little more inclined to believe the latter.
According to a new YouGov survey, 41 percent of respondents are certain or mostly inclined to believe Ford's testimony, while 35 percent say they are certain or mostly inclined to believe Cavano's testimony.
In addition, 38 percent said that Caveno may or may have lied about his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
The Guardian reported that the FBI is currently investigating Ford’s allegations and at least one other indictment, Deborah Ramirez, at Fleeke’s urging.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kaveno, at the age of 17, had been sexually assaulted while drunk.
Ramireza claims that the candidate for the position of a judge of the Supreme Court during his studies in Yale in the 1980s showed her his genitals at a party.
Global web inventor plans to launch new internet to take over Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a project that could compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend "Inrupt" is a company based on the Berners-Lee open-source platform "Solid".
"Solid" allows users to choose where to store their data and which people are allowed to access what information.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, Burners-Lee joked that Inrupt's hidden intention was to "dominate the world."
"We have to do it now," he said of the start-up.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses "Solid" technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data storage" or PTD.
It can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
This is the same as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available in the same browser at the same time.
The personal online storage of data is unique in that only the user determines who and what kind of information can be accessed.
The company refers to this as "personal authority through data".
According to CEO John Bruce, Inrupt’s idea is to provide the company with the resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently operates Burners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some freelance developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer encoders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world could build their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Burners-Lee said he and his team aren’t talking to Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete change by completely turning all their business models around overnight.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In an article published Saturday by Medium, Burners-Lee said Inrupt’s “mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new Solid-based web.”
In 1994, Burners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating the Global Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Burners-Lee has had an influential voice in the net neutrality debate.
Even after the Inrupt launch, Burners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the Global Web Consortium, the Global Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm really optimistic about this new era of the web," added Burners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: commemoration of the Victoria Cross awarded to the clergyman during World War I
For 100 years, the only clergyman of the Church of England has received the Victoria Cross as a fighter during the First World War.
The honorable Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Wen received this award on 29 September 1918 in connection with the attack on Bellenglis and Lehaucotte.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper, so he never learned of the highest British military award he had received.
At Saturday's parade in Rashden, Northamptonshire, his two grandsons discovered a commemorative stone dedicated to him.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "excellently symbolic" that such a stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather received the major award.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Wen led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through very thick fogs and large fires caused by cannons and machine guns."
Later, he hurried to the shooting line and guided the line forward with the greatest courage before taking over the cannon zone, where he defeated three factions.
Lieutenant-Colonel Wen was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Wen (72) said that his grandfather's action was "something I would never be able to do, and which is also a very humble act at the same time".
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath on the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band after the parade.
Michael Wen stated that he felt "glorified to be part of this parade" and added that "the value of a true hero is demonstrated by the support provided by many people".
MMA fans waited all night for Bellator 206, but instead welcomed Piggy Peppa
Imagine spending the whole night upstairs to see Bellator 206, but in the end you're not allowed to watch this main event.
The San José poster included 13 fights, including six on the main map, broadcast live all night on Channel 5 in the United Kingdom.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were about to confront each other, viewers in the UK were unpleasantly surprised by the switch to Piggy Pepp.
Some were really puzzled when they stayed awake all night until early dawn, waiting for the battle.
A fan on Twitter described the change of the broadcast to a children's cartoon as a "unsuccessful joke."
"The government has determined that after 6.00 this type of content is unacceptable, so the switch to a children's program took place," Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communication, explained the switch.
"Piggy Peppa," "yes."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said he would work on scheduling so that viewers in the UK could see the shows in the future.
“When we think about retransmission, I think we can sort it out somehow,” Cocker said.
"But the clock is there at six o'clock in the morning on Sunday, and we won't be able to solve the problem by Sunday after our time and Monday after their time.
But we are working on it.
Believe me, after switching the transmission, a lot of texts appeared, and they were not positive.
We tried to prevent it because we thought it was a technical failure.
But it was not. It was controlled by the government.
I can promise you that next time there will be no such problems.
We will stick to five fights instead of six (as it has been so far). We tried to please the fans, but overdid it.
This is an unfortunate situation."
“Desert Island Discs”: Tom Dale didn’t feel good enough because of his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality, but that motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old man did not realize that "not everyone is like me" until he started attending high school.
During his visit to the first Radio 4 program "Desert Island Discs", led by Lauren Laverne, he mentioned that he had begun talking about homosexual rights in order to give others "hope".
He also mentioned that becoming a parent made him worry less about winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the permanent director of the long-term programme, has gone on a several-month holiday due to illness.
When appearing as an outcast in Laverne's first program, Dale said that as you grow up, you feel "less valuable" than others because "it's not accepted in society that girls and boys alike can like you."
He said: "To this day, the feeling that I'm not as good as others, or that I'm different, has been the main driving force that has given me the strength and stamina to succeed."
He said he wanted to prove there was "something" so people wouldn't be disappointed when they finally learned about his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze medallist has become a high-profile LGBT campaign manager and used his appearance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on even more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he decided to speak to the public because he felt happy that he could live openly and uncomplicated, and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man, US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, "surprised the unprepared".
Dayly married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year and said the age gap has never been an obstacle.
"When you have gone through so many things at such a young age" (his first Olympic Games were at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later), it is difficult to find someone at your age who would have experienced similar peaks and falls.
The couple became parents to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley claimed that his "whole perspective" had changed.
“A year ago, all that was important to me was getting a gold medal,” he said.
"Do you know what? There are more important things in life than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son Robert has the same name as his father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley mentioned that his father did not want to accept that he was dying, and one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets for the 2012 London Olympics, where he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him that she wouldn't be in the front row anymore," he said.
“I held his hand until he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing and was dead did I finally admit that he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, he competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I just knew that this was what I had been dreaming of all my life - to plunge in front of the hostess at the Olympics. There was no better feeling than that," he said.
It also inspired his selection of his first song, "Proud" by Heather Small, which resonated with him on his way to the Olympics and continues to infuse gooseskin.
The Desert Island Discs programme can be heard on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11.15 a.m. British Summer Time.
It’s a great way to get to know each other better.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record playing his 47th Rider's Cup hand on Sunday, but will need to change his strategy to avoid an unfortunate turn of events.
For the 12th time in a two-year championship, Mikelson was dropped by Captain Jim Furyk on a bench for Saturday's four-ball and two-pair games.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as has so often been the case with the US teams, the five-time winner split his day, acting both as a supporter and playing in his game with the hope of correcting what was troubling him.
Since the 48-year-old golfer has never been the most accurate player, even at the height of his career, he is not the best candidate for the tense Le Golf National on the rough ground, where inaccurate kicks are regularly punished.
And if the game itself isn’t scary enough, Mikelson will fight the exact British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with young Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind by starting 12 singles games, successfully advance to the lead, the Mikelson match could prove to be crucial.
Furik expressed his confidence in his teammate without words.
"He was fully aware of his role today, clapped me on the back, put his hand around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furick said.
"He is very confident in himself.
He is an outstanding athlete who has given so much to these teams in the past and this week as well.
I guess I didn't imagine him playing in two matches.
I was more imaginative, but everything went wrong, and that is what we will take into account.
He wants to be out there like everyone else."
Mikelson will pass the record of Nick Faldo for the most played match in the Rider's Cup on Sunday.
This could mark the end of a career in the Rider's Cup that has never quite coincided with the heights of his individual record.
Mikelson had 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Furick claimed that his presence gave the team some intangible benefits.
“He’s cheerful, sarcastic and witty, he likes to have fun about people, and he’s a great teammate,” he explained.
“I think the younger players liked to tease him this week as well, which was fun to watch.
He gives much more than just a game."
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European national team, knows that the remarkable lead can quickly fade away
Captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn of the European team knows from experience that a significant lead in the fight for the Rider's Cup in the last day's singles can easily turn into an unpleasant situation.
Dane made his debut at the 1997 Valderram, where the opposing team, led by Seve Ballesteros, scored a five-point lead over the Americans, but only now made it to the finish line with a very small lead of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a great lead in Valderram; we had a lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and Valderram, where we won, but only with a slight lead,” said Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn (pictured), watching the 2018 Graduation Group win with 5–3 on both Friday and yesterday, taking the lead with 10–6 on the golf course at Le Golf National.
In this way, history will show me and every member of that team that nothing is over.
Tomorrow you will give yourself everything.
Go on the field and show your best performance!
It will not expire until the points you have earned are visible on the screen.
Our goal is to get this trophy and we will focus on it.
I've said all the time that I'm focused on the 12 players who are on our side, but we know very well who is on the other side of us, the greatest players in the world."
Relaxed by the performance of his players on the golf course, Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn added: "I never rejoiced too early.
There are new challenges tomorrow.
Tomorrow is an individual game, and that's a completely different thing.
It’s great to have a partner at your side when things are going well, but in individual matches your golfer skills are fully tested.
This message must be conveyed to your players so that they can give their all in the next day’s game.
Now you leave your partner, and he, too, must go to show his best performance."
Unlike Bjorn's opponents, Captain Jim Furick will make sure that his players show their best performance in individual matches rather than partner matches, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furick himself has been on both sides of these major tournaments of the last few days, both as part of the winning team in Brooklyn and after suffering a defeat when European teams achieved a sensational success, later known as "Miracle at Medinah" in the golf world.
"I remember every damn word," he said in response to how Ben Crenshaw, captain of the 1999 team, brought his players together for the last day's fight.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you'd like to get straight to the fast-fire you experienced in Brooklyn, which you experienced in Medina.
When such an impulse is transmitted in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the mid-game.
We made our own line-up and lined up the guys in the way we thought we were right. Let's try some spell tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the counterattack, and he ranked Rory McIlroy for the main game and the Europeans Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood in the first part of the list, and Ian Poulter.
"I put the guys in that order because I think it fits best in the tournament," Bjorn said of the singles.
It’s time to start thinking about your future.
The latest frigate of the German Navy was due to be put into service in 2014, thus replacing the aging Cold War-era warships, but this will not happen at least until next year due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the Rhineland-Pfalz, the main ship of the German frigate class in Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, the newspaper Die Zeit reported, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to join the navy in 2014, but the unpleasant post-delivery problems affected the fate of the ambitious project.
Four vessels of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class, commissioned by the naval fleet as far back as 2007, will be replaced by frigates of the outdated Bremen class.
They are expected to be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signal reception.
Other key features include longer maintenance periods – it should be possible to deploy the new frigates up to two years away from the ports where they are registered.
However, the continuous delay means that the warships of the latest technology, which would allow Germany to demonstrate its power in overseas countries, will already be obsolete by the time they enter into service, note Die Zeit.
The unsuccessful frigate F125 last year was noticeable in all headlines when the German navy officially refused to put the ship into service and sent it back to the shipyard "Blohm & Voss" in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the navy returned the ship to the shipyard after it was delivered.
Little was known about the reasons for this move, but the German media cited a number of significant "software and equipment defects" that would render the warship useless if it were used on a combat mission.
Software weaknesses were a particularly important factor, as the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class of ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 seamen, which is only half of the senior Bremen-class frigate personnel.
Also, it turned out that the ship has too much weight, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the navy to make its improvements in the future.
The 7000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to be twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by Germany during World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the costs of the whole project (including crew training) also became a major problem.
It is said to have cost EUR 3.1 billion instead of the EUR 2.2 billion initially envisaged.
The problems associated with the new frigates are becoming particularly relevant in the light of recent warnings that the German navy is shrinking.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the Defence Committee of the German parliament, admitted that the navy really "begins to run out of usable ships".
The official stated that over time, this problem has significantly increased, since the old ships are taken out of service, but no new ones are delivered on site.
He regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class had joined the fleet.
"National Trust" listens to the secret life of bats
The new study, conducted on a Scottish Highland property, aims to uncover how bats use the landscape in their food search.
The findings are expected to shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and to assist in their future protection measures.
Scottish National Trust scientists will study dwarf bats, pygmy bats as well as brown long-tailed bats and water bats in the Invereves Gardens in Westeros.
Special recorders will be placed in the main locations of the property, which will track the activities of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
Sound experts will analyze all recordings to determine the frequency of bat calls and which species perform specific actions.
A habitat map and report will then be developed to create a detailed landscape view of the behavior of the bats.
NTS nature conservation advisor Rob Dewar hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are the most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help to identify the benefits of habitat management activities such as grassland creation and how best to conserve forests for bats and other related species.
Over the last century, the bat population in Scotland and the United Kingdom has declined significantly.
These lands are under threat from construction and development work on hiding and loosing bats.
Wind generators and lighting can also pose risks, as can fly-paper and chemical treatments for some building materials, as well as cat attacks.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes during hunting.
They use a sophisticated echo-location technique to locate insects and obstacles along their flight path.
The NTS, responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land across the country, takes the bat problem very seriously.
The organisation has at its disposal ten trained experts who carry out regular surveys, checks of bat hideouts and sometimes even rescue operations.
The organization has even created Scotland's first and only bat-specific Threee Reserve, owned by Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Property manager David Thompson says the area is ideal for bats.
"Here's a great place for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and a generally suitable habitat.
But there are still plenty of things we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us better understand what they need to survive."
He stresses that it is important to check if bats are staying in the area before carrying out maintenance work, as it may happen that one female hideout kills up to 400 females and their offspring, possibly destroying the entire local population.
Bats are protected animals and should not be killed, tortured, disturbed or destroyed in their hiding places.
Elizabeth Ferrell of the Scottish Bat Conservation Trust has called on the public to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about bats, and for several of their species, we just don't know how they are doing."
Ronaldo Rejects Rape Charges, Appointing Lawyers to Sue German Magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has denounced the rape allegations against him as "fake news", saying people "want to pay attention" to him using his name.
His lawyers are assigned to sue the German news magazine "Der Spiegel", which published these allegations.
The Portuguese-Turin Juventus star is accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He is said to have paid the woman $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
A few hours after making these claims, Ronaldo, 33, approached his 142 million followers via an Instagram online video, calling this information "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
"What they are claiming today is fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said in a statement.
"They want to become famous by using my name.
This is normal.
They want to become famous at the expense of my name, it's part of my job.
I'm a happy person and everything is fine," the player added with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for what they described as “unacceptable reporting based on suspicion in the area of privacy.”
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damage to an extent consistent with the gravity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of a person's rights in recent years."
The incident took place in June 2009 in the Palms Hotel and Casino suite in Las Vegas.
According to documents filed with the County Court of Clark, Nevada, Ronald and Majorga went back to the player’s hotel room after dating at a nightclub, where he raped a woman anal.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the incident and said that he was "99 percent "good boy", but fell into the temptation of this "one percent".
It’s a great way to get to know each other better.
Majorga also claims to have gone to the police and had photographs taken of her injuries taken at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "fear of revenge" and worried about "public humiliation".
A 34-year-old woman says she does not want to accept the terms of the settlement because the incident left a lasting trauma.
It is important to note, however, that this is not the first time that the Commission has adopted a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to asbestos.
Brexit: UK 'to regret forever' loss of automakers
"The UK will 'regret it forever' if it loses its position as world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit," said business secretary Greg Clark.
He is "disturbed" by the fact that Toyota UK has told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, it will temporarily suspend production at the Burnaston plant near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker said that border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could put the workplace at risk.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota models Auris and Avensis, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“In my opinion, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our factory will be halted,” said Toyota’s managing director in Burnaston, Marvin Cooke.
Other UK carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, are concerned about leaving the EU without a deal and how cross-border trade will work.
For example, BMW says it will close its mini-factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
According to the carmakers, the main concern is the supply chain at risk if no agreement is reached after Brexit.
Toyota’s production line operates on a catch-the-eye basis, where custom-made cars receive parts every 37 minutes from both UK and EU suppliers.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be disturbances at the border, which could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
According to the company, Toyota would not be able to detain more than one day's worth of inventory at its Derbyshire plant, so production would have to be halted.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's plan for withdrawal from the EU was "precisely calculated to avoid such checks at the border".
"We need an agreement. We want the best agreement, which would allow, as I would say, not only to benefit at the moment, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's "Today" program.
“The proof of this, not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, is that we need to be able to fully pursue the very successful supply chain strategy.”
Toyota was unable to say how long production could be halted, but warned that rising costs in the long run would reduce the plant's competitiveness and ultimately threaten jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and works at the factory as a union coordinator, said his comrades were becoming increasingly nervous: “I can tell from experience that once a position disappears, it doesn’t come back.”
The government representative said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."

Donald Trump’s key meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed for another week” as the fight against Supreme Court judge candidate Bret Caven continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees special adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election meddling, the link between Trump’s use of funds and Russia, and the president’s alleged disregard for the rule of law.
For months in Washington, it has been rumored whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general and threaten Miller’s independence.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed recording the conversation with Trump and the possibility of suspending the president with Amendment 25.
Rosenstein denied this information.
But last Monday he went to the White House, where there were rumors of his resignation.
Instead, a meeting was announced Thursday with Trump, who was at the United Nations General Assembly in New York at the time.
Trump said he "would rather" not fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid clashing with the hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which testified to both Cavano and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blaise Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations, continuing to delay the Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, visited Fox News Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, she replied: "The date of the meeting has not yet been set, it could be this week or postponed for another week, taking into account all the things happening around the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always want to keep the press updated."
Some reporters dispute this statement: Sanders hasn’t held a White House press briefing since September 10.
Manager Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of briefings was not due to aversion to the TV reporter’s “craving for fame,” although she added: “I don’t deny the fact that they are craving for fame.”
She then proposed a direct contact between Trump, which would lead to an increase in press interest.
"The president engages in more question-and-answer sessions than any president before him," she said, adding without giving further details: "We have consulted on their numbers."
Sanders said the briefings would continue to happen, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it’s undeniably better than talking to me.
We're trying to do a lot of this, and you can see that we've been doing this a lot over the last few weeks, and it's going to be in the place of press briefings when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions by leaving the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences attended by key figures.
Individual press conferences are rare.
Perhaps the president demonstrated the reason for this this this week in New York, devoting an uncontrolled and at times strange expression to a crowd of reporters.
Health Minister writes to EU staff at the Scottish NHS about fears linked to Brexit
The Minister for Health has written to EU staff working for the Scottish National Health Service (NHS) to thank and wish them resilience after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman's MSP sent a letter less than six months before the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the cost of permanent status applications for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU continued on the withdrawal, which led to the decisions expected this autumn.
However, the UK Government is also preparing for a possible scenario in the absence of an agreement.
I know this is a very turbulent time for you.
Therefore, I would like to emphasise once again how much I appreciate the involvement of every employee, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from inside and outside the EU bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and benefit the patients and communities we care for.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here."
After a head injury, Christian Abercrombie undergoes an emergency surgery
Tennessee State Tigers guard Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency operation following a head injury he got in a Saturday game in which he lost 31-27 to Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee sports reporter Mike Organ reported.
(a) the information referred to in point (a) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 of this Article shall be provided by the competent authority of the Member State where the service is provided;
"He came up to the side line and he collapsed," Reed said.
While Abercrombie was on the sideline, his trainers and medical staff gave him oxygen, then put him on a stretcher and took him to further investigation.
A Tennessee state official told WSMV reporter Chris Harris in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been surgically removed from Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
It is also important to note that the use of this drug is not recommended for children under the age of 3 years.
Abercrombie, a red-shirt player, is in his first season after replacing Illyonia with the Tennessee State team.

Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher state fee when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher state fee when buying property in the UK, and the extra funds obtained will be used to help homeless people under the new Tory plan.
Such a move will counteract Corbin's efforts to attract new voters.
A higher tax rate will apply to people who do not pay tax in the UK.
The Treasury estimates that up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year could be raised to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher state fee when buying property in the UK and channelling the extra funds obtained to help homeless people, it will be announced today by Theresa May.
Such a move is seen as an attempt to counter Jeremy Corbyn’s attempts to attract new voters with promises to provide better-priced housing and appeal to the wealthiest sections of society.
The increased state fee will be applied to individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK, with the extra money raised going to government efforts to combat the homeless problem.
The surcharge included in the current national tax, including the application of a higher level of the charge introduced two years ago for the purchase and lease of a second home, could be as high as three per cent.
The Treasury estimates that such a move could add up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to its budget.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of London’s newly built properties are bought by non-residents, thus pushing prices up and making it difficult for first-time buyers to get their homes.
Many territories of the wealthy country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy was introduced just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in state fees so that more young people could afford to buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high property prices by seizing land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to give up quotas on affordable housing to tackle Britain’s housing problem.
Mr Corbin has proposed a series of attractive housing reforms, including a reform of rent control and eviction for no reason.
He also wants to give councils more power over the construction of new housing.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said that I would use my position as Prime Minister to restore Britain's dream of a better quality of life for every new generation.
And that means putting our damaged housing market in order.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and arrange their lives here.
However, it is not right that housing can be purchased with the same ease by foreign companies and people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as by hard-working British people.
For many, the dream of owning their own home has gone too far, and the harsh problem of homelessness is still present.”
Jack Ross: "My biggest goal is to drive Scotland"
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his biggest goal is to become a Scotland boss at some point.
Scott, 42, has accepted the challenge to re-create the Northeast Club, which currently ranks third in the league with three points from the top.
This summer, he moved to the Stadium of Light after the St Mirren re-entered the Scottish Premier League last season.
"As a player, I wanted to play for my country.
I won the B Cup, and that was it,” Ross told the Scottish BBC’s Sportsound.
"But I grew up watching Scotland games with my father in Hampden Park, and that has always called me back.
However, such an opportunity would only be possible if I was successful in running the club."
Ross's predecessors at Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Cano.
The former head of Alloa Athletic claims to have been uneasy following in the footsteps of the club's well-known leaders, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich.
"My success will now be judged by whether I can return the club to the Premier League.
The structure and capabilities of this club definitely make it fit into the Premier League," he said.
"Returning the club to the Premier League will not be an easy task, but I will probably believe that I will be successful here only when this task is done."
Ross spent only three years in his executive career, having previously served as deputy director of Dumbarton, and spent 15 months as head coach of the Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from the fall to the third level and helped St Mirren win the championship in the same season.
Ross says he feels much more comfortable than he did during his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a real crossroads," he recalls, taking responsibility for Alloa.
“I really believed that leadership was my real calling – much more appropriate than playing.
It sounds strange, because I got a good success, I was able to live from it and enjoy some heights.
But playing can be difficult.
You have to go through a lot of things every week.
I still feel it because of work-related stress and pressure, but leadership is my field.
I've always wanted to lead, and now I'm doing it. It seems that I'm in the right place, I haven't felt so good all my life."

The survey found that the best time to enjoy a pint is at 5.30 p.m. on Saturday evenings.
The summer heat wave has put Britain’s less popular pubs under strain, but it has increased pressure on restaurant chains.
In July, sales of pubs and bars increased by 2.7 percent, but in restaurants they decreased by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, who represents the business consulting agency CGA that compiled the data, said: "The continuous sunny weather and England's long-running participation in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar trend as June, with pub profits up 2.8 percent, while restaurants experienced a decline.
Restaurants, whose turnover in June dropped by 1.8 percent, experienced an even more severe situation in July.
The situation in pubs and bars was the most appreciative, as they experienced a much greater upswing than restaurants experienced downswing.
Food-based pubs also suffered from the sun, but not as dramatically as restaurant workers felt.
It seemed that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In pubs and bars, monthly beverage sales increased by 6.6 per cent, while food sales decreased by 3 per cent."
Paul Newman, RSM leisure and hospitality analyst, said: "These results continue the trend seen at the end of April.
Weather and the impact of a wide range of social or sporting events are the biggest factors that determine the turnover outside the home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although the drop in sales by 4.8 percent year-on-year will be particularly painful in addition to the constant cost pressures.
For food providers, a long and hot summer could not have come at a more inopportune moment, and time will tell whether the temperate temperatures we usually experience in August will provide much needed respite."
The total sales growth among pubs and restaurants, including new businesses, reached 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the decline in brand sales.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, the UK's sales monitor for the pub, bar and restaurant sector, collects and analyses data from 47 activity groups with a combined turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, which has become an industry benchmark.
Every fifth child has a secret social media account, which he hides from his parents
The survey reveals that every fifth child, some of whom are only 11 years old, has a secret social media account, which they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in fake Instagram pages.
These reports have raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main" account to show their parents.
One in five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed that the number of fake profiles on Instagram for photo sharing is growing rapidly.
These reports have raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty per cent of pupils mentioned that they had a "clean main" account to show to their parents, and also private accounts.
A mother who stumbled upon the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter discovered a teenager who encouraged others to rape her.
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent School Leaders (HMC) found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-old students had two profiles, and only half of them admitted to maintaining private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: “It’s frightening that so many teenagers create online profiles where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eil<0xC4><0xAB>da Doila will be a "softball voice" on the Scottish Athletics Board
Eilidh Doyle was elected non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Board at the annual general meeting of the Board.
Doyle is Scotland’s most decorated indoor and outdoor athlete, and President Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those driven by sport to take advantage of her extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Eilyn is given tremendous respect throughout the Scottish, UK and global athletics community, and we are confident that Scottish athletes will gain immensely from their inclusion on the board,” Beatty said.
Doyle said: "I want to act as a 'softball voice' and I hope I can really get involved and help push this sport forward in Scotland."
An American, who won the 200-meter and 400-meter race at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, thus winning four Olympic gold medals in total, and is now a regular BBC pundit, was unable to pass after a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, I had a stroke on that day.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said that only time will tell if and to what extent I will recover.
It was a terrible job, but I fully recovered, learned to walk again and today I can already do agility training!
Thank you for inspiring words!"
Opinions are divided on the advertising of a breast pump that compares mothers with cows
A breast pump company has taken care of the differences of opinion online in relation to advertising that compares nursing mothers to cow milking.
To mark the launch of the so-called "world's first silent wearable breast pump", consumer technology company Elvie released a sticky fly advertisement to demonstrate the freedom that the new pump gives breastfeeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a walled cowshed next to a song that goes something like, "Yeah, I wipe myself, but you don't see any tail," and "if you haven't noticed, they're not udders, they're my breasts."
In the singing continues: "Suck out, suck out, I feed the cubs, suck out, suck out, I milk my ladies."
However, the advertisement posted on the company’s Facebook page has had a wide resonance online.
The video, which has been viewed 77,000 times and commented hundreds of times, has received divided viewers' comments, and many claim that it highlights the "horror" of the dairy industry.
"The very wrong decision to use cows for product advertising.
Just like us, they have to become pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, but their babies are taken from them a few days after they are born," he wrote.
Elvie breast pump discreetly fits into the breast of lactating women (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment states: "I understand that it is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But why not use them to advertise a breast pump to mothers who can keep their babies?"
There was also an opinion: "Advertisers did not know what they were doing."
Others defended the ad, and one woman admitted that she thought the song was "fun."
"I think it's a great idea.
I would buy one if I was still breastfeeding.
The sucking of milk made me feel like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I understood the idea.
“This is a great product,” he wrote.
Another comment reads: "It's a funny advertisement for moms who get milk (often in the workplace or in the toilets) and feel like a 'cow'.
It is not advertising that praises or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the ad, a group of women discover that they all danced with inconspicuous pumps placed in their bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the observation that many women who suckle milk claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no wires and pipes, and discreetly fits into the breast of lactating women, allowing them to move freely, hold their babies and even take part in events outside the home.
Anna Balarin, partner and creative director of Mother, commented: “The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing parallels between the milk-removing women and the cows, we wanted to focus on milk-removing, while demonstrating in an entertaining and understandable way the stunning sense of freedom that the new pump will bring."
This is not the first time that the Elvie pump has come into the spotlight.
At London Fashion Week, a mother of two children appeared on the tongue at a show by Marta Jakubowski using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to the tent city on the Texas border
The number of children of migrants apprehended has risen sharply, although the number of people crossing the border each month is relatively the same as in the past, partly due to the Trump administration’s harsh rhetoric and policies that have made it difficult for children to be accommodated by sponsors.
In general, most sponsors have also been undocumented immigrants themselves, fearing that openly applying to host a child would jeopardise their chances of staying in the country.
The risk increased in June when federal officials announced that potential sponsors and other members of their household would have to be allowed to take fingerprints, and that the data would also be passed on to other immigration-related authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs enforcement official, showed before the congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to be sponsors for unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not been punished in advance.
"Almost 80 percent of the individuals who are either sponsors or members of the sponsor's household are staying here illegally, and a large proportion of these individuals are criminal aliens.
It’s not the first time I’ve heard of it, but it’s the last time I’ve heard it.
According to asylum officials, in an effort to speed up the handling of children's cases, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of their arrest rather than 60 days, as was the previous standard.
Many will use the videoconferencing option instead of coming in person to defend their legal status before an immigration judge.
Persons deemed to be unsuitable for obtaining release will be quickly expelled.
The longer children are kept in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which may lead to violent attacks or escape attempts, according to information and evidence provided by asylum officers and retrieved from the system in recent months.
Lawyers argued that these concerns are exacerbated by larger objects such as Tornillo, where signs of a child suffering are more often overlooked due to their breadth.
They added that moving children to the tent city without spending enough time preparing them emotionally or allowing them to say goodbye to friends could cause injuries that many already struggle with.
Syria forces U.S., French and Turkish "occupying armies" to immediately withdraw their troops
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is already in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, claimed that foreign forces were illegally present in Syria on the pretext of combating terrorism, and "this will be addressed accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died and millions have been forced to flee their homes since 2011, "the war on terror is almost over".
He said Damascus would continue to "fight the holy war until all Syrian territories are cleansed" of both terrorist groups and "any foreign military presence".
The United States has deployed around 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs, who are opponents of President Bashar Al-Assad.
France has sent more than 1,000 men to the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Mualem stated that the conditions had been excellent for their return and blamed "certain Western countries" for "spreading irrational fears" over the refugees' unwillingness to return.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return," he said.
"These people are politicizing what should only be a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not receive assistance for the reconstruction of the country until an agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone at the last rebel-held base in Idlib has created an opportunity to speed up political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, which is home to three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement "has set deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action would be directed against the jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Qaeda affiliated group "Jabhat al Nusrah", which "will be destroyed".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of the new committee, which will include representatives of the government and the opposition, in the near future in order to draft Syria's post-war constitution and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for the Syrian state's participation in the committee, stressing that the group's work should be limited to "revision of the articles of the existing constitution", and warned of interference.
Why Will Trump Be Elected for a Second Term?
From this point of view, Mr. Trump will be re-elected in the 2020 election unless, and this is likely to be the hope of many liberal watchers, the impeachment and scandal will not prematurely put an end to his presidency.
And in that case "it will be the most dramatic Presidency final of all time!"
At the moment, there is no sign of the observer’s relaxation.

Money flows from the outside into the pre-election campaigns of the most demanding interim parliamentary elections
No wonder Pennsylvania's 17th Congressional Constituent District tends to get money, thanks to the reshuffle of the congressional districts, as a result of which the two existing deputies will fight for one seat.
This recently reformed suburb of Pittsburgh is linked to the Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his seat in a special election in another suburb last spring.
Lembs will fight another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former Pennsylvania 12th district, which largely overlaps with the new 17th district.
After the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old areas had been unconstitutionally divided in favor of the Republicans, the maps were revised.
Competition in the new district 17 has led to a struggle between the parties’ main financial groups: the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee and the National Republican Campaign Committee.
Lembs became known in Pennsylvania when he won the popular March election at Pennsylvania’s 18th Congressional District.
This place had been held by Republicans for more than 10 years, and President Donald Trump won the area with 20 points.
Political experts predict a small predominance for democrats.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but then reconsidered
Diplomats admitted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing without much pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017, and stayed at a hotel in Panama until the partners threw the Trump management team out of the door.
State department officials decided to recall the heads of US diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, citing "the recent decision to no longer recognise Taiwan," department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
However, it was only considered to apply the penalties to El Salvador, which in 2017 received about 140 million from the United States, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which would include a reduction in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for a Central American country where unemployment and murder rates are at their highest.
In the course of internal meetings, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity, which would have followed a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step towards efforts to prevent migrants from moving to the US.
In mid-September, top government officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, effectively putting an end to the issue of punishing El Salvador.
Diplomats said Vice President Mike Pence had now decided to attend a conference scheduled for mid-October to show how seriously the administration was stressing the meeting.
And three American ambassadors quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new and serious statements or penalties from Washington.
The representative of the White House, who spoke on behalf of Mr Bolton, did not want to give more details about the debate, which was characterised by three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to negotiate internally, provided their anonymity is maintained.
It is also important to note that the use of the drug is not recommended for children under the age of 3 years.
Research of history
The second rock garden could be a report by special prosecutor Robert Mueller that Mr. Trump may have obstructed justice, which has a lot of evidence at the public's disposal.
It is claimed that Mr. Miller will also investigate whether the Trump campaign has colluded with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the other party prevails in Congress, Trump will have to answer to the body and possibly to his fellow jury just as he is about to meet with voters again.
There's a lot of "buts" and I don't claim that Trump's fall is inevitable or that it will happen to his European counterparts.
There are choices that will have to be made by all of us on both sides of the Atlantic, and these choices will show the duration of the battle.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup against Hitler, if the West had resisted him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and missed the chance to escape the years-long carnage.
History revolves around such turning points, and the unstoppable march of democracy is being accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are now faced with several such milestones.
What will we do if Mr. Trump sacks Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Miller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has had a hard time since it was reported that last year he proposed to secretly record a conversation with the president and wondered about his unfitness for office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the story of The Times is not accurate.
“If the just-requested FBI investigation into Bret Cavan is not complete or fair, or if he is confirmed as a Supreme Court Justice despite his unfair testimony and credible sexual assault allegations, how will we respond?
And, most importantly, will we vote in the interim elections of the Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we do not pass all these tests, democracy will have a long winter.
But I believe that we will succeed, referring to what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was sent to Auschwitz by the very Nazi regime that once lived in my embassy.
She survived, emigrated to America and 60 years later sent me to light Sabbath candles on the table with a swastika.

Women can't sleep because they're worried about their retirement savings
Although the respondents clearly knew what kind of care they wanted, there were few who had discussed the issue with family members.
About half of individuals in a nationwide study indicated that they do not talk to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
"People want to be cared for by family members, but they don't do anything to talk about it," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the National Life Insurance Agency.
This is where we should start.
Talk to your spouse and your children. You can not prepare your family for the fact that you will need care if you do not make your wishes known well in advance.
Collaborate with your consultant and family to discuss where and how to receive care, as these choices can be an important factor in determining costs.
Involve your financial advisor. Your advisor can also help you figure out how to cover these costs.
Your options for long-term care financing may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid insurance policy with a sum of money to cover these costs, or securing your assets – the key is to have money.
Develop your own legal documents. Prevent legal battles before they even begin.
Talk to a health trustee to have a reliable person to supervise your health care and ensure that the specialists act in accordance with your wishes if you are unable to express them on your own.
Consider also the possibility of granting a power of attorney with regard to finances.
Choose a reliable person to make financial decisions on your behalf, who will take care of paying your bills if you are not able to do it on your own.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to the government, a strong earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday have killed at least 384 people. The number of victims is expected to increase.
Due to communications disruption, rescuers have been unable to retrieve any information from the Donggala area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu after the devastating natural disaster.
Here are some basic information about Palu and Dongala, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi island. It is estimated that in 2017 it had a population of 379,800 people.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary with an earthquake and a tsunami.
Dongala is an area stretching about 300 km (180 miles) along the northwest coast of Sulawesi Island.
The area, which is an administrative region within the province, is estimated to have a population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the backbone of the economy of the Central Sulawesi Province, especially in the coastal Dongal District.
Nickel mining also plays an important role in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia’s Disaster Prevention Agency, Palu and Dongala have suffered multiple tsunamis over the past 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings in Dongala.
The tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire, where earthquakes regularly form.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A severe earthquake on the west coast of the province of Aceh in the north of Sumatra triggered a tsunami on 26 December that affected 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of whom were in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nia, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that struck the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai off the coast of Sumatra, causing tsunamis of up to 10 metres, which devastated dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A near-earth earthquake struck the area of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing devastation and panic as it reminded of the destruction caused by the devastating earthquakes and tsunami of 2004.
This time, the tsunami did not form, but more than 100 people were killed by the collapsing buildings.
2018: Severe earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily prevented hundreds of tourists from returning home.
Sarah Peilin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice president-designate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Troopers, 29-year-old Palin, who lives in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and resisting arrest.
According to a police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report what she claimed to have been a crime, he took her phone away.
It’s a great way to get to know each other better and to get to know each other better.
He appeared before a court on Saturday, where, when asked if he was guilty, he declared that he was "certainly not guilty".
He has been charged with three A-class offenses, which can result in him being sentenced to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a Class B offence, which can result in a day’s imprisonment and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that Peylin has been indicted for criminal offences.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Peylin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported that an attack had taken place.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstructing a report on domestic violence, and carrying a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend says he punched her in the face.
In 2016, veteran groups criticized Sarah Peilin for linking her son’s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder when she returned from service in Iraq.
Earthquake Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds Killed
At least 384 people have died since the Sulawesi earthquake struck Indonesia on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and has devastated thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been destroyed and the number of victims is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake struck near central Sulawesi, southeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.

Federal prosecutors seek rare death sentence for New York City terror suspect
Federal prosecutors want to demand the execution of Saijfullo Saipov, who is suspected of a terrorist attack in New York City when eight people were killed, a rare form of punishment that has not been carried out in the state since 1953 for federal crimes.
The 30-year-old reportedly used a Home Depot rental car to attack a bicycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October, where he shot down pedestrians and a cyclist on his way.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused a serious injury, as stated in a statement announcing his intention to seek the death penalty filed with the Southern District Court in New York.
According to a court document, both of these charges can lead to the death penalty.
In the weeks following the attack, the federal grand jury accepted an indictment letter for Saipov's prosecution in 22 charges, which included eight charges of homicide for extortion, commonly used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, as well as charges of cruelty and motor vehicle damage.
The attack required "substantial planning and premeditated intent", prosecutors said, citing that Saipov's attack was "horrible, cruel and inhumane".
"Sayfullo Habibulaevich Saipov (Sayfullo Habibulaevic Saipov) injured, harmed and caused damage to the families and friends of these people: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Anna-Laure Décadt, Darens Décadt
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years have passed since New York’s Southern District Court prosecutors indicted a case that carries the death penalty.
The accused Khalid Barnes was tried for the murder of two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in 2009.
The last federal execution in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple sentenced to death on charges of espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
The Rosenberg couple were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, passing days and months, the Uzbek-born Saipov did not show remorse for the attack.
It’s a great way to get to know each other better.
According to the indictment, Saipov told officials that he was inspired to launch the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
Police said he had also asked for permission to display the ISIS flag in his chamber.
He has rejected 22 indictments.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was "naturally frustrated" with the indictment decision.
“We believe that the intention to demand the death penalty, rather than accepting guilt in exchange for life imprisonment without the right to release, will only prolong the trauma caused by what is happening to all parties involved,” Patton said.
A team of Saipov’s supporters has previously urged prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.

Nigel Farage promised at a Conservative conference today to "mobilise the people's army".
The former leader of the British Independent Party said politicians should feel the anger of eurosceptics when one of the MPs of Theresa May suggested that negotiations with the EU should be entrusted to him.
Conservative comrade Peter Bone told the march in Birmingham that Britain would have left long ago if Mr Farage were Brexit minister.
However, the challenge that Mrs May will have to face in trying to unify her controversial party was demonstrated by the Conservatives, who are in favour of staying in the EU and joined a separate city protest against Brexit.
The Prime Minister is fighting to maintain her plan for a compromise on the future relationship between Britain and the European Union (Chequers compromise), and is feeling the attacks from those who want to leave the EU, from those who want to remain in the EU, and also from the EU itself.
Allies insisted she would resolutely seek an agreement with Brussels despite the negative reaction, and would force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her offer and "chaos".
Mr. Bown's "Leave Means Leave" at a rally in Solihull announced that he wanted to dump May's plan in the trash (to chuck Chequers).
He proposed making Farage an ally and entrusting him with negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been on the line, we would have already left," Boone said.
Wellingborough MEP added: "I will support Brexit, but we have to throw May's plan in the trash."
In support of his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight to have servants!
We want to make our own laws in our own country!"
Mr. Boon ignored speculation that public opinion may have changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is absolutely false.”
Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the march, telling reporters: "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan is not popular with the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular with our party and our supporters, who are actually doing all the work and electing us.
Please give up Chequers and start listening."
In a message addressed to May, she added: “Prime Ministers remain in place as they keep their promises.”
Mr Farage said politicians at the rally should be under pressure if they intend to ignore the 2016 referendum decision.
"It is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our politicians," he said.
"They're trying to hand over Brexit, and we're here today to tell them we're not going to let that happen."
In his message to an enthusiastic crowd, he fills: "I want you to give pressure to our politicians who are planning to hand over Brexit.
"We will call on the people of this country who have allowed us to win the battle for Brexit, and we will never let go until we have an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the Stayers marched through Birmingham before a two-hour rally took place in the city centre.
Uninformed activists greeted the Conservatives with anti-Brexit banners after the group's meeting this weekend.
Lord Adonis of the Workers’ Party ridiculed Conservatives for the security issues they experienced with the party’s app at the beginning of the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they are able to maintain the order of the IT system and all its technology for Canada and yet, and yet, for an undivided border, for free trade without borders with Ireland,” he added.
"This is an absolute farce.
There is no such thing as a successful Brexiteer,” he added.
It is not the first time I’ve heard of it.
Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "carefully consider" running for President of the United States after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future in the City Hall of West Massachusetts.
Warren, who frequently criticizes President Donald Trump, runs for re-election in November and stands as a candidate against GOP Republican Geof Dele, who was Trump's vice president of the 2016 Massachusetts Campaign.
It is speculated that she will be the main one who dares to stand against Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event at Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters through the City Hall since Trump took office.
A visitor asked her if she planned to run for president.
To which Warren replied that the time was right for "Washington to have women who would "fix" the imperfect government, which also means female presidents."

The police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, said on Saturday that a suspect was arrested for shooting LSU basketball player Wade Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Station announced that Daiteon Simpson, 20 years old, was detained at 11.00. ET press conference.
On Friday, they broadcast a video of the shooting, calling for help in identifying the man.
Sims (20) was shot and killed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"The face of Sims was shot in the head, resulting in his immediate death," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the press on Saturday, over 247 Sports.
Way rushed to defend his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed to having been at the scene of the accident, with a gun, and admitted to having shot Wade Sims.
The Simpsons were arrested without resistance and he is in the East Baton Rouge Village Police Station.

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches World Champion title after team lets him beat Sebastian Fettel
It’s a great way to get to know each other better.
From the start, Botas started well and almost left Hamilton in the dry, defending his position in the first two runs and calling on Fettel to attack his teammate.
The first to go into the garage and leave Hamilton in the engines to deal with the others, it was probably the decisive one.
The Mercedes driver came back later and fell behind Fetel, but Hamilton continued to take the lead after a matchup of forces, which saw the Ferrari driver persistently leaving the inside free, risking to fall behind after a double-manoeuvre to defend in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row and was seventh at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
After that, he was in the lead of a large part of the race, as he focused on tires to quickly reach the finish and overtake Kimi Raikonen in the fourth.
He eventually entered the garage on lap 44, but could not speed up the remaining eight laps, as R<0xC3><0xA4>ikk<0xC3><0xB6>nen remained fourth.
This is a difficult day, because Walter did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman.
The team did an extremely important job to get the two of them together,” Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a Saturday rally for her insistence on not disclosing a letter from Christine Blaise Ford, in which she accuses Supreme Court candidate Bret Caveno of sexual harassment.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony it gave to the Senate Legal Commission, but commented that what happened in the Senate shows that the people there are "evil, nasty and unreliable."
"One thing that can happen and something beautiful that has already happened in recent days in the Senate, when there is anger, when you see angry, evil, nasty and unreliable people," he said.
"When you read press releases and leaked information and then they say, 'Oh, no, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Feynstein, did you leak the information?
Remember her answer to the question...did you leak the document? - "Oh, oh, what did I do?"
Oh, no.
I didn't do it."
Okay, wait a minute.
Did we do it...No, we didn’t,” he added, in the senator’s intonation.
In July, a letter was sent to Feinstein detailing Ford's accusations against Cavan, and in early September, the contents of the letter were disclosed, but Feinstein denies that it would have happened in her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't leak her story," Feinstein told the jury, reports The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential, and I did."
But her denial displeased the president, who commented on the situation at Saturday night's rally as follows: "I will tell you that it was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend a Supreme Court candidate accused of sexual harassment by three women, the president suggested that Democrats use the accusations for their own benefit.
"They are determined to regain power by any means."
"You see the evil, the mess, they don't care what they hurt, what they have to destroy in order to gain power and control," he said.

Air traffic controller dies, allowing hundreds of people on board to escape during earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is hailed as a hero after he sacrificed himself to take a plane with hundreds of passengers safely off land.
More than 800 people have died and many have disappeared after a strong earthquake on Friday rocked the island of Sulawesi, causing a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue in the area and many are trapped in the mud in the town of Palu.
However, despite the fact that his colleagues saved their lives, 21-year-old Antonio Ganavan Agung refused to leave his job at the control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu, which was rocking violently.
He stayed at his post to make sure Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, would take off safely.
He then jumped off the traffic control tower, thinking it might collapse.
Later he died in the hospital.
Indonesia’s air navigation spokesman, Johannes Sireit, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Australian ABC news reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We are heartbroken to hear it," he fills.
Meanwhile, state authorities are concerned that the death toll could reach thousands, the state disaster prevention agency says access to Dongalas, Sigi and Butangao (Boutong) is limited.
"It is believed that the beauty will grow, because many more people's bodies are under rubble, as well as many have no access," said the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves reaching a height of 6 metres destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft continue to deliver assistance and necessary goods.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute the ambulance service brings in new victims.
Clean water is a deficit.
Small shops are crowded everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors, but we don’t know what we’ll find there.
"It's already a tragedy, but it can get worse."
On Sunday, Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu and said to the country’s military recruits: “I ask you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Already this year, more than 550 people died in earthquakes in Lombok.
Plane crash in Micronesia: Now "Air Niugini"says that one of the people has disappeared after the plane crash in the lagoon
The airline carried out a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia and now claims that one person is missing, although it previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release on Saturday afternoon that they were unable to answer for one of the passengers, a man.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the missing man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more detailed information on the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Locals helped rescue other passengers and crew with boats after the plane fell into the water trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline said six people remained in hospital until Saturday, and all of them were in stable condition.
The causes of the accident and the sequence of events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy report that the plane crashed into the lagoon shortly after taking off from the runway.
Some eyewitnesses felt that the length of the runway on the plane had been overestimated.
Bill Janes, an American passenger, said that the plane was very low.
"It was really very good," said Janes.
Janes says that he and other passengers were able to get out of the sinking plane using emergency exits because the water was only up to the waist.
He said that the stewards were panicking and screaming, and that he had a slight head injury.
U.S. Navy sailors who worked nearby to improve the ship’s berth also helped in rescue operations using an inflatable boat to bring people ashore before the plane sank about 30 meters (100 feet) under water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have died at PNG registered airlines in the last twenty years, no one is associated with Air Niugini.
A commentator on psychoanalysis explains the course of events on the night in which a woman was burned alive
The indictment on Saturday provided evidence in a retrial in which a man is accused of burning a living woman in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, a commentator on psychoanalysis at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for hours as a witness to an expert in intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used the information from his phone to put together how the 29-year-old accused, Quinton Telle, and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, acted on the night she died.
Rovlets said he received location data from several phones, suggesting that Telis was with Chambers on the evening of her death, challenging his previous testimonies, the Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his phone was at Chambers when he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to question Sanford.
Sanford testified in the courtroom on Saturday that he was not in town that day.
When the indictment asked if Tell was telling the truth by claiming he was in a Sanford car that night, Sanford said he was "lying because my car was in Nashville."
Another discrepancy was that Tell said he knew Chambers only about two weeks after she died.
The phone records show that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that a little after Chambers’ death, Tell deleted the text messages, calls, and contact information he had received from Chambers from his phone.
"He wiped him out of his life," said Hale.
It is planned that the defences will present their final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be handed over to the jurors later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative views of this music genre by giving a positive message with their music.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip-hop has deviated from its origins in terms of political messages and social issues.
The group wants to return to the roots of the genre and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have experienced a recent revival in the UK with artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Black again?!
In New York, a babysitter sued the couple for dismissal after receiving a "racist" news
In New York, a babysitter has sued a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving an erroneous text message from a mother who complained that the babysitter was "black again."
The couple denies that they would be racists, equating the trial to "extortion".
Lindsey Plasko-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her rejection when she found out that the young caregiver, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work on her first day in 2016.
"N<0xC4><0x92><0xC4><0x92><0xC4><0x92><0xC4><0x92><0xC4><0x92><0xC4><0x92><0xC4><0x92><0xC4><0x92>, R<0xC4><0xAA>GAS BLACK," Plasko-Flaksmana wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, she sent the message not to her husband, but to Maurice, and twice.
Conscious of her awkwardness, "confused" Plasko-Flaxman rebuffed Mauricio, pointing out that their previous nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that she was expecting a Filipino, citing the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for one working day and sent home with Uber.
Now Mauricio has sued the couple for compensation for dismissal and wants $350 a day for six months for the job she was originally applying for, without a contract.
"I want to show them that they don't do things like that," she told Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple rejects accusations that they are racist, claiming that Mauricia’s suspension of employment was a reasonable decision because they feared that they would not be able to trust her after insulting her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She's not racist.
We're not racist," Joel Plasco, husband, said to the Post.
"But would you entrust your children to someone you treated rudely, even if it was just a mistake?
Your newborn?
Think about it."
Associating the court hearing with "extortion", Plasko said that his wife had given birth to the little one only two months ago and was in a very "difficult situation".
"Are you really addressing someone in this way?
This is not an acceptable course of action," added the investment banker.
While the proceedings are still going on, public opinion is quickly judging the couple on social networks, disparaging them for their behavior and logical thinking.
A new letter reveals that the publishers of the Paddington book were concerned that readers would not be able to associate with a talking bear
Bond’s daughter Karen Jenkel, who was born shortly before the book was approved, said of the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in someone’s shoes who reads the book for the first time before it’s released.
It's very surprising now to know what we know about Paddington's great success."
Telling her that her father, who had worked as an operator for the BBC before he felt inspired to write a book for children about a small teddy bear, was optimistic that his work would be rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book's release was "sweet bitter" after his father's passing away last year.
Speaking of Paddington, who she calls "a very important member of the family", her father quietly boasted of his eventual success.
"He was a quiet, quiet man and was not boastful," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was just like having a child who achieves something: you're proud even if you didn't do it yourself.
I think he saw Paddington's success in a similar way.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always gave all the credit to Paddington himself."
I had to say goodbye to my dying daughter by phone
After landing her daughter with ambulances was taken to the hospital of Nice Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors constantly fought for her life.
“Ned called regularly and said it was very bad and expected she would not survive,” said Ednan-Laperuz.
"Then I got a call from Ned saying that she would die in the next two minutes and I have to say goodbye to her.
And that's what I did.
I said, "Yeah, I love you so much, darling.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicine that the doctors gave her to maintain the heart rate slowly ran out and left her body.
She would have died sooner, and it was all over now.
I had to sit and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn’t scream or howl because I was in a situation where there were families and people around.
It took me a lot of energy to control myself."
In the end, Ednan-Laperuz, already grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers who had no idea what she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I stabbed my head down and shed tears all the time.
It is difficult to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt deep sympathy for Ned.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Mourning women attach cards to bridges to prevent suicide
Two women whose loved ones commit suicide act to help others not to take their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey strengthen the cards at the Welsh Bridge with an inspiring message and phone numbers so people can call and get support.
Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he fell ill with depression, but committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to have to experience what I do every day,” she said.
Davis, a 45-year-old who lives in Leeds, said her son was a promising cook with an addictive smile.
"Everyone recognized him with a smile.
Everyone always said that his smile "lit up" always and everywhere."
However, he refused to work before he died because he was in a "very, very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, was the one who found him after Tyler committed suicide.
Davis said, "I was constantly worried that it would have consequences."
Davis made cards, "to let you know that there are people you can turn to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
You don't have to sit in silence, you have to talk."
Humphrey, who has been Davis’s girlfriend for years, lost Mark, his wife, 15 years after his mother’s death.
“He didn’t say he would be sad or depressed or anything else,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed that his attitude had changed.
He reached his lowest point on Christmas morning, when the children opened the gifts, he did not make eye contact with them or anything like that."
His death was a big trauma for the children, but they have to deal with it: "It irritates the whole family.
That sets us apart.
But we all have to continue and fight."

Bret Caveno's future is hanging in the air as FBI investigates
"I think if we could really get what he's asking for in a limited investigation, in terms of time and scope, we could probably get a little consensus," Flake said Saturday, adding that he was concerned the commission was "dividing" between the fortified guerrilla trenches.
Why do the supporters of Kaveno and his Republicans not want the FBI to investigate?
Their abstention is just a coincidence.
If the Republicans are expected to do badly, then their attempts will be much weaker to elect a man from among them to the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush calls the senators, lobbying them to support Cavano, who worked at the White House during Bush's time, and thanks to him met his wife Ashley, who was President Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI prepares its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where currently 51 seats belong to Republicans, and 49 to Democrats.
It's still unclear whether Caveno can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to cast a vote and approve him in the Supreme Court.
Kim's leadership 'decreased' number of North Korean political asylum seekers
North Korea's number of political asylum seekers in South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, South Korea's lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Unification Ministry, said there were 1,127 political asylum seekers last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said that tighter border controls star North Korea and China and the high rates of human smugglers are key factors.
No public comments were received from Pyongyang.
The vast majority of political asylum seekers from North Korea are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most travel through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded Demilitarization Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers political asylum seekers as illegal immigrants and forcibly deports them.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are still technically at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss delayed denuclearisation negotiations.
It happened after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when, in large trains,they agreed to cooperate in order to free the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress in these negotiations.
"If there is no trust in the United States, there will be no trust in the security of our country, and under these circumstances, we will never unilaterally disarm first," Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Bret Cavano "hysterical" and says he is unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Nancy Pelosi, the Chamber's minority leader, called the Supreme Court candidate Bret Caveno "hysterical" and claimed he was unfit for the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't stop thinking that if a woman had behaved like this, they would call her 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said of her reaction to the testimony she gave Thursday to the Senate Judiciary Commission.
Kaveno emotionally denied the allegations of sexual harassment against Dr. Christina Blaise Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his opening argument, Kaveno was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and choking, talking about his family and high school years.
He condemned, in particular, the Democrats in the commission, accusing him of "grotesque and consensual destruction of character" by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes that Caveno's testimony is a justification for not being able to work for the Supreme Court, because it shows that he has a bilateral attitude towards Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with such statements and attitudes toward Clinton and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi objected when asked if she would attempt to question Cavano if he was confirmed and if the Democrats gained a majority in the House of Representatives.
“If he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he’s not fit to serve not only in the Supreme Court but also in his current position in the court,” Pelosi said.
Kaveno is currently a judge at the Washington County Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he was worried about the possibility that Caveno would make decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Way because he was considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation talks, Cavano overcame questions about whether he would reject the Supreme Court’s decisions.
"It is not a good moment for a hysterical and double-minded person to work in the court, but we would be expected to say joyfully, 'Isn't that wonderful?'," Pelosi said.
But women need to hold their hands.
It is a denunciation, for months and years everything has accumulated "across the edges", but she is not allowed to get it from herself by crying out.
"We cry when we're angry," Mrs Steinem told me after 45 years.
"I don't think it's unusual, what do you think?"
She went on to say, "Once I was very helped by a woman who was herself a manager at a company who said she also cried when she was angry, but created a technique -- when she got angry and started crying, his person he was talking to said, "You can think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she went on.
And I thought it was great."
Tears are only partially recognized as a way of discharging anger, because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories is of the oldest work, in which the proportion of men was expressed, when I once cried in unexpressed anger when an older woman, a restrained driver (woman), grabbed me by the withers, from whom I was always a little afraid, which dragged me to the stairwell.
"Never let them see that you're crying!" she told me.
"They don't know you're mad.
They think that you are sad and will only be glad that you managed to "help under your skin"."
Patricia Schroeder, then a U.S. Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his pre-election campaign for president.
In 1987, when Hart, caught in an out-of-wedlock affair, left the ship, also known as "foolishness", and withdrew from the election, Schroeder, deeply disappointed, considered that there was no reason why she should not run for president.
"It wasn't a well-thought-out decision," she told me laughing 30 years later.
"The election was already seven other candidates and the last thing they wanted was for another one to come out.
There were some who called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
She got involved late in the campaign, she lagged behind in the fundraising, and she promised she would not take part in the election unless $2 million was raised.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that many of her supporters who donated $1,000 to male representatives donated only $250 to her.
"Do they believe that I get discounts?" she wondered.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was very emotional — grateful to those who supported her, disappointed in a system that made it very difficult to raise money and speak to voters rather than delegates, and angry at the sexism in which she was "suffocated."
"You would think I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalled in her memory how the press reacted to him.
"You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor."
I remember thinking what they were going to write on my gravestone.
"She was crying."
Why the US-China Trade War May Be Beneficial for Beijing
The main reasons for the beginning of the trade war between the United States and China are hidden, and while the fight does not see an end, disagreements between countries can be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year, taxing key Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation began this week with new rates affecting units worth 200 billion dollars (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), immediately charging half of the goods exported to the US from China.
Beijing also "welcomes" every time, the youngest has five to ten percent rates of $60 billion in American goods.
China has said it will respond to the United States one-on-one, and it is doubtful that the world's second largest economy will slow down in the near future.
In order for Washington to resign, certain demands would have to be accepted, but publicly bowing to the US would be too shameful for Chinese President Xi Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards out correctly, the pressure of the US trade war may have a positive effect on China in the long run, reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision has been made in either Washington or Beijing could create uncontrollable economic conditions in any of the countries, which is really more dangerous than what observers have previously acknowledged," said Abigail Grace, a New American Security researcher who focuses on Asia.
Syria is "ready" to take back refugees, the foreign minister said.
Syria says it is ready to voluntarily take back refugees and calls for help in rebuilding a country ravaged by war for more than seven years.
Speaking at the United Nations Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Almualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
"The situation on land is now much more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists to their normal state.
All the conditions are in place for refugees to voluntarily return to the country they were forced to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still live in the country and are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Almualem said the Syrian regime would accept help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that the country would not accept conditions for help or assistance from countries that helped sponsor the unrest.
European golf team wins the Rider's Cup in Paris
The European golf team won the 2018 Rider's Cup, beating the US team with a score of 16,5,10,5 "Le Golf National" outside Paris, France.
The United States has already lost six consecutive times in Europe and has not won the Rider's Cup since 1993.
Europe regained the cup when the team led by Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn scored 14.5 points, which was necessary to beat the US national team.
The US star Phil Michaelson, who had a hard time going through the whole tournament, hit his T-stick in the water at the 16th hole of PAR 3, conceding in a match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari played brilliantly in all his stages, becoming one of the four players who have ever managed to score 5-0-0 since 1979, when the tournament is played in its current format.
The American Jordan Spite lost 5 to 4 sensationally to the European teams, to the lowest-ranked player Torbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's best player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to Ian Polter of England, for whom this was probably the last Rider's Cup.
Serhio Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a, a veteran of the eight Riders Cups, became the tournament's all-time best player from Europe with 25.5 career points.
"Usually I don't cry, but today I can't control the tears."
This was a difficult year.
I am truly grateful to Thomas for raising me up and believing in me.
I am very, very happy that we have regained the cup.
It is the team’s merit and I am happy to have been able to help,” Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a commented emotionally after the victory of the European team.
He then gives the floor to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated golf legend Tiger Woods in a 2-1 singles on Sunday.
“The pride I feel in winning Tiger Woods, I grew up following this player,” said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and currently has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Riders Cup.
Unprecedented stats for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 top-level golf tournaments, being second behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team fought all weekend to find their way, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. National Team Captain Jim Fury, after his team's disappointing performance, said, "I'm proud of the guys, they fought.
There was a moment this morning when we were able to put a little pressure on the European team.
We fought.
With all due respect to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played a very good game.
We will restructure, I will work with the American PGA and the US Rider's Cup Committee, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and am proud to be their captain.
You have to tap your hats.
We won."
