MG Baltic case: new lawyer of Gustainis says he has not yet got acquainted with the case file
The 11th MG Baltic court hearing on Monday was attended by all defendants: <0xC5><0xA0>ar<0xC5><0xAB>nas Gustainis, Gintaras Steponavi<0xC4><0x8D>ius, Vytautas Gab<0xC5><0xA1>ys, Eligijus Masiulis and Raimondas Kurlianskis.
The trial began with the testimony of the defendants.
At the last court hearing, state-appointed new lawyer Aleksandras Doro<0xC5><0xA1>evas told the panel of judges that he had not yet got acquainted with the case file.
MG Baltic lawyer Linas Belevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius then stated that in order to ensure full personal defence, the panel of judges must allow the new lawyer access to the case file and asked for the court hearing to be postponed.
"In order to ensure a person's defence, he or she must have access to the material of the criminal proceedings.
This is not just a formal sitting," Belevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius said.
The new lawyer, Doro<0xC5><0xA1>ev, said he did not have time to get acquainted with the indictment or the entire case file.
At the previous court hearing, the suspect, <0xC5><0xA0>ar<0xC5><0xAB>nas Gustainis, said he was refusing his lawyer because he could no longer pay him.
There were also audio recordings at the meeting.
The defendants’ lawyers complained that the audio recordings submitted to the court were of poor quality.
Law enforcement suspects that politicians taking bribes from MG Baltic supported or initiated decisions favourable to the concern in the Seimas and other state institutions, as well as exerted influence in determining the winners of public procurements, ELTA reminds.
During the pre-trial investigation, more than 150 persons were questioned, of whom more than 50 were members of the previous and current Seimas, several former ministers and members of the European Parliament.
More than 200 interviews and more than 30 searches were conducted.
It is suspected that Gustainis received a bribe of more than 8,000 euros, Steponavi<0xC4><0x8D>ius received 15,000 euros, and Gap<0xC5><0xA1>ys received more than 27,000 euros.
The Labour Party is suspected of bribery and trading in influence, the Liberal Movement is suspected of bribery, trading in influence and abuse, and MG Baltic is suspected of bribery and trading in influence.
It is suspected that politicians consulted with Vice-President of MG Baltic group R. Kurlianskis on bribes, and later in the Seimas or other institutions proposed or supported initiatives in favour of the group.
Ethics Guards: The Liberal Movement Board is Right About the Act of the Vilnius Division
"The decisions taken by the board are in accordance with the statute," Vytautas Tamo<0xC5><0xA1>i<0xC5><0xAB>nas, the board's head, told BNS after the commission's meeting.
“This decision was not new.
We had already made an explanation as a commission in July, when the issue of Pagėgiai and Utena was raised.
Then we said that according to the statute, it is a matter of competence of the board.
And if the board decides that any division can do as it pleases - go with the committee and the board agrees, then the division can go, but if the board decides that there will be party lists everywhere, what the board has adopted, then it is a decision that all divisions form party lists.
And if you do not agree with the board, then there is a possibility to suspend the membership and go with the committee," he added.
According to Tamo<0xC5><0xA1>i<0xC5><0xAB>nas, the party's board will now decide on further actions.
On October 17, the Liberal Movement's board overturned the decision of the Vilnius city division to participate in the municipal elections not with the party's list, but with the election committee to be newly formed.
In the opinion of the party board, the decision of the liberals of the capital to participate in the elections in the form of a public election committee violated the statutes of the party and the decisions of the board.
By 31 October, the Vilnius branch had to withdraw its intention to participate in the municipal elections with the list of the committee.
But the department didn’t.
The former head of the department, MP Au<0xC5><0xA1>rinė Armonaitė, has already left the Liberal Movement.
Remigijus <0xC5><0xA0>ima<0xC5><0xA1>ius, the mayor of Vilnius, the former chairman of the Liberal Movement, has already presented the team and ideas of the public election committee "For Vilnius, which we are proud of!".
He also left the party.
Elections for municipal councils and mayors will be held in March next year.
Residents of a village in northern India have driven a tiger onto a tractor that had previously tore down a man, officials said Monday.
Forest supervisor Mahavir Kaujlagi said villagers surrounded the beast and ran it by a tractor as the female tried to escape, after the tigers tore a man working in the fields late Sunday.
Residents say the tiger attacked and killed a young man about 10 days ago.
The village is in the Dudhva Tiger Reserve in Lakhympur Kheri, about 250km southeast of Laknau, the capital of Uttar Pradesh state.
The breeding of tigers in protected areas is prohibited.
The director of the reserve, Ramesh Pandey, said the case would be reported to police under the Wildlife Protection Act.
In April, villagers in the Nighasan district of Uttar Pradesh state beat another tiger with serious injuries.
The tiger is the national animal of India; according to the Wildlife Conservation Act, tigers are considered an endangered species.
Last year's government data showed that at least one person died every day in clashes with wild tigers or elephants in the previous three years.
The human conflict with tigers has been on the rise since the 1970s, when India launched a tiger conservation program that established reserves in national parks and made it a crime to kill the big cats.
Although the methods for calculating tigers have changed, the censuses show that the then-population of some 1,800 tigers rose to 2,226 individuals in 2014.
It is proposed that cats and dogs should be marked with microchips.
K<0xC4><0x99>stutis Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eika, the chairman of the Seimas Committee on Environmental Protection, together with other members of the Seimas, has registered amendments to the Law on Animal Welfare and Protection, which propose mandatory labelling of cats and dogs with subcutaneous microchips.
“We propose that cats and dogs should be marked with subcutaneous microchips and that their registration and labelling should be organised by local municipalities, the Ministry of Agriculture and the State Food and Veterinary Service.
In 2019, all dogs will be marked with state funds free of charge, and in 2020, cats will also be labelled free of charge, therefore, residents will have no worries and the costs will be covered by specially provided state funding," said K<0xC4><0x99>stutis Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eika, chairman of the Seimas Committee on Environmental Protection.
The amendments aim to address the systematic need for pet labelling.
This is expected to avoid problems caused by irresponsible animal breeders, illegal breeders or sellers.
It is estimated that, based on the expected average price of the microchip and service, which will be about 5 euros, all animal owners will be compensated during the transitional period.
The total cost of all pet labelling can reach up to 6 million euros.
It is planned that the need for these funds will be spread over three years and will amount to 2 million euros annually.
It is planned that funds for labelling programmes will be allocated through the Special Programme for Municipal Environmental Protection Support, the revenue of which this year will increase significantly due to increased taxes on natural resources and redistribution of funds.
Municipalities will be able to use these funds not only for marking cats and dogs, but also for castration and other programmes.
According to K. Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eika, the practice of mandatory marking is widespread in almost all European Union countries, which allows to protect the animals themselves (because the lost can easily be returned to the owners), and saves the time of the animal breeders themselves, when the search for the escaped and lost pet requires a lot of time and money.
In addition, EU legislation stipulates that travel is allowed only with marked pets.
At the same time, marking obliges to responsibly care for the animal throughout its life.
Previous proposals for mandatory labelling were met with resistance, as the relevant programmes were proposed to be financed by the population.
"The current model should avoid this criticism, because animal protection is proposed to be funded by increased income in the environmental protection support program and the right to label not only veterinarians, but also public figures, i.e., persons in animal care institutions who have attended special courses at the Veterinary Academy," the authors of the project say.
The draft law was registered by a group of MPs representing different parliamentary groups - K<0xC4><0x99>stutis Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eika, Algimantas Dumbrava, Eugenijus Gentvilas, Edmundas Pupinis, Rimas Andrikis, Antanas Vinkus and others.
13 government troops killed in Taliban attack in eastern Afghanistan
Provincial governor spokesman Arif Noori said seven soldiers and six police officers were killed.
He added that four other soldiers were wounded in the attack on a joint army and police checkpoint in Khogyani district.
Noori said six militants were killed in a three-hour battle with Afghan forces and 10 other Taliban were wounded.
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid issued a statement in which the group claimed responsibility for Monday's attack in Ghazni province.
Noori said the post was set up two days ago in a strategic area to cut off the Taliban supply route.
During the attack, the post was completely destroyed.
"Morning" lends a helping hand to the Ukrainian club
On Wednesday, the fourth round of the FIBA European Cup will take place in Vilnius "Morning" arena, where Kosovo and Ukraine clubs will meet.
The event will be held in the capital for political reasons.
Vilnius Rytas, which maintains a warm relationship with Ukrainian basketball, will host Cherkasy Cherkasy Mavpy and Pristina KB Pristina teams under its roof on 7 November.
"For political reasons, between Kosovo and Ukraine, we were not able to host this match at home, so we are very happy that our friends from Vilnius agreed to host us," the head coach of the Ukrainian team, Maxim Michelson, told Rytas.
We have a lot of friends in Vilnius, and our countries always get along well with each other.
Lithuania is one of the best basketball traditions in the world, so it will be a real honor for us to play here.
We hope to get some support from the villains.
The Kosovo team was not able to come to Ukraine because these countries do not have any diplomatic relations.
Currently, the Ukrainian team is in third place with one win in three matches after the first round, while the Kosovo team is in second position and has more wins.
This will be a major challenge for Group E, as only two teams will advance to the next stage.
In the past, Ukraine and Kosovo national teams competed in qualifying for the 2017 European Basketball Championship in Vilnius.
The Ukrainian team won 100-61.
Basketball fans will be able to enter the game for free on Wednesday, and the start of the duel - 7:00 p.m.
'Women lie better' star actress Boris Arsobaitė is haunted by liars
It’s probably just a coincidence, but the charming brown-eyed actress Brigita Arsobaitė has been receiving roles related to liars for several times.
At first, the series "Women Lie Better", then the play "Liars" and finally the comedy "Liars".
In this film, Brigita plays the wayward wife of Dainius Kazlauskas’ hero.
"I loved filming in Lielaisiai because I'm more like a theater actress and I rarely appear in movies.
The wonderful team of colleagues from the very beginning promised a great result.
This experience is very important and valuable to me.
But the most interesting thing that happened on the court was the puppy Sunny!
All my life I thought that if I had a dog, it would definitely be big and serious.
I've never been interested in those small, decorative "fife" four-legged ones.
But during the filming, Sunny became so attached to me that the sympathy became mutual and eventually I even wanted to buy it from the hostess, but without success," the actress smiles.
From the very first minutes, the comic and intriguing peripets of family members are surrounded by a new Lithuanian comedy "Melagiai", produced by the producers of the Lithuanian hits "Inexperienced" and "Between Us, the Boys...", Paulius Virbickas and producers Stasys Baltakis and Vladimiras Razarionovas.
Your sweetheart just told me she's pregnant.
That would be great news, but... your lover is your brother's wife!
But that's not all.
If you don’t have time to share the “good news” with everyone, the parents suddenly declare – they are different!
After 50 years together...
And all this takes place just before the most beautiful holidays of the year - Christmas!
But the ending will surprise even more, because no one expected such an outcome.
All heroes are not what they seem at first glance...
In B. Arsobaitė's comedy "Liars" a good mood will be given to the audience by four generations of movie stars: Giedrius Savickas, Dainius Kazlauskas, Edita U<0xC5><0xBE>aitė, Giedrė Giedraitytė, Liubomiras Laucevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius, Larisa Kalpokaitė and Gediminas Girdvainis.
Comedy "Liars" - in cinemas from November 9.
A decision on whether to write off 100 million euros in unpaid taxes for emigrants
On Tuesday, the Seimas adopted an amendment to the Law on Declaration of the Place of Residence drafted by the "Farmer" leader Ram<0xC5><0xAB>nas Karbauskis.
56 MPs voted for it, 9 voted against it and 25 abstained.
The Seimas will then consider the amendments on December 6 or later, after receiving the government's conclusion.
According to R. Karbauskis, these payments are calculated for people who have not declared their departure from Lithuania.
According to the MP, in three years, one person does not pay about 1,000 euros, and now there are about 100,000 such people.
Social Democrat Algirdas Sysas regretted that in this way the Seimas would "call on some people not to comply with their obligations" - to declare their departure and then no taxes would be calculated.
Conservative member of the Committee of Health Affairs Antanas Matulas noted that Lithuanians living abroad use the fact that paying a small health insurance fee, they come to Lithuania for treatment - they are provided with the same services as those paying this fee to residents.
The amendments provide that the persons who have left Lithuania would be those who will pay social insurance contributions in the countries of the European Union, the European Economic Area or the Swiss Confederation, and "Sodra" will have exempted them from paying health insurance contributions in Lithuania.
Mindaugas Sinkevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius, the head of Sodra, said earlier that such a step would facilitate both the lives of emigrants and the activities of Sodra.
A video of a teddy bear on the Internet reveals a serious problem
Filed as a mother bear climbs a steep snow-covered slope, and the little one climbs, slides down, and climbs persistently again.
The video has received many reviews and comments.
People admired the perseverance of the little bear - he repeatedly slipped down, he climbed back to his mother.
He succeeds not the first time, but the little one does not even try to give up and finally achieves his goal.
The video is certainly worthy of attention, but it also reveals the threat that humans pose to animals.
Scientists argue that it is also necessary to talk about the fact that people's desire to get to know the wild can sometimes be harmful.
"It's clear to me that the bear drone scared me a lot.
Their movements show that they are panicking.
If the drone didn't fly around, they'd probably have chosen a safer path, or they'd have taken it slower or more cautiously.
It's a great example of how drones should not be used," ecologist Mark Ditmer told The Verge.
Some time ago, Ditmer and his colleagues studied how drones affect bears.
The animals were fitted with heart-work gauges.
When the drone approached, some of the bears would run away, others would not run anywhere, but all their hearts would start beating more often with fright.
Scientists advise to use drones responsibly, not to fly too close, not to make noise and not to fly where it is prohibited.
He spoke to the president through a newspaper.
A Kiev court on Tuesday invited ousted Russian President Viktor Yanukovych to attend a unusual hearing in the case of his alleged treason, the statement said in the state's official gazette.
In a court summons published in the government news newspaper Uridadovoj kurjer, the former leader is invited to attend a criminal hearing on November 19 to hear his closing arguments.
The document states that Yanukovych has the right to attend the meeting by video link.
On October 30, a Kiev court said it had closed the debate in the Yanukovych case.
Yanukovych's Russian lawyer, Alexander Goro<0xC5><0xA1>inski, was given the opportunity to register with the register of foreign lawyers until November 19 to attend a hearing where Yanukovych is expected to have his last word by video link.
The Kremlin-backed Yanukovych was ousted and fled to Russia during the Maidan uprising in February 2014, triggered by the president's refusal to sign an association agreement with the European Union.
Russian President Vladimir Putin later revealed that the former Ukrainian leader had been taken to Russia in a special operation organized by Moscow.
In March of that year, Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine, and a war broke out in the east of the country between Kiev and Russian-backed separatists.
Since then, fighting has claimed the lives of some 10,000 people, despite numerous attempts by the international community to secure a lasting ceasefire.
Valdas Benkunskas to lead the list of conservatives to Vilnius City Council
Former Minister of Economy, Member of Parliament Dainius Kreivys has already been approved as a Conservative candidate for the year.
Over the weekend, during the Conservative primary elections, party members ranked the list of candidates for the Vilnius City Municipality Council.
According to the party, V. Benkunskas, chairman of the TS-LKD Vilnius Branch Conference, became the leader of the list of conservatives.
Paulė Kuzmickienė, Adomas Bu<0xC5><0xBE>inskas, Gediminas <0xC5><0xA0>vilpa, Audrius Skaistys, Rasa Ba<0xC5><0xA1>kienė, former Seimas member Liutauras Kazlavickas, Chairman of the Young Conservative League Mantas Benkunskas, Ar<0xC5><0xAB>nas Valinskas and Goda Karazijaite were among the top ten candidates.
Direct elections of mayors and municipal councils will be held in Lithuania on March 3 next year.
Restrictions on Cogeneration Power Plants Appealed to the Constitutional Court
The Seimas opposition, as promised, appealed to the Constitutional Court against the ruling party's decision to pass a law on the possibility of suspending the construction of waste incinerators.
On Tuesday, the opposition faction of the Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) announced that a group of MPs had turned to the Constitutional Court asking to investigate the constitutionality of the amendments to the Law on Waste Management adopted by the ruling party.
"The Parliament stresses that the provisions of the law are aimed at questioning the existing waste incinerator projects, by instructing the government to impose new restrictions (20 km distance from the residential area) before the law enters into force for the waste incinerators that have been started to be built in Vilnius and Kaunas," the statement said.
"Parliaments note that taking into account how the law formulates the prohibition to construct waste management objects of national importance (i.e., to determine the distance and define the concept of "residential area"), it must be concluded that this prohibition disproportionately restricts or even denies the essence of the right to carry out economic activities related to the incineration of waste for energy production, because the established criteria are formulated in such a way that, after assessing the density and distribution of the Lithuanian population in the country, it is impossible to construct such objects.
The motion states that the adopted law is contrary to the constitutional principle of a state under the rule of law.
The Constitutional Court has repeatedly indicated that legal acts do not apply to those legal facts and consequences that occurred before the entry into force of the newly adopted legal act.
In this case, the government is vested with the power to apply the law retroactively on the basis of an unspecified criterion.
The establishment of such legal regulation violates the constitutional principles of legal certainty, legal security, protection of legitimate expectations and, therefore, the constitutional principle of a state under the rule of law," the petition states.
It also notes that significant financial investments have already been made in the projects of the combined heat and power plants in Vilnius and Kaunas.
Suspension of the current projects would not only result in hundreds of millions of financial losses for the state, but would also cause huge losses for the Lithuanian population: heating prices would increase, and environmental pollution would increase due to the growing amount of waste disposal in landfills.
The appeal to the Constitutional Court was signed by Algirdas Butkevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius, the deputy head of the Seimas TS-LKD, the Liberal Movement, Social Democrat groups and the ruling Social Democrat Labour Group.
A couple of weeks ago, the Seimas managed to get 71 votes to reject the amendments to the Law on Waste Management adopted by President Dalia Grybauskaitė's veto, which provide for the government's right to stop the construction of cogeneration plants that have already been started, and also established a 20-kilometre "quarantine" zone from residential areas for the construction of such plants.
The amendments to the law, which have been repeatedly adopted by the Seimas, will come into force on 1 January 2019.
This proposal is expected to be discussed in the autumn session of the Seimas.
However, the right of the government to suspend projects that have already been started is not planned to be abandoned.
The court will examine this case in the order of succession, not earlier than in one year.
LeBron James's statistics at the Lakers
LeBron James’s start at the Los Angeles Lakers isn’t what he expected, the organization and basketball fans to expect.
The Lakers started the season with four wins and six losses, and such a weak start led to rumors of a possible dismissal of coach Luke Walton.
Still, the president of basketball operations, Magic Johnson, calmed down, saying he would not fire the coach, but he needed to play better.
The team's biggest star, L. James, should be back on his own.
Although the forward's statistics are usually impressive - 26.8 points, 7.6 rebounds and 7.7 assists.
But it does not tell the whole truth.
In the first ten games of the season, there were other numbers showing that the Lakers played better when James was not on the court.
Unfavorable +/- statistics showing how many points the team scores or misses when there are certain players on the field.
That's when James is on the pitch, the Lakers have spent 30 points more than their rivals this season.
As he sat on the bench, the "lakes" scored 19 points more than the rivals.
The Lakers are currently in 13th place in the Western Conference, but a few victories could turn everything upside down.
Spain will continue to contribute to the protection of Lithuanian airspace
Spain will contribute to the protection of the airspace of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia in 2019 and 2020.
"Lithuania highly appreciates Spain's cooperation with NATO and its significant contribution to ensuring the security of our country and the region," Minister Linkevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius said.
The Spanish Air Force has already carried out NATO air policing and air policing missions in the Baltic States five times, including three times in Lithuania.
The last time Spanish Eurofighter jets were deployed in <0xC5><0xA0>iauliai was in May-August this year.
Spain will also contribute to the protection of the airspace of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia in 2019 and 2020.
The Minister also noted that regular consultations were held between Lithuania and Spain on security, political, economic and strategic communication in the fight against propaganda.
Linkevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius expressed his hope that Lithuania and Spain would continue to cooperate closely in addressing the European, transatlantic agenda and other multilateral issues.
Since 2004, when Spain opened its embassy in Vilnius, Ambassador Jose Maria Robles Fraga is the fifth representative of Spain in Lithuania.
On 29 October, Jose Maria Robles Fraga presented his letters of credence to President Dalia Grybauskaitė.
V. A<0xC4><0x8D>ienė on the arrest of R. A<0xC4><0x8D>as: I believe in the innocence of my husband and law enforcement
“It was the most incredible thing I could ever think of.
On the other hand, the services are probably doing the work they have to do.
We all do our job.
I believe in law enforcement, I believe in my husband, that everything is right and fair, that no unfair actions should be done," A<0xC4><0x8D>ienė told BNS.
R. A<0xC4><0x8D>as was detained by the Special Investigation Service (STT) on Monday - law enforcement suspects that he, while still the director of the administration of Raseiniai Municipality, took a bribe of high value, and in return could create exceptional conditions for a private company that signed a contract with the Raseiniai bus park managed by the municipality.
Representatives of private companies are suspected of directly bribing A<0xC4><0x8D>as or of taking part in concealing bribes in various financial operations.
Raseiniai district municipality council dismissed R. A<0xC4><0x8D>as from the position of the head of the administration on the third attempt in April of this year after expressed distrust.
The former "orderman" in March this year became a member of the newly established Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party led by Gediminas Kirkilas, he suspended his membership in the party on Monday.
R. A<0xC4><0x8D>as was unsuccessfully running for mayor a few years ago as a representative of the election committee "Tavo Raseiniai".
V. A<0xC4><0x8D>ienė says that the man did not intend to stand as a candidate in the elections of Raseiniai mayor next year, but had not yet decided whether he would not participate in the municipal council elections.
V. A<0xC4><0x8D>ienė was elected to the Seimas with the list of the Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union, she is a member of the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission.
The politician says she will wait for further law enforcement actions, and it will depend on whether she withdraws from the commission.
“I’m not making any quick decisions today, I think I’ll make some decisions this week.
I will see, if there is a need, what charges have been brought, I will of course make one decision or another.
I probably need to stay away from all the things that are being investigated by the Anti-Corruption Commission, but again, time will put everything in its place," she said.
Radvilė Mork<0xC5><0xAB>naitė-Mikulėnienė, the representative of the opposition conservatives in the Seimas, urged the Speaker of the Seimas Viktoras Pranckietis and the leader of the "Farmer" Ram<0xC5><0xAB>nas Karbauskis to distance themselves from the statements of the group's colleague Vida A<0xC4><0x8D>ienė and recall her from the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission, transferring her to another parliamentary committee or commission.
She says that A<0xC4><0x8D>ienė's further work in the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission "would lead to a society-based mistrust and discredit the work of an important parliamentary oversight commission."
"Coldplay" has attracted the attention of famous Lithuanian couples
Many music and film lovers gathered for the pre-release of Coldplay: A Head Full of Dreams.
The event was attended by a group of famous people: Jonas and Simona Nainiai, Ignas Lelys, Martynas Tyla and many others.
The film tells the story of Coldplay, one of Britain’s most popular pop-rock bands, which intertwines with moments from concerts.
The documentary’s director, Mat Whitecross, met the band’s guys while they were still playing in bars and gathering just a few dozen spectators.
In the film you can see undiscovered shots from behind the scenes of concerts, rehearsals or free time.
Vocalist and pianist Chris Martin and guitarist Jonny Buckland met at college in 1996 and formed the band Pectoralz.
They were soon joined by bassist Guy Berryman and, a little later, drummer Will Champion.
The band changed their name to Coldplay and released their first record, Safety, exactly twenty years ago, containing three tracks.
Of the 500 copies of the record, most were distributed to radio stations, producers and friends, and only 50 Safety copies went on sale.
Coldplay are now a world-renowned, respected and beloved band that has released seven albums with over 100 million copies sold.
The band has won 107 awards in two decades, including nine Brit Awards and seven Grammys.

Israelis shot dead in West Bank after Palestinian knife attack
The soldier "prevented this attack by identifying a terrorist who attempted to knife civilians and an IDF (Israel Defence Forces) officer," the Israeli army said in a statement on the incident outside the Kirjat Arba settlement near Hebron.
"The soldier fired at the terrorist and neutralized him.
He was taken to hospital.
Israeli civilians and IDF troops were not hurt," the statement added.
A military spokeswoman told AFP the attack was attempted by a Palestinian.
Video footage of the incident showed that he was slightly injured.
A similar wave of Palestinian attacks began in 2015.
Such attacks have declined in recent years, but there are fears that a new wave of them may emerge.
On October 22, a Palestinian was shot dead after he attacked a group of Jewish soldiers near Hebron with a knife.
Grybauskaite calls on China to create a more favourable investment environment for EU businesses
President Dalia Grybauskaitė calls on China to create a more favourable investment environment for European Union (EU) countries and to facilitate foreign imports.
At the opening of the trade and investment forum at the China Import Expo in Shanghai, Grybauskaite stressed that, in the face of signs of economic slowdown, the common goal between Europe and China should be to "unite efforts to stop the spread of protectionism in the world", which would apply to the root causes of the tensions caused by trade wars, "overproduction and unfair competition".
"China's commitment to create a more attractive, open environment for investment is crucial for the European Union, as is negotiating a trade deal with China.
It is important to complete this trade agreement as soon as possible, ensuring that foreign businesses feel welcome and safe here, as well as strengthening the protection of intellectual property," Grybauskaitė said.
She said China's opening-up was important not only for Europe but also for the country and for global economic growth.
Dalia Grybauskaitė underlined that investment transparency must be "above the interests of any business group".
"Transparency, the rule of law, strict compliance with international treaties - this must be an essential point for the new investment relationship environment," Grybauskaitė said.
"Corrupted capital flows should not be expected in any country in the world - not just here or in our countries," she added.
China’s import exhibition is trying to defuse criticism that it avoids opening up its own market and only protects its own companies.
More than 2800 companies from 130 countries and regions of the world, including Lithuania, participate in the exhibition.
According to the data of Statistics Lithuania, China currently ranks 25th among export partners.
Last year, Lithuania's exports to China grew by 50 percent, reaching 180 million euros.
At the same time, imports from China exceeded EUR 820 million.
Some officials worry that China's investment in Lithuania could bring undesirable political influence, while Beijing's exclusive attention to Eastern Europe divides the EU's unity.
Troubleshooting: The mobile signature service is already working
The Estonian IT company SK ID Solutions, a mobile signature provider, reports that the mobile signature system has been removed and the service is working as usual.
The mobile signature went live again at 2:28 p.m.
The mobile signature system crashed at 9:52 a.m. on Monday.
The customers of the telecommunications companies "Bite", "Tele2" and "Telia" suffered from these failures.
SK ID Solutions has identified the cause of the crash, but does not disclose it for security reasons.
The company apologizes to consumers for the inconvenience.
SK ID Solutions specializes in international e-identification solutions.
They are partners of the Estonian state, issuing certificates of national identity documents and giving citizens of different countries the opportunity to access electronic services and submit electronic signatures.
SK ID Solutions serves nearly 1,000 organizations that provide financial, healthcare, education, and other private and public sector electronic services.
SK ID Solutions services in the Baltic States are used by more than two million end-users.
Lion Air plane crash: families of victims angry
Indonesian airliner Lion Air's black box data shows that at least four of its last flights suffered a speedometer malfunction, investigators said Monday.
Soerjanto Tjahjono, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Committee (NTSC), said a similar incident had occurred on the plane's last four flights, including the fatal one when it crashed in the Java Sea on October 29 shortly after taking off from Jakarta.
All 189 people on board were killed.
Many media outlets reported problems during the previous flight of the Boeing 737 MAX 8 from Denpasar to the Indonesian capital.
"When we opened the black box, yes, in fact the technical problem was the speed in the air, in other words the speed of the plane," Tjahjono told a news conference.
"Data from the black box showed that during the two flights before Denpasar-Jakarta was also the same problem," he added.
“There are a lot of rumors on social media.
“We now want to clarify that there are four flights in the black box during which there were problems with the air speedometer,” he said.
At a meeting with family members of the dead, Tjahjono said the information from the flight recorder was consistent with reports that the speed and altitude of the last flight had changed erratically.
Search teams have not yet found a second black box recording conversations in the cockpit.
Lion Air said it had corrected the technical fault on the Bali-Jakarta flight in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations.
One of the company's founders, Rusdi Kirana, was not invited to speak to Transport Minister Budi Karyos Sumadi, who moderated a meeting between family members and officials overseeing the search for the plane and the victims' remains, as well as the investigation into the crash.
But he stood up and bowed his head when angry and grieving family members demanded that Kirana, who co-founded Lion Air with his brother Kusnan in 1999, introduce himself.
Lion Air acted inappropriately," said a man who identified himself as the father of passenger Shandy Johan Ramadhan, a prosecutor on the island where the plane was headed.
"I want Mr. Rusdi Kirana and his team to pay attention," he said.
Since the beginning of the crisis, Lion Air has never contacted me.
We lost our child, but Lion Air showed us no compassion."
After the meeting, Kirana hurriedly left, avoiding questions from journalists.
Many families are waiting for the results of a long process of identifying the dead.
Police medical experts received nearly 140 body bags loaded with human remains.
So far, only 14 victims have been identified.
Relatives have questioned why the aircraft, which entered service two months ago, was allowed to fly despite a malfunction on the October 28 flight from Bali to Jakarta, which caused passengers to be frightened by the sudden downfall of the plane shortly after takeoff.
Lion Air said that this fault has been removed.
Is it true that the problem has been solved? asked the son of one of the dead.
- If not, the technicians concerned must be brought to justice.
The law is very clear, not that they said the plane was allowed to take off again.
These bad technicians must be held accountable by law to prevent a repeat of the plane crash in Indonesia.
Tjahjono said the large amount of small debris and the fact that it had spread over a relatively small area indicated that the plane was likely crashing into the water at a very high speed.
“The plane was intact when it fell into the sea.
It did not explode in the air, and the aircraft's engines, when it touched the water, operated at high revs, as shown by all of the turbine's broken blades," the official said.
The Lion Air crash is Indonesia's worst aviation disaster since 1997, when 234 people were killed in a Garuda plane crash near Medan.
Rescuers rescued from wreckage: minor injured
On Monday evening, on the road Vė<0xC5><0xBE>ai<0xC4><0x8D>iai - Plungė, near Tilvikiai, cars "BMW" and "Mercedes-Benz" collided.
Cars collided head-on, with three people reported injured.
It is reported that the BMW driver, born in 1999, drove to the opposite side of the road and crashed head-on into a Mercedes-Benz car carrying a father born in 1967 and a daughter born in 2005.
The driver of the BMW was rescued from the wreckage by firefighters - rescuers.
A girl from a Mercedes-Benz was knocked out of her teeth in an accident.
All the victims were taken to the hospital.
Presidential Palace: No artificial relief needed for referendum
After the Seimas approved the proposal of the ruling parties to lower the threshold for the referendum for the currently more protective first section of the Constitution, the president will veto the amendments, Mindaugas Lingė, her adviser, said. [...]
"More than half of the population voted for the Constitution - that is a requirement.
This and its modification, especially the articles in its first section, certainly should be no less the majority .
It's easy to predict that the president would indeed veto," Dalia Grybauskaitė's domestic policy adviser told <0xC5><0xBD>ini<0xC5><0xB3> Radijas radio on Tuesday.
He stressed that the first section of the Constitution defines the fundamental issues of the state - language, flag, territory, capital, sovereignty of the state, therefore, reducing the number of votes necessary to amend these articles would create a "negative precedent" and "open unmanageable risks".
"In the President's view, there is no need for any artificial facilitations, we need more preparation for the referendum itself, we need more dialogue with the people," he said.
The Lithuanian parliament is scheduled to vote on Tuesday on the amendment to the referendum law.
It provides that a decision on amendments to Chapters 1 and 14 of the Constitution, which enjoy higher protection, shall be adopted if at least two fifths of the citizens with the right to vote approve it in a referendum.
At present, more than half of all citizens with the right to vote may amend articles of Chapters I and 14 of the Constitution by referendum.
About 2.5 million citizens have the right to vote in Lithuania: half would be 1.25 million voters, two fifths - one million voters.
The proposal came after the Seimas in September approved the president's veto on earlier amendments that softened the requirements for the number of votes on the change of citizenship in Article 12 of Section 1 of the Constitution.
It is proposed to reduce the threshold for the referendum in the run-up to the referendum on dual citizenship, which should take place on 12 May next year and on 26 May, when the first and second rounds of presidential elections are planned.
Those who emigrated after the restoration of independence on March 11, 1990, currently, with some exceptions, cannot have dual citizenship.
The world's Lithuanian community is seeking dual citizenship, but it fears that under the current conditions a referendum will not take place - not enough people would come to vote.
R. Masiulis: Lithuanian Airports are “bra<0xC5><0xA1>ka”, therefore they need to be updated
The infrastructure of Lithuanian airports and roads is starting to crumble, therefore it needs to be upgraded, says Rokas Masiulis, Minister of Transport and Communications.
According to him, the renovation of Vilnius Airport is the minimum task that the state must perform.
"The air transport infrastructure is already crumbling because it was planned for smaller passenger flows.
We must upgrade Vilnius Airport - it does not even fall into long-term planning, that is the minimum we must do," Masiulis said at a conference on communications organised by the Democracy Development Fund and the magazine Valstybė on Tuesday.
According to the minister, the next decade will be crucial as important projects will have to be implemented: the construction of Via Baltica, Rail Baltica, the construction of the Klaipėda outer port, the renovation of Vilnius and Kaunas airports, and possibly a new airport.
"The next decade will be very important - we must complete the integration of roads and railways, the construction of an external port in Klaipėda, clean up the airports, and perhaps decide on the construction of a new airport.
We must not sleep, we must start projects now that will use our potential in 10, 20 or 30 years' time," said the Minister of Transport and Communications.
Mr. Masiulis reiterated that road maintenance has been underfunded in recent years.
“The roads are not getting better because there is not enough money.
We are planning to build new roads, but even the necessary maintenance, for example, on highways, lacks funds.
We must determine the amount that should be allocated for road maintenance if we want their condition to improve," Masiulis said.
He emphasized that the export of Lithuanian transport sector services grew by 18.6% this year, and Germany became the largest export market, overtaking Russia.
Mr Masiulis once again criticised the European Commission's proposal, according to which carriers of EU countries will have to periodically return trucks to the country of registration.
“We must make our exporters feel at home in Western Europe.
In my opinion, the proposal for trucks to keep coming home is absurd, because empty trucks would be driving around in Europe, burning fuel, increasing emissions.
The railways will gain the most from this, as the costs will increase so much that part of the transport will go to the railways.
We are looking for ways to defend our positions," Masiulis said.
According to the Ministry of Transport, the transport sector accounts for 12.2%.
Lithuania's Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
It has more than 118,000 employees and more than 7,500 companies.
Disputes with Heritage Trustees
Last week, Mr. Masiulis announced in the Seimas Economic Committee that he had started negotiations on the change of cultural purpose of the Vilnius Airport building, which would allow to demolish the old terminal and build a new one.
However, Algimantas Degutis, acting head of the Department of Cultural Heritage (KPD), called Mr. Masiulis' considerations political pressure.
According to him, the building, which was built in the 1950s, is a value that was entered in the register in 1993, and it is not politicians, and specialists have to decide on its deletion.
Mr. Masiulis commented at the time that a modern arrival terminal would contribute to the improvement of Lithuania’s image.
"To extract this old terminal from the heritage would be a politically important step to demolish it and build a new modern arrival terminal so that upon arrival in Vilnius, you would feel yourself in a modern country, rather than in such an interesting, really unrepresentative country as an innovative one," Masiulis said last week.
At the time, Mr. Masiulis also announced that it was planned to build a completely new passenger terminal in Kaunas and to connect the airport with the Rail Baltica track by building an underground station.
This transport hub is expected to be operational in 2026, after the completion of the Rail Baltica project.
Last year Vilnius Airport serviced about 3.7 million people, 4.8 million passengers are expected this year and 5 million passengers are expected next year.
Last year Kaunas Airport serviced a total of 1.2 million passengers.

Next year direct flights from Vilnius to Madagascar will be launched
Next spring, the largest regular-flying Boeing 767 passenger aircraft will land at Vilnius Airport, which will fly passengers from Lithuania directly to the Be island of Madagascar, according to information provided by the tour operator Itaka Lietuva.lt.
Passengers will be able to choose from 259 economy class and 8 business class seats.
The new holiday destination will be available directly from Lithuania from April 2019.
Dominikas Milowskis, CEO of Itaka Lietuva, says that he is trying to offer tourists from Lithuania new holiday destinations.
Madagascar is an island in the Indian Ocean, near the east coast of Africa.
Other tour operators have also prepared new holiday destinations for the summer season of 2019.
For example, "Novaturas" and "Itaka" will start flying directly from Vilnius to Tirana (Albania).
Finance Minister on possible crisis: it is important not to talk about the disease
“We always have to prepare for more difficult times.
What I want to be happy about is that for the third year in a row, for the first time in the history of Lithuania, we are accumulating reserves.
But it is also a very important thing - not to talk about the disease," <0xC5><0xA0>apoka said during a visit to Brussels on Monday.
On Monday and Tuesday, the Minister of Finance and Vice-Minister Miglė Tuskienė participates in the meetings of the Eurogroup and the EU Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN) in Brussels.
The ECOFIN meeting discusses issues related to taxation of digital services.
This new tax aims to avoid fragmentation of the EU single market, as some Member States have already introduced, or are about to introduce, a tax at national level.
In the short term, it is proposed that there should be an agreement on how revenues from the provision of certain digital services in EU Member States should be taxed until there is a global consensus.
The Eurogroup will review the draft budgets of the euro area countries submitted to the European Commission (EC).
On 23 October, the European Commission rejected Italy’s draft budget as not compliant with the Stability and Growth Pact.
This is the first time the Commission has used this opportunity.
Further information was requested from Belgium, France, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain.
The Eurogroup will also discuss the deepening of the Economic and Monetary Union: possibilities for implementing the European deposit insurance system and reforms of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).
Lithuania supports a stronger role of the ESM in financial assistance programmes, however, it is considered that the functions of the ESM should be clearly defined in order to avoid duplication of the ESM and other EU institutions.
Balys Bura<0xC4><0x8D>as.
Lithuanian labour traditions and customs
Recently, it has been 120 years since the birth of the famous Lithuanian photographer and cultural chronicler, ethnographer and ethnographer Balias Bura<0xC4><0x8D>as (1897-1972) in Sidari<0xC5><0xB3>, <0xC5><0xA0>iaulėnai county, then <0xC5><0xA0>iauliai province.
Celebrating the 100th anniversary of the State of Lithuania, we have a great opportunity to remember how the national revival that breathes life has called many people of Lithuania, including the brothers Bura<0xC4><0x8D>us - Bali, Jonas, Bronius - to engage creatively from the very depths of the countryside in the fostering, giving meaning to and preservation of our cultural traditions.
Balys Bura<0xC4><0x8D>as, who spent more than 50 years traveling around his native country with a camera in his hands, presented a wide and realistic picture of our country’s customs, traditions, folk art and material culture.
He sought to preserve the rapidly disappearing layers of national culture and had a rare ability to realize the enduring value of his work.
In the photographs of Balys Bura<0xC4><0x8D>as, the Lithuanian landscape, mounds, people immortalized in the environment of everyday life and holidays decorated the pages of Lithuanian newspapers and magazines with national costumes.
This publication presents a significant part of Balys Bura<0xC4><0x8D>as’ heritage, dedicated to the description of national labour customs and related traditions and, most importantly, their attractive iconography.
The material published shows not only the uniqueness and beauty of these traditions, but also the progress of our civilization over the past century, despite two world wars and heavy occupation.
The manuscript of the book is particularly rich in the interwar Samogitian, especially Kupi<0xC5><0xA1>kėnai, <0xC5><0xA0>iauliai, Tel<0xC5><0xA1>i<0xC5><0xA1>kės, as well as Auk<0xC5><0xA1>taitija and Dz<0xC5><0xAB>kija residents’ works, their celebrations and other traditions and customs written by Balias Bura<0xC4><0x8D>as.
Of the approximately 10,000 negatives stored in museums and archives, more than 400 rare, mostly unpublished, photographs were selected for this publication and grouped according to the selected texts.
They reflect the unique aspects of ethnic culture typical of Kupi<0xC5><0xA1>kėnai, Dz<0xC5><0xAB>kai, other Auk<0xC5><0xA1>taitija and <0xC5><0xBD>emaitija districts.

Tragically, the couple died after just a few hours of marriage.
A helicopter crash in southwest Texas killed a newlywed couple who were married just hours earlier.
William Troy Byler, 24, and his wife Bailee Raye Ackerman Byler died on Sunday shortly after midnight when a helicopter crashed into a hill 16km northwest of Juvaldi and 129km west of San Antonio, local peace judge Steven Kennedy said.
Surprisingly, the accident happened after flying about 24 kilometers, exactly the same number of years as the newlyweds.
The pilot, 76-year-old Gerald Douglas Lawrence, was also killed.
The couple studied at Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, Texas.
They married on Saturday evening at the Byler family ranch near Juvaldi, and flew out in a family helicopter after the wedding.
The accident occurred when the helicopter flew about 20 miles.
The newlyweds were on their way to Sant Antoni International Airport, where they were planning to board a plane and fly for their honeymoon, Kennedy said, without specifying the final destination of the couple.
"It's a very rocky, rugged terrain, and the hill is about 120-150 meters high," Kennedy said.
Lawrence had been piloting the family’s aircraft for years.
Kennedy said he was piloting helicopters and serving in Vietnam.
The autopsy should reveal the pilot’s physical condition and whether it could have caused the crash.
The helicopter crashed about 5-10 minutes after take-off.
Its wreckage spanned a wide radius on a rocky hillside and its body remained "dangerously suspended", flight safety investigator Craig Hatch of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) told a news conference on Monday.
Investigators are going to take the wreckage out and then inspect it thoroughly, but it won’t be easy for the truck and truck to reach the site, he said.
The cause of the crash has not yet been determined, and the NTSB's preliminary report is expected to be published in two weeks.
Israeli PM calls new Iran sanctions 'historic day'
"Today is a historic day," Netanyahu told MPs from his Likud party, his office said.
“Today is the day, under President Trump, the United States imposes particularly severe sanctions on Iran, the most severe sanctions on Iran since efforts to curb his aggression began,” he said.
Earlier on Monday, Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman said the new sanctions would "decisively" hit Israel's actions in the region.
The measures, described by Washington as "the toughest sanctions ever," came after Trump's controversial decision in May to pull out of a global nuclear deal with Tehran.
The sanctions aim to significantly reduce Iran's oil exports, which have fallen by about a million barrels a day since May, and cut Tehran off from international financing.
Israel has long opposed the Iran nuclear deal, saying it is too limited in scope and timeframe.
The Jewish state also says the lifting of sanctions has allowed Iran to fund militant groups and its own military activities.
Israel is particularly concerned about Iran's actions in neighbouring Syria and has vowed not to allow it to assert itself militarily there.
The other parties to the deal -- Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia -- oppose the U.S. decision, saying the deal has so far prevented Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.
Court rules over death of young motorcyclist
At the death of a young motorcyclist in Vilnius, the Northern town, in the case of an accident that has ended, the court will hear the testimony of a witness.
Vilnius Regional Court ruled on Tuesday that in order to clarify all the significant circumstances of the case, one of the witnesses in the case will be examined at the next hearing on November 26.
An acquittal has already been handed down in this case, but the prosecutor’s office disagrees.
On August 22, Vilnius City District Court acquitted the driver of a motorcycle accident after declaring that the 79-year-old Eduard Osipov was driving at high speed and had committed a serious violation.
The Vilnius Regional Prosecutor's Office is asking the regional court to overturn the ruling of the district court and says Osipov is the biggest culprit in the accident, while the district court's findings are unfounded.
The acquittal is also requested by the family lawyer of the deceased motorcyclist.
The accident happened around 3 p.m. on August 11, 2015, when Osipov's <0xC5><0xA0>koda Fabia drove from Lak<0xC5><0xAB>n<0xC5><0xB3> Street into <0xC5><0xBD>irm<0xC5><0xAB>n<0xC5><0xB3> Street and collided with a motorcycle driving on the main road.
The prosecutor's office accused the man of breaking traffic rules to give way and causing a traffic accident by killing a man who was riding a Piaggo motorcycle on the main road.
Initial police reports said the motorist was killed, but later investigations found that the vehicle was comparable in power to the motorcycle.
Rolandas Bu<0xC5><0xBE>inskas, a judge of Vilnius City District Court, told BNS that experts had determined that the motorcycle driver was driving at a speed of 89.2 kilometres per hour, although the speed limit at that place was 50 kilometres per hour.
"The driver of the car could not have foreseen that the motorcycle would travel at such a high speed," the judge said.
At the time, the driver of a senior car claimed to have been driving at a speed of only five to six kilometres per hour.
The motorcycle driver, who saw the obstacle, tried to brake and fell off the vehicle before facing <0xC5><0xA0>koda Fabia.
The prosecutor's office believes Osipov, who was driving from the side road to the main road, should have given way to the motorcyclist.
Novaya Gazeta: Six Wagner mercenaries killed in Syria
Five Syrian soldiers and six members of the Wagner company were among the dead.
This is reported by the source of Novaya Gazeta in Syria.
According to the source, one of the 5th units of the Syrian Armed Forces Corps is stationed in the territory, which includes a number of Syrian volunteers and "military mercenaries".
"Novaya Gazeta" sent a request to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs with a request for information about the fate of the Russians.
Belgium's ex-king to take paternity test
This decision is a partial victory for the artist Delphine Boel.
She has been seeking recognition as a child of a former monarch since 2013.
The 50-year-old claims that her mother, Baroness Sybille de Selys Longchamps, and Albert II had had a long love affair decades ago.
The 84-year-old former king denies paternity.
According to the RTBF, he can go to the Supreme Court to oppose a DNA test.
According to the Court of Appeals, Jacques Boel, Delphine’s mother’s ex-husband, is neither biologically nor legally the artist’s father.
Delphine was approached for the appropriate investigation in order to be recognized as the daughter of "real" father Albert.
CEC will distribute the money to the parties, but the social workers will not give anything
This week, the Central Electoral Commission (CEC) plans to allocate a budget subsidy of almost 3 million euros to the largest political parties.
The ruling Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party (LSDDP), which was established in spring this year and is headed by Deputy Speaker Gediminas Kirkilas, has not yet been set aside for funding from the budget.
However, they may be allocated already in the near future by a separate decision of the Central Electoral Commission, if the legal environment regulating the distribution of grants to parties changes.
Laura Matjo<0xC5><0xA1>aityte, the Chairwoman of the Central Electoral Commission, informed the V<0xC5><0xBD> that "this Thursday, a meeting of the commission is scheduled to take a decision on the distribution of the budget half-year grant to parties."
According to her, the CEC must make a decision on this matter by November 15.
Seven parties, six of which are parliamentary, are to receive 2.751 million euros.
The opposition Homeland Union – Lithuanian Christian Democrats should receive more than 0.66 million euros, the ruling Peasant and Greens Union – about 0.55 million euros, the opposition Social Democratic Party – about 0.5 million euros, the opposition Liberal Movement – almost 0.4 million euros, the Labour Party – which does not have its own group – about 0.23 million euros.
Under the current law, which will be followed by the Central Electoral Commission when distributing the budget money, grants are awarded to parties that meet the requirements of the law and have received at least 3% of votes in the last elections to the Seimas, municipal councils and the European Parliament.
Therefore, the current legal regulation does not allow the LSDDP, which was established only this spring, to expect to receive money from the budget.
So far, the party has not participated in any elections.
However, the ruling coalition is trying to change the law so that the social workers will receive at least about two hundred thousand euros for three elections to be held next year - municipal, presidential and European Parliament elections.
The relevant amendments to the Law on Political Parties and this year's budget passed by the Seimas were vetoed by President Dalia Grybauskaitė.
The Seimas has not yet decided on the veto, but the ruling party's representatives Kirkilas and the leader of the Peasant-Greens Ram<0xC5><0xAB>nas Karbauskis say MPs will seek to reject the president's objections.
However, this will not be possible until this Thursday's meeting of the CEC, therefore, according to Ms. Matjo<0xC5><0xA1>aitytė, "grants will be allocated in accordance with the legal order that has existed until now."
However, the head of the Central Electoral Commission has not ruled out that if the Seimas rejects the president's veto this week or next week and new amendments on the allocation of budget funds to parties enter into force, the commission may consider a decision on the allocation of an additional grant to individual political forces, including the LSDDP.
"We will take into account the entire existing legal environment when making our decision, as we are the executive body that has to implement the laws that are being passed," she said.
If the Seimas were able to reject the veto and the new laws came into force, the Government would allocate additional money to the parties according to them, borrowing the corresponding amounts for this purpose.
Grants already distributed to seven parties would not be affected by such a decision.
The results of <0xC5><0xA0>iauli<0xC5><0xB3> bankas were used for the sale of shares
<0xC5><0xA0>iauli<0xC5><0xB3> bankas, which announced the results for the 3rd quarter, on Monday received the most attention in the Baltic stock exchange, where the positive reaction soon received a response from the sellers.
Vilnius Stock Exchange index rose 0.46% on Monday, shares in Riga were 0.49% cheaper overall, Tallinn Stock Exchange index dropped 0.18%, OMX Baltic Benchmark dropped 0.07%.
Over 3 exchanges 478 shares were transferred for EUR 762.172.
Poroshenko: Orderers of the murder of activist Handziuk must be punished
“I want to make it clear that no version – and there are more than 20 of them today – will be rejected.
Each will be carefully examined in accordance with the examination procedures.
“As president, I have no opportunity or obligation to obtain information that could undermine the course of the investigation.
However, the authorities must ensure transparency and the law enforcement agencies must work effectively.
Only in this way will it be possible to find out the truth and punish evil," Poroshenko said at a meeting with young people in Kiev on Tuesday.
He stressed that he was most interested in finding out about the murder and that the murderers, organizers and sponsors of the crime "accept the necessary responsibility".
"After this case was reclassified as a murder, they are quite rightly and justly threatened with life imprisonment," he said.
He called the public demand for an open and impartial investigation into the case.
Poroshenko stressed that the statements by law enforcement officials in parliament should show that "the authorities are determined to bring criminals and murderers to justice, whoever they are."
He also said that political speculation on the subject would not clarify the situation, but would confuse it even more.
"I call on all forces, both the government and the opposition, not to waste their unsubstantiated arguments and, God forbid, not to use this murder for public relations," he said.
On the contrary, we now need to come together and ensure that the investigation is effective, fair and transparent, fast – one that raises public confidence.
There is no other way for us.”
"No one will be allowed to take advantage of this situation to destabilize the situation in the country," he said.
The anti-corruption campaigner was attacked and acid-laden in July in the city of Kherson.
She was an advisor to the mayor of this southern Ukrainian city.
She was hospitalized after the attack but died in hospital on Sunday.
After police and prosecutors failed to find out who was behind the attack, Ukrainian Attorney General Yuri Lutsenko handed in his resignation on Tuesday.
After her death, authorities have been accused by public activists of failing to conduct an investigation properly.
Activists have also called for the resignation of the attorney general and the interior minister.
"I am submitting my resignation today," Lutsenko told MPs as he read out his investigation report.
Parliament has yet to approve the prosecutor’s resignation.
Lutsenko accused activists of putting pressure on the investigation and leaking important information, making it difficult to identify the perpetrators of the killing.
Bill Gates has launched a toilet without water.
With the introduction of the futuristic toilet, Bill Gates compared the transition from traditional toilets to waterless toilets with the computer revolution of the 1970s.
Microsoft founder Bill Gates unveiled a high-tech toilet that does not require water in plumbing pipes at an exhibition in Beijing, Reuters reported.
The toilet without water works according to the principle of separation of solid and liquid waste.
Both types of wastewater are processed into chemical fertilizers.
"The technologies you see here are the greatest advances in sanitation in the last 200 years," Bill Gates was quoted as saying by Bloomberg.
The tech toilet was funded by a charitable foundation set up by Bill Gates and his wife Melinda.
Over the course of seven years, the foundation has spent $200 million working on a facility that could turn human waste into fertilizer or water.
According to Bill Gates, there were about 20 toilet models.
Now the device is finished and can be sold.
But in order for such toilets to be mass produced, the Gates Foundation is ready to spend another 200 million.
According to the Gates Foundation, 500,000 children under the age of five die every year from poor sanitation.
To combat the problems caused by poor sanitation, such as cholera and others, increases health spending, which already amounts to $233 billion.
To better illustrate the sanitation situation that needs to be improved, Bill Gates takes a jar of feces to the toilet presentation.
He said it was a good reminder that a small sample "could contain 200 trillion rotavirus cells, 200,000 bacteria that cause infectious diseases, and 100,000 worm-parasite eggs."
S. Slyva elected President of the Association of Mass Football
On November 5, an extraordinary meeting of the Lithuanian Mass Football Association was held in Kaunas, where Sergejus Slyva was elected as the new president of the organization.
Due to the request of Anatoly Stetsenko to resign from the office of the president of the association, an extraordinary general meeting of the members of the association was convened.
There were 13 members out of 15.
The main item on the agenda was the election of the new president.
Two candidates took part in the election - Sergejus Slyva and Vaidotas Rastenis.
11 members of the association voted for S. Slyva, two members voted for V. Rastenis.
Slyva will end the term that Stecenko started, which will last until January 2021.
France: Concerns over deaths
French health officials on Monday announced a permanent ban on a widely used pesticide amid concerns over dozens of people who have been poisoned in the country's recent west.
The ANSES health agency said the decision to ban all products containing metam was the result of a new safety review launched earlier this year, at least three months before poisonings broke out in September in the department of Art and Loire.
As a result of these cases, the government has already stopped the use of pesticides.
This soil disinfection chemical should not come into contact with plants or farm workers.
To be effective, the product must be used in large quantities.
In France, about 700 tonnes of it were used every year.
At least 70 people, including many farm workers, in the Angers region, where many salad broths are grown, complained of sore eyes and throats and breathing problems.
"These episodes confirm the correctness of our decision, but they did not speed it up," Francoise Weber, deputy director of the ANSES, told the Ouest France newspaper on Monday.
Metam, one of the most commonly used pesticides in the US and Europe, is considered by the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) to be a 'probable human carcinogen'.
The pesticide, which is marketed under names such as Vapam and Sectagon, is allowed in Europe until 2022, when a new safety inspection must be carried out.
"There was no choice but to remove him from the market, regardless of whether there were alternatives," Weber told the paper.
"We understand the difficulties that will be faced by lettuce growers, farmers in general, but public health is more important," she said.
Farmers have already voiced opposition to the government's decision last month to halt the use of methamphetamine in a region whose economy relies heavily on intensive agriculture.
More than half of the 35,000 tonnes of lettuce consumed in Europe each year is grown in the region near Nantes.
Next season, there will be "much less salad broths, radishes and leeks", Philippe Retiere, head of the Nantes Breeders' Federation, told AFP last month after the government suspended the use of the product.
70 million euros invested in the shopping centre with a viewing wheel in Tallinn
A new shopping centre “T1” will be opened in the capital of Estonia this weekend, where the local capital real estate development company “Pro Kapital Grupp” has invested 70 million euros.
A total of 130,000 sq. m. or 55,000 sq. m. of leased area, the shopping center will operate 150 store services or entertainment venues, more than 30 cafes and restaurants, according to the developer’s report.
In comparison, the total area of Vilnius "Akropolis" (counting together with the area of offices) is about 110,000 sq. m., and rented - 91,000 sq. m.
"T1" is the first shopping center with a rooftop observation wheel, according to the developer.
It will start working early next year.
In addition, international transport gates will also be integrated into the territory: trams will be next to it, and intercity buses will soon be running.
The main terminal of Rail Baltica is also nearby and is expected to serve 1 million passengers a year by 2026.
Paolo Michelozzi, CEO of Pro Kapital Grupp, says that the global supermarket business is undergoing profound changes, and the development of T1 has succeeded in putting them at the forefront.
“We have created a new generation of shopping mall that provides emotions and experiences unattainable online.
It is a place of attraction for people in the very centre of the city, a gateway for travellers, an impressive and worthy attraction, and at the same time a quality time spent with friends or family,” Michelozzi said in a press release.
Great attention to entertainment
According to the manager of the shopping centre, T1 also has the largest entertainment and discovery centre in the Baltic States.
A total of 12,000 sq. m, or a fifth of the total leased area, was allocated for entertainment at the object.
An exclusive highlight is the observation wheel installed on the roof.
It will raise guests to 120 m above sea level - only the TV tower is higher in Tallinn.
Underneath the circle, on the fourth floor, there will be the Super Skypark, which will open Europe’s largest trampoline centre and Estonia’s first basketball and volleyball court, the company said.
The interactive SkyLAB research and discovery center promises to keep children occupied for at least 5-6 hours.
The entertainment complex will also host 360-degree panoramic 4D cinema.
In addition to the usual cinema shown in six halls, visitors will also be able to experience virtual reality cinema with interactive 7D cinema.
In addition to visual effects and moving chairs that move according to the rhythm of the film, the feeling of realism here will be enhanced by the effects of wind, rain or snow, as well as selected smells, smoke or fog in the cinema hall.
According to the developer, the opening of “T1” is expected to increase Estonia’s tourism revenue by 13 million euros per year, attracting more than 300,000 visitors.
Pro Kapital Grupp is listed on the Nasdaq Baltic exchange and also on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.
Last year, the group received 1.8 million euros in sales revenue in Lithuania and incurred losses of 350 thousand euros, according to the financial report of Pro Kapital Grupp.
In 2016, the Lithuanian market generated almost EUR 9 million in sales revenue and earned EUR 2.4 million in net profit.
The T1 shopping centre was built by the Estonian company Merko Ehitus.
Cameroon's President Paul Biya sworn in for seventh term after controversial election
At a ceremony supervised by parliament speaker Cavaye Yeguie Djibril, the 85-year-old vowed to protect the West African state's "integrity and unity".
Africa’s oldest president, who has ruled for 35 years, was declared the winner of the October 7 election with 71 percent of the vote.
However, the election was marred by low voter turnout, violence and suspected fraud.
On the eve of Biya's inauguration, 79 students and three school staff, including the principal, were abducted at a presbyterian school in the northwestern region where English-speaking separatists are campaigning for independence.
The majority of Cameroon's 22 million people are French-speaking and a fifth are English-speaking.
In 2016, the northwestern province and the neighboring southwestern province began to demand autonomy amid discontent over alleged discrimination in education, the judiciary and the economy.
In 2017, after Biya refused to give in, the radicals declared an independent state, the "Republic of Ambazonia", and raised their weapons.
According to NGOs, at least 400 civilians and more than 175 members of the security forces have been killed in separatist attacks and government reprisals this year.
More than 300,000 people have fled the violence, some across the border to Nigeria, but many are forced to live undernourished in the woods.
Only 5 percent of voters in the northwestern region voted in October, compared to 15 percent in the southwestern province.
In both parts of the country, Biya received two-thirds of the votes.
Conservative Primary Elections: Mistakes Caused by Inexperience
"Some things were missing in places - understand that the party organized everything with its own resources.
Some municipalities allowed the use of their premises, but not everywhere were voting booths, because we can not buy them ourselves.
“Thank you to those who borrowed it,” he said.
According to him, complaints have been received, but their content does not change the essence, and the violations themselves are not of a malignant nature.
“There were complaints.
Not all the people who took part in the election had experienced it - it was also news for them.
Thus, not all actions of this inexperience corresponded to our order.
Therefore, we had to warn the RCC that the principles we described would be followed.
These complaints, however, do not create grounds for doubting the results," Anu<0xC5><0xA1>auskas said.
According to the President of the Central Electoral Commission, there have been cases when the ballot papers were not stamped - upon learning of this, the ballot papers found in the ballot boxes without a stamp were annulled.
Some towns lacked space, but, according to Anu<0xC5><0xA1>auskas, complaints and violations were related to several dozen ballots.
"Well, since the difference is several thousand, it certainly does not make a fundamental difference in the election results," Anu<0xC5><0xA1>auskas said.
The turnout of party members was 55 percent, while that of non-party voters was 69 percent.
Both candidates had 400 observers, while 600 people worked on the commissions.
The results announced on Sunday also do not change - 79 percent of voters voted for the winner Ingrida <0xC5><0xA0>imonytė (16,418 votes), while 21 percent (4441 votes) voted for Vygaudas U<0xC5><0xA1>ackas.
On November 17, the TS-LKD Council will officially support I. <0xC5><0xA0>imonytė's candidacy in the presidential elections to be held in May next year.
Trump Says He Won't Meet Putin in Paris
White House national security adviser John Bolton said earlier that Trump would meet with Putin in Paris this week to mark the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I.
But in his final rallies ahead of the US midterm elections, Trump told reporters he was not sure if it would be a good opportunity to meet with the Russian president.
"I'm not sure we'll meet in Paris.
Probably not,” the US president said.
But, he added, the two will meet at the G20 summit and "probably meet many times" afterwards.
Trump is still trying to "reset" relations with Moscow, despite allegations that Russia interfered in the 2016 US presidential election.
K<0xC4><0x99>stutis Strupas calls for annulment of VTEK decision
K<0xC4><0x99>stutis Strupas, the former general director of Vilnius University Santaros Klinikos, has appealed for the annulment of the decision of the Chief Official Ethics Commission (CEO), which acknowledged that the failure to declare transactions on time was a violation of the law.
Strupas's complaint was heard by the Vilnius Regional Administrative Court on Tuesday.
The decision will be announced on November 26.
The petitioner is seeking the annulment of the VTEK decision of May 23, court spokeswoman Sigita Jacinevi<0xC4><0x8D>ienė Baltaduonė told BNS.
K. Strupas believes that gifts given to relatives should not be declared, he says that he understands the exception of the law in this way.
VTEK announced in May that the then removed Santaros Klinikos CEO K. Strupas and the head of the Outpatient Rehabilitation Department of the Republican Vilnius University Hospital Silvija Strupienė violated the provisions of the law regulating the declaration of private interests.
During the investigation, it was established that four transactions were declared in case of non-compliance with the set deadlines: a loan was taken from the bank in 2010 with the spouse, purchase of securities from the bank in 2017, a gift given to the daughter in 2017 - an apartment, and a loan granted to a natural person together with the spouse in 1996 and not recovered.
S. Strupienė also declared these transactions as missing deadlines.
Persons who have violated the Law on the Adjustment of Public and Private Interests in the Civil Service may not be encouraged for a year.
The law obliges you to declare not only your own data, but also the data of your spouse.
The investigation was conducted on the basis of information from Info TV.
It is being investigated whether K. Strupas and his spouse, head of the Outpatient Rehabilitation Division of the Republican Vilnius University Hospital S. Strupienė duly and timely declared their transactions.
According to Info TV, last year K. Strupas gave his daughter real estate worth 125 thousand euros.
However, the former head of the Santara Clinic and his wife did not disclose the data in their declarations of interest.
The law enforcement agency, along with at least ten other people, has expressed suspicions in the corruption investigation - according to law enforcement, companies were required to pay illegal financial compensation for the won public purchases of computers and software in clinics, which was disguised as support.
In this way, K. Strupas is suspected to have consulted at least five times during the procurement in the field of information technologies at Santara Clinics.
Mr. Strupas himself denies his guilt.
In September, Professor K. Strupas, suspected of corruption, was dismissed from his position as head of Santara Clinics.
By the decision of the Ministry of Health of Santara Clinics and Vilnius University, the employment relationship with K. Strupa was terminated at his own request.
He has been in charge of the hospital since November 10, 2013.
Santara clinics continue to be temporarily headed by Professor Juozas Raistenskis until the competition to elect a new CEO is held, it is planned to announce it later this year.
Message of congratulations to L. Gutauskas on his birthday
According to the President, Gutauskas brings together religious, historical and philosophical metaphors, eternal values, and opens a thousand-year-old nation's wisdom and memory.
The author's favorite and appreciated works - poetry, prose, children's literature, painting, book illustrations - testify to L. Gutauskas being a multi-talented artist.
On the occasion of the jubilee, the President thanked the artist for significant works that enriched Lithuania and wished him inspiration, happiness and success.
Schools already want to teach differently: promises less tests, more practice
Such changes in the curriculum are planned by the Ministry of Education and Science, which presented them on Monday at the forum "Changing Educational Content: Foreign Experiences for Solutions in Lithuania" in Vilnius.
The Minister of Education and Science Jurgita Petrauskienė, who spoke during the discussion, said that more than 30 million euros have been invested in updating the curriculum over the last ten years, but no results were seen.
"According to the results of the international student achievement survey PISA, student achievement is below the OECD average," said the Minister of Education and Science Jurgita Petrauskienė.
OECD expert Phil Lambert, quoted in a statement by the Ministry of Education and Science, said that Lithuania is too focused on providing knowledge, not on the practical application of knowledge.
According to him, in general education programs in Lithuania, much attention is paid to the development of students’ literacy, critical thinking, respect and responsibility, but it is also necessary for the development of children’s creativity, entrepreneurship, financial literacy, empathy.
The Vice-Minister of Education and Science Gra<0xC5><0xBE>vydas Kazakevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius, when presenting the changes in the general education content, said that the volume of the programmes that are being updated this school year will decrease, they will be more specific, and the disciplines will be more closely linked with each other.
According to the Vice-Minister, pupils' education will be more individualized, schools will become more independent - they will be allowed to prepare from 10 to 30 per cent of their unique educational content, the current system of pupil assessment will change into a cumulative score, student competences acquired in an informal way will gain more weight.
There will be fewer standardized tests.
It is promised that general education programmes will be digital, user-friendly, linked to e-resources and a task bank.
The aim of the curriculum update is to improve the achievements of students in the international PISA study by at least 10%, to reduce the gap between the achievements of students by a third, to ensure that students acquire modern competences at school, and to be literate in various fields.
Lithuania plans to allocate 7.8 million euros from the European Union and the state budget for updating the curriculum from May 2018.
It is planned that in the 2019-2020 academic year, the project of updated general education curricula will be tested in a part of schools, and from September 2021, they will be implemented in all schools.
At the beginning of October, the Ministry was criticized for the nearly 8 million euro project carried out by the Education Development Center to renew general education programmes for primary, basic and secondary education.
A sum of EUR 7.8 million has been earmarked for this purpose for four years, and at the beginning of October the first procurement of EUR 1.3 million was announced, which was aimed at developers of educational programmes.
After the experts criticized the purchase, it was suspended, and Minister of Education and Science J. Petrauskienė dismissed Giedrius Vaidelis, Director of the Education Development Center.
Training on how to respond to extreme flooding in Lithuania
Lithuania on Monday began a 10-day exercise aimed at improving the authorities' response to extreme flooding.
According to the information provided by the Fire and Rescue Department, the exercise will verify the readiness of state institutions to work in the event of a state-level emergency, such as a flood: to respond to its consequences, to coordinate the search, rescue and emergency evacuation of people from flooded areas, to organize their supply of drinking water, food, to ensure the necessary energy supply and to provide other measures for the protection of the population.
The exercise will be attended by more than 100 representatives from all ministries, other institutions of the country, as well as members of emergency operations centres of 12 municipalities.
On November 5-13, a preparatory phase of the exercise will take place, during which municipalities, which have received information from the Hydrometeorological Service about the continuous rainfall and the beginning of the flood, will make decisions on emergency management.
The active phase of the exercise is scheduled for November 14-15.
During the meeting, the State Emergency Operations Centre will operate in the Department, and the emergency operations centres of the institutions will operate in state and municipal institutions.
When the Government declares a state-level emergency due to the consequences of flooding, the Chief of Operations appointed by the Prime Minister will be in charge of emergency response, mitigation of its consequences, and protection and rescue of residents and property.
Mindaugas Kanapickas, Deputy Director of the PRT, says that the most important thing in the exercise is to check the readiness of the institutions to perform the functions provided for in the legal acts, to assess the possibilities of exchanging information, to check how the preparedness to warn and inform residents, state and municipal institutions, agencies and enterprises about an imminent disaster and to "improve state institutions' emergency management skills".
The exercise will also demonstrate the joint capacities of Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian firefighters-rescuers to pump a huge amount of water from flooded areas.
For this purpose, BaltFloodCombat module was established in 2009.
Prosecutor General of Ukraine Yury Lutsenko resigns
Ukraine's Attorney General Yuriy Lutsenko announced his resignation on Tuesday in a speech to the country's parliament over the resonance caused by the death of an acid-laden anti-corruption campaigner, Katerina Gandziuk, according to Ukrainian news agency Unian.net.
Under Ukrainian law, the attorney general must submit a resignation request to the president of the country, who must submit it to the Verkhovna Rada for approval by a majority vote.
On Tuesday, Attorney General J. Lucenko presented the progress and results of a law enforcement investigation into Gandziuk’s murder order in the Verkhovna Rada.
In a speech to MPs, he described the investigation as effective, but voiced outrage that Gandziuk's death was being exploited for political public relations.
Gandziuk was a Ukrainian anti-corruption activist who spoke publicly about police corruption in her southern Ukrainian hometown of Kherson.
On July 31, an unknown assailant, K. Gandziuk, splashed acid in her face outside her home.
She died in hospital on November 4 due to her injuries.
Protesters at Ukraine's interior ministry are demanding an answer to Gandziuk's death, AFP/Scanpix reported.
Lucenko said the law enforcement investigation involved 12 people allegedly involved in Gandziuk's murder.
However, one of the most likely versions of the study was leaked to the media, which threatens the success of the study.
According to the prosecutor general, due to information leaks, the suspects received essential information for them.
Lucenko added that he personally knew Gandziuk and was outraged that some politicians were using her blood for public relations.
"So that no one has any reason to say that someone clings to the government, I want to state that I am submitting my resignation.
Today I will present it to the President of Ukraine and you will have to discuss this issue in the parliament," the newspaper Obozrevatel quoted Lucenko as saying.
Lutsenko added that "you cannot allow dual government in a country where the law enforcement system is destroyed without any evidence, even for the crimes revealed."
Lucenko is seen as a close ally of President Petro Poroshenko.
He was appointed Prosecutor General on 12 May 2016 after prolonged attempts to remove from office his predecessor, Viktor Shokin, who is suspected of concealing corruption among top officials and politicians.
Minister of Energy <0xC5><0xBD>. Vai<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC5><0xAB>nas meets with representatives of Orlen Lietuva
As advised by Aurelija Vernickaitė, advisor to the Minister of Energy, the meeting will focus on the achievement of renewable energy targets in the transport sector by 2020 and beyond.
According to the European Commission (EC), transport is the only sector that currently does not achieve the cumulative trajectories set out in the National Renewable Energy Action Plans at EU level - in 2015 the share of renewable energy in it amounted to 6%.
Progress towards the binding 10% target in the transport sector has been slow, according to the EC, due to a number of challenges, including relatively high greenhouse gas reduction costs and regulatory uncertainty.
Renewable energy in this sector comes mainly from biofuels (88%), with electricity playing a smaller role at this stage.
The Seimas has taken up a proposal to supplement the Conservatives’ appeal to the Constitutional Court with the issues of corruption investigation
On Tuesday, after the presentation, the Seimas approved the proposal, which was registered by the "Farmer" Agnė <0xC5><0xA0>irinskienė, who heads the investigation into illegal influence on political processes.
There were 58 MPs in favour, 27 against, and nine abstained.
The Seimas committees will then consider the draft, and the Committee on Legal Affairs, headed by A. <0xC5><0xA0>irinskienė, will be appointed as the main committee.
Upon receipt of his conclusion, a vote will be taken on the adoption of the resolution.
The Seimas ad hoc investigation commission, which is currently conducting a new investigation into political corruption, has been instructed to investigate a possible illegal influence in 2008-2016.
A. <0xC5><0xA0>irinskienė proposed to extend this term, stating that "significant information about possible illegal influence and influence on political processes and state institutions has appeared in the public space."
A. <0xC5><0xA0>irinskienė in the draft defines "possible representation of the interests of pension funds in the legislative process or when applying to the Constitutional Court or attempts to influence the decision-making processes of such significant independent institutions as the Chief Official Ethics Commission".
The appeal to the Constitutional Court on pensions was initiated by the opposition conservatives.
The ruling "Farmers" found that the Conservatives relied to a large extent on the arguments of lawyers of private pension funds in their address.
The heads of the "Farmers" blame former comrade Povilas Urb<0xC5><0xA1>ys for the impact on the Chief Official Ethics Commission.
According to them, the former chairman of the Seimas Committee on State Administration and Local Authorities could have instructed the members of the Seimas to dismiss the former head of the Commission's Prevention Division Mindaugas Siauras from office.
At the end of September, the Seimas formed a commission to investigate the possible illegal influence of the interested persons or their groups, their influence on the course of elections, the formation of coalitions, the work of parliamentary groups, individual politicians, the activities and funding of parties and public movements, legislative processes, the election and appointment of members of state-owned enterprises, heads of public institutions, management or supervisory bodies.
It is also proposed to find out what information law enforcement and intelligence institutions provided to competent authorities and how they reacted to it.
The investigators are expected to present their findings by May 1 next year.
At that time, there will be an election campaign for the President, for the European Parliament.
Of the 12 members of the Commission, seven are representatives of the "Farmers".
Its members are also two social workers, one "orderman" each, a liberal and a representative of the Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania-Christian Families Union.
The Conservatives and Social Democrats refused to take part in the commission's work.
The new investigation was initiated by Ram<0xC5><0xAB>nas Karbauskis, chairman of the ruling Lithuanian Peasant and Greens Union.
According to him, the investigation by the National Security and Defence Committee (NSGK) conducted during the previous session, essentially on the same issues, showed the need to continue the investigation.
Germany's domestic intelligence chief loses his job
Maassen, 55, fuelled the controversy by saying his troubles were the fault of "radical left-wing forces" in Merkel's coalition.
As a result, he was not transferred to another post, as promised earlier, but was forced to retire to the reserve.
Among other things, it emerged over the weekend that Maassen had criticised Merkel's "naive" immigration policy at a meeting of representatives of European domestic intelligence organizations in Warsaw a few weeks ago.
German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, who has long defended the intelligence chief, said at a news conference on Monday that Maassen's comments were unacceptable and "disappointed personally".
Seehofer, himself under pressure both from the dispute and from his own party's poor performance in Bavarian local elections, asked President Frank-Walter Steinmeier to release Maassen for reserving.
A series of shark attacks have spooked the entire island, killing a third person.
The Queensland Ambulance Service said in a statement that the victim suffered "serious injuries to his leg and wrist" in the attack near Whitsun Island, off the coast of Queensland state.
The man was taken to hospital by helicopter.
Pentecost Island is the largest of the archipelago's objects of the same name, attracting many lovers of diving and sailing from all over the world.
Shark attacks in the region have been relatively rare so far.
On September 19, a woman was attacked in Sid Harbour, and the next day a 12-year-old tourist was attacked in the same bay.
The last shark attack on the archipelago occurred in 2010.
CEC has two new members - Visconta and Puksa
A. Puksas was proposed to the members of the CEC by the Lithuanian Lawyers’ Association.
He will replace Svajonė <0xC5><0xA0>altauskienė delegated by the Law Society.
Lawyer E. Viskontas was proposed to the members of the Central Electoral Commission, taking into account the provision of the Order and Justice party.
This party does not have its own representative in the CEC when Donatas Laurinavi<0xC4><0x8D>ius withdrew from it.
In a secret ballot, Puks' candidacy was supported by 74 MPs, five were against, and six abstained.

Plump girls break stereotypes about wedding dresses
A voluptuous girl with a white blown bride's dress - a mission (not) possible?
Can a white swan floating towards the altar be larger than the S or M size and still look attractive?
The participants of the plus-sized reality show "Evolution of size (r)" will already prove today that the beauty and elegance of the bride really does not depend on the woman's kilograms.
But that's not all - one of the girls of the project will shed tears of happiness tonight - her boyfriend will appear on the set.
“There are still people who think that bigger girls don’t get the attention or the attention of guys.
It's just a myth - my boyfriend himself is an athlete, but he likes me as I am, he does not require a figure of any standard from me," - before the appearance with the wedding dress will speak the participant of the show Aurika.
Wedding dress is not easy, in every sense, the garment - it's a complex construction, it has a lot of material, the dress is heavy, uncomfortable for movement.
Also, some women think that a bigger girl in a white dress will look even bigger and therefore less confident.
I can reassure you that a properly selected model of a dress really solves this "problem", - explained one of the jury members of the show, fashion designer Robertas Kalinkinas.
The fates of the girls in the project are decided by R. Kalinkinas together with the entire commission - Erika Vitulskiene, who has opened a plus-size fashion house, photographer and social media star Nagliu Bierancu and TV producer Laura Pauk<0xC5><0xA1>te.
"When deciding which girl to say goodbye to the show, there are many quarrels between the members of the commission - after all, we all represent different spheres and have a different idea of the winner of the show.
The task of demonstrating the wedding dresses was made even more difficult by the fact - now I can reveal - that two newcomers appeared, which were certainly not inferior to the old ones.
It was a very special evening in every sense," Kalinkin said.
The newcomers – Ieva, who became famous for her scandalous behaviour in one of the summer reality shows, and Dovilė, a 31-year-old mother of two, who is of exceptional beauty – like other girls, participated in the selection of “Size (r) evolution” and made it to the top 20.
Unfortunately, after the first very open photo session in the streets of Vilnius, the girls had to say goodbye to the project.
The girls were returned to the show by the viewers of LNK, who voted for their favorites on the television portal.
Having gained international recognition, the reality show of plump beauties in Lithuania is taking place for the second week - here plus-size girls compete for the name of the country's first plus-size star.
There are only eight of them left, and they all know that there can only be one winner.
The intriguing and unpredictable week of the reality show "Size (r) Evolution" begins this Monday evening at 8:30 p.m. through LNK.
Elba named the sexiest man in the world
The US magazine People has named this year’s sexiest man in the world.
He is the 46-year-old British actor Idris Elba.
Although the man claims that the news was unexpected, he was not lacking in wit when he spoke about the new title.
I thought, "It can't be!
Really?”
Then I looked myself in the mirror and thought — yes, I look sexy today — the actors shared with laughter.
Speaking frankly, Idriss said that this title was a very pleasant feeling that touched his ego.
The British star claims to have often received insulting words and bullying, which made his childhood difficult because, as he puts it, he was "very tall and clumsy".
The young actor did not please his peers and became an object of bullying due to his rare and unusual name and his African origin.
“As soon as I grew my mustache and muscles, I became the coolest guy in my city district,” Idriss smiles.
When a man loses his pride on these screens, Elba works as a DJ at parties in Spain and especially in the bustling Ibiza.
In his spare time, the man enjoys Thai boxing and has a vein of fashion, which he realizes by creating his own clothing line.
The British actor says his family is the most important thing in the world, so he is planning a wedding with his fiancée Sabrina Dhowre.
Elba has been named the 33rd sexiest man in the world by People magazine.
In 2017, the title was won by Blake Shelton.
Man killed in drunken attack in <0xC5><0xA0>irvintos district
On Monday evening, a man was beaten to death while drinking in <0xC5><0xA0>alki<0xC5><0xA1>kės village in <0xC5><0xA0>irvintos district.
According to the Vilnius County Police, at 9:16 p.m., a report was received that a man had beaten a neighbor while drinking.
Doctors have confirmed the death of a man born in 1943.
The suspect, who was born in 1994, was arrested and charged with 2.53 cases of drunkenness.
Police are investigating the circumstances of the incident.
Managers no longer demand 20 km distance to build waste incinerators
Vilnius CHP plant is under construction near Gari<0xC5><0xAB>nai Market.
Managers no longer seek to maintain a distance of 20 kilometres from settlements when building incinerators.
K<0xC4><0x99>stutis Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eika, the head of the Environmental Protection Committee, on Monday registered an amendment to the Law on Waste Management in the Seimas, which waives such a requirement.
According to Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eika, the "Farmer's" group, which had previously supported the provision on the distance of 20 km, promises to support the amendment on its refusal.
Mr. Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eika's amendment provides that from January 2019 waste incinerators could be built according to the statutory environmental and public health protection requirements.
He admits that the amendments were prompted by the president's doubts about such a ban.
"Given the definition of the residential area, it is clear that such a place, where the above-mentioned objects could be built, would be almost impossible to find," the committee chairman said.
In October, the ruling majority opposed amendments to the president's veto, which tightened the construction of waste incinerators.
In addition to the ban on the construction of waste incinerators less than 20 km from settlements, the amendments provided for permission for the government to make decisions on the future of the two power plants already under construction, taking into account public health interests.
Mr. Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eika does not propose to amend the latter.
The power plant, which is powered by waste and biofuels, is being built in Vilnius by the energy group Lietuvos Energija and in Kaunas together with Fortum Heat Lietuva, a company of the Finnish energy concern Fortum.
The latter is already burning waste in Klaipėda.
A possible compromise in the Brexit negotiations
LONDON (Reuters) - British and Irish leaders on Monday discussed a possible compromise on the thorny issue of Northern Ireland, which has stalled Brexit negotiations, Dublin said.
In a phone call, British Prime Minister Theresa May offered an opportunity to review the so-called backstop mechanism, which would allow leaving open the border between the British province of Northern Ireland and the European Union's Irish Republic.
Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has promised to consider the proposal but ruled out any unilateral withdrawal by Britain, the Irish government said in a statement.
In the conversation, May "raised the possibility of reviewing the backstop mechanism," it said.
"Varadkar has indicated that he is open to reviewing new proposals, provided that the result of such review is not linked to a unilateral decision to terminate the restrictive measures," the government said in a statement.
Brexit negotiators have not found an acceptable solution to avoid checks at the UK-Irish land border when Britain leaves the single market and customs union next March.
Both sides agree on “backstops” to keep the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland open until a wider trade agreement is signed to ensure that additional customs checks at the border are not carried out.
The EU wants Northern Ireland to continue to comply with EU customs rules, but London wants them to apply temporarily to the whole of the UK.
The Daily Telegraph reported Monday that Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab wants Britain to be able to withdraw from the backstop unilaterally in three months.
But Varadkar told reporters in Dublin that his government "cannot support it".
"The three-month or limited-term backstops are not worth the paper they will be written on," he said.
London and Brussels have not confirmed details of a breakthrough in Brexit talks after a weekend of talks in Britain that a deal was within reach.
"I would say we are making further progress in the negotiations, but there is still work to be done," May's spokesman in London said.
European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas also told reporters: 'We are not there yet'.
Nobel Prize winners call for access to reliable information
A group of leading thinkers, including Nobel laureates, issued a declaration on Monday calling for the right to access reliable information in the age of the internet.
The 25 signatories of the International Declaration on Information and Democracy include economists Amartya Sen and Joseph Stiglitz, Nobel Peace Prize-winning Iranian lawyer and human rights activist Shirin Ebadi, and Nobel Prize-winning writer Mario Vargas Llosa.
“We call on leaders of good will on all continents to take action to strengthen democratic models and open public debate in which citizens can make fact-based decisions,” the group said in a statement.
They argue that the “global information and communication space” is a common good that “must be protected in order to enhance freedom of expression and opinion.”
“People have a fundamental right to information that is freely collected, processed, and disseminated, based on the principles of commitment to truth, pluralism of views, and rational methods of establishing facts.”
The document asks for help from world leaders, including US President Donald Trump, who has often criticised "fake news" but is regularly accused of distorting the facts.
World leaders are expected to take a stance on the issue when they gather for a "Peace Forum" in Paris on November 11-13, signatories said.
The declaration came within two months, under the leadership of Ebadi and Christophe Deloire, head of Paris-based Reporters Without Borders (RSF), a media freedom and journalist rights group.
Other signatories include former Senegalese President Abdou Diouf, Chinese lawyer and human rights activist Teng Biao and political scientist Francis Fukuyama.
Seimas approves higher fines for harmful products
The Seimas approved amendments to the Law on Product Safety, which stipulate that fines for product safety violations should be increased.
The amendments were unanimously approved in the Chamber.
As Antanas Vinkus, a member of the Seimas Committee on Health Affairs, said when talking about the new project, it is to be welcomed that the goals set are related to better protection of consumers of products.
In addition, its provisions are adapted to the requirements of the Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
"In my opinion, the proposed draft law better and more specifically distributes all the actors involved in the supply and distribution process: manufacturers, service providers, importers, distributors and others.
As practice shows, the current system of fines does not always prevent further violations, because the subjects who paid the fines continue to commit repeated violations," A. Vinkus said.
The draft was prepared by the Ministry of Economy, and after the approval of the Government, the Seimas Economic Committee supplemented it with its proposals.
The amendments to the law aim to increase fines for infringements, strengthen the protection of consumer rights, empower market surveillance authorities and establish a clear framework for monitoring product safety requirements and compliance with them.
According to the Ministry of Economy, currently there is no obligation for manufacturers to properly label a product and thus ensure its traceability.
Moreover, according to the Ministry, the market surveillance authorities’ state control of product safety does not grant access to the territory of producers and suppliers, buildings, premises and inspections, which complicates the work of the authorities.
According to the Ministry, the six-month time limit for imposing fines and warnings is too short to establish the infringement, to investigate and to impose a fine.
Also, according to the Ministry, the penalties imposed are not effective enough.
Companies often repeatedly violate the requirements of the law - in 2017 alone, 14 companies did this.
The Ministry of Economy proposed to introduce an obligation for manufacturers to properly label a product in order to ensure its traceability, in order to make it easier for market surveillance authorities to identify suppliers of non-compliant products.
It is also proposed to grant market surveillance authorities the right to enter the territory, buildings, premises and carry out inspections of economic entities that manufacture, supply products to the market, when performing state control of product safety.
There are plans to increase the fines for violations of the law.
A manufacturer, importer or authorised representative who has placed dangerous products on the market and a distributor who has supplied them to the market, a service provider who has provided or is providing dangerous services would be subject to a fine from EUR 150 to EUR 2500 (currently from EUR 144 to 1 448).
Should the State Consumer Rights Protection Authority (CRPA) or another market surveillance authority decide to prohibit the placing on the market and placing on the market of dangerous products or the provision of dangerous services, a fine of between EUR 1 000 and EUR 5 000 (currently from 868 to 4 344) would be imposed.
Failure to comply with the obligation to withdraw dangerous products from the market, recall them from consumers and destroy them would result in a fine of between €2,500 and €6,500 (currently 1,448 and 5,792).
If dangerous products caused harm to the health of the consumer, a fine of between €2,500 and €15,000 (currently 1,448 and 1,1584) would be imposed.
If dangerous products caused the death of a consumer, a fine of between €6,500 and €25,000 (currently €5,792 and €23,169) would be imposed.
According to the ministry, a fine of up to 25,000 euros is imposed in Poland and Austria for violation of product safety legislation (the minimum amount of the fine is not specified), in Belgium - from 26 to 600,000 euros, in Romania - from 155 euros to 6,666 euros, in Bulgaria - from 125 euros to 7,500 euros.
10-year-old girl has been raped by family member
The incident in Colombia has shocked millions of people.
A 10-year-old girl raped by her older brother gave birth to a healthy boy.
The baby has seen the world thanks to a caesarean section, but both the girl and her baby are doing well.
They were monitored by doctors for a while.
There is still some time before the young mother and the baby are released home.
"Based on the information I received from the police, the little girl became pregnant after being sexually abused by a family member, a brother," the director of the hospital where the birth was accepted told foreign television.
Police are investigating the incident of rape and child abuse.
The Norwegian Armed Forces took part in NATO exercises in the most remote and harsh areas
Troops from the Norwegian Armed Forces took part in a series of complex exercises in the mountains north of the capital Oslo.
It is part of NATO's Trident Juncture 2018 exercise, NATO's largest exercise since the end of the Cold War.
Most soldiers from Norway’s second battalion have spent a lot of time away from home since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, in places like Afghanistan — that is, in warm lands.
But they are the most proficient at war in the Arctic, and these skills are especially useful now that NATO is changing its focus.
In recent days, soldiers in the mountains east of Tinset, often in the most remote and harsh areas, have taken part in staged battles against real British troops.
Soldiers have the skills to survive in the cold in the wild, but in the harsh climate they have to carry a much greater weight on their shoulders - one backpack weighs about 50 kg.
Troops in the command post say they share their skills to survive and fight in such conditions with other NATO troops.
According to the troops, these exercises, which like no other are particularly reminiscent of real warfare, will teach them to be ready in the event of a serious threat.

However, the hosts retained the lead and did not allow Fulham to take the draw.
The only winning goal in the 29th minute was scored by Tom Fosu-Mensah.
It is worth noting that this was the first goal for Huddersfield Town at home this season.

Retired Deputy Mayor Doesn't Plan to Return to Politics
Former Kaunas vice-mayor Povilas Ma<0xC4><0x8D>iulis, who has left his job in the municipality and the United Kaunas organization to support Vygaudas U<0xC5><0xA1>ackas in the presidential elections, does not plan to return to politics and promises to focus on business.
“I’m going to focus on business.
I am a shareholder of several companies and I have ideas for new projects.
And most importantly, I will be able to enjoy the opportunity to spend more time with my family," Ma<0xC4><0x8D>iulis told BNS.
He also said he does not plan to participate in the next municipal elections.
Ma<0xC4><0x8D>iulis has not yet had the opportunity to speak with U<0xC5><0xA1>ackas after he lost the initial elections of the Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats to Ingrida <0xC5><0xA0>imonytė on Sunday.
“To be honest, we haven’t had time to discuss the results with him and the team in detail and talk about our future plans.
It is obvious that after Vygaudas withdrew from the further election campaign, this stage of my life is over," Ma<0xC4><0x8D>iulis said.
He said he did not regret the decision to leave Kaunas' policy on supporting U<0xC5><0xA1>ackas, but regretted that "Lithuania has lost a unique opportunity to have a true leader in the context of international relations."
Ma<0xC4><0x8D>iulis briefly served as deputy mayor of Kaunas in 2011, and later returned to this position after the successful election of "United for Kaunas" in 2015.
He is a shareholder of the private school "Erudite Lyceum" and several other companies.
Workers are working in Kaunas Castle: what are they doing here?
The residents of Kaunas, upon noticing the workers working in Kaunas Castle, hoped that the reconstruction of the remaining tower was finally under way.
Gabrielius Su<0xC5><0xBE>iedėlis, the director of Kaunas City Museum, told the website that the southwestern tower with a fragment of the defensive wall was undergoing replacement work.
According to the interlocutor, the canopies will be cans.
"A worn-out tin coating in an emergency condition posed a danger to those around it - people could fall and get injured - so it had to be replaced.
The roofs were no longer resistant to moisture, so it was detrimental to the heritage as well," the museum director said.
Will these roofs be similar to those that existed a few centuries ago?
"All works are coordinated with heritage and other institutions," G. <0xC5><0xBD>u<0xC5><0xBE>ėdėlis added that the result would be as authentic as possible, but at the same time, the practical side is also important - roofs must protect valuables from moisture.
When working with heritage, a universal solution is chosen.
Before that, the elements of Kaunas Castle were covered with tin back in the Soviet times, so they no longer had historical value," the director of Kaunas City Museum explained in detail.
The contract was signed on October 2.
It is expected that the works will not take more than three months from the signing of the contract.
"It is expected to be completed by the end of November," the director of the museum said.
According to him, the value of the works carried out amounts to almost 24 thousand euros.
This amount, according to the interlocutor, was provided for in this year's budget.
Works in Kaunas Castle are carried out by the company "Statija".
Kaunas. diena.lt has written how, according to the research carried out, Kaunas Castle might have looked earlier.
U.S. and South Korea resume naval exercises
Naval exercises with about 500 troops will now take place in the southern city of Pohang for two weeks, Seoul's defence ministry said.
There are 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea.
The two countries have been holding joint military maneuvers for years, which Pyongyang has described as a "provocation" and an "invasion readiness".
On Friday, North Korea threatened to resume its nuclear program unless Washington lifted economic sanctions against Pyongyang.
Such a change of course could be "seriously debated", the North's foreign ministry said.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a television interview that punitive measures will remain in place until Pyongyang gives up its nuclear weapons.
He also announced that he would meet North Korean envoy Kim Yong Chol in New York this week.

Maxima Bulgaria CEO Edvinas Volkas told the business publication Capital that the company will open two more stores by the end of this year and will have a total of 74 stores in the country.
According to E. Volkas, another 7-10 stores are planned to be opened in Bulgaria next year.

It has a 24-hour "social zone" - you can use the Internet for free, charge your smartphone, buy sandwiches, salads and other dishes.
According to Volkas, 2018 will be the first year that the company will end with a positive EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization).
Mr. Volkas forecasts that Maxima Bulgaria’s revenue this year will grow by 40%, to EUR 158.5 million.
Last year, the company received EUR 113.3 million in revenue.
Maxima Grupė has been operating in Bulgaria since 2005.
Last year, the company for the first time ranked among the country’s 10 largest retail chains.
Maxima Grupė, managed by the group controlled by Nerijus Numavi<0xC4><0x8D>ius, intends to invest around 200 million euros this year and next year, the most of which is in Poland, where Maxima has acquired the retail chain Stokrotka.
The group owns retail chains Maxima and an online grocery store Barbora in the Baltic States, and Stokrotka and Aldik in Poland.
In 2017, Maxima Grupė earned EUR 2.806 billion in consolidated revenue - 4.2% more than in 2016, its net profit increased 2.1 times to EUR 75 million.
Eastern Europe Studies Centre will cooperate with two prominent US 'brain centres'
According to Linas Kojala, the head of the EESC, who is based in Vilnius and is already counting his thirteenth year of activity, the US will allow us to implement projects and make Lithuania's voice more audible on the other side of the Atlantic.
“We have been working hard on this for several months.
I am glad that two large institutions see us as partners and are looking for opportunities for joint activities.
I have no doubt that there will be niches for activities, because the topics of NATO, security, disinformation and development of the Eastern Partnership countries that we are analysing are also priorities for them," Kojala said.
The agreements state that the EESC and the US institutions will work together to prepare applications for international projects, exchange expertise and knowledge, and organise expert visits.
This should be especially useful for Lithuanian analysts, as both partners have an excellent international reputation.
The FSA has been in operation since 1955 and brings together nearly a hundred top analysts.
In the latest global ranking of analytical centers compiled by the University of Pennsylvania, the FSA ranked seventh in its category.
Meanwhile, CEPA, whose analysts have repeatedly been invited to consult and work in the top US political institutions, is in the top ten in its category.
"This will provide more opportunities for Lithuanian analysts working in various institutions to break into the US information space and encourage us to raise the quality bar," Kojala added.
One of the first practical steps should be the distribution of the EESC analytical publication "Lithuanian Foreign Policy Review" by US decision-makers and in the public space.
The Eastern Europe Studies Centre operates on the basis of implemented projects and is not supported by targeted grants.
EESC partners with which joint initiatives are being implemented include the European Commission, NATO, USAID, various international funds, etc.
Two buildings collapsed in Marseille
Two people were slightly injured when two buildings collapsed in the southern French city of Marseille on Monday, the fire service said.
When the buildings collapsed, the debris was seen on the street, and clouds of dust rose.
Dozens of firefighters worked at the scene near the famous old port of Marseille, some with trained dogs.
The local prefecture posted pictures on Twitter showing a heap of debris and wooden beams, a huge gap where buildings stood, firefighters at the scene and cars covered in thick dust.
Officials said they were looking for people who may have been trapped in the rubble.
Marseille firefighters said on Twitter that two people were being treated for minor injuries.
The amateur video, broadcast on BFM-TV, showed clouds of dust on the street and passers-by covering their mouths with their sleeves.
Google Street View photos taken before the incident showed that one of the collapsed buildings was five storeys high and the other six storeys high.
One of these buildings was clearly in poor condition, with hammered windows, with large cracks in the facade.
Sabine Bernasconi, the mayor of the Marseille district, said one of the buildings was in poor condition and had been ordered to evacuate.
However, the mayor could not rule out the possibility that the building might have been used by people who had settled there arbitrarily.
The prefecture of the region urged people to avoid the area and clear the way for rescue services.
Sabine Bernascon, the mayor of the Marseille district, said the building was in poor condition and had been ordered to evacuate.

Mexican Restaurant Helps Migrants Deported from the U.S.
The farther away, the more Mexicans are deported back, and they struggle to adapt when they return.
“When they deported me, they took everything: my house, my car, my clothes.
They took away everything except one thing — my knowledge,” says Victor Hugo Hernandez, restaurant director.
The restaurant’s board hopes that merging Mexican and U.S. cultures will promote a better understanding of each other.
Afghan special forces officer kills American instructor during training
North Ogden 39-year-old mayor Brent Taylor, north of Salt Lake City, was on a year-long vacation to carry out a mission in Afghanistan.
He was a military intelligence officer at the Joint Force Command, but was due to return to serve as mayor in January.
Another U.S. soldier, whose name has not yet been released, was wounded in the attack that killed Taylor on Saturday.
Authorities said Taylor died from infantry fire.
Major General Jefferson S. Burton, commander of the Utah National Guard, told reporters that Taylor helped train and strengthen the Afghan National Army's capabilities.
Utah media quoted NATO as saying that Taylor had been shot dead by one of the trained special forces and that the attacker had been killed by Afghan forces.
Taylor had a wife and seven children.
His body will be flown to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware on Monday.
He had previously carried out two missions in Iraq, and this was also his second mission in Afghanistan.
Before leaving for Afghanistan in January, Taylor told local media that he had been assigned to a team of advisers and instructors from a special forces battalion in Afghanistan.
Hundreds of residents of North Ogden gathered on the streets of the city of about 17,000 to see off their mayor, who was escorted by police along with his family.
Taylor became mayor of the city in 2013.
