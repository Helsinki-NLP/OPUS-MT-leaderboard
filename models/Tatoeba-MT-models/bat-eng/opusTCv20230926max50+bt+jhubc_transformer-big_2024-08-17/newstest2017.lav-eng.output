28-year-old cook found dead in San Francisco supermarket
This week, a 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in a stairwell of a supermarket.
But the victim's brother says he can't think of anyone who would want to hurt his brother, stating, "His life finally began to improve."
The body, found outside a supermarket in Westfield on Wednesday, was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, a spokesman for the San Francisco Bureau of Forensic Medicine said.
San Francisco police said his death had been confirmed as a murder and an investigation was under way.
The victim's brother, Luis Galicia, tells San Francisco's ABC KGO station that Frank had previously worked as a chef in Boston, but that six months earlier he had his dream job at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco.
A representative of the restaurant Sons & Daughters reports that the news of his death shocked and shocked them.
"We are a small team working as a united family and we will miss him very much," he said.
At this difficult time, we are thinking with Frank's friends and family.
Luis Galicia says that at first Frank stayed overnight in hostels, but recently life has finally improved.
"He moved into a new apartment and met a girl," Louis tells KGO radio station.
Luis Galicia claims that he does not know who would want to harm his younger brother.
He was a good man with a big heart.
"He always pampered his family by cooking a delicious meal and cooking lunch", said Luis Galicia
He never wanted to get into a fight.
He was the brother who adapted to the others.
"In the face of all that went wrong in the world, he was like a rough diamond that shined brightly every day," he says.
Everyone who has information about the event is invited to call the SFPD Information line 415-575-4444.
New Doctors Strike: Call for New Protests
Representatives of the new doctors are asking their trade union to start protests in a dispute over the new contract.
The Committee of Young Physicians (JAK) of the British Medical Association (LMA) is preparing to request advice to support wider protests in early September.
The JAK is of the opinion that the ministers have not managed to dispel doubts about the Treaty.
In July, young doctors and medical students rejected the contract offered by the AAL.
58% of all Members who voted voted against the Treaty.
In a message posted on Twitter on Thursday evening, JAK board member Ellen McCorth said the government remained silent on the issue and therefore the contract offer was rejected.
She said: "In view of this, as a result of the JAK's vote, the contract proposal has been rejected in its entirety and it has been decided to request new formal negotiations to discuss the most important issues."
In response to the government's silence, the JAK today officially requested a meeting with the AAL Council to authorise the development of new contracts, which would enter into force in September.
As a result of the dispute, the young doctors have taken part in six strikes, including the first time in NHS history that they have stopped working.
After the vote, which rejected the terms of the contract proposed by the AAL and recommended by the BMA, Dr. Johans Malawana, the representative of the new doctors of the AAL, resigned.
Before meeting with 54,000 new doctors and medical students, he had told BMA members that the offer is good and will be accepted.
After the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt informed that the contract would be concluded with English medics.
Russia and Turkey: Alliance of Distraction?
A gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce the end of an eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But as Vladimir Putin greeted the Turkish leader at the St. Petersburg Palace, it seemed that Ankara needed this partnership more.
However, they both shook hands.
Vladimir Putin's smile looked pretentious and did not cause warm emotions, even taking into account his usual abstinence.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan at least five times called Putin a "my dear friend," according to a review of the meeting.
I've lost count.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only improve to pre-crisis levels, but would become even stronger.
The next day, a newspaper reported that Erdogan had behaved as if nothing had happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm evokes conflicting feelings.
However, the radiant coolness of Putin shows that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
The first thing he mentioned in his address was the shooting down of a Russian plane on the Syrian border.
At the time, Moscow reacted sharply.
Putin accused Ankara of stabbing a dagger into Moscow's back.
The incident was even more painful, given that it came from a friend’s side.
It will be very difficult, if not impossible, to restore true trust.
Since November, Russia’s public attitude has changed.
For several months, government-controlled television circulated aggressive accusations against Ankara.
Suddenly the Turks seemed to be to blame.
The most serious accusations were that Erdogan’s own family profited from the illegal oil trade with the Islamic State-controlled part of Syria.
He denied it, of course.
But the main message of the St. Petersburg meeting is that it is time to forget the past.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received an apology from President Erdogan.
Russia could see this as a kind of victory.
The benefits of reconciliation for Ankara are obvious.
First of all, Erdogan needs all possible friends after the failed coup last month in which he was tried to be overthrown.
His position has also been shaken by numerous terrorist attacks.
There are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have caused serious damage, in particular a charter ban, which usually provides an influx of several million Russian tourists to Turkish resorts every year.
The number of tourists decreased by almost 90%.
Russia’s tour operators and charter companies will also be relieved when regular flights are resumed.
They are hoping for a vacation fever in the Mediterranean at the end of the season.
Already this week, the national TV is predicting a drop in the price of fruit and vegetables, as Turkish fruit and vegetable imports will resume.
As quoted by the local newspaper Vedemosti: "Tourists for them, tomatoes for us."
However, the visit also had other political motives from Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West for what they see as a weak response to the coup attempt.
One can also look at the frustration with the protracted negotiations on EU accession and Putin's interference, who is keen to take advantage of Turkey's estrangement from the West.
The Russian leader unquestionably scored extra points in Ankara's eyes, expressing support for its elected government after the coup attempt.
Keep in mind that Moscow understands this well, because it itself has a deep-rooted fear of regime change in the country.
The summit, which took place in this luxurious seaside palace, gave Russia and Turkey the opportunity to present, as it was called by an analyst, the "alien alliance", two countries that feel alienated from the West join forces.
However, despite the publicly demonstrated unity, there are still significant differences of opinion between the two countries.
The main disagreements concern Syria, where Russia presents itself as a peacemaker, but in fact Russia and Turkey support the opposing sides.
After more than three hours of initial talks, the two presidents said at a press conference that they had not discussed the issue.
The President of Turkey purposefully avoided questions about disagreements between the two countries, while President Putin wanted to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus on how the two countries could find a common language on Syria.
However, after months of open hostility and a potential catastrophe when NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian combat aircraft, the situation has improved, as the two leaders have at least resumed talks.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland
The SKB brand will play a supporting role in the future, the bank’s CEO has announced.
The SKB will no longer be available outside Scotland.
Ross Makewan tells BBC Channel Scotland that the SKB brand was associated with the bank’s global ambitions.
It has given up on this ambition because eight years ago the bank almost went bankrupt and needed financial assistance.
Meanwhile, branding strategy experts have used the SKB brand to protect other consumer finance brands.
The bank received millions of pounds from international sports sponsors, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon tennis champion Andy Murray.
However, it has now been decided to put other national brands to the forefront.
The Royal Scottish Banque will be available to Scottish customers, but will not be initialised.
In England and Wales, all references to SKB, outside of the head office and official listing, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
Smaller private finance brands such as Coutts, Adam & Co., Drummond, and Holt’s Military Bank will also be noticed.
Makewan was interviewed during a cruise with clients and employees on Invernessshire.
He told the BBC Scotland channel: “SKB will become our investor brand and our employees are working on it because we are now becoming more of a brand bank.”
In time, the bank itself became a global brand and SKB became a global brand.
Now I say that we no longer have global ambitions, we have local ambitions.
Each of these brands will represent something unique in their industry and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
SKB has already announced that it will not continue sponsoring Six Nations and will involve various brands in sports sponsorship.
“It’s time to become a brand bank, because we’ve been asking ourselves for a long time how to become a better bank for our customers,” says the CEO.
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical for us to announce that we would become a great bank for our customers and develop these brands.
But thanks to hard work and a focus on customer needs rather than our own, we have obviously made a big difference.
We can bring these brands back to life, so I think now is the time.
Frankie Detori wins 3000th place in Newmarket with horse Predilection
Detors uncorked champagne, winning their 3000th win, finishing twice in the first race in Newmarket.
On Friday, Jockey Frankie Detori won his 3000th victory in British history, taking the first place in the Newmarket.
He achieved this by winning a second victory in the race, which took place in his hometown, riding the Predilection trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to achieve such a result in a horse sprint race.
He has joined Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Pigott, Pete Eddy and Willy Carson.
Three-time champion jockey Detori, who previously won with the horse Ghayyar, said, "It's something special."
I'm very moved because my family is here.
I am very happy that it happened in Newmarket, because I have been living here for 30 years.
This is not a big race, this is not Royal Ascot, but an ordinary Friday evening with 20,000 people.
I feel relieved and very grateful.
After the victory, Detori and Predilection are greeted with applause and cheers.
Two jockeys have set this record in a race with obstacles - champion Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who has set several records in his career, winning more than 4,300 victories.
Lester Pigott, a nine-time derby winner, has won 4,493 wins in his career.
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of our time, and it comes as no surprise that he has achieved success that few people can achieve.
He is stylish and strong, but his sense of tact distinguishes him from other jockeys.
He is a fantastic representative of racing, his enthusiasm and charisma for years attract fans of this sport.
A few weeks ago at the Epsom race, I told Frankie that he would have won 6,000 victories if he had not participated in the weekend and the big race.
But, seriously, it is a real pleasure that Frankie has been winning the UK race regularly for 30 years.
He is cheerful, great for British racing, and a great jockey.
Frank Detori celebrated this achievement with his trademark flying jump.
From finishing at wind speed to a flying jump, Frankie Dettori has been the face of British horse racing for twenty years.
This has been a journey full of adventures.
He has won numerous major races, including the 1996 Great Seven in Ascot, as well as surviving a plane crash and disqualification for the use of preparations.
Three years ago, it was difficult for him to return after six months of disqualification, but he demonstrated the strength of his character by challenging those who doubted him to return to his best form.
And he could take part in the race for a while longer - Detori has previously said that he would like to continue to participate in the race until at least the age of 50.
Russian President Putin dismisses head of administration Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed the head of the administration Sergey Ivanov.
Ivanov for many years was among Putin's closest people.
Today, the 63-year-old politician is appointed Special Representative for Nature and Transport.
The Kremlin said in a statement that Putin "has decided to release Ivanov from the duties of head of the administration of the Russian president," without giving a reason.
In the place of Ivanov appointed Anton Vaino, who was his deputy since 2012.
The 44-year-old Vaino is a former diplomat.
Vaino was born in 1972 in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MVSAI) and later worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
As reported on the Kremlin website (in Russian), he later headed the President's protocol and the administration of government employees.
After his appointment, he told Putin: "Thank you for your trust."
In my opinion, the main task of the administration is to support your work in the office of the President of Latvia by developing laws and controlling the execution of your decisions.
Putin told a Russian broadcaster on Friday that Ivanov himself wanted to leave the post and recommended Blain as his replacement.
Are smiles persuasive?
This move embarrassed Moscow.
Sergey Ivanov is an ancient and close ally of Vladimir Putin and, like Putin, once worked in the Soviet security service in the KGB.
In this position, he was one of the most influential men in Russia.
In a meeting broadcast on state television, the two men announced that Ivanov resigned on his own initiative.
But despite the camera-oriented smiles, few people are convinced by such an explanation, especially before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the result of a power struggle?
No one knows.
But the official statement that the man who was considered to be a possible president suddenly wanted to become the head of Russian environmental policy is met with great scepticism.
In remarks published on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov says to Putin: "It is a fact that at the beginning of 2012 I asked you to entrust me with this difficult position, one might even say problematic position, for four years.
It turns out that I have been in this position for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
Previously, he was Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former KGB member of the State Security Service, as is Putin.
At the end of the 1990s, Putin headed the Federal Security Service, the successor to the KGB, Ivanov took the position of his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov among the five people he trusted the most.
At the end of Putin's second term, Ivanov was considered a potential candidate for the presidency of Russia, since re-election of Putin for a third term would be unconstitutional.
But then another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev, became president.
Putin became prime minister, and three and a half years later returned to the post of president.
The appearance of a mysterious fish in a garden in the city of Banff
A man from Banff asks for help to find out what species of fish appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bane thinks that 75 of the fish might be sand eels that have arrived with a water room.
Mr. Bane, who lives about 500 metres [500 m] from the sea, posted a fish video on the Periscope website, hoping that someone might know how the five-centimetre-large fish ended up in his garden.
Queensferry Crossing: The bridge is now connected to Fife.
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is currently scheduled to be completed in May 2017.
Engineers have connected the northern part of the Queensland Crossing and the viaduct, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
The first of the four connecting parts is completed, which means that the construction of the bridge is nearing completion.
The Fifa Bridge is 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It consists of 10,000 tons of steel, 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 supporting cables.
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is currently scheduled to be completed in May 2017.
The Secretary of Economics, Kate Brown, had arrived at the construction site today and was one of the first to climb the bridge.
He said, "This is a symbolic and historic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Bridge."
In this project, we see an unparalleled engineering solution, where only this part of the construction used more than 30,000 tons of cement and steel.
Despite the enormous weight and size of the bridge, connecting the bridge and the viaduct is an extremely delicate process that requires tremendous precision.
In total, more than 79% of the bridge deck has already been built and the last section that will connect the bridge with Rosita will be laid today, which means that all parts of the bridge are ready for laying.
Michael Martin, Project Director of the Fourth Bridge Connection, says: “The first connection is a very important point in the construction of any bridge.”
In this fantastic project, the first connection demonstrates first-class engineering.
After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the support of the northern tower, it was left for us to connect the northern section of the road with the land part or viaduct.
This was done by shifting the part of the viaduct of the northern entrance 700 millimeters to the south.
It was a huge and at the same time very delicate operation.
Huge, because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6000 tons and had to be pulled at an angle of about 3%.
Delicate, because the tolerance in both directions, with which the team worked, was only a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything went well.
Simone Bailes gets gold in gymnastics for women.
Forget the tension.
Forget about worry.
Simon Bailes doesn't care.
Dynamic jumps.
Do the exercises on the beam without effort.
Unbeatable on the floor.
Perfectly perfect.
And finally, the Olympic champion.
On Thursday, the 19-year-old American gymnast won a gold medal, fully demonstrating the difference between herself and the rest of the world on the Olympic stage.
Her total score of 62,198 was superior to the result of the head trial of the silver medal winner and her teammate Alija Raismane, and the result of the bronze medal winner Russian athlete Alija Mustafina.
On Thursday, U.S. athlete Simone Bailes performed on a beam in the individual combined gymnastic finals for women at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Bailes became the fourth American in a row to win the title of multi-combat champion and the fifth best gymnast, gradually cementing her reputation as the best gymnast of her generation and possibly the best gymnast in history.
When the final result was announced, she burst into tears because the long road to this moment was over.
This achievement places him next to such unbeatable athletes as Michael Phelps, who took his sport to another level.
Baile has dominated her sport for the past three years, winning 15 medals at the world championships, including 10 gold medals, performing such excellent, accurate and ambitious combinations of exercises that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Reton called her "the best gymnast she had ever seen".
In Brazil, she faced her final test, where she had to compete, to a large extent, with the expectations that were placed on her, and not with the rest of the athletes.
She would be disappointed to return to her home in Spring, Texas, without a gold medal.
(a) the information referred to in point (a) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 of this Article shall be made available to the competent authorities of the Member State in which the competent authority of the Member State of origin is situated;
The first gold medal for Bailes was won on Tuesday, making a special farewell party for the national team coordinator Marta Karolji.
Although Bailes claims that she did not expect anything like this on her long journey to fame, it is not true.
Part of her free movement, which includes her special acrobatic transition, is accompanied by Latin music, which would fit perfectly on the street next to the Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl, who was adopted by her grandparents when she was still an infant and who was discovered by the mother of trainer Amy Boerman on a tour to the gym where Boerman’s turrets were held, has now become a force to be reckoned with.
She has not lost in the combined events since the summer of 2013 and the series of victories can continue as long as Bailes wants.
Although Mustafina made a slight lead during the two rotations, it was only an illusion.
Balance beam and free movement - part of the competition, where Bailes will defend his title of champion, is still ahead.
She led with a score of 15,433 on the log and solidified the lead with a score of 15,933 in free moves
Raismane embraced her gently while they waited for the results, which were only a formality, and she burst into tears of joy when the dream that she had once written in her notebook came true.
The result of Raismane was like a little revenge for four years old events, when she shared the third place with Mustafin, but lost the battle for the bronze medal.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of the team, which the Americans call the "grandmother", took a confident lead.
After performing in free motion, which dispelled doubts about her return, she was able to devote herself to the crowd of air kisses.
In the meantime, 19-year-old Bailes’ viral Twitter post r, which she published this week, has a completely different meaning.
Mahai Brown, a 6-year-old boy, survives a shooting in Philadelphia.
Police say the six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, the second six-year-old to be shot in Philadelphia this week.
The child's grandparents confirmed to the CBS Philadelphia news channel that it was Mahai Brown.
Grandparents say that Brown was shot several times, including in the groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but was still conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
His grandmother Delores Melendez tells television: "His little body was just punctured by bullets."
I can't believe it.
The boy is in a critical condition in the hospital and has already undergone several operations.
The family reports that he will definitely recover.
He had to start going to the first grade at a local elementary school.
Brown is one of four people shot in the Germantown area.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-old men and one 32-year-old man.
The CBS Philadelphia channel reports that one of the 29-year-old men is in a critical condition, while the other two are in a stable condition.
The channel said the child was found in the front seat of the car next to the 29-year-old victim in a critical condition.
The other two victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether any of them were attackers.
The investigator told CBS Philadelphia that several shooters were likely involved in the shooting.
In the place of the event, shells of weapon cartridges belonging to different weapons were found.
It appears to have been a long-standing shooting.
On both sides of the pedestrian sidewalk were found shells.
"So it looks like there were several armed shooters who were actively participating in the shooting," said Philadelphia police captain Anthony Ginaldi.
There are also a number of homes and cars affected.
No one has yet been arrested and it is reported that the police are checking the recordings of surveillance cameras.
On Tuesday, a stray bullet hit a 6-year-old girl while she was playing in front of her house in the Westokelin area.
She's slowly recovering, but the police are still looking for the culprit.
Why do we need Simona, Gabija and Lauria?
I call it the Women's Olympic Athletics Team of the Year for a number of reasons.
First of all, I have been to all the Summer Olympics since 1984, and the US team has never been so good.
Secondly, the team consists of three athletes, Simon Bailes, Gabija Douglas and Lauria Hernandez, who are inspired by many young girls of origin.
People can be proud that this team includes Alija Raismane, who is Jewish, and Madison Kotiana, who is a Catholic.
Finally, this team truly represents America.
It has also strengthened the participation of black and Latin American athletes in this sport.
For the past four years, the best gymnast is an African-American.
Last year, Simona and Gabija took 1st and 2nd place.
These are impressive results.
In the previous Olympics, Gabby Douglas surprisingly became an Olympic champion, and America could rejoice.
Now the world has seen incredible exercises performed by three-time world champions Simon Bailes, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, performing unprecedented but masterful exercises.
On Thursday, Simona became the fourth American woman in a row to win a gold medal in the women's singles competition.
Her teammate Alija Raismane won a silver medal.
We have seen the best that this sport can give, but in the rest of the country, the situation during gymnastics is completely different.
Simona, Gabija and Lauria were selected for the Olympic team, as were Alija and Madison.
They are the "Olympic Five", because the next Olympic gymnastics team will consist of only four athletes, and this is the last year of coach Martha Carol's work as a coach.
In fact, gymnastics is an expensive sport. Gymnasts mostly train in private athletics clubs, and they are supported by parents who pay for training, rooms, travel, uniforms, hotels (coaches, athletes and their families) and other expenses.
Most of these athletics clubs are located in urban areas that can afford this sport.
In these clubs, athletes spend all their training, and this is an expensive and long-term investment for the families of athletes.
Amy Boerman - Simona Bailes coach and Maggie Hayney - Laurie Hernandez coached her athletes since both girls started athletics.
We need to provide young girls inspired by Simona, Gabija and Lauria with cheaper gymnastic training options.
I founded my athletics organization 20 years ago.
My organization is located in Harlem and we offer over 15,000 city youth (mainly black and Hispanic) gymnastics trainings for free or at a low price. We have also trained national and international champions.
In September, we will open a branch office in Detroit (my hometown) to provide local youths with the opportunity to explore this great sport.
Athletics develops strength, flexibility and body coordination, as well as teaches hard work, discipline and striving for the goal.
This combination provides a long life with good health and success, both at school and at work.
This team will inspire thousands of young girls to train in athletics and it is fantastic.
It is very important to engage in this sport, especially for young girls.
This is a very exciting time.
Thanks to Simona, Alija, Gabija and Madison for a great "Girl Power" demonstration, winning the gold medals of the Olympic Games and motivating countless young girls of different backgrounds to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
After the rejection of Jeremy Hunt’s offer, the new doctors plan to go on more strikes.
The ministers hoped to end the dispute by reaching an agreement on changes to the contract with representatives of the British Medical Association, but this was rejected by 58 percent of the 37,000 new doctors who took part in the vote.
In July, Hunt announced plans to enter into a contract, stating that the NHS is in an unstable state and further delays will only harm workers and patients.
The first young doctors have already signed a new contract that provides for changes in the conditions for working at night shifts and at weekends to improve working conditions during non-standard working hours.
Yesterday evening, Dr. Elena Makourta, a representative of BMA new doctors, announced that the new doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially that it will deepen the labor crisis and does not provide for equal conditions for all doctors.
There are eight weeks left until the first group of new doctors signs the new contract, so we need to make progress, because there is not much time left.
The BMA's efforts to resolve the problem through negotiations have been met with reluctance on the part of the government to engage, and sometimes with complete silence.
This is despite the fact that Jeremy Hunt said last month that his door was always open.
Jeremy Hunt must take immediate action, stop inaction, and cooperate with the new doctors.
If he does not, then the new doctors are ready for new protest actions.
During the last strike at the end of April, more than 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits were postponed, while nurses and consultants tried to replace the doctors who had gone to the picket.
The ministers hoped to put an end to the dispute by reaching an agreement on changes to the agreement with the representatives of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants to raise the rate for working on weekends for the 54 000 new doctors who would be covered by the new contracts.
NHS Chief Employment Officer Daniel Mortimer urged young doctors not to go on strike.
Mr. Mortimer explains that strikes do not solve anything, but only increase the pressure on busy workers and worry, create stress and impediments for patients, carers and their families.
For the last two months, we have been talking to the new doctors’ committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and other institutions, we have responded positively to their questions about guardians and whistleblowers.
Employers expect active cooperation on other important issues, such as placement, flexible training, additional training for those returning after a career break, training costs, mutual recognition of training programs, drop-out from studies and gender pay inequality in medicine - shows that employers, English health education institutions and the Ministry of Health are serious about implementing the agreements concluded with BME in November, February and May.
A drug of 2 pounds a day can reduce the risk of heart attack.
Thousands of patients who have had a heart attack could be treated with the drug for 2 pounds a day, as official representatives recommend using it for more people and for a longer period of time.
Ticagrelor reduces the risk of recurrent heart attacks in people with heart disease.
The medicine is already prescribed for use 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a heart attack.
NICE, represented by the NHS, recommends using this product 4 years after a heart attack to further reduce the risk of heart attack in people with cardiovascular problems.
However, NICE currently under NHS supervision recommends using this product 4 years after a heart attack to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
Every year, some 140,000 people in England suffer a heart attack, and a quarter of those suffer a second heart attack or stroke.
Heart attack and stroke are caused by the accumulation of fatty substances in the walls of the heart, forming blockages.
If the blockage breaks, it can cause a blood clot, blocking the flow of blood to the heart and causing a heart attack.
In turn, if the clot separates from the blood vessel wall, it can travel further into the bloodstream and block the blood’s access to the brain, causing a heart attack.
People who have had a heart attack are at greater risk of having another heart attack.
Ticagrelor, produced by the UK company AstraZeneca and marketed under the name Brilique, reduces the risk of blood clots forming.
The new NICE Guideline, published today, recommends that people take 90 mg Ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg twice daily for 3 years with aspirin.
Professor Carol Longson, NICE’s director of health technology, explains: “Despite the availability of drugs to prevent a recurrence of heart attack, more than a quarter of people who have had a heart attack experience another heart attack or stroke, often with severe consequences.”
Fear of a repeated heart attack can have a negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
Evidence shows that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of recurrent heart attacks and strokes in people who have had them before.
By preliminary recommending treatment with Ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to expand the treatment options for thousands of people, who are thereby benefiting.
In view of the limited information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor, in particular on the risk of bleeding when used for more than three years, the draft guideline does not recommend its use beyond this period.
Political Correctness Culture Promotes Election Fraud in Muslim Communities
According to a management report, Lutfur Rahman, the former mayor of the city of Tauerhamlet, was dismissed due to corruption.
The government's report reveals that the culture of political correctness is turning a blind eye to large-scale fraud in Muslim communities.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickle criticizes the police, election monitors and city councils for ignoring signs of fraud in the election process because "they are afraid to offend ethnic and religious interests."
The former community secretary, who has now become head of an anti-corruption organisation, says that intimidation of voters for religious reasons is so widespread that the police should be allowed to place guards at polling stations to protect intimidated voters.
He also suggests that voters should present an identity document when they vote to prove their true identity.
Currently, only the name and address should be provided to voters.
He even suggested that the fingers of voters should be marked with a special ink to prevent double voting.
Reporters must also be given more protection, says Sir Eric.
He felt that the press should be given greater access to the Council's documents and to the decisions taken by the informal committees and working groups.
He says: “The goal is not only to prevent electoral fraud, but also to protect the local government from a broader culture of corruption and fraud that goes hand in hand with it.”
The report was commissioned by Downing Street following the scandal surrounding the Tauerhamlet city elections.
Last year, a special election court decided to remove Mayor Lutfur Rahman from the mayor’s office due to corrupt and illegal activities.
The court found that Rahman "cynically distorted" the religious outlook of his Muslim community and silenced his critics, accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
"Rahman led his election campaign with the belief that it is the religious duty of Muslim believers to vote for him."
About 300 votes were falsified or questionable, as one person had voted repeatedly.
Sir Eric also points out that there are signs of fraud throughout the country.
He said it was particularly worrying to see postal fraud where senior members of Muslim communities forced others to vote for their preferred candidates.
Sir Eric suggested a series of measures to improve the electoral system, including the presentation of an identity document, in order to establish a person’s identity.
"The evidence shows that vulnerable members of ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, are forced to vote for candidates chosen by community elders, especially in communities in Bangladesh and Pakistan."
"There is a concern that district authorities are not paying attention to these problems because of political correctness, as ethnic and religious interests could be affected."
Sir Eric outlined 50 recommendations for improving the electoral system, which also includes banning political activists from working with mail-order votes to prevent "vote-gathering".
The report, which is being examined by Theresa May, also calls for more scrutiny of registration in order to prevent the use of electoral rolls for immigration and benefit fraud.
Consider requesting voters to present an identity document before the vote.
Mark the fingers of voters with special ink to prevent double voting.
Systematically check the nationality of persons to make sure that they have the right to vote.
Set a three-year limit for requests for automatic postal voting.
Prohibit political campaigners and activists from working with postal votes and ballot envelopes for postal voting.
Provide the police with the power to deploy security guards at polling stations.
Make changes to the law to facilitate prosecution of individuals for intimidation under the 1983 Human Rights Act.
Prohibit photographing at polling stations.
Only English (except in Wales) is required at polling stations.
Step up training to ensure that polling stations ensure that voters go to the ballot boxes one by one.
Sir Erik sharply criticises Metropolitan Police for not understanding that no charges have been brought in the Towerhamlet case.
He says: “The election court only disqualified Luftur Rahman and his representative for activities related to corruption and fraud.”
He was found guilty convincingly by the standard of criminal law evidence on the basis of irrefutable evidence.
It’s a great way to get to know each other better.
Sir Eric says, "Last year's court decision is a wake-up call.
Our country is known as the birthplace of parliament, but the alarming and hidden spread of electoral fraud and the institution's pretending that fraud does not threaten this good reputation.
Passion for the cyclist - Kate's counterpart and other Rio Olympic celebrity counterparts

Hunter & Wolf: U.S. archer teammate Brady Allison, left, has been compared to Leonardo Di Caprio since childhood
Apart from Kate’s counterpart on the cycling circuit, many people on the Internet indicate that this archer could be the twin brother of superstar Leonardo DiCaprio.
Brady Allison, a member of the U.S. men's archery team, caused a storm on Twitter when he posted photos where he was very much like the Wolf of Wall Street.
The athlete himself noticed the storm on social media and admitted that he has been compared to Leonardo Di Caprio since childhood.
"I personally don't see much similarity except for the beard," Brady tells Huffington Post.
"He's a handsome guy, so I take it as a compliment."
This year, the popularity of one of the most popular pairs of the 2012 London Olympics will undoubtedly increase: the striking resemblance between the British long jumper Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian athlete Aliya Mustafina, thanks to her large, expressive eyes, is compared to the Cuban-born American singer Gloria Estefan.
In terms of swimming, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burg has been compared to stage star Matthew Morrison for several years.
This is the first time in the history of the United States that the United States has been a member of the World Trade Organization.
It is also the case of tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who have similar eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medalist, swimmer Yulia Efimova and actress Annalina McCord can boast not only of sun-tanned skin and blonde hair. Meanwhile, fans believe that the athletic US athlete Nathan Adrian resembles Joseph Gordon Levit.
Hardcore Women: Football star (left) Hope Solo and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter (right) have similar facial shape and eyes.
There is no one: one Twitter user was pleasantly surprised to learn that others see these similarities as well
Theory: This user thinks there may be a reason why the two look so similar
Recently, a Twitter user said with great pleasure that "the rest of the Internet users are agreed that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter actually look identical."
It’s a great way to get to know each other better.
Other popular comparisons refer to Carrie Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to the smile of actress Laura Linney. Also, the gold medal-winning athlete Gabby Douglas is proud of a beautiful, wide smile, which resembles the smile of "Bring It On" star Gabriela Unijona.
A commentator at the CBC Olympic Games apologizes for saying that the Chinese swimmer died as a pig.
Byron McDonald's analysis of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhas finishing fourth in the 4x200 m freestyle relay for women caused a storm of indignation among CBC viewers.
The Canadian CBC channel was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer had "flew out of the race, that she smelled alone" and "died like a pig".
Commentator Byron McDonald thought his microphone was turned off when the 4x200m freestyle relay for women at the end of the finals set out his personal opinion.
McDonald, who was included in the CBC commenting team to give the comments a vibrancy, said: "That little 14-year-old Chinese girl can't keep up."
"Too runny, she flew out of the race, that she only smelled and died like a pig."
Thank you very much.
The 14-year-old Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan scored 1:57.79 in the second stage, 1.61 seconds slower than the Canadian Taylor Rucka, allowing the Canadians to catch up with China.
Viewers across Canada reacted immediately on the Internet because they were shocked to hear such tone and expressions.
Emmett McFarlain tweeted: "Did a CBC commentator just say that a 14-year-old swimmer from China "dead like a pig"???
The idiot did not understand that they were still on live air.
Ai Yanha from China in the 4x200m freestyle finals for women was named "the little fourteen-year-old from China who does not keep up."
Criticism of Byron MacDonald quickly took hold, as many demanded explanations.
Twitter users could not believe the insensitive comments of Byron McDonald.
Twitter user Sarah Paradi wrote: “Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada, and for your sake we all sound like racists.
Shortly afterward, Scott Russell, who was leading the CBC live broadcast at the time, apologized for McDonald's comments, saying: "We apologize that the comment about the swimming result was aired live."
It was an unfortunate choice of words and we are very sorry that it happened.
The CBC apologized to more than 90 people who had responded to the tweet.
McDonald's colleague Scott Russell had to apologize in his place.
The CBC then copied an apology to more than 90 Twitter users who complained about McDonald's comment.
Also, the channel quickly published an apology and a statement.
We very much regret that such comments were made and that they went live.
Yesterday, we reacted immediately and apologized to all the live viewers and followers on social media.
For the sake of clarity, it should be said that Byron's comments were made about the performance of the swimmer, and not addressed to her personally.
But in any case, they were unprofessional and unsuccessfully chosen statements, and Byron deeply regrets what happened.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald personally apologized to the air and tried to explain that he did not think his comment would be perceived as a personal attack.
In a live broadcast of the CBC Olympics, he said: "I would like to take a moment to apologize for a comment I made yesterday after the women's freestyle competition."
I am talking about the performance of the swimmer, not about him personally.
Needless to say, I did not mean to show disrespect and I am really sorry that this happened.
Primark customers are shocked by a woman who brazenly tries on underwear in the middle of the store.
Buyers were embarrassed when the woman started undressing to put on panties in the middle of the store.
To make matters worse, she tried them on to see if they fit her and then took them off by putting them back on the shelf.
She continued to look for clothes in the shop of Folkestone Bouverie Place and tried on four more panties.
The Primark Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone is the place where the woman tried on her underwear and then put it back on the shelf.
At the time, there was also Jenny Davidson, a mother of two, who says that the unknown woman put on her clothes and left the store without buying anything after trying on her underwear.
She points out that people could not believe their eyes.
Standing in the middle of the store, she took her underpants from the shelf, took off her tights and trousers, and measured them on the spot.
She did not even try to find a more discreet place to measure them, she simply tried them on the spot.
Everyone watched as she took off her panties, and apparently the woman did not like them, because she simply put them back on the shelf.
She measured three more panties until she decided she didn't like any of them and left the store.
She didn’t seem to be worried that someone was watching or thinking about the person who would buy the clothes she was wearing.
Miss Davidson, 33, from Kent, says, "The idea that someone will buy clothes that have been tried on by another person and that have not been washed afterwards."
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson adds, "I assume the store staff took the clothes off the store shelves after she left -- which is also acceptable."
I can’t imagine buying a new underwear and finding out that another woman tried it on and then didn’t wash it.
The representative of Primark indicated that Primark was aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday, 9 August.
The clothes in question have been removed from the store shelves.
How to protect yourself from firearms using Krav Maga
The world is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer.
To find out how to protect ourselves at a close distance from the attackers with a firearm, we spoke with Ron Mizraki, the grandmaster of Krav Maga from New York.
Whether you are attacked from the front or the back, this video shows you how to protect yourself and get the upper hand over the attacker.
Mizraki indicates that if an attacker attacks from the back, then you must first turn to clearly see the attacker and avoid the trajectory of the shot.
Then the weapon should be grasped between your front arm and shoulder and make a blow to the opponent's face with your free elbow.
Then follow the shot with the knee in the groin and until the attacker freezes in pain, take his weapon, hit his face with the gun's handle and step back, continuing to turn the weapon against him.
If the attacker approaches from the front, the situation is similar - avoid the trajectory of the shot, grasp the weapon and fold it so that the villain can not shoot.
At the same time, you have to put pressure on the gun and hit your opponent's chest, and then you have to take the gun away and step back and continue to aim at him.
Sounds complicated?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizraki does it.
But remember, if you are not the master of Krav Maga, then it is safer to give the robber your money.
The Vandal family demolishes the social home of Saltash Cornwall and is put out on the street.
The Vand<0xC4><0x81>li family has been evicted from their homes for terrorising neighbours, causing damage to a social home worth <0xC2><0xA3>50,000.
Tanja Skeldon and her partner Sean Trebilcok justlayed from the property in Saltash in Cornwall, because of a number of complaints against them.
When they were forcibly evicted from their property, the shocked housing service officials found that the property had been completely vandalized.
There were holes in the floors and walls, waste was scattered everywhere, and the walls were covered with graffiti.
The family is now evicted from the property and most likely lives in a private property.
Donna Makevoy, a manager for the Cornish Housing Service, says there are fears that it will not be possible to renovate the home.
She says that it has been extremely difficult for the people who lived here, and she believes that people cannot live that way.
In this case, a number of factors need to be considered, since the property in Cornwall will no longer have a good reputation.
This family is famous and their name is well known.
The couple had three sons who had periodically resided in their property, and the police say that their terror included violence, street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of the local population, drug abuse, drug sales, and loud shouting and swearing.
It’s a great way to get to know each other better.
In a number of rooms of the demolished house was found littered waste.
In a house where drugs have been sold in the past, several floorboards have also been torn out.
Neighbours say that they regularly fight on the street and are constantly called the police.
They were forced out of their property by the Cornish Housing Service after they had 11 weeks to leave the house voluntarily.
Desperate neighbors were very happy about the eviction, because their life was said to have been an absolute hell.
One said, "They didn't care about other people."
We lived next to them for 20 years, it's always been crazy.
It's amazing how often we've seen the police here.
We couldn’t sleep this morning.
We woke up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it!
Now that they are finally gone, here will be wonderful.
Adam Fitzpatrick, who is the head of neighborhood protection at Cornwall Housing Service, said the family did not cooperate with local security authorities.
The family has lived here for 20 years and is regularly called the police.
In the overgrown garden of the house, various old and unusable items were found.
He also said: "It is a pity that the tenants did not show any responsibility for their behavior, because eviction from the house is always the last step considered by the Cornish Housing Service."
This was a very difficult case, because their behaviour was extreme and the neighbors had to watch their behaviour very hard.
I appreciate the work of my entire team, the Devon and Cornwall police and the members of the community, who were brave and cooperated with us in providing the necessary information.
I hope that this event will make life easier for neighbours and show that antisocial behaviour is unacceptable.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons lived here at different times, but they were all about 20 years old.
Dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the rooms after laying out.
The staff will now have to clean up the waste heap left in the house.
In 2014, police raided the house and found more than 70 grams of marijuana, scales, supplies and 1,700 pounds in cash.
Skeldon has only been found guilty of storing Class B drugs for the purpose of distributing them.
She insisted that the money was intended for a monument to her son Lee Sheldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After the eviction, it became known that they were currently renting a private property in Plymouth.
There were graffiti on many of the walls of the house.
Police say they will continue to evict tenants who violate their leases.
If you’re not sure what to do, ask your doctor if you’re allergic to any of the ingredients in this supplement.
She also said: "This is a warning to those who think that they can behave as they want and it will not have any consequences."
The Devon and Cronwall Police do not accept criminal and antisocial behaviour, and the police will continue to work with our partners to protect local communities.
The willingness to spend can give a boost to the economy.

The mayor of Cannes has banned burkini swimsuits on the beaches.
The mayor of the southern French resort of Cannes has banned burkini swimsuits on the city's beaches, which almost completely cover the woman's body and look very like a wetsuit, local officials said Thursday.
The mayor of Cannes, David Linar, has signed a decree that "access to beaches and swimming is prohibited to anyone who does not have a bathing suit that respects good customs and secularism" as a basic principle of the French Republic.
"A beach suit that ostentatiously displays religious affiliation at a time when France and places of worship are the target of terrorist attacks may create a risk of disturbances of public order (crowds, clashes, etc.) that need to be prevented," the order said.
"We're not talking about banning religious symbols on the beach, but about an ostentatious outfit associated with trust in the terrorist movements that are at war with us," said Thierry Migul, head of municipal utilities.
He added that the burkini has not been seen on Cannes beaches since July 28, when Linar, a right-wing member of the centre-right Republicans party, signed the order and it came into force.
This week, a water park in the city of Marseille cancelled a planned private event for Muslim women who would be wearing a burkini in swimsuits, as both right-wing and left-wing politicians expressed indignation at such an event.
In France, wearing face-covering headscarves for Muslim women is prohibited, but not religious symbols or appropriate clothing.
On July 14, 85 people were killed in a terrorist attack in the nearby resort town of Cannes, Nice, which was claimed by the Islamic State group.
On July 26, two attackers who had sworn allegiance to the Islamic State massacred a priest in a church in northwest France.
It’s the same with the rest of the world.

The company’s turnover in 2014 was EUR 22.57 million.
The company’s profit also grew slightly – from EUR 781 235 in 2014 to EUR 785 896 last year.
The management report states that last year the company reconstructed the existing store in Riga, Slokas Street, and closed the store in Riga, Kurzemes Avenue.
This year, as in other years, the main task of the company is to continue to increase both turnover and profit.
It is recommended to leave the profits made last year undistributed.

The festival "Kub<0xC4><0x81>na" has started in Lucavsala.
In the evening of Thursday, August 11, in Lucavsala was given a start for one of the last festivals of this summer - there will be "Kub<0xC4><0x81>na" until Sunday night.
The first night was pampered by such bands as "Enter Shikari" from Great Britain, which was expected last year, but American punks "NOFX", DJ Maxim from "The Prodigy" and others disappeared from the program.
Also in the next days of the festival there are noteworthy names in the program - "Guano Apes" and "Garbage", drummer of punk rock legend "Ramone", Marky Ramon with "Marky Ramone's Blitzkrieg", "Brutto&Lyapis" with Belarusian punk rock leader Sergey Mikhailok, popular Georgian actor and singer.
This is the second year that Kubana festival takes place in Latvia.
Last year it suffered a financial failure and huge losses, but it did not prevent the organizers from re-trying - they added a garm<0xC5><0xAB>zm<0xC4><0x93>t<0xC4><0xAB>jums to the name, included a Latvian group in the program (on Friday evening at 7:15 pm "All Day Long" will climb the stage) and announced that now the festival has become "closer to the local colors along with such symbols of Riga as its panorama and cats".
It is still too early to say whether these efforts will be justified, as the festival has just started, but as "Delfi Entertainment" observed on the first night, at least for the time being, it has not been possible to attract huge crowds of people and the number of visitors was similar to last year.
The British track cycling team doubles the Olympic record and wins the sprint.
The British track team broke the Olympic record twice on Thursday and won the men's sprint race.
The first Olympic record was revised by the British in qualifying, but in the first round of the competition it was revised again by the New Zealanders.
In the final of the sprint, the British team met New Zealand, and the British stripped New Zealanders of the title of Olympic record holder, leaving them with silver medals.
In the final, the British team won with a score of 42,440 seconds, beating New Zealanders by 0.102 seconds.
In the battle for bronze, the French team beat Australia.
It should be noted that the record was also corrected in the qualification of women's pursuit - the British team corrected the world record, which is now 4:13,260.
The President, who remained in the shadows: Gustavs Zemgals - 145.
On Friday, August 12, 145 years have passed since the birth of the second President of Latvia, Gustavs Zemgals.
Zemgale proclaimed the state of Latvia, but it has been left undeservedly in the shadow of the well-described first President of Latvia, J<0xC4><0x81>nis <0xC4><0x8C>akste, and the last President of the pre-war period, K<0xC4><0x81>rlis Ulmanis.
If you’re not sure what to do, ask your doctor or pharmacist if you’re allergic to any of the ingredients in this product.

The rest of the strings, always very correctly.
He knew not to be like that, today it could be similar to Raimonds V<0xC4><0x93>jonis.
"He was someone who was close to the people," Auzi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> says.
Modern politicians know history poorly, they referred to K<0xC4><0x81>rlis Ulmanis as a good leader, but few know how furious he was.
The only person he didn’t yell at was General Balodis.
Even if he is kind and smiling in the pictures, by nature he was hysterical.
It’s also a great way to get to know each other better.
If you’re not sure what to do, ask your doctor or pharmacist if you’re allergic to any of the ingredients in this product.
He also notes that Zemgals was distinguished by respect for minorities and regularly invited Jewish representatives to the presidential palace.
"At that time it was not a common practice, after Zemgale's presidency Alberts Kviesis took over this tradition," says the historian.
He was such a quiet and balanced man that for a long time he had to be persuaded to become president.
He did not seek it himself, he simply did not hunger for fame.
He was also quite critical of himself, because he did not know French, but he believed that the president must be able to do so.
"During his presidency, he learned the basics of the French language," explains Stranga.
It’s a great way to get to know each other better.
In any case, he is a very respectable person in the history of Latvia, already before entering the presidential palace he was in a serious position - he was a very sought-after notary.
Zemgals also managed the famous Zemgals Treasury at Suvorova Street 3, where the Association of Savers and Lenders was located, where the Latvian state was formed in practical government talks.
He was always progressive.
It was not a big fan of Ulmanis, but he did not object to it in public either.
“In private conversations, however, he has sometimes said that he doesn’t really like Ulmanis’ actions,” says Stranga.
Lived a peaceful life, there is no suspicion of lawlessness or corruption.
How is Zemgale remembered today?
It is a pity, but for a large part he associates only with a street in Riga.
He was an absolute democrat, and his views were centered.
"There were no major shocks during his time, that is, he could be associated with a truly stable presidency," Stranga summed up.
During the presidency of Gustavs Zemgals, from 1927 to 1930, the state visit of Latvia to Sweden also took place, which for Latvia at that time implicitly meant full recognition in the neighbouring country and inclusion in the family of democratic nations of Northern Europe.
On 28 May 1929, Zemgals arrived on a state visit to Stockholm.
The return visit of King Gustav V of Sweden to Latvia took place on 29 June 1929.
The second President of Latvia was born in 1871, but passed away in January 1939.
Simple ways to help your child cope with tantrums.
I often have to face the fact that the child’s anger, the appearance of rage, is considered by parents to be something wrong and abnormal.
When a child openly shows his anger - we do not know how to react, Ekaterina Kess, a psychologist, points out in Econet.
The specialist encourages a little conversation about these so natural and human feelings - anger and rage, which are periodically experienced by everyone.
Aggression - this is already a physical action directed against another person, and it usually appears when we feel angry.
When we adults are angry, excited - we usually know what is happening to us and how to deal with it.
We can express our anger and anger in ourselves: express, suppress, hide, keep within ourselves, tell about it to our friends or other loved ones, we can kick the sofa in anger, smoke a cigarette (it is not the best way to dispel anger!), take a shower, hit the kulaks on the table and do other things that we do not usually do.
We do not turn our aggression against others, because we know different ways to deal with these emotions.
Children, when they are angry, do not understand what is happening to them, how to name them and how to live with them.
They can say, "Go away!", You're a fool, "Bad Mom," "I don't see you," "I'm not going to be friends with you," and very rarely can they say, "I'm angry with you."
Children live in the literal sense, they are completely here, at this moment, they are spontaneous and sincere in showing their feelings, and often also are held captive by various emotions.
It is very important that parents do not forbid a child to express feelings, including anger, do not be ashamed of it and do not scold, but, on the contrary, help the child.
Do you need a break in your relationship?
A long working day in which everything has not gone as you would like, or just a bad mood - there are so many reasons why you would like to "off" from all over the world for a moment, a day or even longer.
Is it possible to break up a relationship for a while and breathe a little?
Or does it show that each of the partners has its own path?
In their opinions share gentlemen of different ages.
John (23) is short and succinct: "In my opinion, if you need a break in a relationship, you are not with the right person."
In the meantime, Eduardo (30) has discovered a scheme that may be able to help someone.
If you feel that your partner starts to get nervous about every little thing, then definitely - this is the moment when you should look at other hunting fields to understand whether you miss him, or do not think about him especially, or even do not want to see him anymore.
So the answer is - yes, taking a break can help you save time and understand how important your other half is to you.
I am 29 years old and have my own theory.
In my opinion, it is necessary to take a break from each other on a daily basis, because if you spend time with a person 24 hours a day, seven days a week, then quarrels are inevitable.
They are caused by the fact that you notice every detail that the other one is doing, and it starts to fall on your nerves.
People start to get bored with each other, especially if you don’t even have anything to talk about anymore, just about what you’ve done over the course of the day.
My personal experience makes me think so, so I haven’t been in a relationship for more than a couple of months either.
If you think for a moment that somewhere else or next to another is better - then why this woman with whom you are with deserves someone who can think that here is not good enough and behind the hills there are paradise fields?
Thinking alone is a little betrayal.
If not, then not.
"I have, so I condemn those who do not have a little," says Edmunds (46).
This is a great way to get to know each other better.
I think everyone needs a moment of respite.
You can’t look each other in the eye every moment, all the time, from morning to evening and rejoice at the enduring love.
Get up!
There are so many things - friends, work, parties.
Everything has its time.
Of course, even a friend or a wife, but if both of them can keep their balance between family life and the rest of the world, then it can live to the brim of the grave.
That and only that.
If you’re a business owner, you’ll want to make sure that you’re getting the most out of your business.
If this question is raised, then it should be taken into account that in the near future there will be some changes - for the better or for the worse, it depends on themselves.
I think that while you are still young and crazy, while you need to pause - something all the time, but when everything is serious and the relationship goes into a completely different phase, then there can be no question of rest.
You decide to spend the rest of your life together!
"If you can't cope with each other's society now and need respite from time to time, then what will happen when you become pensioners who comment on how passing cats growl or argue about which day the garden should be weeded," Kristaps explains (19).
All the names of the gentlemen have been changed.
With his enthusiastic and enthralling personality, Rozent<0xC4><0x81>ls was the first to arouse the interest of the Latvian people in performing arts.
"In this sense, he was the first love of the Latvian people, which, as such, will remain forever unforgettable," Romans Suta once wrote about the old master of Latvian painting, Janis Rozent<0xC4><0x81>ls.
Also in 2016, with the opening of the old master's extensive retrospective exhibition in the restored main building of the Latvian National Museum of Art, it is clear that Rozent<0xC4><0x81>ls is the first love of Latvian art.
The exhibition was opened on 12 August, but already from 13 August it is open to visitors and will be open until 30 October.
The Latvian National Museum of Art honours painter Janis Rozent<0xC4><0x81>ls (1866-1916) with a wide retrospective in the newly opened Great Exhibition Hall, whose one hundred and fiftyth birthday is internationally included in the UNESCO calendar of public holidays.
The retrospective exhibition, which features more than 150 works, is one of the central events of the annual programme of the anniversary of Janis Rozent<0xC4><0x81>ls.
The selection of artworks is mostly from the collection of the Latvian National Museum of Art, which convincingly represents the main stages and genres of the classic’s creative activity, stylistic change and diversity of techniques.
In addition, exhibits from the Axel Gallen-Kallela Museum, the Literature and Music Museum, the Liep<0xC4><0x81>ja Museum, the Tukums Museum and several private collections in Latvia and Finland have been used.
The atmosphere of the turn of the century is brought to life by the presence of photographs, the mobile application of the exhibition reveals the interrelationship of certain works of art with photographs taken by the painter with his own camera for creative purposes.
The Finnish-Latvian Friendship Society Rozent<0xC4><0x81>ls-seura, named after a Latvian classic, at the same time offers the first stop of a small informative travelling exhibition "With a Look in Finland, With a Heart in Latvia" at the Latvian National Museum of Art.
A similar exhibition with content in English, Finnish and Swedish will be opened in autumn at the Virka Gallery in Helsinki.

The Commission shall be assisted by the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed established by Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety.
Nothing is officially happening yet.
"If so, the BBC will announce it," Leblanc said in an interview with TV critics.
Doubts about the future of "Gase in the floor!" arose in July, when LeBlanc's partner Chris Evans announced that he was leaving the program.
After leaving, Evans admitted that Leblanc and "Gas on the floor!" are "like made for each other."
Evans describes the former "Friends" star as a "real and decent man", dispelling rumors that the friendship between the two had broken down during the filming.
When Leblanc asked what he liked the most about the show, he replied that traveling to other countries like South Africa, Morocco and Ireland.

It is expected that the meldonium in the medicament Mildron<0xC4><0x81>ts, produced in Latvia, could be excluded from the list of prohibited substances for athletes already this year, Academician Ivars Kalvi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>, the director of the Latvian Institute of Organic Synthesis, said on Friday morning on the LNT broadcast for 900 seconds.
He said he would travel to Canada in September to discuss the meldonium issue with representatives of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).

In essence - a very provocative, balancing work on sophistication and banal vulgarity, in which it is difficult to draw lines between European art house films and the territory of Hollywood genre product.
The main role of the film with Vigo Mortensen highlights the question of whether parents’ conceptually chosen life models (ecological, vegetarian, alternative and distancing themselves from the stumbling blocks and values of consumer society) bring blessing or destructiveness to their children.

This solo number of survival can be compared to James Franco's acting skills demonstration in the film 127 hours and Ryan Reynolds' game in the film Buried Alive.
It is possible that the main role played by Mila Kunis is also to blame, whose transformation from a role model into a creative inhabitant and a fomenter of almost family values only seems to have been created by the fantasies of quite desperate Hollywood screenwriters.
The Islamic State has captured 2,000 civilians in Syria.
Islamic State militants have captured some 2,000 civilians used as human shields as they fled Menbiz in Syria's Aleppo province, a U.S.-backed Kurdish-Arab alliance and observers said Friday.
"We didn't shoot them because they took civilians with them on their way to Jerrabulus," a spokesman for the Kurdish Menbiza Military Council said.
After two months of fighting, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (QSD), a U.S.-backed Kurdish-Arab alliance in northern Syria, said on Friday that Menbiza had been freed from jihadists.
The Islamic State captured Menbij in 2014.
The QSD expelled most of the Islamic State fighters from Menbij last week, but some held on and showed fierce resistance.
However, on Friday they left the city, taking prisoners with them.
The Islamists are heading to Jerabulus, on the border with Turkey.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a London-based group of Syrian activists, also reported that the Islamic State had kidnapped around 2,000 people.
The Observatory reported that Islamists had hijacked city residents’ cars, forced people to climb into them, and then took them to Jerrabulus.
ISIS militants have also carried out mass kidnappings in the past.
In January, Islamists seized more than 400 civilians, including women and children, in the eastern Syrian province of Deir Ezzor.
Later, about 270 prisoners were freed by Islamists.
It is not known how many Islamic State militants escaped from Menbij.
A spokesman for the Kurdish Menbiza Military Council said QSD had rescued 2,500 people held captive by Islamists in Menbiza.
According to information gathered by the Observatory, at least 437 civilians, including 105 children, lost their lives in the Battle of Menbij.
There are 299 QSD fighters and 1,019 jihadists killed.

The Freeport of Riga has implemented all the recommendations of the SAO regarding the Krievu Island project.
The Freeport of Riga Authority has implemented all of the five recommendations of the State Audit Office regarding the implementation of the project Infrastructure Development on Krievu Island for the transfer of port activities from the city center, the portal Diena.lv informed the company.
Approval of the project is planned for the next meeting of the Freeport of Riga Board.
In order for the recommendations to be implemented in accordance with the SAO’s opinion, when preparing the documentation necessary for the implementation of the recommendations, the Freeport of Riga Authority was also guided by the conclusions of the legal and operational audit carried out by the international auditor Deloitte at the Freeport of Riga Authority and the recommendations provided for the improvement of project management in the subsequent stage of the project.
Information on the implementation of the recommendations has also been sent to the SAO today.
Despite the fact that the Freeport of Riga Authority does not agree with the opinion prepared by the SAO on the usefulness of the implementation of the Krievu Island project, we are very responsible for the implementation of the project and the financing provider - the European Commission (EC).
I would like to emphasize that all the construction works planned within the framework of the project have been fully completed within the set deadlines and in the planned amount.
"In order to prove to all those involved in the implementation of the project, including the EC, the SAO and also stevedores, that the main goal of the free port is the successful implementation of the project, we have fully implemented all the SAO recommendations regarding the issues of project management and supervision," says the project manager of Krievu Island Sanita Kaire.
The long-term action plan for the control and monitoring of the achievement of the goal of the project was supplemented with the most important planned activities of the parties involved and the deadlines for the necessary decisions, the definitions of meetings and regular reports and their deadlines, the instruments for monitoring the planned construction process, as well as the definitions of the most important border points.
The approved action plan to achieve the project goal by 31 December 2018, in accordance with the recommendations of the State Audit Office, is supplemented with performance monitoring activities, thereby reinforcing the control of the duration of activities of other parties involved in the implementation of the project from the side of the Freeport of Riga.
To improve project management and reduce potential risks, a project management plan has been developed, defining the areas of project management and indicating the developed documents that provide a control and monitoring mechanism for each of them.
To increase the capacity of the project, a project management structure has been developed, which reflects the planned structure of the project management team, the qualifications and functions of the employees.
In order to improve the communication between the Freeport of Riga Authority and the parties involved in the project, a communication plan of the project stakeholders has been developed, which, in addition to the parties specified in the project action plan, defines the parties involved for the successful completion of the project, the principles, types and periodicity of information exchange.
In order to improve the control of the use of financial resources, the necessity of entering into a service contract or launching a procurement and the rule of law will have to be justified in more detail in the future.
Within the framework of the project, a world-standard port infrastructure has been built on Krievu Island – four new deep-water berths, railway connections, as well as engineering and technical communications.
The structures co-financed by the Cohesion Fund have been completed and put into operation at the end of last year, achieving a savings of EUR 10.6 million.

German researchers are discussing the number of victims of the "Berlin Wall".
According to a new study, the death toll on the Communist-dominated border with former East Germany could be much higher than previously thought, but doubts about the true number of victims have not been dispelled.
According to data released Wednesday by the Checkpoint Charlie Museum of the Berlin Wall, between 1945 and 1989, 1,841 people were killed trying to get out of the area under their control by the later Communist authorities of West Germany.
The museum has been studying border-related deaths for years and occasionally adjusts the number of victims.
This year, 11 more deaths have been added to the list, including a six-year-old boy who drowned as his family tried to get to West Germany through what was then Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
Among the new victims of the Berlin Wall are the deserters of the Soviet army.
"The final extent of the damage caused by the double evil of communism and socialism has not yet been fully documented," said museum director Aleksandra Hildebrante.
"Our task is to ensure that the graves of those who died trying to escape the communist-controlled country are maintained and not lost," Hildebrante said in a statement.
But other researchers have already questioned the new figures.
"The figure of 1841 is unconvincing", says Jochen Staats, an expert on the history of East Germany at the Free University of Berlin, in an interview with the S<0xC3><0xBC>ddeutsche Zeitung newspaper.
He and other researchers at the Free University of Berlin are currently reviewing possible suspicious deaths at the border, and so far only 260 have been confirmed.
In the past, researchers estimated that only at the Berlin Wall, the Communists murdered 138 people.
If you’re looking for a way to make money online, it’s a great way to get started.
However, it is still significantly less than in 1841.
One of the reasons for the different number of victims could be the different methodologies.
The Checkpoint Charlie Museum also lists all suicides of East German border guards, regardless of whether they were directly linked to their service.
The museum also lists deaths that are not related to direct violence.
"Seniors between 70 and 80 years old who died of a heart attack after contracting the border control should be the result of this "murderful border"," Hildebrante said.
But Status is convinced that a distinction must be made between the elderly, who may have died as a result of the treatment they have experienced, and those whose death was caused by waiting for a long time in hot weather on a bus at the border.
Despite this, counting the victims is not easy, as the communist East German authorities did not accumulate such statistics, and the researchers have to select documents in various scattered archives, says Staats.
However, the establishment group has recently come up with new documents and could therefore come up with a new estimate of the number of victims in the near future.

In order to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market, the Commission should be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).
The Commission shall be assisted by the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed established by Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety.
Initially, the list of riders included swimmers A<0xC4><0xBC>ona Ribakova and Uvis Kalni<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>, coaches Jakubovskis and Dave Collins, as well as the president of the federation Pone.
The Latvian Swimming Federation announced five participants for the Olympic Games, and even before the departure Aldons Vrub<0xC4><0xBC>evskis stated that Germans will be and are looking for tickets.
"But apparently for objective reasons he was not," he said, expressing the opinion that it did not affect Ribakov's result.
At the request of the federation, Uvy's coach undertook to help her.
The Commission shall be assisted by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs established by Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 establishing a European Supervisory Authority (European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority).
In my opinion, it is unethical to approve five persons on the executive committee of the LOC and not to remove any of them.
"I don't know why the Swimming Federation didn't have enough space," he said, adding that the work of the federation and its presidents was not appreciated by the public, reminding them that the presidents of the federations don't receive salaries.
In addition, he criticized Jakubowski himself, stating that before the London Olympics, when Ribakova was not approved among the participants, he complained to the International Water Sports Federation (FINA) and urged Latvia not to send any athletes.

600,000 juvenile salmon will be introduced to the Daugava.
During the Latvenergo AS fish resource recovery programme, salmon and sea trout fry are being let in this week in the Daugava near Manga<0xC4><0xBC>sala, and this year it is planned to let in more than 600,000 annual salmon and sea trout fry raised in the fish farms of the scientific institute Bior Tome and Dole.
The Commission shall be assisted by the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed established by Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs (OJ L 139, 30.4.2004, p.
Pike and lamprey larvae will be released in spring and early summer of 2016, in June - whitefish, in July - one summer salmon, in August and September - zander and vimba.
The production director of Latvenergo M<0xC4><0x81>ris Kunickis told that taking care of the environment is one of the cornerstones of the sustainable development of Latvenergo Group.
"In the measures for the protection and reproduction of fish resources, all activities are aimed at environmentally friendly actions in close cooperation with the scientific institute Bior, carrying out both the breeding and release of juvenile fish in the Daugava basin and implementing other activities," said Kunickis.
This year, more than 600,000 annual salmon and sea trout fry will be released into the Daugava estuary.
For the second year in a row, fry are marked by cutting off the fat.
The cargo brought today contains 25,000 salmon fry with an average weight of 31.3 grams.
Every year, in a scientifically based composition of species and in numbers, fry and larvae are let in in the Daugava and its basin water bodies.
In accordance with the regulatory enactments, the reproduction of fish resources in the Daugava and its basin water bodies is carried out by Bior on the basis of an expert-examination of the damage caused to fish resources as a result of Latvenergo’s economic activity and providing a conclusion on what compensatory measures should be taken to ensure the diversity of fish resources.
In turn, the State Environmental Service, on the basis of the abovementioned expert-examination, shall take a decision on the amount and type of compensation.
The annual compensation amount for Latvenergo in the programme for the recovery of fish resources is EUR 1 035 000.
In the spring of 2016, Latvenergo, in cooperation with the association "M<0xC4><0x93>s <0xC5><0xBE>uviem" (We for Fish), is setting up 400 artificial fish spawning nests in the Daugava near Kaibala and Ik<0xC5><0xA1><0xC4><0xB7>ile.
Cooperation with the society, promoting the natural spawning of fish, is an initiative supported by Latvenergo within the framework of the programme for the restoration of fish resources.
The placement of artificial spawning nests in the reservoir is an important measure that contributes to the protection and reproduction of fish resources in the Daugava River.
In the festival "Sansus<0xC4><0xAB> koncertz<0xC4><0x81>le" there is a country yard, forest, felling site.

The festival will take place in Sus<0xC4><0x93>ja - no longer existing village - in the courtyard of the former parish house, next to forests and felling grounds.
In three days - from 12 to 14 August - on five stages you can combine the carefree enjoyment of nature and academic music.
Here, music meets theatre and contemporary circus, performances and installations.
Opera and academic music, especially in its newest forms, find new listeners in a free and open environment without the stiffness of concert halls.
The distance from here to Riga is about 150 km, but to a smile on your face and lightness on your feet only a few minutes.
"Please do not look for the programme, because we have deliberately chosen not to publish it in advance, so that people do not go to one particular event or artist, because the true taste of Sansusi can only be captured by spending all three days in it," invites the initiator and host of the festival, opera baritone Armands Sili<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>.
We open the gates of the festival on Friday at 17.00, and the first concert is at 19.00.
Of course, there will be programs with all the information on the site.
For those who need to choose one day, we recommend Saturday, because it is the most saturated - from 9.00 in the morning until the next dawn.
"The names of the artists are available on the website www.sansusi.lv", tells Armands Sili<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>.

Reid claims that if Clinton is elected president, then she will appoint Garland as a Supreme Court Justice.
Harry Reid, the leader of the Senate Democratic Party, is convinced that if she becomes president, she will nominate Merika Garland as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.
The Republican Party in the Senate has blocked Garland's approval since March, when he was nominated by President Obama.
Mitch McConnell, the leader of the majority of the Senate, said that the next president will choose who will replace the current Supreme Court Justice Antonina Skaliu.
During his conference on Thursday, Reid announced that he was confident Clinton would choose Garland.

Greenland shark is the longest-living vertebrate - video review
Scientists say that Greenland sharks have the longest lifespan of any vertebrate on our planet.
Shark explorer Julius Nielsen says that the record for longevity belongs to a female, who may be between 272 and 512 years old and five metres long.
A French court has rejected a request to demolish shops in the jungle refugee camp.
A French court rejected a request by the authorities in Calais to demolish dozens of self-built shops and restaurants in the "Jungle" camp, home to several thousand refugees.
At a hearing in Calais this week, the authorities stated that the state should demolish 72 self-made shops where people trade in various goods such as cigarettes and energy drinks in the camp, offer hairdressing services, tea for 50 cents (40p) and simple meals for a few euros in self-made restaurants.
The Prefect’s Office in Calais pointed out that these self-created businesses should be dismantled because they create a shadow economy and do not pay taxes, as well as pose fire and sanitary risks.
Representatives of the humanitarian group explained to the court that these small businesses are important because the food provided by the government and the support groups does not meet the needs of the camp, where the number of residents continues to grow.
They also pointed out that self-made boutiques and restaurants often offer free shelter and food to those most in need.
The Lille court ruled that there is no legal basis for expelling people who have created 72 self-designed shops, but it understands the concerns of the Prefect of Calais.
Judge Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Molla said that food, coffee and restaurants play a greater role than simply providing food to people who live in "extremely poor conditions".
He pointed out that these places are peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places at risk of demolition is the camp cafe "Jungle Book Kids", which provides more than 200 free meals a day, English and French lessons and provides asylum advice to hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors.
More than 170 000 people have signed a petition on the protection of a children's cafe.
In a letter to the Guardian, it said the cafe's liquidation "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old."
On Friday, two charity groups, Aid for Refugees and L’Auberge des Migrants, said the number of people living in the Jungle camp had risen to 9,000, the highest level since the summer migrant influx.
The United Kingdom gets silver in the fight of the rugby-7 series, when the Fiji national team masterfully wins gold.
The Commission shall be assisted by the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed established by Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs (OJ L 139, 30.4.2004, p.
Fiji performed a masterclass in ball management, ball play with a leg, a supporting game and a brutal power play, winning gold - the first Olympic medal in its history.
The defeat brought a respectable consolation prize - a silver medal, which was the third medal of Great Britain that day. The British team can be proud of its success in the first Olympic rugby-7 tournament, in which they defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
It’s a great way to get to know each other better, and it’s a great way to get to know each other better.
But in any case, the Fiji national team is in its best shape at the moment to win the team of 15 men.
Although unlikely, some consolation for Britain could be the fact that at least one Briton won a gold medal. This is the head coach of the Fiji national team Ben Ryan - a former English coach from Wimbledon.
It was an exciting experience for the UK.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's leadership, they lost all the games in the rugby-7 series in Adelaide.
This time they lost only one game.
Defeat is painful, but growth is amazing.
This is the first time I’ve heard of this product.
It was like a clash between Captain Thomas Mitchell and his comrades with several opposing buses, and the World Series champions took the lead with a 5:0 when Osea Kolinisau got the first touchdown.
In the last four minutes, Jerry Tuwai also increased the lead even more, realizing the landing in the right wing.
It’s a great way to get to know each other better.
Mitchell's excellent technique of force did not allow the typical Leoni Nakarav to score three points, but it only had a slight effect on the result for Fiji.
It’s a great way to get to know each other better and to have a good time.
After the game, Nakarava further increased the lead and by the end was more than a minute left... at the end of the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou avoided some awkward British force and crossed the line to score points.
The landing gave a result of 29:0.
It seemed that Fiji was born to play rugby 7 matches, while the British were still studying.
In fact, it is true.
The British team made a major change in the halftime, breaking Fiji's line... full four minutes, which was good by the standards of the first half, until Joshua Tuisov, after a fantastic team play, scored a few more points for the Fiji team.
Dan Norton managed to score points for the British team, landing in the left corner and scoring 36:7, but the game was already lost, while fans of the South Sea islanders sang, waved flags and danced on the stands.
One cannot help but admire Fiji's cheerful attitude.
Mata made Fiji's victory even sweeter with another touchdown at the end of the game.
In the end whistle, Fiji could start to celebrate, but the British were able to sit on the grass after defeat.
In the first half of the day, Fiji defeated Japan with a score of 20:5, while the British were superior to South Africa, where in a very fierce fight both teams scored a touchdown and South Africans lost only a few points.
In the first half, Kyle Brown advanced to the lead of the team, and in the second half, Dan Norton crossed the line with brilliant mastery and delivered the ball between the poles, securing a victory for the British.
Markus Watson, who is the brother of English rugby player Antonis, was awarded a silver medal at the end of the game.
The coach's fight with cancer inspired Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to win the rowing competition.
It will be the most emotional gold medal in this race and it already says a lot.
From the first to the last stroke, the golden moment of Helena Glover and Heather Stanning played a special role at the Estacio da Lagoa circuit.
Although there are only two female athletes on the boat, they were accompanied by Robin Williams' echo, which inspired them to receive the second Olympic gold medal in pair rowing for women, becoming the first women in British sports history to achieve such success.
They undoubtedly dominated, because for the 39th time they won an unbeatable, unprecedented victory.
The two great athletes with swan elegance glide on the surface of the water, do not fully reflect this triumph.
Behind every gold medal in rowing there is a whole team that is working hard to ensure that athletes continuously improve their performance and the greatest contribution to their success has been given by a coach who did not know yet 30 months ago whether he will experience this day because he was diagnosed with cancer.
According to him, it disappeared as quickly as it appeared.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of those that can be operated on and it happened.
If not, it would spread throughout the body.
And the situation would become uncontrollable.
It changes your perspective a bit.
Williams was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
The trio were lucky enough that William was able to start the recovery procedure at the beginning of the 2014 mid-season and reduce the duration of the break to a minimum, so to speak.
I needed income, so I had to recover quickly.
This stimulated recovery.
I was in the hospital and I walked 6, 10 and even 15 meters long distances, although the doctor said that a few steps would be enough.
That's how it all began.
It is a challenge in itself, but this time it was even bigger.
After the victory, the first thought immediately came to Williams, who was very worried all morning and talked more than usual in excitement.
Staning, who has served in the Royal Artillery Unit in Afghanistan, said: "It was an emotionally difficult week, but it means a lot to me."
It just confirms how much it means to us and how much I, Helen and Robin have worked.
The last 3 years with Helen and Robin have been great.
Without Robin, we wouldn’t have achieved anything, so thank him very much, he is the best coach in the world.
I can't think of a better coach or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a single race in five years.
The couple reaches such a huge speed with which the rivals can not compete.
Even in the last 500 meters, when teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to get closer, the dominance of Staning and Glover was too great.
We felt every moment.
Helen shouted, "Keep the rhythm, keep the rhythm."
It is really important not to lose focus.
We made a good start, but at the same time we did not have high expectations.
On that day, we had no intention of breaking records, but just to row well and win the race, and that's what we did.
A couple of years will rest to decide what to do next.
Next month will be the wedding of Glover and TV adventurer Steve Bashal.
For now, she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say that this was my last race.
That would have been too much pressure.
It took me about six months in London to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
It was a new experience and I was very excited.
This time it took about four minutes.
She said, "The feeling is fantastic."

In Spain, the possibility of reducing the budget deficit is threatened by the failure to form a government.
A month ago, on 12 July, the European Commission (EC) said that Spain and Portugal had not taken sufficient measures to bring the deficit level down to the 3% of GDP required by the euro area.
It is estimated that, despite the austerity measures implemented, Portugal's budget deficit at the end of last year was 4.4% of GDP, while Spain's was 5.1%.
The European Commission, however, decided not to impose economic sanctions on the two countries, while at the same time setting fiscal targets for the near future.
One of the reasons why the European Commission did not impose sanctions against the two countries is growing euroscepticism in many EU countries.
Additional sanctions would only add to such a negative mood.
The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 25 to amend the Annexes to this Regulation in order to adapt them to technical progress and to adapt them to technical progress.
For example, the President of the German Bundesbank, Jens Weidmann, has pointed out that Europe is losing confidence in itself in this way, creating a perception among the citizens that the European Union's rules are recommendatory, not binding.
The Commission has now proposed, and all Member States have approved, an extension of the deadline for correcting the budget deficit until the end of this year for Portugal and until 2018 for Spain.
The European Commission promises to review the progress made by both countries in the coming months, while pointing out that both Spain and Portugal should be ready to introduce additional austerity measures if circumstances so require.
Initial forecasts indicate that Portugal could reach its target on time and that the budget deficit could fall to 2.5% of GDP already this year.
This means that, within the framework of the Stability Programme, the government of this country should implement austerity measures amounting to 0.25% of GDP this year.
These measures should be included in this year's budget, with an additional focus on controlling the costs of purchasing goods and services.
In the case of Spain, the situation is much more complicated.
The budget deficit should be reduced to 4.6% this year, to 3.1% next year and to 2.2% of GDP in 2018.
In addition, consolidation measures should amount to 0.5% of GDP annually in the next two years.
The fact that the Spanish political parties have been unable to agree on a government for eight months now makes it particularly difficult to achieve these objectives, and it is increasingly likely that Spain will have to hold early parliamentary elections for the third time in a year.
However, opinion polls show that the third election would not significantly change the political landscape in the country.
The most popular party is still the People's Party led by current Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, which would again win less than 33% of the vote.
Only socialists have slightly increased their popularity, while the popularity of anti-austerity parties Podemos or Together we can and Ciudadanos or Citizens has slightly decreased.
The People's Party wants to get the Socialists and Ciudadanos involved in the government as early as this month, otherwise it will not be able to adopt and submit the draft budget for 2017 to the European Commission for approval by mid-October.
If the government is not formed and parliamentary elections are held for the third time, Spain will become a laughing stock for the whole of Europe, as stated by Rafael Hernando of the People's Party parliamentary group.
The cleanliness of the beaches in the Gulf of Riga is critical.
In addition to the above, we may also collect information about you from other sources, such as your country of residence, your country of residence, or your country of residence.
The most polluted bathing sites are in Riga.
In the capital city council, it is explained that bathing places are cleaned up every day, but it is quite difficult to fight against dirty visitors.
In addition, the waste left on land during rainstorms can be flushed into the water, thus significantly impairing its quality.
Apart from Liep<0xC4><0x81>ja beach and some places in Kurzeme, the cleanliness of the beaches in other parts of Latvia is critical.
This week, volunteers from the "My Sea" campaign circulated such a message.
It’s a great way to get to know each other better and get to know each other better.
Unfortunately, this year, that critical assessment has come into play.
"We see that this will be the year the number of garbage on the beach 100 meters, perhaps even can exceed 200 units," says the representative of the expedition "My Sea" J<0xC4><0x81>nis Ulme.
It’s a great way to get to know each other better.
This year, among the remains of various household waste and picnics, activists had to collect even fluorescent lamps left lying in the sea sand.
It’s a great way to get to know each other better.
"The main source is the beach visitors themselves, because more than half of the total amount of waste is plastic, various waste, starting with bags, pieces of plastic that are already in the process of being decomposed, they can no longer be identified, and smokers, bottles, corks", says Ulme.
Among the dirtiest beaches there are also swimming spots in Riga.
For example, in Daugavgr<0xC4><0xAB>va, almost 800 waste units were collected every hundred meters on average, which is a critical amount.
The organizers of the campaign also explain that there are also cigarette butts tossed at almost every step and that warning or prohibition signs are not everywhere.
"The average figures for all three bathing sites in Riga together - Daugavgr<0xC4><0xAB>va, Vak<0xC4><0x81>bul<0xC4><0xBC>i and Vec<0xC4><0x81><0xC4><0xB7>i - unfortunately turn out to be high and far exceed the desired goal, which is to reduce the number of waste units to 135 by 2020.
It’s a great way to get to know each other better.
However, the fight against filthy visitors is quite difficult.
We return to the question of the culture of these people.
"Those who get used to mucking, drinking alcohol, smoking and doing all those things that should not be done, even special signs do not work," notes Viderkis.
This is the first time I’ve been to the hospital.
It is possible to call the police, confidently point out these violations and thus all fight.
Perhaps some new warnings can be imposed, but, as I said, this is unlikely to radically change the situation.
"As all together we just have to go and be intolerant of such violators," he says.
It’s a great way to get to know each other better.
This year, like other years, the quality of water is everywhere good and satisfactory.
The current situation is that all 56 bathing sites have had good water quality all the time and there are no restrictions on bathing.
"The last time we will take the analysis is at the end of August," says Normunds Kadi<0xC4><0xB7>is, the senior environmental health specialist at the Inspectorate.
During heavy rainfall, the waste left on land can be flushed into the water.
This, in turn, can affect its quality, according to an environmental specialist.
Rotations in the Russian elite continue - the change of the head of Putin's administration.
Did he leave office himself?
Vladimir Putin has told Russian media that Sergei Ivanov wanted to leave the post himself and will continue to be the president's special representative on nature conservation, ecology and transport.
In announcing the changes, Putin paid tribute to Ivanov in front of television cameras: "Dear Sergei Borisovich, we have been working with you for many years and we are doing it successfully."
I am satisfied with the way in which you are carrying out the duties assigned to you.
I well remember our agreement not to use you in this position of Head of the President's Administration for more than four years.
That is why I am sympathetic to your desire to change the scope of your activities.
And I hope that you will also make full use of your knowledge and experience in your new role.
However, it is noted that the leadership of the presidential administration is a very important position and this made Ivanov one of the most influential people in the country.
In the light of the upcoming State Duma elections in Russia next month, there have been rumors that this move is related to the struggle for power in Russia’s political elite.
Ivanov was also called a possible replacement for Putin in the post of president, so the assertion that he himself wanted to take up the post of president's representative on nature protection and transport matters raised doubts.
It’s a great way to get to know each other better.
Ivanov has been an ancient and close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He began his career in the special services in 1975, where he met Putin.
Later, when Putin became the head of the Federal Security Service, Ivanov became his deputy.
At the end of the reign of the first Russian President, Boris Yeltsin, he was appointed secretary of the Russian Security Council.
In 2000, after Putin came to power, Ivanov's "Information Security Doctrine" was approved, which included the revival of state censorship mechanisms in Russia.
In 2001, Sergei Ivanov became the Minister of Defence of Russia, and in 2005 - the Deputy Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov and was responsible for the development of Russian defence companies and arms exports.
Now, after the head of the presidential administration has left office, Ivanov will also retain a seat on Russia’s National Security Council, where the new head of the presidential administration, Vaino, will now work.
The blame comes from the family in the elite of the Soviet party.
It’s a great way to get to know each other better.
Antons Eduardovi<0xC4><0x8D>s and I have known each other for a long time.
From the time we were in government under your leadership.
And for the last five years or so, we've been communicating practically every day.
"Therefore, I am sure that after all the professional and personal qualities of the character, he is ready for this job," Ivanov said.
The blame comes from a family that belonged to the elite of the Soviet party.
His grandfather Karl has held high positions in the Estonian Communist Party, including being its first secretary for ten years until 1988.
The Internet edition Meduza, with reference to the book "Estonia's Self-Determination and Independence", writes that in the late 80s, Karl Vaino asked Moscow to allow the use of force against the participants of the demonstrations.
He was refused and soon lost his job.
Shortly afterward, Vaino moved to Moscow.
Anton Vaino has graduated from the Moscow Institute of International Relations and speaks Japanese.
However, he has left the diplomatic service to work in the administration of the President's Protocol.
The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 25 to amend the Annexes to this Regulation in order to adapt them to technical progress and to adapt them to technical progress.
According to political scientists, President Vladimir Putin is reorganizing the ruling elite ahead of the 2018 elections.
One of the main features - more and more representatives of power structures are taking up leadership positions.
The judo wrestler Nikiforenko also loses in the first battle of the Olympic Games.
This was a fight in the first round, and the Latvian judo wrestler has concluded his participation in the Olympic Games, finishing in 17th place.
It’s a great way to get to know each other better and to have a good time.
He also discovered that the judo wrestler suffered a shoulder injury in the fight.
It is significant that in order to get the Olympic road sign, Nikiforenko had to compete in a different weight category than usual - namely, in the weight category up to 100 kilograms.
The Azerbaijani wrestler was 25 kilograms heavier.
It is also important to note that in some cases, you may be able to get a loan at a lower interest rate than you would be able to afford.
It’s the only way to get to the top of the mountain.
Dreams disappear in the sand of Rio.
Thursday was opened by Judith Eugene Borodavko.
Yes, he had a more titled opponent, but the ambitious ones can sometimes surprise him.
He didn't.
Art<0xC5><0xAB>rs <0xC5><0x85>ikiforenko’s task was even more complicated, as the experience was smaller and the opponent was also respectable.
The result is similar, although he stayed on the tatami for almost a minute and a half longer than Borodavko.
Unfortunately, recently Latvian Judiths lack ambition the most.
The Commission shall be assisted by the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed established by Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety.
Jackevi<0xC4><0x87>, who advises Kazakh judists here, and Vsevolod Zelenyy do not see the heirs.
But if they don’t, they won’t either.
And that is the prerogative of the federation.
In the morning, the President of the Latvian Judo Federation promised to win medals in Rio.
Flight far from reality.
In the evening, we were looking forward to the beach volleyball match Samoilovs/<0xC5><0xA0>m<0xC4><0x93>di<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> - Evandru/Pedru Solbergs.
Intrigue as in the "death" group - the losers in the game is over.
The Latvian duo had a slight deviation - they could also lose, but by no more than four points in two sets.
The tension was increased by the prolonged previous game.
No one wanted to die - this feeling was felt over the windy court all the way through the match.
The wind blew up the players, creating additional difficulties.
At first it seemed that it could be an ally of ours - which is more comprehensive.
But it didn't.
It was quite easy to play against the Latvian duo here.
Serve just to Samoilov and wait for him to tear.
In the case of the United States, the United States, Canada, and the United States, the United States and the European Union have signed a treaty on the protection of the ozone layer.
It’s important to remember that you’re not the only one who’s been affected by this disease.

The third one was already in the sign of the Evandru serviu.
If you’re looking for a way to make money online, then you’ve come to the right place.
If there was a stranger Samoilov on the square against the Cubans, then this time he was more successful, and it would be unprofessional to pass the loss to Sasha.
It’s a great way to get to know each other better.
Losing the team.
This time there was a lack of luck - in the third set alone, two Evandru attacks almost flew out of the court, but the ball still hit the line.
Two of them were next to the line.
Also, the contentious episode of the video was decided in favor of opponents.
In the first two games, Evandru was tormented by servers, but they were very productive against ours.
It all comes down to the loss of the board.
Now calmly analyze the causes of failure.
Perhaps it was necessary for many to live next to the stadium, rather than with a delegation in the Olympic village.
Two and a half hours passed on the way.
This is the first time I’ve heard of this product.
Maybe Klagenfurt shouldn't have played, but it's quicker to come here and better to acclimatise.
Maybe there was a problem with finding the pinnacle of sporty form.
For now, there are more questions than answers.
The games for our beekeepers are over.
The dream of medals is over.
What's next?
It’s a great way to get to know each other better.
It’s a great way to get to know each other better.
But it is not necessary either.
When the dream of Olympic medals has collapsed, the idea of divorce may also arise, because the guilt will be sought not only in oneself, but also in a partner.
It is not difficult to decide, but it will be much more difficult to find a worthy partner in Latvia.
Both brothers play bee, but John and Tom have already tried and divorced, while Mikhail Samoilov is still too green to start conquering the tops of the world.
It is possible to try to return to M<0xC4><0x81>rti<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> P<0xC4><0xBC>avi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>, Haralds Regza, Aleksandrs Solovejs, Edgars To<0xC4><0x8D>s, but it will not be better than this option, which has proved itself in the World Cup stages more than once.
The sand of the copacabana did not smile at them this time.
And that's it.
Of course, one should also take into account the fact that beach volleyball is becoming more popular, new couples are entering the market, and only a few have a height of less than two meters.
This does not yet guarantee success, but is an important argument in the battle for victory.
Ours are not longer.
Both athletes and journalists have the opportunity to live in the places offered by the organizers of the games, as well as to choose their own.
The U.S. basketball team lives on a cruise ship, some tennis players do not stay in the Olympic village.
Also, some beach volleyball players have found a hotel in Copacabana.
This time, the prices offered to journalists for all the modest accommodations were greatly exaggerated.
Therefore, the choice fell on the rental of apartments.
There is a risk, because sometimes they can be inconvenient from a logistical point of view.
This time the risk is justified.
Together with Vladimir Vladimirovich we rent apartments on the border of Copacabana and Ipanema.
The beach is 200 meters away, the beach is half an hour walk away.
The area is safe enough, as far as favelas are concerned, but vigilance must not be lost here either.
Vladimir Vladimirovich is not something that some people immediately think about, but the most professional sports journalist in the Russian media Vladimir Ivanov.
P.S. On Friday morning, another dream of medals was dreamt out.
In the 100-meter barrier race and high jump Laura Ikauniece-Admidi<0xC5><0x86>a was behind her personal records.
There are five disciplines.
After a 10-year break, "Porgy and Besa" is played in Liep<0xC4><0x81>ja.
In Latvia, the opera "Porgy and Bess" premiered at the Latvian National Opera in 1973.
Since then, the internationally acclaimed masterpiece has not been performed again.
That is why the organizers of the C<0xC4><0x93>sis Art Festival and the Liepaja Art Forum in close cooperation have decided to give the audience the opportunity to enjoy George Gershwin’s masterpiece.
"We are very happy that after a ten-year break, when Liep<0xC4><0x81>ja was last able to enjoy an opera production, this excellent version of George Gershwin's opera "Porgy and Bess" can be enjoyed at the new, newly opened concert hall "Great Amber"," says Baiba Bo<0xC5><0xBE>e, the director of the concert hall "Great Amber".
The opera "Porgy and Bess" is a vivid musical story about love, its volatility, passion, as well as everyday tragedies and simple everyday pleasures.
It reflects African-American vitality, music and rhythm.
It is this lack of political correctness in this opera, this exclusion of tolerance that makes it so alive.
"And yes, this love story is extremely powerful, extremely beautiful and in some way really deep," says director Viesturs Kairi<0xC5><0xA1>s.
What I like the most - listening to or playing this opera, there are always such stops - famous melodies, famous motifs, but these transitions from one character to another, illuminating one character or another character, or a choir, or an orchestra.
"This is the most exciting, this building", the musical director and conductor of the opera "Porgy and Bess" Andris Poga evaluates the opera.
The visitors of the opera agree that this is a grand event.
They are delighted to hear this world-famous opera by Gershwin.
It is very important to know that you are not alone.
"Execution professional", the opera is appreciated by the visitor Edgars L<0xC4><0x81>ms.
The concert performance was special due to the fact that in the newly opened concert hall "Great Amber" for the first time the orchestra played in the orchestra pit and for the first time the opera concert performance took place.
The square next to the restored building of the Art Museum could be named after Janis Rozent<0xC4><0x81>ls.
The Vice-Mayor of Riga, Andris Ameriks, announced at the opening of the Rozent<0xC4><0x81>ls anniversary exhibition that the museum’s own address in the future might also be Jana Rozent<0xC4><0x81>la Square 1 instead of Kri<0xC5><0xA1>j<0xC4><0x81><0xC5><0x86>a Valdem<0xC4><0x81>ra Street 10a.
The Director of the museum M<0xC4><0x81>ra L<0xC4><0x81>ce admitted that re-registration of the address will create a considerable bureaucratic burden, however, in general, this idea is welcomed and therefore agreed with the proposal of the local government.
The city of Riga laid a kind of foundation stone for this idea in 1936, creating Burkards Dzenis monument to Janis Rozent<0xC4><0x81>ls standing by the museum.
Vilhelms Purv<0xC4><0xAB>tis, the director of the museum at the time, was one of the initiators of the creation of this monument.
In this way, this further action could be quite logical.
I'm a little bit upset with my conscience all the time - but Vilhelms Purv<0xC4><0xAB>tis, where are we going to put his name?!
"But if you, Mr. America, promise to think about it"... said L<0xC4><0x81>ce.
The building of the National Museum of Art, after extensive reconstruction and modernization, is said to have officially opened its doors in May this year.
This week the VEF Culture Palace will finally start to be reconstructed.
The castle will be renovated by SIA "Velve" for approximately EUR 11 million.
It is planned to renovate several premises of the castle, including two auditoriums, as well as to adapt the building for people with disabilities.
The Commission shall be assisted by the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed established by Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety.
"Despite the fact that the political will to start VEF Culture Palace repairs by attracting European structural funds is, we wait for months for a decision, real action from the Ministry of Finance officials, will be the money allocated or not," says Burovs.
Last December, we were told that everything depends on Brussels.
Two weeks ago, the Ministry of Finance received a letter from the European Commission asking you to decide for yourself that Brussels is not taking a decision here.
Now we see that another round of discussions is taking place, well, then we will see what we can expect in the coming days.
"I want to say that the Riga City Council undoubtedly guarantees that this process will be initiated and completed in time," Burovs points out.
It has been reported that more than a year ago, in March 2015, VEF Kult<0xC5><0xAB>ras pils collectively organised a farewell concert before the immediate renovation of the building.
Although a year has passed, the renovation of the building has still not started and the collective continued to work in inappropriate conditions.
In the strategy of the Riga City Council Property Department, the renovation of the VEF Culture Palace is divided into seemingly independent sets of reconstruction works, each of which will ensure the implementation of different functions of the palace.
First - increasing the accessibility of the VEF Culture Palace and improving the surrounding area.
It is planned to arrange the surrounding area and engineering communications, as well as to restore the facade of the building.
The second is the improvement of the VEF Culture Palace services.
It plans to restore the interior, walls and ceiling of the building, improve the stage and sound recording studio, as well as arrange the internal engineering communications of the building.
Third - Improvement of creative amateur collective working conditions, which includes plans to improve workshop equipment, space heating and ventilation systems.
Before the 40th anniversary of "L<0xC4><0xAB>vu" the legendary rock band can be seen at the exhibition in Liep<0xC4><0x81>ja.
The exhibition will feature various "L<0xC4><0xAB>vu" characterizing objects - photographs, which are arranged in a time line to reflect the group's activities from the beginning until 2010, when the end of the group's activities is announced.
In addition, participants will be shown stage costumes, musical instruments, awards and concert recordings, as well as other things that have never been seen before, which reflected the creative activity of the band "L<0xC4><0xAB>vi".
The exhibition will be supplemented with items from the collection of the Liep<0xC4><0x81>ja Museum.
The visual design of the exhibition has been created in collaboration with fashion artist and painter Elita Patmalniece.
The musicians associated with the band "L<0xC4><0xAB>vi" and their relatives also responded to the call and shared both objects and memories.
The origins of "L<0xC4><0xAB>vu" date back to 1972, when a vocal-instrumental ensemble was formed in the Liep<0xC4><0x81>ja Culture House, led by Juris Pav<0xC4><0xAB>tols.
The original composition of the ensemble took part in the festival "Liep<0xC4><0x81>jas dzintars" (Liep<0xC4><0x81>jas dzintars) in 1972 and 1974, as well as city and republic shows.
In 1976, a fateful meeting took place, when Juris Pav<0xC4><0xAB>tols met <0xC4><0x92>riks <0xC4><0xB6>i<0xC4><0xA3>elis and founded a group at the Palace of Culture, inviting Ingr<0xC4><0xAB>da G<0xC5><0xAB>tmane, Andris Kr<0xC5><0xAB>zi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> and J<0xC4><0x81>nis Groduma to join.
Over the years, the composition of the group has changed more than once.
Participants have joined, others have gone their own way, some have returned.
However, the most important thing - the desire to confirm that Latvian rock music is able to live and exist - has remained unchanged.
"What we saw was not lacking - jeans, hairy and bearded, these boys were markedly different from the generally accepted stereotype of the pop singer," says music reviewer Kl<0xC4><0x81>ss V<0xC4><0x81>vere.
In addition to the musicians mentioned above, the group has included such outstanding musicians as Igo, Vilnis Krievi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>, Modris <0xC5><0xA0>terns, Valdis <0xC5><0xA0>tarks, Laimis R<0xC4><0x81>cen<0xC4><0x81>js, T<0xC4><0x81>lis Pusbarnieks, Ainars Virga, Aivars Br<0xC4><0xAB>ze, Guntars Mucenieks, Dainis Virga, Tomass Kleins and many others.
Entrance to the exhibition is free of charge.
The exhibition is open from August 19 to October 30.

Zbig<0xC5><0x86>evs Stankevi<0xC4><0x8D>s: The time is coming and the truth is rising.
The archbishop of the Latvian Catholic Church, Metropolitan Zbig<0xC5><0x86>evs Stankevi<0xC4><0x8D>s, emphasizes in an interview with Nepriklaus<0xC4><0xAB>ga that if we want to gain strength for life, we must put the Gospel message at the centre of it.
For the power of truth is greater than the power of evil.
Many are already on their way to the feast of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Aglona.
What message will the faithful receive there this year?
In recent years, Pope Francis has expressed his desire to lead the main service in Aglona.
Therefore, the content of the main message is up to him.
The fact that Bishop J<0xC4><0x81>nis Bulis leads the Way of the Cross has also turned out to be a kind of tradition.
He will also create his own message.
I'm running a festive vigil service the day before.
Last year, I turned to Pope Francis' encyclical Laudato si and actualized the theme of the Earth in the context of Latvia.
This year, of course, I'm watching what's happening in the world, and I'm trying to respond to it in my speech.
My approach coincides with the Church’s recommendation that the Gospel message should be placed at the heart of life.
It must be shown that the Gospel responds to the most painful problems of human life and inspires him on the way forward.
Then it speaks to people.
But in C<0xC4><0x93>sis, in the Lamp discussion, you said that "you have to go back to understanding the full man."
What do you mean?
Does this mean that a person turns away from the message of the church?
And does the church have a resource for such a return today?

This year, the number of residents in Riga has dropped
In the beginning of this year, Riga had 638 784 residents, which is 0.34% less than in 2015, when 641,000 residents were officially registered in the capital, the Central Statistical Bureau (CSB) informed LETA.
In terms of population, the capital of Latvia ranks 30th among the capitals of the European Union (EU) countries and large cities with a population of more than one million.
According to the EU statistical office Eurostat, Riga has the highest proportion of women - the capital of Latvia is convincingly in the first place among the largest cities in Europe with 127 women per 100 men.
All three Baltic capitals have the highest proportion of women in Europe's largest cities: Vilnius has 123, while Tallinn has 121 women per 100 men.
Warning pictograms will be placed next to the LNMA.

During this summer season, the Riga City Council has installed two new playgrounds in the city, Kipsala and Ciekurkalns, which are already available for children.
<0xC4><0xB6><0xC4><0xAB>psala beach has a spacious, multifunctional toy ship with various climbing elements, bridges, games, tubs and slides.
The playground is designed for children of all ages.
The square is also equipped with swings and various balancing elements.
The world of fantasy for small sailors is enhanced by the location of the attraction on the bank of the Daugava with a view of the passenger port and the cruise ships visible there.
There is a playhouse, a trampoline, a run of steps, a balance bridge, swings, play balls and other game elements, as well as a gymnastics area with rings for strength and coordination training, parallel to other sports elements.
Under the area is laid a rubber cover in different colors.
A new, colourful pavement has been laid from the street to the playground.
The reconstructed section of the road has been opened in Medumi.
The Minister of Transport Uldis Augulis, the management of VAS Latvijas Valsts ce<0xC4><0xBC>i (LVC), as well as representatives of construction company Binders and local governments today opened the reconstructed section of the state main road Russian border (Greb<0xC5><0x86>eva) – Rezekne-Daugavpils-Lithuanian border (Medumi) (A13) from Medumi to the Lithuanian border (km 156,4-163,05).
Roads are the calling card of the state, especially border roads, so it is a special pleasure to discover a reconstructed section on the border with our southern neighbours.
This is another example of the fact that, thanks to the co-financing of European Union funds, the situation on the country's main roads is improving.
"According to forecasts, the funds available for roads in this planning period will be used already in 2018, and we have to think about how to continue maintaining the most busy roads in very good quality, and also to ensure the mobility of residents in all regions of Latvia without European Union funding," said Uldis Augulis, cutting the symbolic ribbon.
The Minister of Transport also indicated that the proposals prepared by traffic experts on sustainable financing of Latvian roads will be presented to the government in the near future.
The construction works in the section from Medumi to the Lithuanian border (km 156,4-163,05) were started by Binders last year and continued this year after the technological break.
The cost of reconstruction is 13.5 million euros (including VAT), the project was co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
"The reconstructed road section has been completely renovated and next year the repair works will be started in the next section from Medumi to Daugavpils, thus the whole road from the Lithuanian border to Daugavpils will be arranged," informed J<0xC4><0x81>nis Lange, Chairman of the Board of LVC.
The main roads of the country are the most busy, and by 2018 we plan to ensure that all the main roads of the country are in good condition.
The next task will be to maintain them in good quality by ensuring periodic maintenance in a timely manner and to replace the top layer of asphalt every 7-9 years.
"This, of course, will require adequate funding, and all travelers look forward to the proposals developed by the expert group for the arrangement of the road financing system," Lange noted.
Within the framework of the project, road connections and lighting were arranged in Medumi Centre.
Significant earthworks have been carried out: large-scale dewatering and extensive excavation and embankment works have been carried out in four stages, the longitudinal profile of the road has been levelled, which until now was very uneven.
The public transport stops have also been restored and a turnaround area for public transport has been built.
Previously, the road had insufficient load bearing capacity and the terrain was not visible due to the mountainous valleys, as well as the old road common terrain.
In the next construction season it is planned to restore the road section from Daugavpils city border to the now reconstructed section (144,80-156,40 km).
This year, LVC plans to carry out various types of works in more than 1,100 kilometres of national roads.

"In order to achieve the desired weight loss results, the right choice of food combinations is very important", admits Lithuanian nutritionist Laura Romeraite-Kuklieriene.
In addition, it is easy to do in the summer period, when fresh fruits, berries and vegetables grow in our own gardens.
A well-considered combination of dietary products can help not only to reduce excess weight, but also to purposefully promote various processes in the body.
Pasta and vinegar are a successful combination, as they provide a long-lasting feeling of satiety and help fight fat.
Studies published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition have shown that vinegar has a beneficial effect on blood glucose levels and helps us feel more alert.
Cayenne pepper and protein-rich foods such as poultry or protein shakes not only create a feeling of satiety, but also reduce the craving for large meals at subsequent meals.
Such a combination of dishes is also able to increase the amount of calories burned after a meal by up to 35%.
Studies show that cayenne pepper can help get rid of fat deposits in the abdomen.
Eggs contain a metabolism-promoting nutrient - choline, while paprika is a good source of vitamin C.
By taking in sufficient amounts of these nutrients, cortisol levels can be reduced, which can lead to a build-up of fat around the middle of the body.
Oatmeal porridge, to which fresh berries are added, is another delicious and fat-burning meal for breakfast, which is worth including in your menu.
Oatmeal and berries contain fiber, which, according to the findings of Canadian scientists, controls grelin - an appetite-stimulating hormone - and thus also a feeling of hunger.
In addition, the berries contain polyphenols, which are helpers in weight loss, and also prevent the formation of fat.
Vegetables and proteins are also able to do wonders in weight loss.
Such a combination is able to create a feeling of satiety.
Vegetables contain water and fiber, so they contribute to a feeling of satiety.
At the same time, proteins slow down the digestive process and provide a feeling of satiety for a longer time.
For lunch, you can eat chicken with salad or make a protein cocktail from the finished mixture and enjoy it together with your favorite vegetables.
What product combinations to avoid.
The fruit contains sugars - monosaccharides or disaccharides - compounds of one or two molecules.
In contrast, the starch contained in vegetables is polysaccharide.
Fruits decompose in the stomach mechanically, while chemically they do not decompose until they reach the third or fourth degree of digestion, which occurs in the intestines.
Starch divides into three different stages, which begin already in the mouth.
Therefore, it is important not to eat sweet food immediately after a meal.
When eating sweet food immediately after a meal, it is "entrapped" in the stomach along with other dishes, where it is not chemically digested and begins to rot.
Do not eat bread, potatoes, peas, bananas, dates or other carbohydrate-containing products along with lemons, limes, oranges, grapefruits, pineapples or other acidic fruits.
The enzyme ptyalin, which is present in saliva, acts only in an alkaline environment.
Fruit acids inhibit not only the digestion of carbohydrates, but also contribute to their fermentation.
Do not eat eggs and meat, nuts and meats, cheese and eggs or cheese and nuts, meat and milk, eggs and milk or nuts and similar combinations of protein-rich products in one meal.
Their processing requires different digestive juices, each of them with different strength, features and the time when to reach the stomach.
Watermelon, honeymelon, nutmeg and other melons should always be eaten separately from other dishes.
Melons are not digested if they are in the stomach along with other foods.
Fat in combination with protein-rich products.
Fat forms a successful combination with starch, but the same can not be said about fat and protein - fat inhibits protein digestion.
Proteins can be combined with a very small amount of fat.
If large amounts of protein products are consumed, avoid consumption of fat altogether.
This also applies to raw - it is not recommended to combine a large amount of nuts (containing protein) with a whole avocado (containing fat).
Such a combination hinders effective weight reduction.
How better to cook?
“Food preparation, heat treatment, leads to a significant loss of nutrients - about 15% to 55% of the original nutrient composition of the products,” says the nutritionist.
In most cases, nutrients go to waste by boiling foods in water.
However, the nutritional value of some foods increases directly by boiling.
It is recommended to use the remaining liquid after cooking the vegetables for the preparation of the soup - in this case you will not lose the nutrients left in the water and can eat them later.
Vegetables are also recommended to be cooked by steaming.
Heat treatment significantly increases the bioavailability of the lycopene contained in tomatoes.
Boiling tomatoes for 30 minutes, the amount of lycopene increases by 25%.
Heat treatment also significantly increases the bioavailability of betacarotene found in red, yellow, orange plants such as tomatoes, carrots, sweet potatoes and spinach.
Heat treatment of eggs and meat deprives the natural properties of the proteins contained in them, making them more easily digestible.
Heat treatment of meat and eggs also makes iron and other minerals contained in these products more easily absorbed by the body.
It should also be borne in mind that freezing products can reduce the amount of vitamin C from 10% to up to 90%, but fiber freezing does not affect.
Beans in combination with tomatoes can increase the intake of iron in the body, which in turn provides better brain and muscle function.
Our body absorbs up to 33% less of the non-blood-producing iron found in plant products such as beans, leafy greens, cereals, than the blood-producing iron found in animal products such as beef, fish and chicken.
You can significantly increase the absorption of non-blood-producing iron by eating non-blood-producing iron-containing foods along with sources of vitamin C, such as oranges, tomatoes and berries.
Vitamin C helps to change the non-blood-producing iron so that it is more easily absorbed by our body.
Iron is needed for the production of hemoglobin, which provides oxygen to the muscles and brain.
To get the most out of the salad, add healthy fats, such as olive or linseed oil, to them.
When making sandwiches with salmon, add vitamin D-rich salmon or sardines to the unsweetened yogurt, which is a good source of calcium.
Vitamin D increases the amount of calcium absorbed in the intestine and plays an important role in bone formation.
Oats (as well as other whole grain products) along with sources of vitamin C, such as strawberries, black currants, raspberries and other fruits or berries, help to stabilize cholesterol levels, as well as to avoid arterial blockages.
Snapchat's Anime Effect Criticizes Asian Caricature
Snapchat representatives say that this filter is inspired by animation, but some commentators say that it is racially unresponsive.
With this lens effect, Snapchat allows 150 million users to change reality and play with their identities in a rather absurd way on a daily basis.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or an image that would fit in Roy Lichstenstein’s painting.
Lenses are hazy, image-distorting instruments that generate more than 30 million converted selfies a day.
Any mistake quickly becomes visible to the public.
Snapchat lens effects have been criticized in the past for promoting too black or light skin tones as a benchmark for perfect beauty.
This week, new lens effects were published that allow users to make crooked eyes, crooked teeth and round cheeks, and some critics called it a racist Asian caricature – the “yellow face”.
The question was also asked whether such contradictions indicate that the company has greater problems with diversity.
News and public negativity broke out on Wednesday when The Verge and Motherboard reported that the effects of the lenses had been removed from the app.
The company explained that the objective of the lens is to portray Anime characters rather than caricature people of Asian descent.
However, for people who have experienced racism, these effects were reminiscent of painful stereotypes.
Others categorically denied the similarity with Anime.
Korean-American art student Grace Sparapani's Twitter post about the images gained wide resonance. In an email, she states that the effects of the lens are "offensive and uncomfortable, to say the least".
She added that it is difficult not to notice the obvious similarity between Asian cartoons and lens effects.
This suggests that the effect of the lens is not just a yellow face, but a yellow face in the sense of racism.
Snapchat is not the only company that has fallen into this cultural trap.
American culture is also engaged in a never-ending battle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood and the gadgets we use every day.
And Snapchat's large audience of young people, representing different races, unlike the older population, is more sensitive to such things.
If Snapchat lenses create an image that offends users, then "such things do not go unnoticed today," 25-year-old Katie Joo said in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, the product manager of Medium, Jou, deleted her Snapchat app and advised others to do the same.
In her Medium and telephone interviews, she explained that, in her view, the problems with race stem from Snapchat's employment policy, which does not sufficiently support racial diversity.
Jou criticised the company’s leadership, which is largely composed of white men, and then concluded his article with a reference to #DeleteSnapchat.
"This means that there is no racial diversity in the company, so such decisions are allowed. Whether the company employs some representatives of other races, but they do not hold a position that allows them to express their opinion safely and comfortably," says American woman of Chinese origin Jou.
Her opinion is shared by others, while Snapchat has not responded to her complaint.
The company does not disclose how many employees are of different races, indicating that it is a private company.
Snapchat declined to discuss the origins of its employees, but its spokesperson revealed that the company has hired a HR specialist who will focus on also representing racial minorities who are not well represented and will promote inclusion.
Jou, on the other hand, won’t update her Snapchat account, adding: “It’s interesting whether they really need more users like us to understand that it’s wrong.”
The House of Congress says military officials have misrepresented reports about the Islamic State.
In a statement released on Thursday, the congressional chamber said the U.S. Central Command had misrepresented reports depicting the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria more optimistic than it actually is.
Analysts of the Central Command Intelligence Service have expressed general dissatisfaction with the interim report of the task force set up by the Armed Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee, and the Republican Subcommittee on Defense Financing, indicating that their leadership controlled reports of American success in the fight against the Islamic State.
The Central Command, also known as Centcom, is a military base in Tampa, Florida that oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The latest news on the report says that the intelligence reports, which were approved by high-ranking Centcom executives, reflect the U.S. fight against terrorism in a more positive way than it actually is. The facts were regularly distorted, depicting better achievements than other intelligence analysis shows.
Ken Calvert, a Republican from California, said: "Centcom's behaviour is unacceptable - it is our soldiers who suffer when our policy-makers get false reports."
Centcom management mistakes can be found in the organisation’s top management.
This 10-page report details existing problems in Central Command coverage and analysis of American efforts to prepare Iraqi forces for 2014 and 2015.
While this does not provide conclusive evidence that the Obama administration's senior officials have distorted the reports, it does show that Centcom's management has put some pressure on analysts to portray a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the Islamic State (also known as ISIS or ISIL).
The report notes that in the first half of 2015, the Central Management’s press releases, statements, and reports to Congress put the situation in a much more positive light than it actually was.
For example, representatives of Centcom publicly announced that the Mosul recovery operation could start already in April or May 2015.
Mosul is the second largest city in Iraq, still under the control of the Islamic State.
Republican Kansas Party spokesman Mike Pompeo said in a statement: "This is clear evidence from several months of investigation."
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, U.S. Central Administration senior officials rigged the reports, depicting ISIS threats in Iraq weaker than they actually were.
The Republican Party set up a task force after it learned that analysts were concerned that information about the Islamic State was being distorted.
As the investigation continues, the report published on Thursday will be followed by new findings on the case.
The General Inspectorate of the Ministry of Defence is conducting an investigation into Centcom's intelligence activities.
The Democratic Party members of the intelligence management committee released their own report on Thursday, in which they agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republican Party's working group.
Democrat Adam B. Schiff said in his report that Centcom overly limited the production of intelligence assessment reports in relation to ISIS and the Iraqi Security Forces between 2014 and 2015.
Mr. Schiff explains that this process "suspended the dissemination of information", worsened the analysts' work ethic and "distributed facts that were not true."
But Shif and Democratic Party members added that there is no evidence that the White House has put pressure on Centcom analysts to produce reports in line with “a predetermined or political stance.”
The Daily Beast published the preliminary results of the congressional investigation on Thursday.
In August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon's inspector general had launched an investigation into complaints by Centcom analysts.
Pentagon spokesman Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans said the Pentagon would not comment on the congressional report while the investigation continues.
He also noted that experts sometimes interpret complex data in different ways, and the Ministry of Defence and the intelligence service invite constructive dialogue on vital national security issues.
The investigation is not limited to the question of whether the American-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is a success (a statement made by an increasing number of representatives of the Ministry of Defence).
But last year's indictments cast doubt on whether President Obama can fully rely on the Central Administration's reports on military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and other hot spots.
Criticism of Islamic State intelligence is reminiscent of events more than a decade ago, when CENTCOM intelligence analyst Gregory Hucker published a study claiming that the George W. Bush administration launched the Afghan war with too little thought about its possible consequences.
Hoeker also played a significant role in the discovery of the Islamic State's intelligence issue.
Last year, official representatives reported that the Hoeker team discovered that, contrary to public reports, air strikes on Islamic State oil plants had not significantly worsened the financial situation of the terrorist group, because they had built temporary factories to sell oil on the black market.
The Times reported in a September edition that this discovery did not come outside the walls of the Central Administration.
General Lloyd Austin III, the commander of the Centcom at the time, received sharp criticism, as many law-makers felt that the war reports described the situation too positively.
In April, General Austin retired and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel.

Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals and the match will only determine which team will take first place in the group of six teams and which will take second place.
The first place winner will avoid meeting the strong Dutch national team, which is the leader of the second group, for a little longer.
In addition, it is important to note that the use of this product is not recommended for children under the age of 2 years.
Bama was also on the team.
She grew up in Blubel, took a field hockey stick in her arms for the first time at the age of 3 (her older twin sisters were already engaged in this sport in Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16 years old, becoming the youngest player in the history of the team.
She didn't make it to the 2008 Olympics because she didn't make it to the final.
However, 2012 was a bad year for her and her team.
The following year, Englishman Craig Parham was appointed coach of the team, and everything changed for the better.
Bama called it "cultural, mental and physical changes."
In London, we did not put in as much work as we do now.
We have changed everything.
In a game on Thursday, Bama revealed the result, scoring in the first half with a back-to-back shot from a close distance.
India started the game without a win in their account, but their team was very fierce and kept a minimum score of 0:1 until the end of the third period, when Bama again scored.
She put the ball into the opponent's zone on the left side of the field, then managed to get to the middle of the field and shoot the ball into the opponent's goal, placing the American 2:0 lead.
In the middle of the fourth period, Melissa Gonzalez scored another goal.
This was the first U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs' dry game, with one goal in each of the first three games.
She's got a run.
And so is Bama.
“We are doing very well right now,” Pahams said, but how well the game will show on Saturday.
The most depressing food of the period of depression is "A hearty meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his election as president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down in an oval room to have a meal.
President Roosevelt enjoyed fine culinary delicacies such as goose liver pate or foie gras and Maryland tortoise soup.
But that day his meal was much more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes, and in the dessert - plum pudding.
Jane Ziegelmann says: "This is a way to show solidarity in cooking with people who have been very hard on."
Her husband, Andrew Kou, added: “It’s also a message to Americans about how they should eat.”
A couple from Brooklyn Heights are food historians.
Kou’s last book, “Vegetable Stew,” describes Chinese cuisine in America, while Ziegelmann’s book, “97 Apple Trees,” describes life through food in a rental house in the lower east of Manhattan.
Their new joint work, "A Rich Meal," to be published Tuesday by Harper, is the story of American food during the Great Depression.
Showing some solidarity in cooking, they ate a meal together at the reporter "Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop", a simple diner located in the Flatiron district and operating since 1929, when the Great Depression began.
Mrs Ziegelmane, 54, ordered a sandwich with melted cheese and chopped olives, while the 57-year-old Kou ordered turkey, mashed potatoes and vegetable salad.
When a reporter ordered a fake bunny, the couple admitted that his choice was very appropriate for a conversation about the food of the time of the Great Depression.
Mrs. Ziegelmane said that the fake bunny was very popular.
There was a peanut hare, a liver hare, and a bean hare.
They were made from basic ingredients and other ingredients that enriched the meal.
Imagine what it's like to eat as many peanuts as you want for lunch.
Mr. Kou waved.
"It must have seemed like the stomach was full of lead," he added.
During the pre-depression years, the American dining table resembled a buffet, especially in rural areas.
Women cooked for their husbands-workers, and for breakfast, lunch and dinner, freshly prepared casseroles were served.
During the First World War, it was the Americans who sent food to the Europeans. "A hearty meal" describes how the Americans adapted to the conditions when America suddenly ceased to be a land of abundance.
“At that time, food became the American people’s main daily focus,” explains Mr. Kou, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about the subject.
New budget diets became equally important: unknown dishes such as the fake hare and stews became everyday, stews were "a great way to use leftovers," noted Mrs Ziegelmane, as chefs could hide the unattractive ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruits were replaced by cheap dried fruits.
Meat, which for years was the main ingredient of American dishes, now became an extremely rare luxury item.
At a time when calorie count and nutritional value of food were more important than taste, new, yet unseen formations were born.
In an ancient cookbook, Mrs. Ziegelmane found a recipe for making onions stuffed with peanut butter.
Mr. Kou adds: "It was not a popular addition to the dining table."
Mrs. Ziegelmane emphasizes: "It was surreal."
Peanut butter and fried onion are not compatible.
Many recipes of home dishes adapted to the difficult times.
Household economists such as Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Office for the Economics of Households from 1923 to 1943, determined eating habits that had never been experienced before or after the Great Depression.
By publishing articles and recipes in newspapers and magazines, they advised housewives to become "economists" and accept challenges such as turning pasta and carrot mix into a tasty meal.
"Enriched Meal" is a feast of historical delicacies.
Especially interesting is the evidence of the attitude of the government towards its hungry citizens, for example, the attitude of President Herbert Hoover "let me eat cake".
Although he spoke publicly about his simple childhood and dining in Iowa, he actually ate like the fine millionaire he had become.
Mr Kou says: "He liked European cuisine, like a fish with cucumber sauce."
He ate in an almost gilded living room, wearing a lunch jacket.
He was completely detached from reality.
President Roosevelt would have made the same mistake had it not been for his wife, Eleanor, to advise him to set an example by his eating habits.
According to the book, Roosevelt hired a housemaid who could not cook, so the White House became the place "not only to serve one of the most delicious dishes in Washington, D.C., but also the worst-cooked dishes."
As soon as the country's economy recovered, most of the culinary signature of the depression era disappeared.
But we continue to pay attention to calories and nutritional value, as well as how to apply science in cooking, added Mrs Ziegelmane.
The couple says that by writing the book, they gained a greater understanding of Mrs. Ziegelmane’s mother’s eating habits, for example, why she was unable to throw out food.
"She was really afraid to throw food out," said Mr. Kou.
Mrs. Ziegelmane said, "She was in fact bullying people."
Once there was an incident with wind cakes.
After we ate in Eisenberg’s dining room, a couple of writers pulled a homemade dessert out of the bag—a plum pudding that President Roosevelt used to eat for lunch.
"It's plum whipped cream," said Mrs. Ziegelmane, adding that at that time it was a common habit to give a chic name to modest dishes.
It does not contain whipped cream, only prunes, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone impatiently dipped the spoons into the brown mass on the plates.
Surprisingly, it wasn't so bad.
Mr. Kou ate a few more bites.
Sounding like an experienced "economist", he said to his wife: "A pinch of ground hazelnut would fit."
Gilead will receive a refund for legal expenses in the fight with Merck for a patent for Hepatitis C
The district judge has ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to the reimbursement of lawyers' fees it paid in the case of the termination of the patent for Hepatitis C against pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was acquitted of a <0xC2><0xA3>200 million fine for breaking two Merck patents that threatened it in connection with the successful Sovaldi and Harvoni tablets when a US federal judge found irregularities in Merk’s activities, such as lying after swearing in and other unethical acts.
During the trial on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Bett Labson Freeman indicated that Gilead has the right to claim compensation for legal costs incurred in defending the case.
Merck is trying to gain a position in the market against Gilead, which dominates the market with a new generation of Hepatitis C drugs that are effective in 90% of cases of liver disease.
The case was initiated already in 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other in an attempt to acquire ownership of the newly developed active ingredient sofosbuvir, which is the main ingredient of Gilead's medicines.
The U.S.-backed forces claim to have taken full control of the city of Manbij from the Islamic State.
The U.S.-backed forces have completely taken control of the northern city of Manbij, near the Turkish border, and the last Islamic State troops have left the city, a spokesman for the group said Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) is currently clearing the city of the last enemy fighters who have not yet left the city.
They have freed more than 2,000 hostages-civilians captured by the militants, Charfan Darvish of the SDS allied military council of Manbij told Reuters.
"The city is now under our full control and we are conducting a search for militants," he told Reuters.
Clinton’s income reached $10.75 million in 2015 and the couple paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
Hillary Clinton released a 2015 tax return on Friday showing that the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband had earned $10.75 million that year and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
During 2015, Clinton has donated $1 million, mostly to his Clinton charity. Former President Bill Clinton earned about $5.3 million, performing as a speaker and former Secretary of State earned $3 million in income from his book about working for the State Department, published in collaboration with Simon & Schuster.
Clinton's ally, Virginia State Senator Tim Keynes and his wife, Anna Holton, have released their tax returns for the past 10 years.
In 2015, they paid a federal tax rate of 20.3 percent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kane continue to set new standards for financial transparency," Clinton campaign partner Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
If you’re not sure what to do, ask your doctor for a list of the best ways to get rid of it.
The publication of paid tax information is a record practice for US presidential candidates, but it is not required by law.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers cite a State Revenue Service audit as a reason not to disclose tax information.
"Your move," Clinton's campaign partner Ian Sam said in a Twitter post about the Democratic candidate's tax information.
On Thursday, Trump’s special advisor Michael Cohen told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release tax information until audits were completed.
Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mit Romney and other Republicans, say his refusal raises questions about his true wealth, donations and other business commitments, including his ties to Russia.
Clinton poured oil into the fire, releasing a video on Friday in which several influential Republicans are demanding Trump release his tax information.
She returned to the matter again during an economic speech on Thursday in Michigan.
She told the crowd: "He refuses to do what other presidential candidates have been doing for decades."
"Politico" reports that Trump paid very little or no tax for two years in the 1990s, and the New York Times business columnist said on Friday that many accountants and lawyers believe that today, too, nothing has changed.
Federal tax rates are a key issue in this presidential election.
Clinton, in support of billionaire Warren Buffett’s proposal, promotes the idea that anyone earning more than $1 million a year should pay at least 30% tax.
This proposal is also supported by President Barack Obama.
Last week, while Clinton was speaking in Omaha, Nebraska, where his Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is located, Buffett called on Trump to exchange his tax returns.
Buffett said he too was being audited by the Revenue Service, and that Trump was afraid of the electorate, not the tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign has published tax information until 2007.
The Clintons now live in Chapaqua, New York, and have paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 percent and a total tax rate of about 40.5 percent between 2007 and 2014.
Clinton’s 2015 tax report shows that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income is a salary.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund, from which the Clintons received $109,000 in dividends.

Jewish film director criticizes hotel in Berlin for disabling Israeli long-distance code at Arab request - RT News
A French-Jewish film director has launched a social media storm after discovering that Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin does not have an Israeli long-distance code.
Claude Lanzmann, director of Shoah, a documentary about the Holocaust, did not hide his dissatisfaction with the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin and addressed an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his recent visit, Lancman tried to find the Israeli long-distance code on the hotel's proposed list.
However, the country was not included in the list of countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of new Germany, Israel was wiped out and destroyed?
Written by Lancman.
Instead, the Kempinski Bristol Hotel offers to call to this country through its call center.
The director asked for an explanation from the hotel staff.
Lancman writes that the answer he received "shocked him."
The hotel administrator explained that "this is a conscious decision by the hotel management".
The reason for the removal of the code made the film director even more angry.
“Most of the guests are Arabs and they demanded the deletion of the Israeli code,” Lancman quoted an employee of the hotel.
Suddeutsche Zeitung said Israel's ambassador to Germany, Yakov Haddad-Handelsman, had described the incident as a "great shame".
We are surprised and shocked by this incident.
That in itself is a great shame.
And the fact that this has happened in Germany is even more humiliating in this hotel chain.
Explanatory notes are not required.
The official said: "We hope that the hotel will draw the right conclusions."
This event also had a fairly wide resonance on the Internet, where people called it a scandal.
Others believe that Kempinski simply indulged the Arab customers.
Another recording read "shame" and said that the hotel is located on Kurfurstendamm Street next to the synagogue.
Der Spiegel reports that the hotel itself quickly rejected all accusations, saying it was a "misunderstanding" and apologized to Lantzmann.
"We have not received a direct order to remove Israel from the list of country numbers," the Suddeutsche Zeitung quoted Kempinski as saying.
The code was added to the list again.
Police use rubber bullets and tear gas against protesting Brazilian students.
A clash between students and police took place on Thursday in S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo, Brazil, where students gathered in a demonstration against government education reforms.
The police used rubber bullets and tear gas against the students.
The problems began when the ombudsmen tried to expel the students, as a result of which the police used rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to show their reluctance to reform the education system.
The proposal of the Governor of S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo, Geraldo Alckmina, envisages the closure of almost 100 public schools, while 300 000 students will be relocated to other schools in order to save money.
Some demonstrators drew graffiti on the walls with messages against interim President Michael Temer.
The protest came just days after the previous protest, when students demonstrated in support of suspended president Dilma Rousseff, whose impeachment was voted in by the Senate.
Scott Kelum Skinner finishes first, bringing UK gold medal in cycling
Kelum Skinner from Scotland finished the first men's cycling team sprint race at the Rio Velodrome held last night. The British team guarded its championship title, which it won at the 2012 London Games.
The 23-year-old athlete from Glasgow played an important role in this race, making proud the legendary Scottish Sir Chris Hoy and bringing victory to favorites New Zealand.
Four years ago, Britain won an amazing victory when Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they did it again at the World Championships in London, even though Hoy had already finished his athletic career.
The problems were in the period between the Beijing and London Olympics, as they had to replace the experienced start specialist Jamie Staph.
They succeeded at the last minute.
When Hoy left, his place was filled by Cian Emadi and Matt Krampton.
The British coaches put their hopes on Skinner, seeing the potential in him, which he later proved.
In addition, it is important to note that the use of the drug in the treatment of trichomoniasis is not recommended for children under the age of three years.
However, the British trio won gold medals.
The Hindus were close-minded in their circle, Kenny took the lead, and Skinner protected the lead.
The change of strategy played an important role in the victory, as Hindes drove a higher gear to allow Kenny, and especially Skinner, to drive faster.
Hoy watched the race as a BBC representative and caught the eye of Skinner, Kenya and Hindes as they climbed onto the podium.
The 23-year-old Glasgower said, "It was an indescribable honour."
I do everything to defend my name.
In the final, we set an Olympic record and beat the World Champions.
It was just incredible.
There is no better victory.
After winning the race with Kenya and Hoya at the 2012 Olympics in London, Hinds admitted that he had deliberately fallen to the track after the unsuccessful start.
He later rebutted the comment, and the British rivals were unable to prove otherwise.
There were no such incidents this time.
Hindes said: "British flags on the stands were reminiscent of London."
In the last 3 months, we have become a united team.
We have lost so many World Championships, so the victory at the Olympic Games was really special.
One medal will go to the country that won seven of the ten gold medals in cycling in Beijing and London.
If this achievement is an indicator of the progress of the team in the last five months, then the next five days will be very exciting.
Given the Kenyan result, he could really repeat Hoy's success by winning three Olympic gold medals.
For Kenny, this would mean six golds and one silver medal. In addition, Kenny was also born on March 23 (it looks like this is the date of the British saint, because on this day, Steve Regreve, Mo Farah and Roger Banister were also born).
On this date, Hoy was also born.
Kenya's next race is a sprint that starts today and will continue for the next three days.
The 28-year-old athlete from Bolton said, "At the moment, I just enjoy it all.
A team trip is always the best.
Because then you can win together with your teammates.
To be honest, winning one is a little lonely."
Hindes said, "If he gets two more gold medals, he should be appointed knightly."
It was the only medal fight that day, but it wasn't the only good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Vigin, Ed Clancy, Steve Burke, and Owen Dowl showed the fastest qualifying time for the four-kilometer pursuit.
Their time was 3:51,943
The world record set in London in 2012 is 3:51,659.
The first round and the final will take place today in the second half of the day, where Vigin will definitely be the center of attention.
Yesterday, before the qualifying trip, he had a disagreement with the commissariat when the judges called him to measure his height.
In the Women’s Ride, which will continue and end today, Laura Trott, Joanna Rovsel Shanda, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald from Milngavia set a new record time of 4:13,260.
The British delegation hopes that the British cycling team will win medals in the middle of the Olympic Games.
Remembering the excellent and unprecedented performance in Beijing and London, everyone expects the same achievements in Rio.
The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 25 to amend the Annexes to this Regulation in order to adapt them to technical progress and to adapt them to technical progress.
However, when the first cycling race starts, it seems that the UK will reach the highest level at the right time.
The future of the Portland smelter is becoming uncertain due to the termination of an ambitious contract.
The future of the aluminum smelter and hundreds of its employees in Portland, Victoria has become uncertain as its main customer, the energy company, has announced the termination of cooperation.
This announcement builds on the government's plans to end the subsidising of the energy company, which is vital to the company's continued operation.
The 20-year subsidies will end in November.
As a result, more than 2000 jobs at the Alcoa Portland plant are at risk.
Up to 2000 direct and indirect jobs could be at risk.
In addition, it will also have unpredictable side-effects, as the smelter consumes about 10 per cent of Victoria’s total electricity supply.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the "Point Henry" smelter, which led to the interruption of the operation of the Anglesea power plant.
Alkoas Portland Smelter is operating at a loss and may be closed.
These events were triggered by years of speculation about the rising value of the Australian dollar and the cost of factory production.
AGL, the plant’s energy supplier, which supplies power from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latroube Valley, says the other three owners are likely to terminate their contracts as well.
Most of the power plant is owned by "Alcoa" and "Alumia" joint venture, in addition to the company's shares also belongs to Chinese "CITIC" and Japanese "Marubeni Corp" holding companies.
AGL expects the Portland plant to continue operations, which would mean further energy supplies for the smelter," the company said in a statement.
AGL said the contracts were so-called "risk-limiting contracts" and were expected to come into effect in November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month validity period and will therefore remain in force until 2017.
AGL plans to receive revenue from these contracts also in fiscal year 2017,” the company’s spokesman said.
Starting from the fiscal year 2018, the potential profit effect is limited by favourable market forecasts for future wholesale electricity prices.
AGL says it has already calculated a loss of $187 million in its forecast, with these contracts expected to be terminated.
Alcoa says the decision to terminate the contracts will not affect Alcoa’s ability to continue the smelter’s operations or to supply it with energy.
The U.S. company says it signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, but will end it in November, without giving any explanation for why it will end its cooperation.
Analysts have expressed concern about both the possible closure of the Portland smelter in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle, due to the industry's weak economy.
AGL CEO Steven Mikelson said last week that analysts estimate Portland uses 600 megawatts and Tomago 900 megawatts of energy per year.
If these two plants were to leave the energy market, energy demand would fall significantly.
And that wouldn't be good at all.
The Community legal centre rejects 160 000 people every year.
Every year, more than 160 000 people are turned down, and a budget cut could worsen the situation.
Three out of five people in Queensland - mostly pensioners, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those who do not have the means to fight illegal eviction - are refused free legal assistance and representation.
The Community's legal centre, which has already been overburdened, warns that a reduction in funding will only make things worse.
Already from June of next year, these legal centres will receive 30% less funding than before.
James Farell, director of the Queensland Law Center, said the latest report from the National Association of Law Centers said legal aid was being denied to thousands of people in need.
Mr Farell pointed out that if this decision is not reversed, then the situation will only get worse.
He also says: "The Queensland Legal Center is consistently underfunded, which means that thousands of people in need are denied help."
People trying to end violent relationships, people in deep debt, families going through divorces, workers being unfairly laid off - all have legal problems and this report shows that they are not getting the help they need.
From June 2017, the federal government will cut funding by 30 percent, meaning that several thousand more Queenslanders will have to deal with their complex legal problems without help.
We call on Attorney General and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately stop cutting funding so that people in need of legal aid can get it.
Last year, the government unveiled its plans to bring the level of legal aid up to the national average.
Now it is also time to pay attention to the needs of local communities and their customers and to invest in this important area by the Palazchuk government.
Donald Trump's campaign sued after one of his employees pulled out a firearm
New York: Donald Trump's campaign has been sued for failing to act after its North Carolina operations chief reportedly turned a gun on an employee after they drove a car in February.
This incident was described in a lawsuit filed on Wednesday at the Charlotte court by Vincent Bordini, a former campaign programmer.
Brady said he had been waiting for months for this case to be dealt with internally, but realised it would not happen.
Head Earl Phillips "pushed out the gun, put his right index finger on the cock, and pointed the barrel at Vincent's knee," Bardini says in his complaint.
He also claims that, by submitting complaints to the local and regional campaign management, Bordini learned that at least four more people had experienced the same thing.
"Weapons don't have to be fired to cause damage," Bordini said in a complaint.
Just two days before the case was filed, the Republican presidential candidate sparked a scandal by announcing to people that the "People of the Second Amendment", i.e. weapons owners and enthusiasts, could act in case his rival Hillary Clinton and his elected judges win the election.
Trump’s campaign said the media had taken his words out of context and he had never incited anyone to violence.
If you’re not sure what to do, ask your doctor or pharmacist if you’re allergic to any of the ingredients in this product.
It’s not just a matter of what you do, but what you do.
I haven't been able to contact Phillips.
WCCB - Charlotte's local news agency reports that Philip recently quit the campaign.
It is also not possible to call his consulting firm "Innovative Consulting Services".
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has conducted a controversial election campaign.

A new tradition - parish and sports festival in <0xC4><0xB6><0xC5><0xAB><0xC4><0xBC>ciems.
This is the first time that people have gathered for the first time in <0xC4><0xB6><0xC5><0xAB><0xC4><0xBC>ciems for the parish and sports festival.
After ten years of celebration, this time it was decided that there would be no more Lake Festival.
A new page has been added.
The day began with a sports competition.
This time, the race was not traditional and too serious, because, for example, darts had to be thrown to a sleeping target, a boot flew, with a person's left hand thrown, "bubbles" have not been in any Olympic games at all.
However, each participant was able to show how strong, brave, agile and resourceful he is.
After the sports games, everyone gathered at the open-air stage, where the parish festival began.
In the meantime, there was also a "children's corner", where the little ones could break through the inflatable attractions and get a new image of the face make-up room.
A new thing that could also become a tradition was the parade of vehicles, where both tractors and motorcycles went.
The Commission shall be assisted by the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed established by Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety.
The celebration continued with the greeting of the youngest inhabitants of <0xC4><0xB6><0xC5><0xAB><0xC4><0xBC>ciems.
It's really good that the parish has grown up with five girls and one boy.
In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).
And it's not a coincidence that someone slipped on the wet stage.
Of course, the local people and visitors were delighted by the famous actor duo J<0xC4><0x81>nis Jar<0xC4><0x81>ns and Dainis Porgants, who were again Mildi<0xC5><0x86>a Nabina and Skaidr<0xC4><0xAB>te Kr<0xC4><0x81>ni<0xC5><0x86>a, as well as the attractive wives of B<0xC4><0x93>rzciems from the fishermen's farm "Dieni<0xC5><0x86>as".
The ball was played by the band "Bru<0xC4><0xA3>is".
Britain must maintain the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow.
Heathrow will not only contribute to prosperity and growth in the local regions and in London, but also throughout the country.
This, in my opinion, makes Heathrow very attractive, as it was in London in 2012, where we invested a huge amount of work so that all regions of the country would benefit from the Olympic Games.
Stratford and East End won a lot from the Olympics.
And we will do it again by providing local people and businesses with business opportunities near Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we will create 10 000 new business opportunities, 40 000 new jobs and finally bring an end to youth unemployment in the Heathrow area.
Like the London Olympics in 2012, this time there will be people who will think that the challenge is too great and that the extension of Heathrow is too ambitious.
At the time, people said that Britain would never be able to prepare for the Olympic Games in time and that it would be a global failure.
The sceptics were wrong about 2012 and they will not be right about Heathrow either.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow has so far overcome everything.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that will benefit society as a whole, not individuals.
Enlargement has the potential to create up to 180 000 new jobs, economic growth of 211 billion, creating a breeding ground for both employment and experience at this airport and throughout Britain.
Heathrow has an excellent team that has created an infrastructure investment program worth <0xC2><0xA3>11 billion, within time and budget, starting with Terminal 5, which has been named the best airport terminal in the world for five years now, and ending with Terminal 2, which is built between the two most heavily used runways in the world.
They are now ready to build a third runway, which will be financed by private investment of GBP 16 billion.
The 2012 London Olympics were a great success, and I am sure that the expansion of Heathrow will also be so.
The time has come to revive the Olympic spirit and to expand Heathrow, ensuring the future of our trade and creating a new employment environment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Dayton is a board member of Heathrow and former commercial secretary of the Ministry of Economic Affairs.
In Switzerland, a woman rushes to the highway in an attempt to commit suicide.
In the middle of the night, he fell asleep on the highway.
Police are trying to find witnesses to the accident when she was hit by several cars early Thursday morning on a highway.
The accident occurred on Thursday shortly after midnight on the A1 road near the town of Morges in the canton of Vo.
A report from the canton police said that in a desperate attempt to commit suicide, the woman was lying on a road in the dark, where several cars drove her.
Clearly trying to kill himself, the victim, a 49-year-old Swiss, ran over several cars, including a truck.
She died at the scene.
The Commission shall be assisted by the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed established by Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs (OJ L 139, 30.4.2004, p.
A criminal investigation has also been launched, which in such a case is a logical step, lawyer Gilles Hofsteller told Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it is not yet known whether any of the drivers involved will be penalised.
Could a collision have been avoided?
Hofsteller adds, "This will be determined by the prosecutor."
Two similar cases, which have occurred in the last 5 years, show that none of the drivers will be held liable.
In both cases, the pedestrian had gone out on the highway in the middle of the night, so it was decided that drivers could not predict that there would be a pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night, the newspaper said.
Last year, a policewoman was acquitted of negligent killing when, in August 2014, she drove a man who was sleeping on the A1 road near Payierne in the middle of the night.
The court found that the 22-year-old victim had been drinking and later managed to fall asleep on the road.
The court concluded that the policewoman, who was on the way to the scene of the accident, drove in a way appropriate to the circumstances and the judge acknowledged that the man lying on the road was a "completely unpredictable and exceptional case".

The petition, which is addressed to the ministers of the National Alliance (NA) and the Union of Greens and Farmers (ZZS), states that the public wants a transparent and professional process for nominating officials.
The petition was created on August 10 and is currently signed by 55 people.
The process of nomination of Inga Ko<0xC4><0xBC>egova, the candidate for the position of Director General of the State Revenue Service, is non-transparent and unprofessional.
It reminds us of the best traditions of Soviet functionaries.
It discredits the state administration and once again disappoints the public in government and politicians.
"It is necessary to have a competition with clear criteria against which all candidates should be judged," the text of the petition reads.
The author of the book, J<0xC4><0x81>nis B., pointed out that the public is not aware of the criteria for choosing Kolegova for the position.
It is also not clear what the candidates intend to do in the work at the SRS.
The petition states that the State Chancellery should create a new, open competition in which professional candidates are actively approached, personnel selection specialists are involved and appropriate remuneration is offered.

We started it in a similar way, but after we switched sides, the result grew for only one team.
We had too many mistakes in the attack.
In the sub-group, all teams were similar, almost all matches had three sets, so the small points were important.
“We should have played more like this, rather than give away 3-4 points in a row,” said the athlete.
We knew that Evandra could be preserved.

"If we lost, so I played badly," said Samoilov.
We expected a good service from Evandra, and we managed to do it quite well in the first sets, but in the third set he opened a service and it was difficult to form an attack.
I made a lot of mistakes at the service of Pedro, but I had to deal with it.

"All of us were expecting a medal, and so were we, but after that there is no difference - 25th place or fourth," said Samoilov, who predicted that the duo will continue to play together in the future.
I think there will be no questions and we will continue to play together, because this is only one tournament.
Samoilov had his third Olympic career in Rio de Janeiro, because in 2008 he competed with M<0xC4><0x81>rti<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> P<0xC4><0xBC>avi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> in Beijing, but four years ago he played with Ruslan Sorokin in London.

Latvenergo follows the process of opening up the gas market also from the position of a potential trader.
The state energy company Latvenergo is following the process of opening up the gas market both from the position of a consumer and a potential trader, said the company’s press secretary Ivita Bidere.
"The decision on whether Latvenergo will join the gas market as a trader in the future will be determined by the model of the gas market and the legal framework that will be established."
"We are actively involved in drafting and commenting on laws and regulations, as well as submitting our proposals," said Bidere.
The Agency has already written to BNS that the Ministry of Economics (MoE) in cooperation with the Public Utilities Commission and the energy company Latvijas G<0xC4><0x81>ze (Latvijas G<0xC4><0x81>ze) has developed a Cabinet of Ministers draft regulation “Regulations on the sale and use of natural gas” that will change the existing principles of the natural gas market, providing natural gas users with the right to freely choose a natural gas trader as of 3 April 2017.
Working on the new regulation of the natural gas market, the aim of the EM is to make the natural gas trading process as simple and user-friendly as possible.
Therefore, as the most effective and user-friendly service solution, the "central model of the trader" has been chosen, in which all activities related to customer service are provided by the trader - one contract, one invoice and one information provision and customer service point, leaving the technical issues of the natural gas distribution system to the distribution system operator.
A similar solution is currently being implemented in electricity trade.
We would like to remind you that a gradual market opening is planned for household users - even after 3 April 2017, those household users who do not wish to choose another natural gas trader will be able to continue receiving natural gas from the existing trader at a regulated price, thus becoming related users.
"In this case, the obligation to supply natural gas to related users at a regulated price is imposed on the public trader," the ministry said.
In turn, merchants will have to choose a natural gas trader with whom a natural gas trade contract has to be concluded.
Until entering into a natural gas trade contract for a specific period of time merchants shall be ensured the trade in natural gas by the previous natural gas trader for the price determined thereby.
The draft regulations of the Cabinet of Ministers detail the rights and obligations of the natural gas trader, system operator and users.
This Regulation prescribes the procedures by which natural gas shall be supplied to users and discontinue the supply thereof, the requirements for the safe use of the natural gas system, the rights and obligations of a trader, public trader, system operator, user and owner of a gasified object in the supply and use of natural gas; the procedures by which settlements shall be performed for the services received, the amount of late payment interest, the procedures for changing traders and supply of users in case of natural gas supply disruption; the procedures by which the public trader shall ensure the supply of natural gas to related customers.

Oil prices continue to rise; stock market indices in the US and Europe are rising, as are the value of the US dollar.
Oil prices in the world continue to rise on Friday morning, with investors’ confidence positively influenced by the remarks of Saudi Arabia’s oil minister, which amplify expectations that the largest oil-producing countries will act to stabilize the world oil market at the OPEC meeting in September.
The three main US stock indices reached a record level on Thursday, which has not been observed since 1999.
The main positive factor in the market was the rise in the price of oil and the strong financial indicators of several large companies.
The rise in oil prices and strong financial indicators of several companies on Thursday were also the reason for the rise in European stock indices.
The value of the US dollar rose against the euro, against the British pound and against the Japanese yen on Thursday.
In the electronic trading of the New York Stock Exchange, the price of crude oil of the WTI brand rose by USD 1.78 to USD 43.49 per barrel in September.

The company’s management report states that in 2015 the company was suffering losses due to a number of reasons, including a persistent lack of working capital caused by Unicredit Bank exiting the Baltic market, terminating the previously existing credit line, and leaving the Blue Lagoon with concluded contracts without the possibility to perform them.
As a result, the company did not have sufficient funds to buy cheaper raw materials in large volumes and receive a volume discount.
The withdrawal of the relevant bank from the Latvian market also prevented the company from implementing the European Union structural funds support projects, which would have allowed the factory to purchase new production equipment and modernise its infrastructure.
Similarly, the company's financial indicators in the past year were negatively affected by the rise in the prices of raw materials and the unwillingness of customers to pay more for the goods produced by the company.
"Only in the second half of July 2016, customers acknowledged the price changes and were ready to buy goods at the new - the highest - prices," the company's management said.
In 2015, "Blue Lagoon" started negotiations with potential investors, including valuation of the company's movable and immovable property.
Investors have already been to Unicredit Leasing, the largest creditor of the company, where the parties have studied and discussed possible investment plans.
At the same time, the company’s operations and development were positively affected by the implementation of the restructuring and optimization plan launched in 2014 and 2015.
This plan included the improvement and optimization of technological processes, which allows to achieve higher productivity and capacity of production.
"A number of equipment was purchased, which provides a higher production speed," the company's management said.
The management of "Blue Lagoon" notes that the equipment purchased in 2016 will allow the company's production facility to fulfill orders that were previously impossible.
The first batch of production that will be produced on this equipment will be ready in August.
As the Letter of Intent has already been signed for the sale of the product, all production will be sold in accordance with the Letter of Intent.
The new product will increase turnover by about 300 thousand euros per month," the company's management said.
In August 2016, the company plans to sign a cooperation agreement for the supply of fish products to Iraq.
"Blue Lagoon" in 2016 has sent the first experimental container to Israel, expanded the market to Cyprus and this September will sign a cooperation agreement with a new chain of supermarkets in the US.
As a result of all the above measures, the company plans to increase its turnover.
In 2014, "Blue Lagoon" had a turnover of 6,347 million euros and a loss of 5,113 million euros.
"Blue Lagoon" was founded in 1997 and its share capital is EUR 1,156 million.
The company is owned by two Latvian private individuals - Mikhail Kaidanov (89,11%) and Igor Shirshon (10,89%).
You are welcome to meet cinema diva Saare Leander and participate in a press conference at the museum at 15:00.
Riga can be considered the starting and inspiration city of the career of the adored cinema diva Sara Leandere.
Saara Lendere’s visit to her aunt Ruta, who was the Swedish ambassador to Latvia, turned out to be fateful in Riga in 1924, as she was the one who discovered the low contralto unusual for Saara Leander, which she tried to make by debuting on the stage of the Riga cabaret theatre.
Perhaps it was the randomness in Riga that became the fateful turning point in Zara’s creative journey towards world fame.
Riga was associated with warm memories for Zara Leander, and she hoped to come to Riga in guest performances, but unfortunately, these hopes were not destined to come true, because the Second World War began.
Using the form of the performance, this meeting will be possible during the Riga Festival 2016 and the great Ieva Ker<0xC4><0x93>vica will play the role of the outstanding Saara Leandere.

For other traffic participants, traffic will be ensured along the bypass road - the scheme in the attached file.

The insurer pays compensation to the passengers of the cancelled flight at the airport on Wednesday.
If Insurance has paid travel insurance indemnity to a family for the cancelled flight at Riga Airport on Wednesday, August 10, due to which the planned visit to the music festival had to be cancelled.
On 11 August, If Insurance received a claim for compensation from a client.

The problem is that my neighbors carried out arbitrary construction and my apartment has a broken ceiling.
Then I informed the Riga Construction Board, the house manager and other organizations.
The building board said that we are not an operational service and we do not have any expert.
"The owner of the apartment has to go to the Latvian Union of Engineers, and from there there will be an expert," says Dmitry.
The invited expert arrived, recorded what had happened and admitted that the covering was in an unsatisfactory condition.
It’s not just a matter of how much money you have, it’s a matter of how much money you have, and how much you have.
It’s a great way to get to know each other better.
"Then I wrote to the Riga City Council, but they sent it to the house manager, then the house manager again to the building board, and then there is a dead end," says Dmitry.
After examining the whole pile of papers, it is clear that the construction work has been stopped, although from time to time you can hear that someone is working there.
In addition, it is necessary to conduct an expert-examination within two months and, within six months, the owner of the apartment, who is carrying out repairs, must eliminate all these defects.
The independent expert has developed his opinion, but the construction board considers it incomplete and superficial.
The expert has not indicated whether the metal lattice in this load-bearing structure is affected, so there is no certainty that the owner of the lower apartment is being threatened.
“That’s why we have asked for additional explanations from this expert,” says Ilze <0xC5><0xBD><0xC5><0xAB>ka, representative of the Riga City Construction Board.
Despite the prohibition to carry out any repairs in the upper apartment, it is still heard from there that construction continues.
The penalty for arbitrary construction without a construction permit is from 70 to 700 euros, but in the particular case the penalty can be much more severe.
The Commission shall be assisted by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs established by Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 establishing a European Supervisory Authority (European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority).
"This is an unprecedented case in the practice of the construction board, where in this way, due to their ignorance or simply unwillingness, the inhabitants may have caused a threat not only to the owner of their property, but also to the owner of the lower property, as a result of which this owner cannot exploit his property," says the representative of the construction board.
Now Dmitry needs to look for another place to live - with relatives, friends, in a hotel or rent another apartment.
But Dmitry can try to recover the damage from the neighbor by civil law, which can take a lot of time.
Due to the arbitrary construction, it is currently forbidden to stay in both apartments until the construction engineer gives his conclusion, and it may be necessary to wait for up to three weeks.

The conversion of the former <0xC4><0xB6>emeri sanatorium into a five-star hotel will cost EUR 22 million.
If you’re looking for a way to make money online, you’ll want to make sure that you’re using the services of a reputable online casino.
The establishment of the hotel is the first stage of the restoration of the former <0xC4><0xB6>emeri sanatorium.
The second stage will be the wellness clinic, which is planned to be opened in 2022, while the opening of the hotel is planned for May 2018.
<0xC5><0xBD>elve notes that the exact cost of the clinic is not yet known.
However, she points out that it will be located in the building of the former Kemeri resort polyclinic, which covers an area of approximately 12,000 square meters.
The clinic will be located on three floors.
The owner of Park Hotel <0xC4><0xB6>emeri and the planned clinic is the international fund G Capital Europe, which invests in European assets.
“G Capital Europe” is owned by several investors who invest in this fund, <0xC5><0xBD>elve points out.
As George Jones, CEO of G Capital Europe, said earlier, it is planned to invest 12 to 15 million euros in the creation of the former resort polyclinic, with a total investment of more than 30 million euros.
It has already been announced that in the restoration of the cultural and historical park in the area of more than 42 hectares, in the restoration of access roads and street sections, in the construction of an interactive nature tourism object, in the improvement of the territory and in the construction of a parking lot on Em<0xC4><0xAB>la D<0xC4><0x81>rzi<0xC5><0x86>a Street, which will contribute to the socio-economic development of the city of J<0xC5><0xAB>rmala and increase in the number of tourists, the J<0xC5><0xAB>rmala City Council plans to attract 14.5 million euros from the European Union funds, co-financed with three to four to four million euros.
Design works are planned until the middle of 2017, but construction and arrangement works will start next autumn.
It is also important to note that the use of the drug is not recommended for children under the age of 3 years.
However, the reconstruction took a long time.
The 2010 report also stated that "Ominasis" regularly communicates with the hotel operator "Kempinski", which continues to ensure daily technical control in the sanatorium "<0xC4><0xB6>emeri", and already in 2011 the "reconstruction of the future hotel "<0xC4><0xB6>emeri" will be completed" and preparations for the opening of the Kempinski chain hotel will begin immediately.
In October 2014, "Park Hotel <0xC4><0xB6>emeri" confirmed its readiness to purchase the totality of the property of the insolvent "Ominasis Latvia" <0xC4><0xB6>emeri sanatorium, but a month later the auction was declared not to have taken place, because the winner had not paid for the purchase in due time.
The sale price was set according to the starting price of the last auction that did not take place - 2.86 million euros.

Russian hackers hacked the e-mail of former NATO commander Bridlov.
The hackers who hacked the computers of the U.S. National Democratic Committee (DNC) may have carried out a number of other cyber-attacks and also hacked the email of former NATO commander Philip Briedlow and the servers of George Soros' Open Society Institute, Bloomberg reported on Thursday.
This is the first time I’ve been to the hospital.
It’s a great way to get to know each other better.
The Institute's computers have been available to hackers for a year.
According to Bloomberg, these cyberattacks were carried out by the same hackers linked to Russian special services who hacked DNC emails.
The Wall Street Journal reported that the administration of US President Barack Obama is currently considering imposing new sanctions on Russia in response to the DNC hacking.
To impose sanctions, the administration will have to formally launch a cyber attack on Democratic Party servers against Russia or hackers supported by Russian authorities.
WikiLeaks released some 20,000 emails in July from the DNC’s computer system, suggesting Democratic Party leaders had tried to undermine Hillary Clinton’s campaign for Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders to win a Democratic nomination for president.
According to U.S. media sources, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which is investigating the hacking of Democratic servers, as well as other U.S. intelligence agencies, Russia’s involvement in the cyber-attack is almost certain.

The 74-year-old rock star is currently in a "good" relationship with the widow of the late John Lennon, but when she went to visit the band in the recording studio, she scared Ono because she was the only woman among the band's members - George Harrison, Ringo Starr, Lennon and McCartney.
When the singer was asked about the relationship, he told Rolling Stone magazine: "It's really good."
We felt threatened at the time.
While we were recording, she was sitting on the amplifiers.
Most of the group could not bear it.
We were able to do it, but not very successful, because we were very tense.
We weren't sexists, but the girls didn't usually go to the recording studio, they let us go.
When John started seeing Yoko, she was not sitting in the control room, but in the middle of our four.
The author of the blockbuster "Yellow Submarine" also admitted that he is now in regular contact with former band member Ringo, and from time to time confirms the work plans of the recording studio "Apple", but otherwise "The Beatles" have "out of business".
Asked if he was still dating his only living member of the legendary rock band, McCartney told Rolling Stone magazine: "Often not."
We meet at social events and parties.
But I don’t go to meetings, I feel a little isolated from it.
I left Apple during a difficult divorce.
In my seat, I sent John Eastman to the meetings and said, "Tell me what everyone is saying, because I can't stand sitting at that table."
It was too painful, as if seeing my pet die.
The company now works in such a way that I just listen to all the recordings.
I am part of the approval process.
NASA climate model: Venus was once a habitable planet
Based on NASA's latest climate models, Venus was once a habitable planet.
Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model to study the history of Venus using tools and algorithms that are also used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, which has a hot, water-free surface and almost carbon-free atmosphere, once had Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously speculated that Venus’ slow speed is due to its dense atmosphere.
However, recent simulations show that Venus once had a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and was spinning slowly.
The model also looks at Venus's earlier topography.
There were more dry areas on the planet than on Earth, but there was enough water and geographical diversity to form life and prevent water from evaporating.
In the early days of Venus, the sun was 30 percent brighter.
In the simulation of the GISS model, Venus’s spinning pattern reveals that the bright part of the day lasts for 2 months, GISS scientist Antony Del Genio explained in a press release.
This process heats the surface of the planet and causes rain, which in turn forms layers of thick clouds that act as an umbrella, protecting the planet from the heat of the Sun.
The result is a moderate climate temperature, which is actually a few degrees lower than the temperature on Earth today.
The model depicts the history of Venus, similar to the theory of evolution developed by scientists in their hypotheses.
Although once habitable, Venus has been exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet rays for billions of years.
Its oceans evaporated, and vapors burned out by ultraviolet rays.
When the water completely evaporated, only a thin atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse gas - Venus, as we know it today - remained.
Scientists published the results of the new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche coach
In the event of a dispute between the parties, the dispute may be referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union.
The Colorado vice president and general manager Joe Sakick confirmed the news and informed that the club will immediately start looking for a new coach.
“For the past three years, I have been energetic, passionate and focused on my role as head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Club,” Roy, 50, said in a statement.
During this summer I have been thinking a lot about how I could improve the team’s performance in order to give it the necessary brilliance and achieve higher level results.
To achieve this, the visions of the chief coach and the vice president of hockey operations must fully coincide with the visions of the organization.
He must also be able to influence decisions relating to team performance.
At present, these conditions are not met.
Sakik, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
Sayk said Patrick informed him of his decision today.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organization and wish him all the best in the future.
In his first season with the Avalanche team in 2013-2014, Roy was named the league's best coach and received the Jack Adams Award.
He helped the club reach 112 points and first place in the Central Division, but in the first round of play-offs, the Colorado team was defeated by Minnesota hockey. Since then, the club has not been in the play-offs for two years.
Avalanche finished the 2015-2016 season with a score of 39-39-4 and remained five points behind Wild without receiving a second special invitation from the organizers of the Western Conference.
In his career, Roy won four Stanley Cups, two with the Montreal Canadiens and two with the Avalanche.
North Sea oil rig workers resume talks and postpone strike
It’s a great way to get to know each other better and to get to know each other better.
Regular strikes against the oil refining company "Wood Group" are organized on the oil platforms of the North Sea, where the company "Royal Dutch Shell" operates.
In a joint statement, Wood Group and Unite and RMT trade unions agreed to resume negotiations on the settlement of the dispute.
A series of full-day meetings are scheduled for the coming weeks, starting early next week, with the aim of re-examining the issues at stake.
Trade unions said their recent actions, organised after a break of more than 25 years, were aimed at reducing wages by 30 percent.
Due to negative market pressure Wood Group reduced wages for North Sea workers by 9 percent this year.
Already in 2014, the company reduced the wages of land workers by 10 percent.
The company explains that additional salary cuts would allow the company to survive the market downturn.
Shell has already cut salaries for several thousand people and announced plans to shut down oil and natural gas operations in 10 countries in order to optimize its work in preparation for a large-scale merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure from falling oil prices, and the situation is further complicated by Britain's decision to leave the European Union.
At the beginning of the week, Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with workers' representatives to discuss one of the most important issues - the North Sea strike plans.
He said that the North Sea was vital to the region's economy.
In his report, he explains that the North Sea and the country as a whole need an economy that benefits everyone, not individuals.
In 2016, nearly $1.4 billion is expected to be invested in new North Sea projects, compared to $7 billion invested over the past five years.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of stars in the Pleiades constellation.
The mission of the newest Kepler telescope has helped astronomers compile the most complete catalogue of the speed of rotation of stars in the constellation of the Pleiades.
The new data helps astronomers understand why stars rotate at different speeds in this constellation, as well as how the speed of the stars relates to the formation of planets.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other constellations, we will gain more information about the relationship between star mass, age, and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebula, a scientist at the Caltech Infrared Process and Analytical Center in Pasadena.
The constellation of the Pleiades is located 445 light years from Earth.
Many stars in this constellation are just beginning to grow, reaching the age of about 125 million years.
They rotate at maximum speed.
At maximum speed, these rising stars emit a large amount of star wind.
As the winds enter the magnetic field of the stars, they brake the stars.
As the stars age, their speed of rotation decreases.
Kepler measures the speed at which each star spins, determining the time between the appearance of recognizable areas of stars, such as sunspots.
The latest catalog of star spin rates shows that larger stars spin more slowly than smaller stars.
Rebul compares stars to dancers, taller dancers perform pirouettes more slowly than small dancers.
Rebuls says that in the "ballet" of the Pleiades it can be seen that the slowly rotating objects are larger and more massive, while the faster rotating objects are very small stars.
Due to the fact that the constellation of the Pleiades is located so close, it serves as an excellent space laboratory, where you can compare the characteristics of stars with the speeds of rotation.
Rebul says that the constellation of the Pleiades helps to form theoretical models of rotation of stars in both directions for both older and younger stars.
We still have a lot to learn about how, when and why the speed of the stars is slowing down and about the complete process of stopping.
Rebuls and his colleagues presented in detail the analysis of the rotational speed of the Pleiades stars in three new publications, which will soon be published in the Journal of Astronomy.
