Welsh Assembly Members Concerned About ‘Looking Like Dolls’
Some members of the Assembly were alarmed by a proposal to change their name to MWP (Welsh MP).
This concerns the intention to change the Assembly's name to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly are concerned that this could lead to ridicule at a political level.
One Labour assembly member said his group was concerned "that this is rhyming with Twp and Pwp."
Not for Welsh readers: In Welsh, "twp" means "stupid" and "pwp" means "kaka".
A member of the Plaid assembly said the entire group was "dissatisfied" and offered alternatives.
The Welsh Conservative said his group was "open" about the name change, but noted that it was a shortening of the word from MWP to "doll".
Because the Welsh letter w is pronounced in a similar way to the English letter u in Yorkshire.
The assembly's commission, which is currently drafting legislation to change the name, said: "The final decision on the names of all the members of the assembly will, of course, be a matter for the members themselves."
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which received strong support for naming the Assembly the Welsh Parliament.
As regards the name of the members of the Assembly, the Commission preferred Members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but MWP received the highest support during the public consultation.
The members of the assembly are obviously proposing alternative options, but trying to reach an agreement could be a headache for the presiding officer, Elin Jones, who is expected to table draft legislation on the amendments in a few weeks' time.
The reform legislation will also include other changes to the work of the Assembly, including rules on disqualification of a member of the Assembly and a plan for the committee system.
During the debate on the legislation, the members of the Assembly will have a decisive vote on the question of how they should be called.
Macedonians vote in referendum on name change
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The popular vote was held to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbour's name is a claim on Greek territory and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia's bid to join the EU and NATO.
Opposition to the name change, Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov said he would ignore the vote.
But proponents of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name is simply a price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
During the difficulties of Harlem, the bells of St. Martin and other churches fell silent
“The old people I spoke to said that historically there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Adams said.
You won’t find one or the other today.”
He said he understood why the bars had disappeared.
“People communicate differently these days,” he said.
“The bars are no longer a neighborhood site where people gather all the time.”
Speaking of churches, he worries that the money from the sale of the property will not last as long as the leaders expect, "and sooner or later they will return to where they started."
He added that churches could be replaced by multi-apartment buildings with cooperative flats that would house people who would not help the nearby shrines.
“Most of the people who will buy cooperative apartments in these multi-apartment buildings will be white,” he said, “and will therefore hasten the moment the churches close completely, because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these cooperative apartments will become members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by white congregations in 1870, before Harlem became a black metropolis – a metropolitan community, and St. Martin’s Church was built a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation emerged in the 1930s.
The congregation of blacks who organized services nearby took over the name of the building.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by a black congregation with cleric John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, the main store in Harlem, where blacks were refused employment or promotion.
The building was badly damaged by fire in 1939, but because the parishioners of the spiritual father Johnson planned to rebuild it, they ordered a carillon.
Priest David Johnson, son and successor of the spiritual father Johnson in the church of St. Martin, proudly called the carillon the bells of the poor.
The experts who hit the carillon in July called it a “cultural treasure” and an “irreplaceable historical instrument.”
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also mentioned that it was the first carillon in the world played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind. 18 years ago, he began playing a larger carillon at the Riverside Church.
Merriweather said that St. Martin's Church did not replace him with another musician.
What has happened in the last few months at St. Martin’s Church has been a complex story involving architects and contractors, some of whom were invited by lay members of the church and others by the Episcopal diocese.
The sacristy, the governing body of the parish, made up of lay leaders, voiced concern in July that the diocese would "try to pass on costs" to the sacristy, even though it did not hire the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained that the diocese lacked transparency.
Shark injures 13-year-old lobster hunter in California
Officials said the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy while he was catching lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
He was attacked just before 7 a.m. in Ensinitas, near the Lighthouse Beach.
Chad Hammel told San Diego KSWB-TV that he was diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help, and then came with a group to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel told me at first that the boy was worried about catching the lobster, but then he realized that the boy was shouting: “I’m bitten!
I was bitten!”
Hammel said that when he approached the boy, he noticed that all his clavicle had been ripped off.
"I started yelling to everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark swimming in the water!'" Hammel added.
The boy was flown by plane to San Diego's Rady Children's Hospital, where he was found in critical condition.
The type of shark that attacked the boy is unknown.
Rescuer Captain Larry Giles said in a statement to media that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but that it was not considered a dangerous species of shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered upper torso traumatic injuries.
Authorities closed the beach from Casablad Pont to Ensinitas Swami for 48 hours for investigation and security.
Giles mentioned that there are more than 135 shark species in the zone, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter UK beauty market
Sainsbury's takes over Boots, Superdrug, and Debenhams with department store-style beauty departments that will be staffed by specialist consultants.
As the UK’s <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty market continues to grow and sales of fashion and household goods plummet, larger beauty product divisions will be tested in 11 stores across the country and, if successful, more stores will be set up next year.
Investment in beauty is on the rise, and supermarkets are looking for ways to use shelves once used for TVs, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury’s said it would double its beauty line to 3,000 product names, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and, for the first time, Dr. PawPaw.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space in brand zones similar to those in stores like Boots.
The mall is also re-launching its Boutique make-up range, most of which is vegan – something that younger shoppers are increasingly demanding.
Fragrance Shop will also test discounts at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second later this year in Seli Ouke, Birmingham.
Thanks to online shopping and the desire to buy small quantities from local convenience stores on a daily basis, supermarkets need to do more to attract people to visit.
Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe said that branded outlets are increasingly looking like department stores as supermarket chains try to fight cheaper retailers by offering more services and non-food items at Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's added Argos outlets to hundreds of stores and also installed a number of Habitat stores as it bought both networks two years ago, which are said to have boosted grocery sales and made it more profitable to buy.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to upgrade its beauty and pharmacy department ended in failure.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots, but the alliance ended in a dispute over how to distribute revenues from supermarket pharmacies.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store business three years ago for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
Lloyds was said to have contributed to the plan by adding an expanded range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Chief Commercial Officer, said: “We’ve changed the exterior and atmosphere of beauty departments to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be ready to give advice.
Our range of brands has been designed to meet every need and, thanks to its attractive environment and convenient locations, we are now an attractive beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones is 'wrapped' over Holly Willoughby's <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
"Dragons Den" star Peter Jones is "stuck" after TV show host Holly Willoughby ended a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on new deals with Marks and Spencer and ITV
H. Willoughby no longer has time for their household and accessories brand Truly.
The couple’s business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
This Morning’s 37-year-old host said she was leaving on Instagram.
When Holly Willoughby left the lucrative lifestyle brand at the last minute to focus on her new big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV, she angered Dragons Den star Peter Jones.
Sources say Jones was "wrapped" when a golden television girl admitted Tuesday at his business empire headquarters in Marlow that she would not have enough time to devote her household items and accessories to the Truly brand because of new deals worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand, and was supposed to double Willoughby’s <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
After Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones flew from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
The source said: Truly has been one of Holly’s top priorities so far.
It was supposed to be her long-term future for the next couple of decades.
Her decision to leave surprised everyone.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, because the beginning was so close.
Marlou has a full warehouse of ready-to-sell goods at its headquarters."
Experts believe that the departure of The Morning, one of Britain’s most financially successful stars, could cost the company millions due to massive investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and household items, as well as delays in getting things started.
This could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were close friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for a decade.
In 2016, Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp, and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couples are on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV’s I’m A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said yesterday: "We will not comment on his business affairs."
We talked a lot and then we fell in love.
He joked about receiving criticism from the media for a comment that some might consider "non-presidential" and for making such a positive statement about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
In a mocked 'newscaster' voice, he said:
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June was seen as a major step towards North Korea’s denuclearisation.
Negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea was not receiving a "appropriate response" from the United States over North Korea's early disarmament.
Instead, he said, the U.S. is continuing sanctions designed to keep up the pressure.
In his speech, he expressed a much more optimistic view.
“We are doing very well with North Korea,” he said.
We were at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We have a great relationship now.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results, including an end to missile tests and assistance in freeing the hostages and returning the remains of American troops.
He defended his unusual attitude when talking about the relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people willing to enter this crammed arena, we’d better have about 200 people standing here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd standing right in front of him.
Indonesian Tsunami and Earthquake Ruined the Island, Killing Hundreds
Following the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were informed that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population has been deployed, this has not been declared a national disaster, a prerequisite for international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, it was said very clearly that there is no need for international aid, so it's a bit complicated," said Sumbung.
Although Save the Children is preparing a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet clear whether employees working abroad will be able to work locally.
National Disaster Agency spokesman Sutopo said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Given Indonesia’s constant experience of earthquakes, the country is still sadly unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, they are not common on other coasts.
The apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, despite the announcement of the warning, is likely to have led to an increase in the number of lives lost.
The best time to travel between many Indonesian islands is difficult.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
A hospital ship in Lombok, where victims of the earthquake are being treated, is heading for Palu, but it will arrive at the site of the new disaster in at least three days.
President Joko Widodo has chosen rebuilding Indonesia’s destroyed infrastructure as the center of his election campaign and has generously spent money on roads and railways.
But the lack of funding has troubled Yoko's administration, which is expected to return to the polls next year.
Yoko has also come under pressure from persisting sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority adhere to a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands driven from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using machetes, bows with arrows and other simple weapons.
Watch: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge score a distant goal in a match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat at Chelsea in the 89th minute by scoring a goal at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday.
With their team behind 1-0, Xherdan Shaqiri passed the ball about 30 meters from the Chelsea gate to the former Sturridge.
He slammed the ball on his left leg and shot towards the far shaft.
High above the penalty area, the ball flew to the right upper corner of the net.
He eventually flew over the jumper Kepa Arrizabalag and reached the net.
"I was just trying to get into this position to get the ball, and players like Shaq are always playing as far ahead as possible, so I was just trying to stay as much time as possible to hit the ball," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, I made a ball with one touch, and without thinking too much, I just kicked."
After the 25-minute goal scored by the Belgian star Eden Hazard, Chelsea led 1-0 from the first half.
During the attack, the blue striker returned the ball to Mateo Kovacic with his heel in the middle of the pitch and hurried towards Liverpool.
In the middle of the square, he quickly played against the wall.
Then he sent the ball between the opponents to the penalty area to the invading Hazard.
Hazard overtook the defenders and threw the ball through Liverpool player Alison Becker with a left foot into the net at the far post.
Liverpool will play Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3 p.m. Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea are meeting Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Indonesian tsunami death toll rises to 832
Indonesia's disaster agency said on Sunday that the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami had risen to 832.
A spokesman for the agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, said at a news conference that many people were trapped in the rubble of buildings destroyed by Friday's 7.5-magnitude earthquake, which triggered a six-metre wave.
The city of Palu, home to more than 380,000 people, was covered with rubble from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of murder after woman stabbed to death
The murder investigation began after a woman’s body was found this morning in Berkenhead.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. outside Grayson Muse on John Street with a 32-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police urged people who had seen or heard someone in the area to speak out.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "For the time being, the investigation is at an early stage, but I would like to address all those who were near John Street in Berkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious that they would contact us.
“I would also like to appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught something on video recorders, and to contact us as they may have information that is essential to our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Berkenhead and was found inside the building.
This afternoon, friends of mine who knew the woman came to the scene to ask where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing as police say they are informing the victim’s immediate family.
Grayson Muse's taxi driver had just tried to get back into his apartment, but police said no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He lost his breath when he found out what had happened.
Residents are now being told they will have to wait several hours before they are allowed to return home.
It was heard that a police officer explained to one person that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
The woman appeared in tears at the scene.
She kept saying, “It’s so scary.”
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were standing in front of the barrier on the inside, while another was behind it on the outside.
Many officers stood on the inside of the fence and watched the block of blocks of flats.
Anyone with information is asked to write to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101, or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 with the September 30 number 247.
Parliament's Cromwell statue is being hit by the final blow in the "rewriting of history" dispute.
Its removal would be a poetic justice for the destruction of England’s cultural and religious heritage, reminiscent of the Taliban’s actions, for which the fanatical Puritan followers of Cromwell are responsible.
Cromwell's Society, however, described Crick's proposal as "foolishness" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the current debate on moving the statues, Oliver Cromwell's statue outside Westminster Palace was bound to become a target.
Cromwell did not order or carry out the iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
The magnificent image of Cromwell by Sir William Ham Thorneycroft is a reflection of the 19th century approach and part of the historiography of the figure that many still hold worthy of honor.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many people, perhaps more numerous in the late 19th century than today, saw Cromwell as a defender of parliament against outside pressure, which of course was a monarchy.
Whether this is true is disputed by historians to this day.
One thing is clear: the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell became an exceptional figure representing one of the sides of this divide.
His accomplishments as the Lord's protector are also worthy of mention and honor."
Swine Killer Kills Chinese Farmer
According to local media reports, a pig attacked and killed a farmer at a market in southwestern China.
On Sunday, the Morning Post reported that a man named Yuan was found dead after bleeding from a damaged artery and lying next to a pig house in Liupanshui Market, Guizhou Province (south China).
On 30 May 2005, a pig farmer in a pig house in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, was preparing to administer vaccines to pigs.
He said he and his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province were planning to go to the market on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, the cousin found the relative dead and found the door open to the neighboring piggy house.
He said that there was a large boar in the piggy house whose mouth was stained with blood.
According to the statement, the forensic examination confirmed that a pig weighing 250 kilograms tore a farmer.
“Guiyang Evening News quoted him as saying: ‘My cousin’s legs were bloody and injured,’” the cousin said, using his surname Wu.
Footage from the security camera showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found within an hour.
An animal torn by a man, Yuan or his cousin, did not belong.
The head of the market told Evening News that the pig had to be locked up so as not to attack other people and kept while police were gathering evidence on the spot.
The Yuan's family and the market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for the loss of life.
There have been few cases of pigs attacking humans in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at a farm in Massachusetts, and the man was especially badly injured.
Ten years ago, a 295-kilogram pig pressed a Welsh farmer against a tractor and pressed him until his wife chased him away.
After pigs ate an Oregon farmer in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs aren’t usually aggressive, but blood-tasting can make them aggressive.
“They’re just playful.
They like to bite, they're very inquisitive... they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to respect them,” he said.
Hurricane Rosa's 'remnant' will bring heavy rain to the southwest of the United States
Hurricane Rosa is expected to weaken as it traverses the cooler waters off Mexico’s northern coast.
But in the days to come, Rosa will bring abundant rain to all of northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
On Sunday, from 5 a.m., Rosa was moving at 137 km/h as a Category 1 hurricane, 620 km southwest of the cape Euchenia in Mexico.
Rose is expected to head north on Sunday.
At the same time, an elongated area of low pressure is beginning to form on the Pacific side and is moving eastward toward the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the California Peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, she will begin to carry significant tropical moisture to the north, to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will cause up to 25 centimetres of rain in some areas of Mexico.
Then the tropical humidity, interacting with the approaching elongated low-pressure area, will bring in the coming days a widespread abundant rain to the southwest.
At the site from 2.5 to 10 centimeters of rain will cause a dangerous flash flood, a stream of debris and possible landslides in the desert.
Because of the high humidity in the rainforest, some areas, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona, will lose between 5 and 8 centimeters of rainfall per hour.
5 to 8 centimetres of rain is expected in the southwestern regions, particularly in large parts of Arizona.
Due to the scattered nature of tropical rains, flash floods and rapidly deteriorating conditions are possible.
With a tropical storm looming, a particularly bad idea would be to head for the desert on foot.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into raging rivers, and thunderstorms will cause jumps of wind and dust.
The upcoming elongated low-pressure area will bring some local heavy rain to parts of the southern California coast.
More than 1 centimeter of precipitation is expected, which can cause a small stream of debris and make roads slippery.
This would be the first rainy season in the region.
Some of the scattered rains from the rains will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before spreading late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains after Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah will spread on Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
In October, intense fluctuations in temperatures across the United States could occur as the Arctic cools, but the tropical zone will be relatively warm.
Sometimes this leads to huge changes in temperature over short distances.
Sunday was a perfect example of the huge temperature differences in the central United States.
Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska) temperatures are nearly 20 degrees different from those of St. Louis and Di Moine (Iowa).
Over the next few days, the summer heat should rise again and cover more places.
A warm October is expected in much of the central and eastern U.S., from the Great South Plains to the northeast, with much of the temperature at 27 degrees Celsius.
In New York, temperatures are expected to rise to 27 degrees Tuesday, about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows temperatures in the eastern U.S. in the first half of October will be higher than the average annual temperature.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s trial
More than 20 million people watched on six television broadcasts on Thursday as Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and woman Christine Blasey Ford were indicted for sexual assault in the 1980s.
But the political stalemate continued as broadcasters cut off regular programs over Friday's last-minute change, with an Arizona senator working on a deal for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh, drunk at a high school party, grabbed her and tried to take off her clothes.
Kavanaugh angrily testified that he was absolutely certain that this was not the case.
Nielsen said Friday that more than 20.4 million people may have watched the broadcast.
The company calculated the average number of viewers watching the broadcast on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available to other networks, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen generally has some difficulty counting the number of people watching television in offices.
To explain it more clearly, it is the same size audience as it would have been at a playoffs or Oscar awards.
Nielsen reported that the Fox News Channel, whose hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh's candidacy, was the lead of all networks, with an average audience of $5.69 million during the day's court hearing.
ABC reached 3.26 million viewers in second place.
Nielsen reported that CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
There was a lot of interest after the court hearing.
The main character in Friday’s drama was Flake.
After a small Republican office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught by CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning as protesters yelled at him as he tried to take the elevator to a court committee meeting.
CNN filmed it directly with its eyes lowered as it was flooded by people.
“I’m standing here in front of you,” one woman said.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?”
He was told, “You have power when so many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement and added that he would have more to say at the hearing before the court before the elevator closed.
Later, cable and broadcast networks discussed directly when the Judiciary Committee voted for Kavanaugh’s candidacy to the Senate.
But Flake said he would only do so if he knew the FBI would investigate the charges against him over the next week, which a minority of Democrats had called for.
Flake, who spoke to his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons, was partially persuaded.
After talking to Coons and several senators, Flake made the decision.
Flake's choice was powerful because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the vote to confirm Kavanaugh's failure to conduct an investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
UK PM accuses critics of 'playing politics' over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union in an interview with the Sunday Times, accusing them of "playing politics" with Britain's future and seeking to undermine national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May is due to attend the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another interview published on the front page of the newspaper under her photograph, former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued to attack her so-called Brexit-dedicated "Checkers" plan that Britain and the EU should collect each other's tariffs, saying it was "absolutely absurd".
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson over LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting of 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department said 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and jailed on charges of second-degree murder.
Officials released a video of the Sims-Simpson clash, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
CBS affiliate WAFB reports that police took the glasses from the scene and found Simpson's DNA on them.
After questioning Simpson, police said he shot Wayde to death.
The attorney informs that his release deposit is $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Expert Service released a preliminary report on Friday saying the cause of death was a gunshot to the head that hit the neck.
The department pays tribute to the Louisiana State Police's Fugitive Task Force, the state police's crime lab, Southern University's police, and the residents of the area who assisted in the investigation that led to the arrest of the suspect.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked the district's law enforcement for "carefulness and administration of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
He grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points per game and caught 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "shocked" and "shocked".
“We’re thinking about it all the time,” Wade said.
Volcano spews ash in Mexico City
From the volcano of Popocatepetl erupted ash, which reached the southern part of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the crater was activated and 183 times the emissions of gas and ash were recorded within 24 hours.
The center watched a lot of thunders and tremors.
Photos on social media show thin-ashed car windscreens in Mexico City, such as Chochimilko.
Geophysicists noted that the activity of the volcano, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, has increased since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police and thousands joined anti-government demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's split vote.
The riot police, who were stopping a group of masked separatists, were pelted with eggs and powder paint, causing dark clouds of dust in the streets, usually filled with tourists.
Police used batons to stop the fighting that began later in the day.
Within hours, the pro-independence groups singing "Unforgettable, Unforgivable" were confronted by unionist protesters shouting "Long live Spain!"
Local media reported that 14 people were being treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests.
Tensions remain high in the independence-seeking region a year after the Oct. 1 referendum, which Madrid considers illegal but is sung by Catalan separatists.
Most voters chose to become independent, but the majority of those who boycotted the vote did not want to separate, and the turnout was low.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year when police across the region tried to stop polling stations from voting.
Pro-independence groups set up a camp on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place, but was forced to change the route.
Narciss Termes, 68, an electrician who is taking part in a separatist protest with his wife, said he was no longer sure of Catalonia's independence prospects.
“We had one of the best moments last year.
I watched my parents joyfully shouting to those who were able to vote, but now we are stuck," he said.
Despite a vital and hard-won victory in regional elections last December, Catalan independence parties have struggled to keep up the momentum this year as many of their best-known leaders have fled into voluntary exile or are in detention awaiting trial over their role in the referendum and subsequent independence.
Pro-police mechanic Joan Puig, 42, who filmed the protest on his phone, said the conflict had been fueled by politicians on both sides.
“The tension is constantly increasing,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who has been in prison since the end of last year, announced that he would take part in the European elections next year.
"Candidacy in the European Parliament elections is the best way to condemn the decline of democratic values and the repression demonstrated by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry —Men Arrested After Entering a House in a Car
Three 33-, 34- and 39-year-old men were arrested after their car repeatedly drove into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place Thursday around 7:30 p.m. in Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gate and the building itself were damaged.
At some point, a crossbow could also have been shot in the car.
Menga's victory secured a 1-0 victory for the Livingston against the Rangers
Livingston's Dolly Menga's first goal was a win.
Livingston surprised Rangers, forcing Acting Ibrox manager Steven Gerrard to lose second in 18 games.
Dolly Menga's strike proved very important, as in an instant Gary Holt's team was on par with the Hibernian.
Gerrard's team remains undefeated in a away game this season and will meet next Sunday with leaders Hearts, eight points behind them.
Before that, on Thursday, the Rangers will play the Europa League home game against the Vienna Rapid.
Livingston then extended their unbeaten series of losing games in the division to six, and head coach Holt has yet to taste the loss, as Kenny Miller only replaced him last month.
Livingston misses chances in game with crooked guests
Even before he scored, Holt's team had to be ahead a long time ago because of its tenacity, which caused the Rangers a lot of problems.
Scott Robinson initially punched and slammed across the gate, and later Alan Lithgow failed to reach Craig Halkett's head on the slide and the ball rolled off the side of the gate.
The hosts didn’t worry about allowing the Rangers to play in the front, because they knew they could make trouble for the guests by creating standard positions.
That is how the decisive goal was scored.
The Rangers missed the free kick, and Livingston began to advance; Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up to pass the ball to Menga, who scored a goal from the middle of the penalty area.
Since then, the ball has been under the control of the Rangers, but the defense of the hosts was invincible and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had almost no job.
The game continued in the second half, although Kelly had to work on supporting Alfredoed Morelos' goal kick.
Scott Pittman's shot was hit by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, while Lithgow's next standard position was hit by a ball near the gate.
The ball was constantly placed in the penalty area of Livingston, but each time it was kicked out, and two penalty demands – one for Halkett's collision with Glenn Middleton, who ran into the field after the replacement, and the other for touching the ball – were not met.
Phenomenal "Livingston" performance analysis
BBC Scotland reporter Alasdair Lamont of Tony Macaroni Arena
The phenomenal game and result of Livingston.
All of them were excellent and continued to exceed expectations for the ever-improving game.
The style and staff of the game have not changed much since his return to the top league, but Holt deserves a lot of credit, as he ignited the team on arrival.
He was helped by a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett played a brilliantly organized defense, and Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worralla on guard.
The Rangers lacked inspiration.
They played well under Gerrard, but this time they didn’t have much time to reach their level.
They made few decisive knocks, and only once they broke through the defense of the hosts. A certain alarm bell in the middle of the table for the Rangers team.
Erdogan was met in Cologne in various ways
On Saturday (29 September), there were smiles and blue skies as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the final day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which was aimed at restoring ties between NATO allies.
The leaders argued over issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new huge mosque.
The city has the largest population in Turkey outside Turkey.
Police have banned 25,000 people from rallying in front of the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters have come to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, also sought to be heard to condemn both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him at home.
Different protests show a split among visitors: some German Turks see him as a hero, while others see him as a dictator.
Road accident in Deptford: A cyclist dies in a collision with a car
A cyclist died in a collision with a car in London.
The accident happened near the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Streets, in the busy Deptford Road, in the southeast of the city, at about 10:15 BVL.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics also arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The accident took place a few months after another cyclist was killed on Childers Street when he was hit by the perpetrator, who then fled, about a mile (1.6 km) away from Saturday's accident.
City police said they were trying to identify the man and inform his immediate family.
Roads are closed and bus routes are changed, drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartino Prison: Six officers injured in riot
The prison service said six prison officers were injured in a major upheaval at a men’s prison with special security.
The incident took place at the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 09.30 BVL on Sunday, where it is still ongoing.
Special Tornado officers were called in to manage the upheaval, which involves eight inmates and takes place in a single wing of the prison.
Officers are being treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A spokesman for the prison service said: "Specially trained prison staff were called in to manage the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we are confident that those responsible will be handed over to the police and that they will probably spend a longer time behind bars.”
The HMP Long Lartin prison holds more than 500 inmates, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison manager was being treated in a hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year rioters were summoned to prison to try to contain a serious upheaval in which some workers were pelted with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flash floods (this could be beneficial for arid areas)
It’s not common for tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that’s exactly what is likely to happen next week when Hurricane Rosa, with its remaining energy, sweeps across the desert’s southwest, causing the risk of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has already said it is monitoring flash flooding Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, heading south and east for Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
As she nears the rain late Monday, Rosa is expected to head straight for Phoenix on Tuesday.
In Phoenix, the National Weather Service noted that only “ten tropical cyclones have maintained a tropical storm or tropical depression status no more than 350 miles [322 km] from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane no more than 64 kilometres from the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center are expected to add 5 to 10 centimetres of rainfall, with some areas of Arizona’s Mogolon Rim expected to receive 5 centimetres of rainfall.
Other areas in the southwest of the desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to receive between 2.5 and 5 centimeters, with up to 10 centimeters of precipitation in some areas.
For people who are not threatened by flash floods, Rosa’s rain can be a blessing, as the region is suffering from drought.
While flooding is a very serious problem, some may benefit from it, as the south-west is currently experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Observatory, just over 40 percent of Arizona suffers from a very severe drought, which corresponds to the second-highest category,” weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa makes its way to the coast across the California Peninsula, which is part of Mexico.
On Sunday, Rose, still a hurricane with a massive wind of 137 kilometers per hour, was 619 kilometers south of the cape Euchenia in Mexico, heading north at 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm collides with cooler waters in the Pacific and is therefore calming.
So it is expected to reach the coast of Mexico with the force of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Precipitation in certain parts of Mexico can be severe and present a high flood risk.
"From the California peninsula to the northwestern Sonora, we expect 8 to 15 centimetres, but possibly up to 25 centimetres of precipitation," the weather service said.
Rose will then head north across Mexico as a tropical storm, then on Tuesday morning she will arrive at the Arizona border as a tropical depression, and on Tuesday night she will pass through Arizona towards southern Utah.
"The main hazard expected from Rosa or her remnants is a very large amount of rain on the California Peninsula, Northwest Sonora, and the U.S. desert southwest," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
The rains are expected to trigger life-threatening flash floods, a stream of debris in the desert and landslides in mountainous areas.
Attack on Midsamer Norton: Four arrested on suspicion of attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in Midsamer Norton's Excelsior terrace area at around 04:00 BVL on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital and is now in stable condition.
Police in Avon and Somerset said a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
Officials have contacted anyone who may have any cell phone footage of what happened.
Trump says Kavanaugh "suffered from the filth and anger of the Democratic Party."
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote we would like to reject the ruthless and offensive tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said in a speech in Willinge, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "experienced the filth, the anger of the Democratic Party" during his candidacy process.
Kavanaugh testified Thursday to Congress that he strongly and emotionally denied accusations by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers decades ago.
Ford also pleaded guilty to the charges at the trial.
“The Americans saw that day how great, how noble, how brave Kavanaugh was.
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for one of the most experienced legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a solid public service reputation,” he told a crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The President implicitly referred to Kavanaugh's candidacy, while at the same time referring to the importance of the turnout in the midterm elections.
“There are five weeks left until the most important elections in our lives.
I don’t participate, but I do participate,” he said.
"That's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere."
Trump said Democrats are seeking to "oppose and thwart."
Senior GOP executive aide told CNN that the first major procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination should take place no later than Friday.
Hundreds killed in Indonesia earthquake and tsunami, death toll rises
Authorities said at least 384 people had been killed, many of them killed by huge waves on the beach after a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit Indonesia's Sulawesi island.
Hundreds of people gathered at the beach festival in Palu on Friday as the six-metre-high waves began to scuttle along the coast at nightfall, killing and destroying everything on the road.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"When there was a tsunami threat yesterday, people were still on the beach and didn't run immediately, so they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the BNPB Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, told reporters in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't blow up on its own, it pulled back cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that before it hit the coast, the tsunami was travelling at a speed of 800 km/h on the high seas.
He said some people climbed trees to avoid the tsunami and survived.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial images from the disaster agency showed numerous buildings and shops were destroyed, bridges were bent and collapsed, and the mosque was surrounded by water.
The coastal city continued to suffer aftershocks on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with a population of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said the energy released by Friday's quake was about 200 times higher than that of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
It is reported that the tsunami may have strengthened due to the city’s geographical location, since it is located at the end of a long, narrow bay.
Nugroho described the damage as "severe" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, supermarkets and hotels had been destroyed.
He said the bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of the buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 people were missing.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and damage could be higher along the coast, 300km north of Palu, in an area called Dongala that is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Nugroho said the communications networks were "completely paralyzed, so no information was received" from Dongala.
“More than 300,000 people live there,” a Red Cross spokesman said in a statement, adding that staff and volunteers were travelling to the disaster-hit areas.
It was said that “this can already be considered a tragedy, but the situation could get even worse.”
On Saturday, the agency was heavily criticised for not reporting that the tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said the waves had come after a warning.
In the shared social media aficionados, you can hear a man on the top floor of a building yelling franticly at an approaching tsunami for people on the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the shore, taking away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami disrupted electricity supply, cutting off communication networks around Palu and making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate aid delivery.
Authorities said the army had begun sending cargo planes with relief supplies from Jakarta and other cities, but that those evacuated were still in dire need of food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport was reopened only to provide assistance and will be closed by October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit Palu's evacuation centres on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami was over 800.
That's very bad.
Doseba said that while World Vision staff were safely travelling from Dongala to Palu, where they were sheltering in tented tents built in the office yard, images were being taken along the way.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
That's very bad.
Even as relief groups began taking complex steps to provide relief in the disaster, some people complained that foreign aid workers with a lot of experience were banned from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and foreign personnel can only help once the disaster area has been declared a national disaster zone.
This has not happened yet.
"This is still a disaster at a provincial level," said Indonesian Red Cross spokeswoman Aulia Arriani.
"When the government says, 'Yes, this is a national disaster,' we can call for international assistance, but this status has not yet been announced."
Two nights after Friday's earthquake and tsunami in Palu, friends and relatives of the missing hoped their loved ones would become part of a miracle that would impact the gloomy history of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the sewers.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped under rubble outside her mother's body for two days.
The head coach of Indonesia’s national paragliding team, Gendon Subandono, had trained the two missing paragliders at the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others of those trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi, were his students.
“Since I’m older in paragliding, I carry my emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon described in detail how, in a few hours, after the announcement of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel, this news traveled through the paragliding sports community. He hopelessly sent messages using the WhatsApp app to the Palu rivals who participated in the beach festival.
But his messages contained only one gray, not two blue ticks.
“I think that means the messages were not received,” he said.
Bank robbers stole $26,750 at Newport on the Levee
According to a press release from the Newport Police Department, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee on Friday morning who was filling an ATM at Newport on the Levee.
“The driver of the car was emptying the ATM in the entertainment complex and was ready to add more money,” detective Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
While he was busy, another man “fell from behind the back of a Brink’s employee” and stole a bag of money to replenish it.
According to a press release, witnesses spotted several suspects fleeing the scene, but police were unable to determine the number of people involved.
Anyone with information about their identity should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West. Rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
In a tweet on Saturday, he said: “A person formerly officially known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, had been known as Ye for some time and named it the eighth album, which was released in June.
The changes began ahead of Saturday Night Live, where West was expected to release his new album, Yandhi.
He is to replace singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled the show for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
This isn’t just a shortening of his current professional title, West said earlier that the word had a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year, referring to the title of the album with radio host Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, it means us.
It started with Kanye, which means the only one, and became simply Ye, which means the reflection of our good, of our evil, of our confusion, of everything.
The album is more about who we are.”
He is one of many famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year declared himself to prefer the names of Love and Brotherly Love.
West’s former colleague, JAY-Z, also changed his name and used it with or without a hyphen and capital letters.
Mexican politician Andrés Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has vowed not to use troops against civilians.
Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody repression of students.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador on Saturday vowed to "never use military force to restrain the people of Mexico" in Tlatelolco Square.
On October 2, 1968, at a time when leftist student movements were beginning across Latin America, a peaceful demonstration was fired on the square by members of the military, and 300 people were killed.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans every month by subsidising students and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are drawing young people into criminal gangs.
U.S. should double funding for artificial intelligence
“As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount spent on research in this area,” said Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and artificial intelligence specialist at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after various U.S. government bodies published reports on artificial intelligence, even the fact that the U.S. does not have an official strategy on artificial intelligence at all.
China, meanwhile, last year unveiled its plan to lead the way in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
“A doubling of the AI research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are more advanced than the U.S. and we are looking forward to another breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
Double funding could double the chances that the next big artificial intelligence breakthrough will be in the US, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book, “Artificial Intelligence Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order,” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Innovation Ventures and has invested in one of China’s leading artificial intelligence companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an artificial intelligence system that defeated the top American player, Othello, and later served as the head of Microsoft Research and president of Google’s China branch.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be to help find more insightful people.
Lee said that U.S. researchers often have to work hard to win state grants.
"It's not China that takes away academic leaders, it's companies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired bright minds from universities to work with artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. step up efforts on artificial intelligence.
“I think doctoral students working in artificial intelligence should be automatically offered green cards,” he said.
In July 2017, China’s State Council announced its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan.
In addition, Lee said, China’s National Fund for Natural Sciences funds people from academic institutions, much like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations give money to US scientists, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the establishment of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) announced a $2 billion investment for the AI Next initiative.
NSF is currently investing more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
But in the coming months, nothing has been done about U.S. legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change country's name
Macedonians voted Sunday in a referendum on whether to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, a move to resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that has blocked its bid to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, home to the Macedonian province, says its northern neighbour's name implies claims to Greek territory and has vetoed Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments agreed on a proposed new name, but opposition nationalists say the name change would harm the ethnic identity of the majority of Macedonia's Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, while the boycott campaign questioned whether turnout would reach the minimum of 50 percent required for the referendum to take effect.
Referendum question put on the voting card: "Are you in favour of membership in NATO and the EU after the agreement with Greece has been approved?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the collapse of Yugoslavia, it is worth paying the price to join institutions such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I came to vote for the future of the country, for Macedonian youth, so that they can live freely, protected by the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgiyevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough MPs said they would stick to the result and make it decisive.
Changing the name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state electoral commission said there were no reports of violations until 1 p.m.
But turnout stood at just 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of voters cast their ballots.
"I came to vote for my children, for our place in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, a voter in the 62-year-old capital Skopje.
Macedonian MP Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Du<0xC5><0xA1>ko are voting in a referendum in Macedonia to change the country's name, in order to pave the way for accession to NATO and the European Union. Macedonia, 30 September 2018
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small stage and pulling chairs in front of tents built by the boycotters.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads held up and not to enter through the servants' door," Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If you do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and take part in the integration of Eurasia."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent, will attract much-needed investment.
"I believe that the vast majority will be in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said.
He said the result, “Yes,” would be “guaranteeing our future.”
The poll, published by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research last Monday, said between 30 and 43 percent of voters were expected to take part in the referendum — less than the required turnout.
According to another poll conducted by the Macedonian TV channel Telma, 57 percent of respondents are expected to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For a referendum to be successful, 50 percent of voters must be present plus one vote.
Failing a referendum would be the first serious setback for the pro-Western government since it took power in May.
Watch: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero defeats all Brighton defense and profit goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton, and Manchester City on Saturday scored a 2-0 victory at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero scored in the 65th minute with seemingly incredible ease.
The Argentine forward received the ball in the middle of the field at the beginning of the offensive.
Before breaking into the open field, he ran among the three Brighton defenders.
Aguero was then surrounded by four players wearing green T-shirts.
He made his way through one of the defenders, having previously overtaken several others at the edge of Brighton's penalty area.
He then passed the ball to the left, where was Sterling.
The English striker returned the ball from the penalty area with one kick, and Aguero kicked the ball to the right of the net, beating Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan.
“Aguero has problems with his feet,” City CEO Pep Guardiola told reporters.
He said he would play for 55-60 minutes.
That's how it was.
We were lucky to have him in that moment.”
However, it was Sterling who helped the Sky Blues take the lead in this Premier League game.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball during the attack from the depths of the Brighton court.
Along the left side of the pitch between the two opponents, he nicely passed the ball to Leroy Sane.
Sane pushed the ball forward with a few kicks while Sterling pushed toward the far end.
The Sky Blues kicked the ball into the goal just before slipping out of the field.
On Tuesday at 12:55, City meets Hoffmann in the Champions League group game at the Rhein-Neckar Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a friendly against Rockies
After the Nationals fell out of the playoffs, there was no reason to force again.
Scherzer hopes to beat the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies still have a chance of remaining in the playoffs; they are one point ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West.
The Rockies, who beat the Nationals 5-2 on Friday night, at least secured a chance to win the pass, but will still have to work hard to secure the right to play in the first division.
“Although we’re playing for nothing, at least we can get on the court knowing that the atmosphere in Denver, where a crowd of people and another team will gather, will probably be at the highest level we’ll be able to reach this year.
Why not compete?”
The Nationals have not yet announced the starting line-up for Sunday's game, but they are clearly inclined to release Scherzer by throwing the ball.
Scherzer, who will be 34 in the cask at the start of the game, set himself up for practice Thursday and will take the role of a thrower on his usual day of rest, Sunday.

Short speech in West Virginia
Speaking about the turnout of Republican voters in the midterm elections, the president indirectly refers to the situation regarding the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
“Everything we have achieved will be on the scales in November.
We have five weeks left until the most important elections in our lives.
It’s very important, I’m not running... but I’m running, that’s why I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere,” he said.
“You see this horrible, horrible group of Democrats, you see this happening right now.
And they are willing to take back power by any means, you can see how low it is, how evil it is.
They don’t care what they’ve hurt, what they’ve climbed over to gain power and control; that’s what they really want — power and control — but we’re not going to give them that.”
The Democrats, he said, have a mission to "resist and hinder."
"And you've seen it over the last four days," he said, calling Democrats "angry, ugly, low-minded and unjust people."
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee, referring to Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein's name, which sparked a huge ovation from the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Have you leaked the document?
Uh, uh, how.
No, um... no, I’m waiting for one – it was really bad body language – the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Labour has lost its diversity of opinion.
They do not tolerate those who openly express their opinions.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to distrust me, it was hardly surprising.
Finally, I am the latest of Labour MPs to be told that I am not welcome – and that is for what I have said.
My fellow Member, Joan Ryan, has received similar threats as she has resolutely opposed anti-Semitism.
My distrust was expressed by criticising me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically, on similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
A statement on the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said: "We want the meetings to involve a large number of members and make the meetings productive."
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, that was exactly what GC meetings were like on Friday evening.
It is sad that the tone of many meetings today is not at all that, and the promises of a "softer, more pleasant" policy have long since been forgotten, even if it has ever been put into practice.
It is becoming increasingly clear that dissenting opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became party leader, and colleagues who share my political views, as I had previously believed, began to expect me to turn 180 degrees and stick to opinions I would never agree with, whether on national security or the EU’s single market.
Whenever I speak publicly — and it doesn’t even matter what — there is a tirade of insults on social media that encourages my recall, condemns the center’s policy, and says I don’t belong in the Labour Party.
And this is not just my experience.
In fact, I am much more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments directed at me are political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who have to endure an avalanche of sexist and racist insults every day.
One of the most disappointing things about this political era is how insults have become a normal phenomenon.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer the same party, and with every "distrust" procedure or change in the electoral system, this party is getting smaller and smaller.
Over the past two years, I’ve received a lot of advice that encourages me not to jump, not to speak so loudly, and then “everything will be fine.”
But that’s not why I went into politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a pupil provoked by the negligence of the Thatcher government, which literally failed my entire school class, I have sought to win better public services for those who need them most, whether as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I have never hidden my politics, including in the last election.
“No one in Nottingham East should have been surprised by my political opinions and areas of disagreement with current leaders.
To those who promoted this procedure on Friday, I can tell you that when a country digs into Brexit, which will hurt households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact one message I have in Nottingham Momentum for my constituents, members of the Labour Party (or not): I am proud to serve you and promise that no threat of revocation or political expediency will stop me from acting in accordance with my convictions and all your best interests.

Ayr-Melrose – 38:17 Invincible Ayr conquers the tops of the tables
Two late attempts distorted the final results, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved this moment of triumph in the stunning, breathtaking game of Tennent's Premiership Day.
Now the team is at the top of the table – the only one unbeaten.
Ultimately, they won with a perfect defense and well-executed opportunities, so coach Peter Murchie can really feel satisfied.
“We’ve raised all the tests in the game so far and we’re still unbeatable, so I’m really happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “Ayr performed well, the players took their chances better than we did.”
Grant Anderson's 14th minute attempt, which was completed by Frazier Climo, led Ayr to the front, but the yellow card for Rory Hughes, released by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to pick the numbers and Baggot to stop the unsuccessful attempt.
Climo increased Ayr's advantage by a fine when he scored points in the middle of the match and successfully completed a personal test, helping Ayr break out 17:5.
However, Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, effectively completed by Baggot, narrowed the gap to five points.
Ruaridh Knott suffered a severe injury and was transported from the pitch to a stretcher, and Ayr continued to push forward after Stafford McDowall's attempt was successfully completed by Climo.
Ayr Captain Blair Macpherson received a yellow card and Melrose tried to take advantage of the overabundance of players, but Bruce Colvine's attempt at the end of the fierce pressure was not successful.
The home team player returned, but when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for stopping Climo without a ball, MacPherson pushed the ball down the penalty line for the Ayr's continuing struggle.
Climo successfully ended his attempt, as he had done almost since restarting the game, after Kyle Rowe stopped David Armstrong's kick in the corner and prevented forward Gregor Henry from making his fifth home team attempt.
Still Game star appears ready to start a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kiernan appears ready to move into the hospitality industry after it emerged he had been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC comedy and co-writes and plays the script with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the final season of the show, and Kiernan seems to be already planning his life after Kraiglang.
According to official data, he became the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, although Scottish Sun sources suggested that Kiernan was looking for ways to get involved in Glasgow's "prosperous restaurant business."
'We own the sea': Bolivia jailed on land hopes court reopens its way to the ocean
Sailors patrol the naval headquarters in La Paz.
A blue ocean flag is flying on public buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, naval bases are adorned with the slogan: “The sea belongs to us by right.
It is our duty to get it back.”
Bolivia, trapped all over the land, still has vivid memories of the access to the ocean that Chile had to sacrifice in the 19th century’s bloody conflict over resources — a vivid and longing to reunite in the Pacific.
The hopes that have been built up in recent decades are now particularly strong, with Bolivia awaiting an International Court of Justice ruling on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia is focused in a spirit of unity and peace and of course hopes for positive results," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians across the country will watch the ICJ’s decision on big screens in the hope that the Hague Tribunal will make a positive decision on Bolivia’s complaint, with Chile obliged to negotiate sea access for the Bolivian state.
Evo Morales, the charismatic Bolivian president who faces a controversial re-election bid, is also very interested in the outcome of Monday's decision.
"We are very close to the opportunity to return to the Pacific," he said late August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in Bolivia’s favor, and that even if it did, little would change.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to delimit Chile's territory and said it would not determine the outcome of the talks.
The fact that the ICJ's decision will be made public only six months after the final arguments were heard is hardly an indication that the case was "not complicated," said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, Chile's expert in international law.
And even if Bolivia managed to make some progress, the last four years could have knocked it back.
"This issue of access to the sea has been illegally raised by the current Bolivian administration," Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
She believes that any remnants of Chile’s goodwill have been destroyed by Morales’ vengeful rhetoric.
Bolivia and Chile will extend the conversation at some point, but after all this it will be extremely difficult to discuss.
The country has not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, objected to the idea that the court's decision was taken at an unusually fast pace.
"On Monday, Bolivia will have a unique opportunity to enter into an era of new relations with Chile and to end 139 years of divisions for mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla has also denied that Morales is still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, and uses the sea issue as a political manipulation.
“Bolivia will never waive its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean,” he said.
“The solution is the opportunity to see that we have to come to terms with the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament is only possible if it can rely on the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho said his nation would never give up its nuclear weapons first if it could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to stick to the pledges made by rival leaders at a summit in Singapore.
His comments came as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared intent on resuming his stranded nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after meeting Kim in Singapore.
Ri says a “utopian dream” is that if sanctions continue and the US abandons the declaration on ending the Korean War, North Korea could one day be brought to its knees.
Washington has been reluctant to back the declaration unless Pyongyang first makes credible disarmament moves.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want to hold a second meeting.
But there is widespread scepticism that Pyongyang has no serious intention of giving up its arsenal, which the country seems to see as its only guarantee of security.
Pompeo is due to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare the ground for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
The Paris fashion show revealed that the latest trend is massive headgear, and they will soon conquer the nearest fashionable stores
If you want to supplement your hat collection or protect yourself from the sun, this trend is for you.
Designers Valentino and Thomas Browne presented a wide range of eccentrically large headgear in their spring-summer 2019 collections, and he literally stunned the viewers of Paris Fashion Week with his style.
These extremely impractical hats conquered Instagram this summer and these designers presented eye-catching creations on the podium.
Valentine's distinctive creation was a huge body-colored hat, decorated with a wide feather-like edge that enveloping the dummy's head.
Other non-standard-sized accessories include jeweled watermelons, a wizard’s hat, and even pineapple — but they’re not designed to keep your head from getting cold.
Thomas Browne also introduced a collection of strange masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many colorful masks were sewn with lips and more reminiscent of Hannibal Lecter than of high fashion.
One of the tracks looked like a diver's suit, with a tube and underwater glasses, and the other looked like a melted ice rink.
And if you follow this huge fashion trend, you will not ask.
Style experts guess that these huge covers can get into stores.
Large hats became popular with La Bomba high heels, straw hats with two-foot edges were already worn by everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand, which created impractical hats that conquered all social networks, released another huge creation on the podium – a straw beach bag, almost the same size as the model wearing a swimsuit.
The red-brick raffia bag, decorated with raffia tassels and a white leather handle, has become the exclusive highlight of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I think next summer, huge hats and beach bags will come to the stores because the designer has had such a big impact, so it’s hard to ignore the need for non-standard-sized accessories.”
John Edwards: “Language proficiency is a vital skill for the citizens of the world”
Scotland’s independent schools have broken records for academic achievement by staying the same way in 2018 and have once again demonstrated exceptional exam results, reinforced by individual and collective achievements in sports, the arts, music and other community endeavors.
With a total of more than 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the highest possible level of service to their pupils and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, for their chosen careers, and to be global citizens.
As we work in the education sector, which can design and implement the intended school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and are eagerly sought after in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you can talk to someone in a language they understand, they’ll understand you with their mind.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will speak to his heart.”
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely on English alone if we want to build relationships and build trust with people from other countries.
Based on the results of recent exams this year, we can say that languages are at the peak of popularity and have the best retention ratings in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of foreign language learners received the highest A score.
The data collected from 74 schools that are members of SCIS showed that 72 percent of students received the highest A rating during the Mandarin exam, the highest A rating was received by 72 percent of German learners, and the highest A rating was received by 69 percent of those who studied French and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland regard foreign language proficiency as an essential skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages as an elective are now considered as important as basic subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills found that of all the reasons employers struggled to fill jobs, 17% had insufficient language skills.
As a result, language skills are increasingly becoming a must for young people to be prepared for their future careers.
As languages will play a key role in future employability, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
No matter what career a person chooses to have a second language, he or she will be much better off in the future if he or she has these lifelong skills.
Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will make a person who speaks several languages much more competitive.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 per cent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to be interviewed, while French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage of people, i.e. 15 per cent.
That is why investing in language teaching is important for today’s children.
By learning several languages, especially in developing countries, children will have a better chance of meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school differs according to the language it teaches.
While a number of schools focus on more classical modern languages, others focus on languages that are considered the most important in the UK, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interests are, there will always be plenty of languages to choose from at an independent school with teaching staff and experts in the field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a teaching environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to live in the future.
It is undeniable that in today’s global business environment, languages remain vital for the country’s future, so this must be reflected in the education system as well.
In fact, modern languages should certainly be regarded as “international communication skills.”
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and performance to Scottish young people.
This must be done.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Board of Independent Schools
LeBron will begin his Lakers debut in San Diego on Sunday.
Fans can't wait to see LeBron James start the season with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play Sunday's opening match against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But exactly how many minutes it will take, it is not yet clear.
"It's going to be more than one minute and less than 48 minutes," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said on Twitter that James is likely to play for a limited time.
Earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers in six pre-season games.
"At this stage of my career, I no longer need pre-season games to prepare," he said.
Trump's speech in West Virginia on YouTube
President Donald Trump is starting his campaign tonight in Willing, West Virginia.
It’s the first of five Trump speeches planned for next week, including stops in friendly locations like Tennessee and Mississippi.
After approving the suspension of his Supreme Court nomination, Trump is seeking to rally support in the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans are threatened with losing control of Congress in November.
At what hour will Trump’s speech in West Virginia be held tonight, and how can I watch it online?
Trump's speech in Willing, West Virginia, scheduled for 7pm Eastern Time on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s speech in West Virginia online on YouTube below.
Trump is likely to touch on the topic of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh this week as she has sown a lot of tension over allegations of sexual misconduct after the Senate voted to suspend nominations for up to a week while the FBI is conducting an investigation.
But the campaign's primary goal is to help Republicans gain some strength ahead of the November election.
President Trump’s campaign said the goal of the five meetings next week was to “energize volunteers and supporters as Republicans seek to defend and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Congressional control is so high on his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as the very hot season of the campaign begins,” a Trump campaign spokesman said.
"The speech planned for tonight at Wiling's Wesbanco Arena is expected to attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and grab the attention of the Pittsburgh media," the West Virginia Metro News said.
On Saturday, Trump will make his second visit to West Virginia, the state where he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Senate candidate, Republican Patrick Morrisey, who is at the bottom of the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president had to come to the top of the ratings," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team is belligerent and looking forward to Sunday's singles
After three personal rounds on Saturday afternoon, the fours may be exactly what was needed during this Ryder Cup tournament.
Such a swing of luck is completely fictional, but players really believe it, especially in competitions like this one.
On whose side is success now?
"They were six points ahead and now four points, so I guess we can see it as a bit of a success," said Jordan Spieth, as he prepared for the day.
Of course, Europe is in the lead, has a four-point lead, and there are still twelve games to go.
American enthusiasm, according to Spieth, fades, and they do not lack for it, not to mention the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each scored three points out of four.
Spieth was invincible from beginning to end and was flawlessly ahead.
As the round continued, Thomas scored two points out of a possible two in an attempt to draw the fourth round.
His strike, which won them a victory at the 15th hole, was accompanied by similar shouts, which seemed to say the American team was not yet in danger of ending.
“You just have to focus on your game and take care of it,” Spieth said.
Now each of these players is played separately.
At the end of the day, there are 18 holes.
The only players to score more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last few days are Francesco Molinaris and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story behind the Ryder Cup.
Strangely enough, but charming couple from Europe have collected four points out of four possible and can rest easy.
Moliwood was the only couple who didn’t need extra punches not only on Saturday afternoon, but also on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning.
That turn of events and the reaction of raging spectators only confirms that they are the players who will win Sunday, and no one else will achieve the same popularity as Fleetwood or Molinari, who, with the last rays of the setting sun on the Le Golf National field, have a chance of securing Europe's victory.
It would be good to have both at the same time.
It is too early to talk about the glory of Europe.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson briefly played with Sergio Garcia, the morning four-ball hero when he was paired with Alex Noren.
An additional blow and two double additional blows in the first nine holes of the series plunged the Spaniard and the Swede into trouble, from which they never managed to get out.
No one will get in trouble on Sunday.
Four-ball and four-ball matches are so interesting to watch because of the interaction between the couples, because of the advice they give and don’t give, and because the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe played better as a team, so it made it to the finals with determination, but this round of four also showed that the US team has a fighter’s backbone, which some, especially in the states, doubted.
On the last day of the Ryder Cup, Europe is ahead 10:6
Europe will take a big lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup, with a 10:6 lead over the United States after Saturday's quarterfinals.
The inspiring duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinario continued to heat the atmosphere, winning two victories against the hard-fought Tiger Woods and taking the lead at Le Golf National by four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, in an attempt to save the trophy they lost to Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the morning four-game match against the unsuccessful American side and finished the round 3:1.
U.S. shows more resistance in four games after winning two games but failing to score points
Jim Furyk's half needs eight points from Sunday's 12-piece match to keep the trophy in his hands.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four consecutive points when he and Molinar doubled Molliwood after a sensational weekend, and they are only the second pair to score four points in their first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fours, they beat the trustless Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even better result of 5:4.
Woods, who did not finish two games on Saturday, showed a high level of professionalism at some points, but had already lost 19 and 29 of his four games, seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose rested and returned to play with partner Henrik Stenson in the morning fours, beating 2-1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka in the first and third place in the world rankings.
Despite a pleasant day in the south-west of Paris with a gentle breeze, Europe was not all about butter.
Three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the bar for the Americans after winning two points on Saturday.
In a four-ball match, they won a tough 2:1 victory against Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter, and in a four-ball match, they defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4:3 without knocking the ball into the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history, the team managed to win a four-point lead in single matches, although Furyko's half-draws would be enough to keep the trophy.
Although the two days were in second place, Sunday’s success seems to have turned away from them.
North Korea Says It Will Not Disarm Unilaterally Without Confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were deepening their mistrust of the United States and that under such circumstances the country would certainly not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri told the General Assembly that North Korea has taken "significant measures of good will" over the past year, including halting nuclear missile tests, dismantling its nuclear test base and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We have not received a similar response from the US side," he said.
“Without any confidence in the U.S., we will not be able to rely on our national security, and under no circumstances will we unilaterally disarm the former.”
While Ri repeated past complaints about Washington’s opposition to a phased approach to nuclear disarmament that would reward North Korea in phases, his statement stood out because he did not entirely rule out the idea of bilateral disarmament, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri alluded to a joint statement made by Kim and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work on "disarmament of the Korean peninsula" and Trump pledged to ensure North Korea's security.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also refused to ease tough international sanctions against North Korea.
“The U.S. is demanding nuclear disarmament first and is increasing pressure with sanctions to achieve its goal through coercive methods, even by renouncing the declaration of an end to the war,” he said.
To think that sanctions can bring us to our knees is like chasing utopian dreams for people who don’t care.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions are exacerbating our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which was highlighted by the US leader at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, he highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months: “If another country on the issue of nuclear disarmament were South Korea rather than the United States, the issue of nuclear disarmament on the Korean peninsula would not have come to such a dead end.”
But Ri’s tone changed dramatically compared to last year when he told the UN General Assembly that when “Mr. President Evil” Trump called Kim a “rocket gentleman” on a suicide mission, it was absolutely inevitable that North Korea’s missiles would be directed at the United States.
At the United Nations this year, Trump, who last year threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, boasted of Kim’s courage to take steps toward disarmament, but said there was still much to be done and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea meets the demands for nuclear disarmament.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timeline for doing so, saying that “if it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia have said the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
But US Secretary of State Mike Pomeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that “Security Council sanctions must be resolutely continued without concessions until complete and conclusive evidence-based nuclear disarmament has taken place.”
The Security Council unanimously approved sanctions against North Korea since 2006 aimed at preventing funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to loosen the ground for another meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the trip has failed.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying all progress had been made only to allow North Korea to announce a few hours later that it had made "gangster demands".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea vowed to dismantle its missile base and nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
Kim said the "appropriate measures" he was seeking were security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and a move to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Learn to Rest Enough
A new course at Harvard University this year encouraged all of its students to sleep more in order to combat the growing culture of macho in studies, caffeine consumption, and staying awake at night
One academic found that in the best university in the world, students often do not even have a basic knowledge of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and Brigham City, a specialist in women’s hospitals, has prepared a course that he says is the first of its kind in the United States.
The inspiration to prepare this course visited him after talking about the effects of lack of sleep on learning.
“At the end of the talk, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why am I only being told about this now, in the final year of my studies?’
She said no one had told her the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course is offered for the first time this year. It explains to students how the most important habits of quality sleep help to achieve academic and sports results, improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services department, said the university decided to offer the course after it found that students were severely short of sleep during the week.
The hour-long course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section is a photo of the dorm room, where students can click on a cup of coffee, curtains, exercise equipment and books to learn about the effects of caffeine, light, how lack of sleep affects sports performance, and how important going to bed routines are.
In the next section, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons that encourage participants to reflect on their daily routines.
“We understand that this will not immediately change the behavior of the students.
But we think they have a right to know – just as you have a right to know the health consequences when you choose to smoke,” explained Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride not to sleep through the night, according to him, still exists. Modern technology and increasing pressure on students led to the growing problem of lack of sleep.
“Ensuring students get enough and get a good night’s sleep should be their secret weapon in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety,” he said, “even to avoid gaining weight because lack of sleep switches the brain to starvation mode, so students are constantly hungry.”
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler take the course when he attended one of his courses last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to ask for an affordable course for the entire campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to invite all postgraduate students to take this course before they start attending this competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advised students to set an alarm clock for when it’s time to go to sleep, just as it’s time to go to bed, and to beware of the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic devices and LED lights, as they can knock your circadian rhythm out of balance, which can make it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston 1:0 Rangers: Menga goal upset Gerrard's men
The Rangers experienced another disappointment when Dolly Mengai Livingstone managed to beat the weakened Steven Gerrard 1:0.
Ibrox had hoped to score their first away win after a 4:1 St Johnstone victory in February, but Gary Holt's team beat Gerrard for the second time in 18 games as manager and now the latter's team is eight points behind those of the far-flung Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, but the uninspired Rangers didn't see a chance to even out the score.
The Rangers are now in sixth place, Livingston are in third place, behind Hibernian by only one goal.
And Rangers' troubles don't end there, because it's likely the butter from the stands hit Judge Calum Spencer in the head and hurt him.
Gerrard made four changes that allowed him to overtake Ayr and lead to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt trusted the same eleven-year-old who took the point from Hearts last week and would have liked how his well-thought-out combinations would have chained opponents every step of the way.
The Rangers dominated the game, but Livingston did more with the ball.
They were able to score as early as the second minute, when Menga, in a close shot, passed the ball to Allan McGregor's goalkeeper Scott Pittman, but the midfielder ruined his chances by kicking the ball away from the goal.
After Keaghan Jacobs's long-range free kick, the ball hit Captain Craig Halkett, but his fellow defender Alan Lithgow begged him to leave.
The Rangers took control, but the last third of the game was just hope, not belief in their game.
Fifteen minutes later, Alfredo Morelos thought he deserved the penalty when he faced Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson dropped the Colombian complaint.
Rangers only managed to score twice in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly frightened by Lassana Coulibaly's headstroke or the gentle roll of Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livi’s 34th minute goal may not have matched the game, no one will argue that they deserved it for their efforts alone.
The Rangers have once again failed to defeat Jacobs's clumsy defense.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his temper and passed it to Menga for an easy finish.
During the break, Gerrard took action by changing Coulibaly to Ryan Kent, and that change almost immediately bore fruit when the winger played Morelos, but Kelly bounced back after an impressive game.
Livingston brought the guests into the game they loved, with long-range passes of Lithgowo and Halkett.
Holt's team was able to increase its lead in the end, but McGregor defended against Jacobs's strike after Lithgow's feed from around the corner.
Rangers player Glenn Middleton returned to the pitch after a penalty shootout with Jacobs at the end of the game, but Thomson again ignored him.
Almanac: Inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning almanac: September 30, 1882, today it is 136 years ago and MORE... That day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity. The invention, on the basis of which a device was later developed, is known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, the device has become a hit in the scientific world and later a hit in popular culture, when cowboy-like scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans starred in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado:
Man: “What the hell is that?”
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can actually hear the atoms that touch the radioactive minerals.”
Evans: “Hey, now it’s really shooting!”
Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that got his name continues to exist.
A new cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to see bad cells
A new cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to see bad cells and kill them
Vaccine Teaches Immune System to Recognize Bad Cells as Part of Treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their replacement in the laboratory
The cells can then ‘see’ the proteins found in many cancers and are then injected back into the body.
The trial vaccine has shown promising results in treating patients with various forms of cancer.
One woman treated with this vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells, has been missing ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The technique involves extracting the immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory, then the cells can see the proteins that are characteristic of HER2 type cancers and inject them back again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
“HER2 promotes the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung, and rectal,” explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, where immune cells are extracted from patients and are trained to target cancer cells, has been successfully applied in the treatment of leukemia.
Kanye West kicked off a short supporting tirade wearing a MAGA cap after his appearance on the SNL show.
It's not over
After the incoherent performance, the Saturday Night Live studio's audience shamed Kanye West with shouts of praise for US President Donald Trump; he said he would take part in the 2020 campaign.
After performing his third song "Ghost Town" that night, wearing a "Make America Great" cap, he continued to denounce Democrats and expressed support for Trump.
“How many times I’ve talked to white people, they’ve said, ‘How can you like Trump because he’s a racist?’
Well, if racism were a concern for me, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL show began with a comic scene in which Matt Damon mocked Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on sexual misconduct allegations by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the footage with West's replicas was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not clear if Rock was trying to make fun of West with this recording.
West also complained to the audience that he was having trouble behind the scenes with his head covering.
“They mocked me in the backstage.
He told me not to wear that hat.
They made fun of me!
They said I had reached the bottom," he told the Washington Examiner.
West continued, “Do you want to see what the bottom is? <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> He asked. <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> I wear my superman hat, and that means you can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to live?
“Start to love.”
His remarks sparked at least two outcry in the audience, and members of the SNL broadcast looked embarrassed, as Variety reports. One person told the media: "A deadly silence has prevailed throughout the studio."
West was called in to quickly replace singer Ariana Grande after her ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, passed away a few days ago.
West was a bit perplexed by his performance of the song "I Love It" in a Perrier bottle suit.
He received support from Candace Turner, leader of the conservative IPUSA group, who posted on Twitter: "To one of the bravest spirits of man: THANK YOU TO THE PEOPLE FOR THEIR SHIPPING."
But talk show host Karen Hunter posted on Twitter that West was just "being herself and it's super awesome."
“But I choose NOT to reject a person (by buying his music or his clothes or by supporting his ‘art’) whose beliefs are a poisonous ideology that harms my community.
He's free.
But we are also free," she added.
Before the show began, the rapper announced on Twitter that his name had changed and that he was now formally known as Kanye West.
He was not the first developer to change his name, but he followed the same path that Diddy had already taken, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
Colleague rapper Snoop Dogg was originally called Snoop Lyons; music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and later became known as Prince.
Indictment for attempted knife attack at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after he was stabbed in the east of Belfast on Friday.
According to police, the incident took place in Balihakamore.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the prosecutor.
'Game of Thrones' Star Another Harington Criticizes Perverted View of Masculinity
Another Harrington became famous as a sword-waving character John Snow in HBO's fantasy adventure series about the Middle Ages, Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor criticizes the stereotype of the macho hero. He says that such roles on the screen often make young boys feel as if they have to be tough to be respected.
Speaking to the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he thought “something was wrong” and wondered how to deal with the problem of misplaced masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Another, who recently married her 31-year-old "Game of Thrones" star Rose Leslie, said the topic was "deeply touching" on him.
“I feel that I am now strongly affected by this topic. Where did we make the mistake of cultivating masculinity?” <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> he asked.
“What do we teach growing men that we face problems like this?”
Another believes that television could be partly responsible for this wave of distorted masculinity, as it creates very masculine characters.
He continued: “What is innate, and what is learned?
What is taught on television or on the street that young people are convinced that this type of masculinity must be distinguished?
I think this is one of the important questions of our time – how do we change this?
“I think we made a mistake with the boys.”
He also confirmed in an interview that he would not take part in any prehistory or sequels to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying "it has enough battlefields and horses."
From November Next will be filming in the modern version of Sam Shepard's "True West". This is a film about a filmmaker and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently revealed the best thing that happened to him in creating Game of Thrones – there he met his wife Rose.
“I met my wife in this series, and in that sense, the series gave me a future family and a life to go on with,” he said.
In the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series, Rose played Igrite, the object of the love of John Snow, another character.
The couple married in June 2018 at a property owned by the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China reports an increase of 14% in the number of citizens infected with HIV/AIDS.
According to health authorities, more than 820,000 people were infected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most newly infected people have been sexually transmitted, and this is different from the statistics of the past.
Traditionally, HIV infection has spread rapidly in parts of China due to transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people living with HIV fell to almost zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, over time, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased to 100,000 people.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a sensitive issue in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
Because conservative values prevail in the country, 70-90% of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
Most cases of infection with this disease are due to inadequate protective measures during such sexual intercourse.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as one way to combat the problem.
Maxine Waters denies employees leaked Republican senator data, condemns 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'
US Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that one of her staff had published the personal information of three Republican US senators on lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the charges were brought by ultra-right-wing experts and websites.
“A lie, a lie, and again a despicable lie,” Waters said on Twitter.
The information also reportedly included the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatcho, both of Utah.
The information was released online Thursday by an unknown on Capitol Hill while allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh were being investigated in the Senate.
The leaked information came shortly after the three senators asked Kavanaugh questions.
"Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, have reported that the IP address used to identify the source of these records was associated with the Waters office and Waters employee information was disclosed," the statement reads.
“These unsubstantiated allegations are completely false and utter lies,” Waters continued.
"A member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised by these fraudulent and bogus allegations is in no way responsible for leaking this information.
These unsubstantiated allegations are completely false and utter lies.”
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial sounds angry,” Fleischer wrote.
“It says she doesn’t have enough self-control to be a member of Congress.
If someone is accused of things he has not done, he should not be angry.
He should not defend.
He should not question the accuser’s motives.
He should be calm and humble.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters’ reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of appearing too angry at Thursday’s hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is campaigning in the midterm elections to replace the Waters, also made his remarks on Twitter.
“True, if not false,” he wrote.
In a statement, Waters said its office had informed the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies of the false charges.
“We will ensure that the organizers are brought to justice, <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> she continued, <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> that they are legally accountable for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to all my employees without exception.”
A Review of ‘Johnny English Strikes Again’ – Exhaled Spy Parody with Rowan Atkinson
It has become a tradition to look for Brexit hints in any British film. The same seems to be true of the revival of the action-spy comedy franchise Johnny English - "Johnny English" was launched back in 2003 and returned to the screens in 2011 with the comedy "The Resurrection of John English".
Will this sarcastic auto-saturation about how clearly we failed become a new national export opportunity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English has a second chance with his wide-eyed and rubber-faced face to bring unpleasant truths to the surface <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> after all, the name itself clearly indicates that this comedy work is intended for non-English-speaking cinematographic regions.
Of course, this stupid undercover agent, who, despite his claims to luxury, has acquired some of Inspector Clouseau's qualities, some of Mr. Bean's traits, and a bit of resemblance to that guy, alluded to in the theme of the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony for the play, "Carriages of Fire."
It is also somewhat based on a character about a traveler and a mysterious man who caused the chaos that Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercial.
There are a few good moments in this latest Johnny English movie.
I liked it when Johnny English was approaching the helicopter wearing a medieval suit and armor, and the rotor of the blades hit his helmet.
Atkinson's comedic talent is obvious, but the humor itself seems exuberant and strangely overblown, especially when serious movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible boldly incorporate elements of comedy.
The humor is more for children than for adults, and Johnny English’s mischievous adventures don’t seem as inventive and as purposeful as Atkins’ silent jokes in Mr. Bean’s play.
The most common problem is that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has successfully hacked Britain’s top-secret spy network and revealed the identities of all British spies in the area, sparking the agent’s outrage at Kevin Eldon’s over-the-top role.
This is the final drop in the cup of the prime minister, a pompous and cornered character who is already suffering from overwhelming political unpopularity: Emma Thompson of Theresa May squeezes out everything she can, but there is not much good material for that in the script.
Wise advisers inform her that the identity of all her agents has been revealed and that she will have to search for people among the retired.
That means you're going to have to turn to Johnny English himself, who's now a school principal in some fancy office, but who's giving illegal lessons on how to work as a secret agent, and there were some good jokes when English proposed a school of rock-like spies academy.
English is sent back to Whitehall to discuss the state of emergency and there he meets his longtime co-star Bough, once again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man associated with the submarine commander, and Vicki Pepperdine, who plays a high society girl, the talent seems underutilized.
So Batman and Robin, able to mess things up in Her Majesty's Secret Service, take action again and meet with Olga Kurylenko's fatally beautiful Ophelia Buletova.
The prime minister has a dangerously charismatic billionaire who says he can solve Britain’s computer problem, the villainous Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on their odyssey: dressed as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant, cause chaos on a luxury Volta yacht, and English embarks on a complete anarchy, trying to use virtual reality headsets to explore the interior of Volta’s house.
All of the stop frames were clearly reserved for this last series, but no matter how pleasant or wild it is, it all reminds a lot of children’s television.
Quite average.
As with Johnny English’s other films, I couldn’t get rid of the idea: isn’t the British film industry capable of giving Rowan Atkinson a role that truly deserves his talent?
Labour denies it is working on a four-day-a-week plan to pay for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is planning to consider a radical plan that would allow Britons to work four days a week but pay for five days.
The party says it wants executives to share the savings generated by the AI revolution by giving its employees a day off.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend while bringing home the same amount of salary.
The source said the idea was in line with the party's economic agenda and plans to steer the country's development in an employee-friendly direction.
The move to a four-day week was also welcomed by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: “The policy review is expected by the end of the year.
It won’t happen overnight, but the four-day week fits in with the party’s approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party is not the first to promote the idea, and the Greens have also promised to do so during the four-day week of the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this idea is not supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: "The four-day week is not party politics and it is not considered in the party."
Shadow government spokesman John McDonnell took the opportunity to present his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy at a Labour party conference last week.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to retake power from "faceless dictators" and "profit hunters" in utility companies.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not get their full share back because the Labour government can deduct something if it sees a grievance.
He also approved plans to include employees on the company’s board and create inclusive equity funds so that 10% of the capital of private sector companies is transferred to employees, and they could receive up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 in annual dividends.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy answer '60 Minutes' question about whether an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI’s investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed for at least a week the final vote on whether to put him to the Supreme Court, raising the question of whether the findings of the Bureau of Investigation could affect the opinions of any Republican senators so that they would not support the judge.
Scott Pelley, the 60 Minutes correspondent for Sunday's interview, asks Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it could happen that the FBI is going to figure out something that will change their minds.
Senator Kennedy seems to be more relaxed than his South Carolina counterpart.
"Well, yes, of course," Kennedy said.
“As I said when I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
When this happened, when these accusations came out, I called him and asked, "Did you do that?"
He answered decisively, firmly, unequivocally.”
So Mr Graham's opinion seems to have been changed by nothing.
“I’ve decided on Brett Kavanaugh, it would need really shocking accusations,” he says.
“As for Dr. Ford, I don’t know what it was, but I know one thing: Brett categorically denies it,” Graham said.
“No one she says can confirm it.
It has been 36 years.
I don’t think anything new will come out.”
What is the World Festival of Citizens and has it contributed in any way to the reduction of poverty?
This Saturday in New York City, the World Citizen’s Festival is an annual music event with an impressive number of stars and an equally impressive goal of eradicating global poverty.
For the seventh year in a row, the World Citizen Festival will gather tens of thousands of people on the Great Meadows of Central Park who will not only listen to such stars as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but will also spread the message about the event’s true goal – to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Civic Festival was launched in 2012 as a follow-up to the Global Poverty Eradication Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless they wanted to buy a paid VIP ticket), concert attendees had to perform a variety of tasks or actions, such as volunteering, sending an email to the world leader, making a phone call, or otherwise making a meaningful contribution to raising awareness of their goal of eradicating poverty.
However, are the world’s citizens succeeding in achieving this goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really going to convince them to demand and urge them to act? Maybe this is just another example of so-called klictivism, bogus activism – people think that it will really change the situation by signing an online petition or posting a post on Twitter.
According to the organizers of the World Citizen's Festival, since 2011 the movement has registered more than 19 million of its supporters' actions that promote the implementation of a wide variety of goals.
Under pressure, world leaders have announced $37 billion in commitments and policies that will transform the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and statements triggered by the group’s actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or raised.
The group estimates that nearly 649 million people worldwide have been directly affected by the bailout.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and promoters to “help children grow up and reach their full potential.” With more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens, she promised to provide Rwanda with US dollars to help tackle malnutrition in the country.
"With the support of the UK government, sponsors, governments and people like you, the citizens of the world, we can make social injustices like malnutrition a thing of the past," nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told a crowd in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after receiving 5,000 appeals to improve the nutrition of mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funding for the “Nutrition Power” project, which will reach 5 million women and children through nutritional interventions.
By replying to one of the FAQs on our website asking ‘Why do you think we can eliminate extreme poverty?’,
The world’s citizens respond: “It’s a long and difficult road, and sometimes we will stumble and fail.
But like the great human rights and anti-apartheid movements, we will win because together we are stronger.”
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e – these are some of the artists taking part in this year’s event in New York. The event will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
Home Secretary Says US Could Use Navy to Block Russian Energy Exports
"If necessary, Washington can use the navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching the markets, as well as the markets of the Middle East," said US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke.
Zinke said Russia's involvement in Syria, especially when it acts at the behest of the legitimate authorities, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think that Russia is meddling in the Middle East because it wants to regulate energy as it does in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe," Zinke said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to solve this issue.
"The United States can do this through the navy, can keep the sea lanes open and, if necessary, can enforce the blockade, make sure that their energy doesn't reach the market," he said.
Zinke said this at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group calling itself the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He then compared Washington’s methods to those used in dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they were essentially the same.
"The economic alternative between Iran and Russia is to find a greater or lesser counterweight to replace fuel," he said, calling Russia a country whose entire economy depends solely on fossil fuels.
The announcements came as the Trump administration pursues a mission to increase its exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe and replace Russia in the market, which offers European consumers a much cheaper option.
That’s why Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the alleged Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says has made Berlin a prisoner of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion-euro Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is just an economic project.
According to the Kremlin, Washington's fierce opposition to the project is purely economic and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we all agree that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and that consumers should have a choice of suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position received a hostile reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its determination to continue the project.
Germany's main industrial organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the US not to interfere in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I strongly oppose third-country interference in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously consider running for president in 2020
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would seriously consider running for president after mid-term elections.
At a meeting at Holyoke City Hall in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed she would consider running.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington to run our failed government, and they must go to the highest office,” she said.
"After November 6, I will seriously consider whether to participate in the presidential election."
During a meeting in the town hall, Warren slammed President Donald Trump for taking the country in the wrong direction.
“I am very scared of the way Donald Trump treats our democracy,” she said.
Warren openly criticizes Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "there is a clear need for an FBI investigation before the vote."
But a poll released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren’s own voters believe she shouldn’t run for president in 2020.
According to a survey conducted by the Center for Political Research at Suffolk University and the Boston Globe, 58 percent of likely Massachusetts voters say the senator should not vote.
Thirty-two percent support her candidacy.
The poll found that former governor Deval Patrick received more support, with 38 percent in favor and 48 percent against.
Other top Democratic candidates for 2020 were former vice president Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make a formal decision in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin speaks about Track Palin’s post-traumatic disorder at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, who joined the military in September, spent a year in Iraq.
In the case of domestic violence on Monday night, he was arrested and charged.
"I see what my son is going through, what he's going through on his return to everyday life, so I understand the other families that are feeling the effects of this post-traumatic disorder, and the kind of injury our soldiers are coming back to," she told a rally of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a shunned truth, saying his son and other war veterans "are coming back a little bit changed, they're coming back with a harder heart, they're coming back in doubt of getting respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots and all the other soldiers have given to their country."
He was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska on Monday on charges of domestic violence and assault on a woman, and on charges of obstruction to report domestic violence with a gun and drunkenness, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States and the District of Columbia Support Opposition to New Asylum Seekers Policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia have backed a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that refuses to grant asylum to victims of gang violence or domestic violence.
On Friday in Washington, 18 states and the county filed amicus curiae to support the challenge of asylum policy, NBC News reported.
The applicant’s full name in Grace v. Sessions, which the American Civil Liberties Union launched against federal politics, is not disclosed.
She says her partner "and members of his criminal gang" have abused her, but US authorities rejected her asylum request on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Graz have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which the U.S. receives many asylum applications, as states plagued by persistent gang violence and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned the Immigration Appeals Board’s 2014 decision allowing undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy “does not respect decades of national, federal and international law.”
"Federal law requires that decisions on applications for asylum be made on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a prohibition violates this principle," amicus curiae said in a note.
In the note, the lawyers also argue that immigration-ban policies are hurting the U.S. economy, and that immigrants are more likely to do business and “provide the necessary work services.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to stop granting asylum to victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
“Asylum is granted to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality, or membership of a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in a June 11 policy statement.
Asylum has never been about solving all the problems (not all the serious problems) that people around the world face on a daily basis.
With the death toll in Palu doubling, a desperate search has been made for survivors.
The situation of the rest of the living is constantly deteriorating.
“The tension is very high,” said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, calming her fever-causing baby son at the evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“The ambulances are carrying more and more bodies.
It lacks clean water.”
It has been noticed that residents return to their destroyed homes, collect water-soaked items, try to save what they can find.
Hundreds of people have been injured and the damaged 7.5-magnitude earthquake hospitals are congested.
Some of the injured, like Dwi Harris, who suffered shoulder and back fractures, were placed outside the Palu military hospital, where patients are being treated outside as strong aftershocks continue.
His eyes filled with tears as he told how he felt a violent earthquake in the room on the hotel's fifth floor, where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save others.
I think I made it through the ruins of the wall," Harry told the Associated Press, adding that he had come to the city with his family to attend the wedding.
"I heard my wife's cry for help, then silence.
I don’t know what happened to her and her daughter.
I hope they are healthy.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of Terrifying Propaganda
A week later, when China’s official newspaper ran a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper praising the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump last Wednesday cited a premium paid by the China Daily to Iowa's top-selling newspaper, Des Moines Register, accusing China of seeking to influence the November 6 US congressional elections, an accusation China denies.
"Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to influence the US election marks a new stage in Washington's growing campaign to put pressure on China," US officials told Reuters.
While it is common for foreign governments to spread advertising to boost trade, Beijing and Washington are engaged in a growing trade war, and both sides are grappling with tariffs on each other’s imports.
According to Chinese and U.S. experts, China's retaliatory tariffs targeted exporters in Iowa and similar states who backed the Trump Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China, a former long-term governor of Iowa and one of the biggest exporters of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
In an opinion piece published Sunday in the Des Moines Register, Mr Branstad said China "is making even more of a mockery by starting to print propaganda ads in our free press."
“As part of the propaganda, the Chinese authorities took advantage of freedom of speech and freedom of the press, which is respected in America, and ordered a paid advertisement called ‘Des Moines Register’,” Branstad wrote.
“Meanwhile, at a local newsstand in Beijing, you won’t find opposing voices and you won’t get a true picture of the different opinions that the Chinese people may have about China’s alarming economic trajectory, because the press is under the hard skin of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
Branstad added that "one of China's best-known newspapers has eluded the printing offer" of his article, without mentioning which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn Kavanaugh fiasco deterred by Republican voter ahead of midterm elections
While many Republican leaders remain loyal to Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has been indicted on several counts of sexual harassment, the analyst warned that it would face a negative response in the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
The situation is very emotional, and many Republicans have already officially said they want to vote.
Such things cannot be taken back later,” said Grant Reeher, a professor at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, in an article published Saturday in The Hill.
Reeher said he doubted whether Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute calls for an FBI investigation would be enough to appease angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will remember it both tomorrow and in November," said military Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national representative for the progressive MoveOn group.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" during a demonstration in the Senate lobby when the Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee chose to nominate Kavanaugh despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic said.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go too far,” said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst.
People say she was already strong, and they are right.
But it could further strengthen its position, especially among undecided female voters in suburban areas and younger voters between the ages of 18 and 29 who, although they don’t like the president, often just don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony, when she detailed the allegations of sexual harassment against a Supreme Court candidate, analysts said that if Republicans approved the candidacy, it could spark outrage.
"It caused a lot of confusion for the Republican Party," former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele said early last week, according to NBC News.
“This is not just about the committee or the final vote, not just about whether Kavanaugh will be appointed as a judge, but about how Republicans have handled the situation and how they have handled Ford,” said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps Democrats in the election.
Still, the Americans seem to be at odds over what to believe after Kavanaugh and Ford’s testimony, even though she gets a little more support.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents believe, or are likely to believe, the testimony of Ford, while 35 percent say they believe, or are likely to believe, in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh had lied, or was likely lied, in his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
At Flake's instigation, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's charges and the testimony of at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, alleging that Kavanaugh assaulted her when she was 17 when she was drunk.
Ramirez says the Supreme Court nominee showed her his genitals at a party they attended while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the web is planning to create a new Internet to counter Google and Facebook
Inventor Tim Berners-Lee is developing a new startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of this legendary inventor, is a company whose work is based on Berners-Lee's open-source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored, as well as who has access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt’s goal was to take over the world.
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup.
It’s a historic moment.”
Solid technology-based app allows people to create their own personal online data store (POD).
It may contain lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal or work equipment.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify being available in one browser at the same time.
The online store of personal data is unique in that only the user decides who and which information can access it.
The company calls this personal empowerment through data.
According to CEO John Bruce, Inrupt’s idea is to provide the resources, processes, and skills needed to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, several programmers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
As of this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools provided on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team were not discussing with Facebook or Google changes that would turn all business models upside down overnight.
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
In a Medium report on Saturday, Berners-Lee said Inrupt’s “mission is to provide trading energy and an ecosystem that will help protect the robustness and quality of the new Solid-based network.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet at Massachusetts University of Technology by founding the Web Consortium.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had an influential voice in the debate about Internet neutrality.
Even with Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m very optimistic about this new era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernardas Vannas was awarded the Victoria Cross in the First World War
On the occasion of the 100th anniversary, the only Anglican clergyman to be awarded the Victoria Cross as a fighter during World War I was honoured in his hometown.
Lieutenant-Colonel Pastor Bernardas Bathas was awarded the award on September 29, 1918, during the attacks of Belenglize and Loucourt.
Unfortunately, after four days, the pastor was shot dead by a sniper, so he did not know that he was awarded the highest level of the British army award.
At the parade in Rachaelden, Northamptonshire, two grandchildren uncovered the memory stone.
Michael Bath, one of the grandchildren, said the discovery of the stone 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning feat was "splendidly symbolic".
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, a lieutenant colonel led his battalion across the St. Kent Canal "in very thick fog, with heavy fire on guns and machine guns."
He then hurried to the firing line and led the line "extremely gallantly", then attacked the cannon alone and killed three of the squad's fighters.
Lieutenant Colonel B. Vann was shot dead by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Bath, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something that will never compare to itself, but at the same time, a very inspiring act of humility."
After a parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra, Micheal and his brother Dr. James Bath laid a wreath.
Micheal Bath said it was a great honour for him to take part in the parade, adding: "The courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that many people will give."
MMA fans didn’t go to bed all night to see Bellator 206, but had to settle for Peppa Pig.
Imagine: you don’t go to bed all night to see the crammed Bellator 206, but ultimately you don’t get to watch the main scene.
There were 13 fights in the San Jose poster, six of them on the main card and broadcast live in the UK all night on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared for the battle, viewers in the UK were stunned by the video “Peppa the Pig”.
Some viewers, to put it mildly, were not impressed, because it was precisely because of this fight that they did not go to sleep until early in the morning.
On Twitter, one of the supporters called the replacement of the broadcast with a children's cartoon "some kind of morbid joke."
“According to the government’s rules, such content is inappropriate at 6 a.m., so we had to turn on the kids’ app,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications.
"Yes, "Peppy Pig."
Bellator president Scott Coker said that in the future, efforts will be made to adjust the schedules according to viewers in the UK.
“When I think about repetition, it seems to me that we could probably do it,” Coker said.
“But then it’s 6 a.m., Sunday, and we wouldn’t be able to fix it by Sunday our time, Monday their time.
However, we are already working on this.
Believe me, with the change in the broadcast, a lot of messages were exchanged, which were not all friendly.
We tried to correct the situation, we thought it was a technical error.
But no, it is a question of power.
I can promise you that this will not happen next time.
We will reduce the number of fights to five instead of six, as we usually do. We wanted to give more to the fans, but simply did not succeed.
This is an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels Inadequate About His Sexual Orientation
Olympic water jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexual orientation, but that gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he only realized in elementary school that he was not the same as everyone else.
For the first time on Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, Lauren Laverne said he had started talking publicly about gay rights because he wanted to give hope to others.
He also said that when he became a father, it was not so important to win the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the regular host of this long-running show, quit her job for several months due to illness.
In the first episode of Laverne's show, where guests are asked to imagine traveling to a desert island, Daley said he felt inferior to everyone else as he grew up because it was socially unacceptable to like both boys and girls.
He said: “To this day, that feeling of smallness and otherness has been an incentive that has given me the strength to succeed.”
He said he wanted to prove himself worthy of something so as not to disappoint those around him when they finally learn about his sexual orientation.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist became a high-profile LGBT activist and used his participation in this year’s Commonwealth Games to call on more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he started talking about it in public because he thought he was lucky to be able to live openly without any consequences and would like to give others that hope.
The three-time world champion said he was surprised to fall in love with a man he met in 2013 – US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black.
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but says the age gap has never been a problem.
When you live so much at such a young age — he was only 14 at his first Olympics and his father died of cancer three years later — it’s hard to meet someone of the same age but with the same heights and lows.
When the couple became parents to their son Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, Daley’s perspective changed, he said.
“If you had listened last year, I would have said that the most important thing for me is to win a gold medal,” he said.
But, you know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
“Robby is my Olympic gold medal.”
The son's name is the same as that of his grandfather Roberto, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Anto Daley, whose father did not want to accept his death, was last asked if he had already bought tickets for the 2012 London Olympics, which he planned to watch in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him he wouldn’t live long enough to be in the front row,” Daley said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only then did I finally admit that he was not invulnerable,” Daley said.
A year later, he competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I just knew I’d been dreaming about it my whole life — jumping into the water watching local spectators at the Olympics — there’s no better feeling than that,” he said.
It also inspired the choice of the first song for the show, Heather Small's "Proud", which echoed his feelings in the run-up to the Olympics and still pleasantly horrifies the skin.
Desert Island Discs are broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11.15 am British Summer Time.
Missing Ph.Mickelson spent Saturday's Ryder Cup on a bench
Phil Mickelson will set a 47-time world record for Ryder Cup on Sunday, but he will need to improve his form to avoid an unlucky anniversary.
Mickelson, who has already played for the 12th time in a two-year competition, was seated on a bench by Captain Jim Furyk in Saturday's four-man competition.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as has often been the case in the United States, five times the main winner has spent part of the day on the support team, and the rest of the day improving their technique on the pitch in an attempt to correct the interfering mistakes.
Even without hitting a particularly straight line at the height of his career, the 48-year-old is not an ideal player on the tight Le Gold National court, which has a long stretch of rough grass that is particularly unfavorable for inaccurate strikes.
What’s more, as if the pitch itself wasn’t scary enough, Mickelson will play against top British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who with rookie Tommy Fleetwood won all four matches this week.
If the four-point-backers get a good start on the upcoming 12-piece game, Mickelson’s match could be decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, but could not possibly speak differently.
"He understood the role he was playing today, clapped me on the back and hugged me and said he was ready to play tomorrow," Furyk said.
He lacks confidence in himself.
He is on the list of the most glorious athletes and has given a lot to these teams both in the past and this week.
I could not have imagined that he would play two matches.
I imagined more, but it turned out like this, so we decided that we would do it.
He wants to play like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will break Nick Fald’s record by becoming the most Ryder Cup-matched athlete.
It could mark the end of his Ryder Cup career, which never reached the heights of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, but Furyk says his presence has also brought the team intangible benefits.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, witty, he likes to make fun of people, and he’s a great guy to have fun with in the team room,” he said.
“I think it was fun for the younger players to compete with him this week, and it was good to see that.
It’s more than a game.”
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a big lead could quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a big lead towards the last Ryder Cup can easily turn into a difficult battle.
The Danish athlete made his debut in 1997 in Valderrama, where the opposing team led by Captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but only crossed the finish line just by scoring 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2:131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"We always remind ourselves that we had a big lead in Valderrama, we had a big lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and also in Valderrama, where we won, but barely," said Bjorn (pictured), who watched the 2018 show win with a result of 5:3 on Friday and 10:6 on the Le Golf National.
So the story will show me and all the team members that it’s not over yet.
Tomorrow we will need all our strength.
Go ahead and do everything right.
As long as there are no points on the board, the game is not over.
We have a goal – to try to win this prize – so we have to consistently strive for it.
I have always said, I count on the 12 players who are on our side, but we know very well who is on the other side, the best players in the world.”
Satisfied with his players on the pitch, Bjorn added: “In no way would I want to pre-empt myself.
Tomorrow will be a different story.
Tomorrow will be the most important individual game – it’s completely different.
It’s great to play with your partner when things are going well, but when you’re on the court alone, the limits of your ability to play golf are tested.
This idea needs to be introduced to the players – tomorrow you will have to squeeze everything out of yourself.
Now you have to break up with your partner, and he will have to squeeze everything out of himself as well.”
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk expects his players to perform better individually than as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who each scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself experienced both sides of the last day's surprises, as the Brooklyn was on the winning team until Europe performed the miracle of Medina and made them losers."
“I remember every damn word,” he said when asked how Captain Ben Crenshaw motivated his players in 1999 as he prepared for the final day.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but try to make a quick start, like you saw in Brooklyn and Medina.
When acceleration occurs in one direction, the middle matches become very tense.
We've formed our team accordingly and we've released players in a way that for us, you know... we're trying to create some kind of magic tomorrow."
Thomas will be tasked with countering Rory McIlroy at the top, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter leading the Europeans.
“I chose these guys in this order, because I think they will be successful in the whole game,” said T. Bjorn about his choice of singles.
The delivery of a new German naval ship is again postponed
The latest frigate in Germany’s navy was supposed to be operational in 2014 and replace Cold War-era warships, but local media said it would not be seen until at least next year due to deteriorating systems and huge price hikes.
According to a military spokesman quoted by the Die Zeit newspaper, the delivery of Rheinland-Pfalz, the main ship of the new Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class frigates, has now been delayed until the first half of 2019.
The ship was due to join the navy in 2014, but the fate of this ambitious project was marred by problems with the ship that had already been delivered.
Four Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy back in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
They are expected to be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic footprints.
Another important feature is the longer service intervals, which would allow the latest frigates to fly away from home ports for up to two years.
However, according to Die Zeit, due to endless delays, the most advanced warships, which are supposed to allow Germany to direct military power to overseas territories, will become obsolete before they are put into service.
The failed F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German navy officially refused to accept the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship that has already been delivered to the builder.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German press mentions a number of major software and hardware defects that would have made the ship useless on a military mission.
Software flaws are particularly important, as the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class of ships will be managed by about 120 seamen – half the strength of the older Bremen class frigates.
In addition, the ship proved to be too heavy, which reduces its efficiency and limits the ability of the Navy to implement various improvements in the future.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is estimated to be twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
The cost of the whole project – in addition to the crumbling technical equipment, including crew training – is also gradually becoming a problem.
It is said to have risen from an initial €2.2 billion to a staggering €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion).
The problems of the latest frigate have become particularly significant following recent warnings that Germany’s navy is losing power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German parliament’s defence committee, acknowledged that the navy was in fact “undergoing a shortage of usable ships”.
The official said that over time the problems had accumulated, since the old ships had already been decommissioned, but there was no way to replace them.
He regretted that none of the Frigates of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class were able to join the navy.
The National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of Bats
A new study, conducted at a Scottish Highlands estate, aims to reveal how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
The findings are expected to provide new insights into the behaviour of unique flying mammals and provide some guidance for future conservation activities.
Researchers from the National Trust for Scotland will be tracking dwarf bats, soprano bats, brown-eared mice and waterfowl in the Wester Ross Inverevo Gardens.
In certain areas of the territory, special recorders will be placed to track the activity of bats throughout the season.
The National Health Service staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile tests with hand-held detectors.
An expert analysis of all sound recordings will determine the frequency of signals emitted by bats and one or another type of activity.
A map of habitable areas and a report will then be created to help shape a detailed picture of behaviour across the landscape.
Rob Dewar, conservation adviser at the National Trust for Scotland (NTS), hopes the results will reveal which residential areas are the most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help to identify the benefits of habitat maintenance, such as grassland creation, as well as how to best care for wooded areas so that they are suitable for bats and other related species.
Over the past century, bat populations in Scotland and the UK have declined.
They are threatened by construction and real estate development works affecting the hatcheries and destroying residential areas.
There are also threats from wind turbines and lightning, as do flycatchers, some chemicals used to process building materials, and domestic cats hunting.
The bats are not really blind.
However, catching prey during night hunting helps ears more than eyes.
Bats accurately determine the location of insects or obstacles in the flight path by sophisticated echolocation.
The NTS, responsible for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
There are ten trained experts who regularly carry out investigations, hatchery inspections and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization has even created Scotland’s first and only bat-specific sanctuary at Dumfries and Galloway’s Threeve Manor, home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
The landlord, David Thompson, says that the territory of the manor is ideal for them.
“We have a great place for bats at Threeve Manor,” he said.
– We have old buildings, lots of mature trees and great areas to live in.
But we don’t know much about bats yet, so working here and elsewhere will help you better understand what they need to thrive.”
He stressed that it was crucial to check for the presence of bats before starting maintenance work on the site, as accidental destruction of one hatchery could kill up to 400 females and juveniles, which could lead to the destruction of the entire local population.
Bats shall be protected and it shall be prohibited to kill, tease or disturb them, as well as it shall be prohibited to destroy their hatcheries.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an official at the Scottish Bat Foundation, urged the public to help rescue the bats.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we don't even know how many native populations are doing."
Ronaldo Rejects Rape Charges, Lawyers Will Sue German Magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the accusations against him of rape with "fake news" and said people using his name "are trying to make themselves famous".
His lawyers are ready to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the indictments.
The forward of Portugal and Juventus is accused of raping American Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that he paid $375,000 to cover up the incident.
Speaking to 142 million followers on Instagram just hours after the indictments were announced, Ronaldo, 33, criticized the reports as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they are saying today is lies,” said the five-time Ballon d’Or winner, looking at the camera.
They want to use my name.
This is normal.
They want to be famous, to say my name – that’s part of my job.
I’m a happy person, everything is fine,” the athlete added with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over what they called “unacceptable disclosure of private space allegations.”
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the athlete would seek compensation for “moral damages the amount of which would be commensurate with the significance of this violation, probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in a Palms Casino and Hotel apartment in Las Vegas.
According to the documents filed with the Nevada Clark County Court, after meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the athlete's room, where he allegedly raped her anally.
Mayorga said Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her he was a “99 percent good man” who was betrayed by the remaining “one percent” of his personality.
The documents state that Ronaldo admitted the couple had sex, but said they were contractual.
Mayorga also said she had contacted police and her injuries at the hospital had been photographed, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "afraid of retaliation" and worried she would be "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old says she is now seeking to cancel the deal as she continues to feel traumatised by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged attack, Ronaldo was on his way from Manchester United to Real Madrid and joined Italian giant Juventus this summer after signing a contract worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK would regret losing car makers forever
Business Secretary Greg Clark said the UK would "perpetually regret" losing its position as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit.
He said he was concerned about a statement by Toyota's UK subsidiary to the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, manufacturing at Burnaston plant near Derby would be temporarily halted.
“We need an agreement,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said a no-deal border delay would mean job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 vehicles last year, 90% of which were exported to other parts of the European Union.
“In my opinion, if Britain suddenly leaves the European Union at the end of March, our factory will have to stop production,” Toyota chief executive Burnastone Marvin Cooke said in a statement.
Other British automakers, including Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover, have also voiced concerns about leaving the EU without a deal and its impact on international trade.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini factory for a month after Brexit.
Car manufacturers said they were most concerned about the threat to the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line works when it’s needed, as custom-made parts for cars arrive every 37 minutes, both from suppliers in the UK and from suppliers in the EU.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be disruptions at the border, which the industry says could result in delays or shortages in delivery.
Toyota said it would not be able to store more than one day's supplies at its plant in Derbyshire, and production would stop.
Clark said Theresa May’s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU was “designed precisely to avoid such checks at the border.”
“We need a treaty, and we want to have the best treaty that, as I say, will allow us not only to enjoy success today, but also to seize this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.
“Data from not only Toyota, but also from other car manufacturers, show that continued access to a highly successful supply chain system is essential.”
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but warned that in the long term, additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallar, who has been at the Burnaston plant for 24 years and is responsible for Unite’s union meetings, said his union members were becoming increasingly concerned: “I’m telling you from experience that if these jobs are lost, they’ll never come back.”
A government spokesman said: "We have proposed an ambitious and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
According to the White House, Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again.
"As the battle for Supreme Court justices continues, a very important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be delayed for another week," the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees special adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia’s election meddling, the ties of Trump’s aides to Russia and possible obstruction of the president’s justice work.
The question of whether Trump would fire the deputy attorney general, thereby threatening Mueller’s independence, has fueled months of rumours in Washington.
The New York Times reported earlier this month that Rosenstein had discussed wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of ousting the president under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
However, in a flash of news of his resignation, he went to the White House last Monday.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York at the time, would take place on Thursday.
Trump said he did not want to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was later delayed to avoid being coincided with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing that featured testimony from both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct.
Trump on Friday ordered the FBI to investigate Kavanaugh's charges within a week, delaying the vote again in the Senate.
Trump’s spokeswoman Sarah Sanders appeared on the Fox News show on Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “His date is not fixed. It could happen this week, but given all the events related to the Supreme Court, it could be postponed for another week.
But we'll see. I always like to report to the press."
Some journalists would disagree: since September 10, Sanders has not held a single White House press conference.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that press conferences rarely take place not because they don't like TV journalists who are looking for "effects for the viewers". However, he added: "I have to agree with the fact that they are looking for effects for the viewers."
Then he suggested that Trump would communicate more directly with the press.
"The president answers questions more often than any previous president," she said, adding, without providing any evidence, "we have reviewed these statistics."
Sanders said there will be press conferences, but “if the press has the ability to question the president of the United States directly, that’s far better than talking to me.”
We have often tried to do this, and you have seen this happen many times in the last few weeks, and the press conferences will be replaced by your direct contacts with the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions by leaving the White House, attending public meetings or attending press conferences with dignitaries.
Press conferences are rare.
The president’s free and sometimes bizarre appearance in New York this week may have explained why.
Health Minister Wrote EU Concerns About Brexit for Scottish NST Workers
The Health Minister has written a letter to EU workers in Scotland expressing the country’s gratitude and desire for them to stay after Brexit.
The letter was sent by Scottish MP Jeane Freeman less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the cost of applying for settled status for EU citizens working in its public service sector.
Freeman wrote in a letter: “Over the summer, the UK and the EU have continued to negotiate their withdrawal and are getting closer to the decisions expected this autumn.
But the UK government has also accelerated preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know you're all very worried right now.
That is why I wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of all employees, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the performance of the healthcare system and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after head trauma
On Saturday, Tennessee State Tigers defender Christion Abercrombie lost the game to 31:27 Vanderbilt Commodores in an emergency operation, Tennessee journalist Mike Organ said.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before the break.
“He came up to the side line and just collapsed there,” Reed said.
Trainers and medics at the sideline gave Abercrombie a breath of oxygen, then laid him on a stretcher and sent him for further research.
Tennessee State official Chris Harris of Nashville, Tennessee, told the WSMV that Abercrombie's operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center had been completed.
Harris added that "there is no information yet on the type and extent of the injury" and Tennessee State was trying to determine when it occurred.
The second-year Abercrombie has moved from Illinois to Tennessee State and is playing his first season.
Before leaving the game, he rebounded five balls on Saturday, bringing his total rebounds to 18.
Foreign buyers buying property in the UK will have to pay a higher stamp duty
Under the new Tory plans, foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp duty and the extra money they raise will be used to help the homeless.
This step will reduce the risk of a successful Corbyn campaign to attract young voters
Higher stamp duty will be levied on non-taxable persons in the UK
Finance Ministry expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help homeless people
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers of UK real estate are going to be subject to a higher stamp duty and the extra money they receive will be used to help the homeless.
With the promise of more affordable housing and targeting high-income earners, the move is expected to reduce the risk of a successful campaign by Jeremy Corbyn to attract young voters.
The increased stamp duty will be levied on non-taxable persons and businesses in the UK, and the extra money received will be used to promote the Government's campaign against homelessness.
The additional fee – paid in addition to the current stamp duty, including the higher rates introduced two years ago for second homes or houses for rent – can be as high as three percent.
The finance ministry expects the move to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of London's newly constructed property is bought by non-UK residents, which increases prices and makes it more difficult for first-time buyers to do so.
Many foreign buyers spend most of their time outside the country, so many wealthy districts of the country, and especially the capital, have become ghost towns.
The new strategy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a cut in stamp duty to help more young people buy their first homes.
He accused large construction companies of buying up land quickly but not using it to prop up high property prices, and urged May to address Britain’s housing shame by scrapping quotas on affordable homes.
Corbyn has announced several eye-catching proposed housing reforms, including rent controls and a no-fault exit ban.
He also wants to give more power to municipal councils to build new houses.
“I said last year that as prime minister I would work to bring back the British dream – for every new generation there must be a better life.
This means that the housing market needs to be rehabilitated.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and create life here.
However, it is not right that non-UK residents and foreign-based businesses can buy homes as easily as hard-working British people.
For many people, the dream of housing has become almost unattainable, and the threat of homelessness is still too real.”
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate goal is to lead Scotland's national team'
Sunderland chief Jack Ross says his ultimate goal is to one day become head of the Scottish national team.
The 42-year-old Scotsman likes the challenge of revitalising the North-East club, which is currently in third place in the first league and three points behind the club in first place.
After returning to the Scottish Championship last season, St Mirren moved to the Stadium of Light this summer.
“As a player, I wanted to play for my country.
I got into Team B, and that's the end of it," Ross told the BBC's Scotland's Sportsound.
“But as a child, I grew up watching a lot of Scottish national team games with my dad at Hamden Stadium, and that’s always been what made me come back.
This will only happen if I manage the club successfully.”
Prior to Ross, Sunderland was headed by Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
Having previously rejected proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town, the former head of Alloa Athletic said he did not feel any anxiety when he began working for such a well-known executive at such a large club.
"My success will now be measured by my answer to the question, 'Can I bring this club back into the Premier League?'
By its structure and conditions, this club is undoubtedly part of the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to take him there, but I guess I'll just have to return the club to the league and I'll think that I worked here successfully."
Ross's managerial career spans only three years, before which he served as assistant manager at Dumbarton and replaced Hearts coaches for 15 months.
Later, he helped Alloa recover from the fall in the third division, and made the club St Mirren, which was in danger of falling, the next season the champions.
Ross says he's more satisfied now than he's ever felt in his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“This change was probably radical,” he recalls about his leadership of Alloa.
“I really believe that leadership is better for me than playing.
It sounds strange, because I was successful, I made a lot of money and I was happy with the satisfactory results.
But playing can be difficult.
You have to overcome a lot of problems every week.
And now it’s not easy – working stress and tension, but I feel that leadership is exactly what I need.
I've always wanted to lead, and I'm doing it now. As an adult, I've always felt like I was in my own sleigh, but leadership is the most rewarding thing."

Studies have shown that the best time for a pint of beer is on Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer heatwave has boosted the incomes of poor British pubs but added to the strain on restaurant chains.
The figures revealed that sales of pubs and bars increased by 2.7 percent in July, but revenue in restaurants fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of CGA, the business consulting firm that compiled the data, said: “Endless sunshine and longer than expected England’s participation in the World Cup meant that July continued with similar trends as June, when pub revenues increased by 2.8 percent.
In June, sales in restaurants declined by 1.8 percent, and in July, the situation became even worse.
The main income from the sale of drinks in pubs and bars was undoubtedly the best, and the trade in them grew more strongly than the decline in restaurants.
Although not as strong as restaurant businesses, the pubs that earn the main income from the food trade also suffered in the sun.
People just wanted to go out for a drink.
In well-run pubs and bars, beverage sales rose 6.6 percent this month, while food sales fell 3 percent.”
Paul Newman of RSM, a leisure and hospitality analytics firm, said: “These results continue the trend seen since the end of April.
As regards catering establishments, weather and the impact of major social and sporting events continue to be key factors.
So it’s no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, but for years, the 4.8 percent drop in sales will be particularly painful as it will contribute to ongoing cost pressures.
Companies with the highest revenues from the food trade could not have had a long hot summer at a worse time. Time will tell whether the milder temperatures in August will provide the much needed respite."
The overall growth in sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened locations, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in the growth of brand-owned networks.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, a sector sales monitoring tool for the pubs, bars and restaurants sector in the UK and recognised by its guidelines, collects and analyses activity data from 47 operating groups with a combined turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion.
One in five children have social media accounts hidden from their parents
One in five children – some as young as 11 – have social media accounts they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increasing number of fake Insta pages
The news has heightened fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they had a parent account
One in five children, some as young as 11 years old, create secret social media accounts and hide them from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in the number of fake Insta pages, a link to the photo sharing site Instagram.
The news has heightened fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they use a censored primary account to show their parents, but they also have secret accounts.
One mother, who accidentally found a secret website for her 13-year-old daughter, found out that the teenage girl insisted: "Rape me."
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent School Directors (MDK) found that 40 percent of 11-18 year olds have two accounts, and half of those students admitted to hiding the accounts.
MDK director Mike Buchanan said: “The fact that so many teenagers are tempted to create virtual spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them is worrying.”

Eilidha Doyle was elected as a consultant to the governing body of the Scottish Sports Council at its annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland’s most award-winning track and field athlete and was described by Ian Beattie as a great opportunity for people in charge of sport to benefit from the many international experiences she has gained over the past decade.
“Eilidha has won great respect across the Scottish, UK and global sports community and we have no doubt that her inclusion on the board will bring significant benefits to Scottish sport,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I really want to serve as the voice of the athletes and I hope to make a real contribution to helping lead the sport in Scotland."
The 200-meter and 400-meter events of the 1996 Atlanta Games and the four-time Olympic gold medalist, who now appears as a regular BBC expert, made him unable to walk after suffering a brief ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said that only time will tell if I will recover and to what extent.
I had to work until I was exhausted, but I recovered completely, learned to walk again and today I am doing mobility exercises!
Thank you for your message of encouragement!”
Breast pump advertising, where mothers are compared to cows, has received different ratings on the Internet
The breast pump company has received different opinions about its advertising, which compares nursing mothers with dairy cows.
To mark the launch of the product, described as the world’s first silent portable breast lift, consumer technology company Elvie has released an advertisement inspired by an ironic musical video to showcase the freedom that the new breast pump gives breastfeeding mothers.
In a hay-filled cowshed, four real mothers dance to audio recordings of, for example, "Yes, I milk myself, but no tail is visible" and "If you haven't noticed, this is not udders, this is my breasts."
The appendix continues: "Put it out, pull it out, feed the babies, pull it out, pull it out, milk my beauties."
However, an advertisement posted on the company’s Facebook page sparked an online dispute.
The video, which was viewed 77,000 times and received several hundred comments, was a mixed response from viewers, many of whom said they were overlooking the horrors of the dairy industry.
“Advertising this product with cows is a very poor solution.
Like us, they must become pregnant and give birth to produce milk, only their newborns are taken from them a few days after giving birth.”

Another commented: “This is obviously traumatic for both the mother and the newborn.
But why not use them for advertising that delivers a breast pump for mothers who don't take their babies away?"
Another added: “Advertising is a complete misunderstanding.”
Other commentators defended the ad, with one woman admitting that the song was "very fun" for her.
“I think the idea is brilliant.
I would buy it if I could still feed.
When I stopped drinking, I felt like a cow.
Advertising is a bit crazy, but I accepted it as what it is.
This product is brilliant," wrote one.
Another commented: “This fun advertisement is for moms who take their milk off (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feel like cows.
Its purpose is not to praise or condemn the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they all danced with inconspicuous breast pumps in their bras.
The idea behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who stop breast milk claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie breast pump does not emit any sound, has no wires or tubes and fits seamlessly in the nursing bra, allowing women to move freely, hold their babies or even leave the house when they take their milk off.
Mother’s partner and executive creative director Ana Balarin commented: “Elvie’s breast pump is a revolutionary product that deserves to be bold and provocative.
Comparing nursing women with dairy cows, we wanted to draw attention to the interruption of milk and all its challenges, while having fun and as much as possible showing the incredible sense of freedom that the new breast pump will bring.
This is not the first time that Elvie's breast pump has entered the headlines.
During London Fashion Week designer Marta Jakubowski’s collection, a mother of two demonstrated using the product on the catwalk.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of people crossing the border hasn’t changed much in a month, but the number of migrant children apprehended has risen sharply, in part because the Trump administration’s harsh rhetoric and policies have made it harder to accommodate them with guardians.
Traditionally, most carers were themselves undocumented immigrants and feared that applying for child custody would risk staying in the country.
When the federal government announced in June that potential guardians and other adult members of their families would have to provide fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities, the risk increased further.
Last week, Immigration and Customs Enforcement Chief Matthew Albence testified to Congress that the agency had detained dozens of people who had applied for custody of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not previously been tried.
“Nearly 80 percent of these people, whether they are guardians or family members, live illegally in the country, and most of them are foreign criminals.
Therefore we will continue to persecute these persons," Albence said.
According to the staff of the shelter, in order to consider cases of children more quickly, officials introduced new rules. According to them, some children must appear in court within a month of arrest, and not within 60 days, as was usual before.
Many will try to defend their application for legal status before an immigration judge by videoconferencing rather than in person.
Those recognised as ineligible for assistance will be deported quickly.
According to the shelter’s staff and reports from the system in recent months, the longer the children stay in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to outbreaks of abuse or attempts to escape.
Defenders say it’s even more alarming in large institutions like the Tornill shelter, where size increases the likelihood of not seeing signs of a child being afflicted.
They added that moving children to the tent town without giving them enough time to prepare them emotionally or say goodbye to their friends could deepen the trauma many have already suffered.
Syria tells U.S., French and Turkish occupation forces to leave immediately
In an address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem called for Syrian refugees to return home, despite the country’s eight-year war.
Moualem, who is also a deputy prime minister, said foreign forces on Syrian soil that used the pretext of fighting terrorism were illegal and would be treated accordingly.
"They must leave immediately and without conditions," he told the assembly.
Moualem said the war on terror was almost over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died and millions have fled their homes since 2011.
He said Damascus would not stop fighting this holy battle until we eradicated both terrorist groups and any illegal aliens from all parts of Syria.
There are about 2,000 US troops in Syria, mostly training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground troops in the war-torn country.
Speaking about the problem of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions for their return are good. At the same time, he accused some Western countries of spreading unreasonable fear, which discourages refugees from returning.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to help them return,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian problem.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will only receive reconstruction aid once Assad and the opposition reach a political agreement to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has paved the way for faster progress in political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has prevented a large-scale offensive by Russian-backed Syrian forces targeting a province of three million people.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement contained clear deadlines. In addition, he expressed the hope that military action would be directed at jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front, which is linked to Al-Qaeda and will be destroyed.
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a committee made up of government and opposition members to draft Syria's post-war constitution and prepare the ground for elections.
Moualem outlined the conditions under which the Syrian government would participate in the committee — the group’s work should be limited to reviewing the articles of the current constitution — and warned against meddling.
Why will Trump be elected for a second term?
According to that logic, Trump would be elected in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers expect, his presidency was prematurely overshadowed by impeachment and scandal.
This would certainly be the most dramatic end to the presidency ever!
So far, no signs of spectator fatigue have been seen.
Since 2014, CNN’s best broadcast time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million, and MSNBC nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC’s The Rachel Maddow Show is number one on cable ratings with 3.5 million viewers on mainstream news evenings.
"It's a fire that attracts people because we don't understand something," says Neal Baer, producer of ABC's Descedent about the secretary of the cabinet who becomes president after an attack that destroyed the congressional palace.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of Only Fun Parts and Some Unpleasant Truths About Entering the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
She remembers taking a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he would vote for Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
“He said, ‘He makes me laugh,’” Scovell said.
Chaos is valuable in that it amuses.
Of course, unlike other TV shows, the scenes coming from Washington could determine the future of the Roe case against Wade, the possibility of bringing immigrant families together, and the state of the global economy.
Neglect is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet it’s more than enough to be an informed citizen when you realize you’ve been watching for six hours a group of experts discuss how Bob Woodward uses sensitive data for his Fear book, Paul Manafort shows off a $15,000 ostrich-leather jacket (“Trumpy-Hungry Apparel,” Daniel wrote in The Washington Post).
I’ll never look at Super Mario again.
“His actions are like those of a reality show, because he throws you something up every night,” says Wheelhouse Entertainment CEO and Pawn Stars creator Brent Montgomery.
You can't miss a single episode, or you'll fall behind.
When I contacted Fleiss this week, it was 27 degrees Celsius outside his house on the north coast of Kauai and the sun was shining, but he was inside and watching MSNBC while recording for CNN.
He couldn’t get away — certainly not when Brett Kavanaugh had to stand before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
“I remember when we were making these crazy shows, people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss said.
“I thought it was a joke, but it turned out to be true.”

Money is pouring out from around the world in the intense fight for the midterm elections to the House of Representatives
Not surprisingly, the reshuffle of congressional constituencies, which resulted in two members of the House of Representatives trying to win the same post, caused money to flood Pennsylvania’s 17th district.
A recently redrawed suburb of Pittsburgh dragged Democrat Conor Lamb into battle, winning his seat in a special election in another district last spring.
Lamb is in competition with another House of Representatives member, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, much of which overlaps with the new 17th.
The maps were redone after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts had been fabricated in favor of Republicans in violation of the constitution.
In the run-up to the election in the new 17th district, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DKKC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRKK) clashed over campaign finance.
Lamb rose to prominence in Pennsylvania when he won a narrow majority in the 18th congressional district in a widely watched special election in March.
For more than a decade, the Republicans took the place, and President Donald Trump won 20 points in the county.
Politicians have given Democrats an advantage.
US considers punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but then calms down
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, but that there had been little negative reaction from Washington.
In June 2017, Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela and had a hotel in the country before the partners moved out of the Trump Organization leadership.
“Regarding recent decisions, Taiwan State Department officials have decided to recall the heads of American diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement.
But the sanctions are being considered only for El Salvador, which in 2017 received roughly $140 million in American aid, as well as drug control, development and economic assistance.
The proposed sanctions, which include a cut in financial assistance and individual visa restrictions, would have been painful for a Central American country with high levels of unemployment and homicide.
During internal meetings, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference for security and economic prosperity, following a similar meeting last year, which was seen as an important step forward in preventing migrants from entering the United States.
But in mid-September, top administration officials made it clear they wanted the conference to take place, effectively ending any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
"Vice President Mike Pence has now been added to the list of speakers for the mid-October conference to show the importance the administration attaches to this gathering," the diplomats said.
And three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without reporting any reprimands or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman declined to comment on the details of the discussion, which were told by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal discussions only if their anonymity was preserved.
Their stories are corroborated by an outside analyst close to the administration, who also spoke if his anonymity is preserved.
Learn History
Next, it is inevitable to wait for special counsel Robert Mueller’s report on a possible obstruction of justice in Trump’s case—very strong evidence of this is now available in public archives.
In addition, Mueller is said to be addressing the question of whether the Trump campaign was conducted in covert cooperation with Russia, which has undermined our elections.
If Congress were to change hands, Trump would have to take responsibility in the institution, at the same time as he is preparing to face voters again, and perhaps finally the commission of officials.
There’s a lot of “ifs” here, and I’m not saying that Trump’s end is inevitable — nor are its equivalents in Europe.
We will all have to make choices on both sides of the Atlantic, and those choices will determine whether the fight will last.
In 1938, German officials were ready to oust Hitler – all they needed was for the West to stand up to him and support Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to prevent a massacre that would take several years later.
History revolves around such crucial turning points – then the relentless march of democracy is accelerated or slowed down.
The United States is now at a number of key turning points.
What if Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man behind the Mueller probe?
Rosenstein’s difficulties began when the newspaper reported that the official had offered to secretly record the president last year and considered his unfitness.
Rosenstein says the story of The Times is inaccurate.
“How will we respond if the FBI’s new investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is found to be incomplete or incorrect, or if, despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony, this candidate is appointed to the Supreme Court?
And, finally, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will force Trump to take responsibility?
If these tests are not passed, democracy is in danger of a long winter.
But because of the lesson I learned in Prague, I believe that we will keep them.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew, and she was taken to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once housed me as an ambassador.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, I was sent to light the Sabbath candles on the table with the swastika.
When I have such a legacy, how can I look at our future in a non-optimistic way?"

Graham Dorrans of Rangers clash with Rapid Vienna optimistically
The Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the knowledge that if they win a spectacular match against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, they could be in a strong position to leave Group G.
Midway through the injury, player Graham Dorrans was able to appear for the first time this season in a 2:2 match against Villarreal, but he hopes Rangers can use the result as a springboard to more important goals.
"We had a good result because Villarreal are a great team," the 31-year-old said.
“We started the game with the belief that we would achieve something, and we ended up having achieved something.
We could have been better in the end, but overall the game was good.
They probably played better in the first half, and we played better in the second half and showed who we are.
Thursday will be another important day for the European League.
I hope that we will be able to get three points. The game will be difficult, because in recent competitions their result was excellent. But I have no doubt that with the support of the audience we can get ahead and achieve a good result.
Last year was really hard – and what happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a good mood.
The team is good and the guys are really happy; the training is great.
I hope that we can now move forward, forget about last season and play well."
Because of this fear of pension savings, women suffer from insomnia
Although the survey participants had a clear idea of what care they would like to receive, few discussed it with family members.
About half of respondents to the Nationwide survey said they had talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their kids about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but don’t try to talk about it,” Holly Snyder, vice president of nationwide life insurance, said in a statement.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children, and if you do not make your wishes known in advance, you will not be prepared to take care of your family.
Discuss with your counselor and family where and what care you would like to receive, as these factors can be important to predict costs.
Call in a financial advisor. An advisor can also help you figure out a way to cover these expenses.
You can choose to pay for long-term care by taking out a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a mixed life insurance policy or by taking out insurance on your property for as long as you have the money.
Prepare legal documents. Prevent legal disputes by allowing documents to be protected.
Prepare a power of attorney for health care. Appoint a trusted person to take care of your medical care and ensure that professionals respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Think about taking care of your finances.
You should choose a reliable person who will make financial decisions for you and make sure that the bills are paid if you become incapacitated.
Imagine that your elderly father or mother is in need of urgent medical attention and is being taken to a hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
To be prepared, write these details in the plan.
“It’s not just financial issues that matter. Who are the doctors?” <0xE2><0x8E><0xAF> asked Martin.
“What medicine?
Who will take care of the dog?
Plan this as well.”
Man shot several times in Ilfraume with air gun
After spending the evening in the city, the man went home and was shot several times with a pneumatic gun.
He was shot in the chest, stomach, and arm of a 40-year-old victim in the Ilfrakum district of Oxford Grauw, Devon.
Around 2:30 p.m., officers described the shooting as an accidental act.
The victim did not see the attacker.
The injuries are not life threatening, and the police are asking for witnesses to help.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia
"At least 384 people were killed when a powerful earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday," officials said. The death toll is expected to rise further.
The destruction of communications prevented emergency services from obtaining any data from Dongala regency, an area north of Palu near the epicentre of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu in the aftermath of the disaster.
Here are some basic facts about Palu and Dongal on Sulawesi Island.
With a population of around 379,800 in 2017, Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island.
When the earthquake struck and the tsunami struck, the city celebrated its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a regency that stretches along the coast of Sulawesi Island at more than 300 km (180 miles) in the northwest.
The regency, a smaller administrative region than the province, had a population of about 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the main economic pillars of the central province of Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Dongala.
The mining of nickel is also important in the province, although it is mainly concentrated in Morovali on the other side of Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palu and Dongala have been hit several times by tsunamis over the past century.
The 1938 tsunami in Donggala killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In addition, a tsunami struck western Dongal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is constantly hit by earthquakes on the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire.
Here are some of the most significant earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years.
On December 26, 2004, a major quake on the west coast of Aceh province in Indonesia triggered a tsunami in northern Sumatra that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
In late March and early April 2005, several major quakes rocked the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people died on the nearby island of Nias.
In 2006, a 6.8-magnitude quake struck the south of Indonesia’s most populous island of Java, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
In 2009, a 7.6-magnitude quake struck an area near Padang, the western capital of Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
A 7.5-magnitude quake in 2010 rocked one of the Mentawai islands near Sumatra, triggering a tsunami with waves of up to 10 metres (yards) that wiped out dozens of villages and killed around 300 people.
In 2016, the regency of Pidia Jaya in Aceh was devastated by the mild earthquake, and panic erupted as people remembered how everything was devastated after the terrible 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but the collapsing buildings killed more than 100 people.
In 2018, strong quakes rocked the Indonesian tourist-prone island of Lombok and killed more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded on the coast.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of Saraha Palin, a former governor and vice-president of Alaska, was arrested on charges of assault.
A report released Saturday by Alaska Police said Palin, 29, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, preventing him from reporting domestic violence and resisting arrest.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
As reported by KTUU, Palin was returned to pre-trial detention in Mat-Su and released on bail of $500.
"He appeared in court on Saturday where, when asked to excuse himself, he said he was completely innocent," the network said.
Palin is charged with three A-class offenses, meaning he could be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He is charged with class B offense, a day in prison, and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The case is currently pending in the Alaska Veterans Court.
The incident was linked to charges of assault on his home, preventing him from reporting a domestic violence crime and possessing a weapon while drunk in January 2016.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups for linking the cruel behavior of her son to the post-traumatic stress disorder he suffered during his time in Iraq.
Indonesia Earthquake and Tsunami: Hundreds Killed
At least 384 people have died since the Indonesian tsunami struck Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not working, and the number of deaths is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck near central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Social media shares videos of the tsunami's impact.
The tsunami hit the coast when hundreds of people gathered for a beach party in Palu.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death penalty for New York terror suspect
In New York, federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, a rare punishment that has not been carried out in the state since 1953 for federal crimes.
On October 31, Saipov, a 30-year-old from Home Depot, was suspected of renting a truck and carrying out an attack on a bicycle path along the western highway in Lower Manhattan, killing pedestrians and cyclists while driving along the path.
According to a report in the southern New York district about its intention to seek the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov intentionally killed eight victims and intentionally caused serious bodily harm.
According to a court document, both of these indictments can result in the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury issued a 22-point indictment against Saipov, including eight charges of murder relating to extortion (usually imposed by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases) and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
Prosecutors say the attack was very well planned and premeditated, and how Saipov carried it out has been described as disgusting, cruel, and immoral.
As a result of Sayfull Habibullaevic Saipov’s actions, the following family members and friends were injured, injured and lost: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleveso, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruch, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damiano Paucano.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The last death penalty case in New York City’s Southern District was a decade ago.
The accused Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers before he was sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last execution was in 1953 in a New York federal case, when Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were convicted two years ago of conspiring to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on June 19, 1953, in an electric chair.
According to court documents, Saipov, a Uzbek native, did not regret his actions immediately after the attack or months later.
Police said he told investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov revealed to authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack by Islamic State (ISIS) videos he watched on his phone.
Police said he also asked for the flag of the Islamic State to be hung in the hospital ward.
He did not plead guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov's federal-funded defenders, said they were clearly disappointed by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, rather than admit guilt and serve a life sentence without the possibility of being released, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all concerned," Patton said.
Saipov's defence team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE must be in charge of Brexit talks
Today, at a Tory conference, Nigel Farage promised to mobilize the nation’s army.
The former UKIP leader said politicians had to feel the heat of eurosceptics, and one of Theresa May’s MPs suggested he lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told demonstrators in Birmingham that the UK would have left now if Farage had been Brexit Secretary.
But the difficulties May faces in trying to unify her divided supporters were revealed by the Tories, who remain in the EU and joined a separate anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The prime minister finds it hard to keep up with her Chequers compromise plan when she is attacked by Brexit supporters, opponents and the EU.
Allies insisted that it try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite hostile reactions and force Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between its package or chaos.
Bone told Leave Means Leave rally in Solihale that he wants to ruin Chequers’ plan.
He said Farage should have been an equal partner and he should have been given the responsibility to negotiate with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would have left the EU," he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we have to reject the Chequers plan."
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: "In world wars, we did not fight to obey others.
We want to make our own laws.”
He denied suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely untrue."
Conservative Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the demonstrations, telling reporters: "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is unpopular among the general public, and the opposition will not vote for it; it is also unpopular among our party members and activists who take to the streets and, above all, vote for us.
Give up the Chequers Plan and start listening.”
In a critical statement to May, she added: "Prime Ministers keep their posts when they keep their promises."
Farage said rallying politicians must be made to feel the heat if they betray a 2016 referendum decision.
"Now it is a matter of our trust, the trust of the nation and the trust of our political class," he said.
“They’re trying to deliver Brexit, so we’re here today to tell them we’re not going to let them get away with doing that.”
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make our political class, which has almost delivered Brexit, feel the heat.
“We are mobilising the army of this nation that has brought us Brexit victory, and we will not stop until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.”
Opponents of Brexit marched through the streets of Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
When the group was formed this weekend, a group of activists waved signs reading "Tories against Brexit".
Labour's Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives over the security concerns they had about the party's app at the start of the conference.
“These are people who say they can implement IT systems and all the technology needed for Canada plus, frictionless borders and free trade without borders with Ireland,” he said.
“It’s a total farce.
“There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren is serious about taking part in the presidential election.
US Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would seriously consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat had spoken about her future at a public meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who regularly criticizes President Donald Trump, is running in November's re-election against GOP spokesman Geoff Diehl, one of the 2016 Trump campaign chiefs in Massachusetts.
There was speculation that it might clash with Trump in 2020.
Since Trump took office, Saturday afternoon's Holjoke event has been her 36th meeting with voters using the format of a public meeting.
One participant asked if she planned to run in the presidential election.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington to repair the broken government, and a woman had to lead it.
Suspect arrested in LSU Sims shooting case
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said Saturday they had detained a suspect accused of shooting LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
At a press conference at 11 a.m., the Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson.
Police released a video of Friday's shooting, asking for help in identifying the man.
Sims, 20, was shot and died near the Southern University campus early Friday.
According to 247sports, police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday that Wayde Sims had been shot in the head and died of his injuries.
Wayde stood up to defend his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being at the scene of the crime, possessing a gun, and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and placed in custody at the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
Sims grew up in Baton Rouge, where he played 32 games last season, 10 of which started in five, averaged 17.4 minutes per game, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton comes close to world title after team orders him to win Sebastian Vettel
When Valtter Bott overtook Lewis Hamilton in the qualifying race on Saturday, it immediately became clear that the Mercedes team's instructions in the race would be crucial.
Starting the race in first place, Bott made a great start and, defending his position in the first two turns, almost left Hamilton in trouble, prompting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to enter a two-barrel garage, left Hamilton, and returned to the race in the group's tail, so it was fatal.
The Mercedes entered the two-door garage after the wheel and returned to the track behind Vettel, but Hamilton stepped forward after barely contactless action, when the driver of the Ferrari, after a double manoeuvre to maintain the position at the third turn, reluctantly loosened the inside of the track.
Max Verstappen, who is celebrating his 21st birthday, started at the end of the line, but by the end of the first round he was seventh.
He was the fastest in most of the race, as he drove without changing tires to be as fast as possible at the finish, overtaking Kimi Raikkonen and finishing fourth.
Finally, in the 44th lap, he entered a two-barrel garage, but failed to accelerate the remaining eight laps, and Raikkonen crossed the finish line in fourth.
“Valtter had a hard day because he was doing great all weekend and when he was asked to let me go, he acted like a real gentleman.
The team did a great job and won the first two places,” Hamilton said.
It was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a meeting with people on Saturday after she vehemently denied leaking a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
In a speech in West Virginia, the president did not directly name Ford’s testimony to the Senate Legal Committee, but said that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were wicked, indecent, and unjust.
"What could have happened and is really happening in recent days in the Senate is when you see anger when you see people are evil, wicked, indecent and unjust," he said.
“When you see official statements and leaks, and then you say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do that.
I didn't do that."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you leaked?
Do you remember her answer to the question, did she leak the document? “Oh, oh, oh, oh?
Absolutely not.
I haven't leaked."
Well, wait a minute.
Whether we leaked... no, we didn't leak," he added, portraying a senator.
In July, Feinstein received a letter detailing Ford's charges against Kavanaugh, which had been leaked earlier in September, but Feinstein denied the letter had been leaked from her office.
According to The Hill, Feinstein told the committee: "I have not concealed Dr Ford's accusations and have not leaked her story."
“She asked me to keep it a secret, and I did as she asked.”
But the president seemed to disagree with her denial, and he said during a meeting with people on Saturday night: "You know, it was really bad body language.
She may not have leaked, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend a Supreme Court justice candidate accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president said the Democrats had used the accusations in their favor.
"They are ready to take back power by any means necessary.
You see the meanness, the obscenity; they don't care what they hurt or what they have to drive through to get power and control," he said in a speech to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5:3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals in a game against the Dundee Giants.
Dundee Stars made up for Friday's loss in the Elite League to the Belfast Giants, winning Saturday's counter game in Dundee's 5:3.
The Giants made an early breakthrough with two goals scored by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie had evened out the result before Dwyer brought the Giants forward again.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bouchard of the Dandi team evened out, but Lucas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals later secured victory.
Adam Keefe's men suffered their third loss this season in the Elite League, after catching up with Dandy's 2-1 on Friday night in Belfast.
It was the fourth meeting of the teams this season, with the Giants winning three previous games.
Dwyer scored his first goal in the fourth minute (3.35 minutes) after the transfer of Kendall McFaull, and four minutes later Beauvilliers doubled the lead after the transfer of David Rutherford.
In the hard-starting game, Sullivan returned the hosts to the game with a goal of 13:10, and after Matt Marquardt's transfer, Cownie evened out at 15:16.
Dwyer arranged for the Giants to take their first break at the top and scored their second goal at the end of the first half.
With a quantitative lead, the hosts regrouped and Bouchard again leveled the score at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen advance for the first time in the game for the Dandi team at the end of the second half, and secured a victory by scoring a fifth goal in the middle of the last half.
The Giants, which have already lost four of their last five games, will welcome Milton Keynes home next Friday.
Flight Chief Killed To Help Hundreds Of Passengers Escape From Earthquake
Indonesia's air traffic chief was declared a hero after he died while helping a plane with several hundred passengers take off safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are believed to be missing since a major earthquake on the island of Sulawesi on Friday triggered a tsunami.
The area continues to be shaken by strong aftershocks and many people are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
While colleagues escaped to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the heavily fluctuating control tower at the Mutiara Sis Al-Jufri airport in Palu.
He stayed at his place of work to help take off the 6321 Batik Air plane, which was already on the runway, safely.
Then, thinking that the control tower was collapsing, he jumped out of it.
He later died in hospital.
According to Australia’s ABC News, Indonesian air navigation spokesman Yohannes Sirait said his decision could have saved hundreds of lives.
We flew him by helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"This is a very painful message for us," he added.
Authorities fear the death toll could rise to thousands as the country’s disaster agency reports that the cities of Dangala, Sighi and Boutong are hard to reach.
"The death toll is expected to rise further as many of the victims are still under rubble and we cannot reach them," agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
Waves of up to six metres have devastated the city of Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute ambulances bring victims.
Lack of clean water.
Self-service shops are plundered everywhere."
Janis Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help the survivors, but we don’t know what we will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but the situation could get even worse.”
Indonesian President Jok Widod arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country's military: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini says one person is missing after plane crashes into lagoon in Micronesia
Airlines on board a flight that ended in a plane crash in the Pacific lagoon of Micronesia now say one person is missing, although they had previously said all 47 passengers and crew were rescued from a sinking plane.
In a statement, Air Niugini said they had no knowledge of a male passenger on Saturday afternoon.
The airlines said they were working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more information about the passenger, such as their age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew when the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuko Island airport.
Officials said Friday that seven people were taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital Saturday, all in stable condition.
It remains unclear what caused the accident and what the exact sequence of events was.
Airlines and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon before reaching the runway.
Some witnesses believe the plane failed to land on the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane fell from a very low level.
"It was very good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others managed to make it to the emergency exits in a sinking, waist-deep plane.
He said the flight attendants were panicked and shouted while he himself suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors who repaired a nearby berth also helped rescue people who were taken aboard an inflatable boat before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 metres.
According to the Air Safety Network, 111 people have been killed in accidents in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none of them belonged to Air Niugini.
An analyst laid out the sequence of events of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor's office presented the facts in a retrial on Saturday of a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for hours as an expert on intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used cell phone recordings to put together the movement of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of his death.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said he had received location data from several mobile phones, which indicated that Tellis was with Chamber on the night of her death, which contradicts previous statements.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed to have been with friend Michael Sanford, police went to question Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford expressed his position and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tell told the truth, claiming that he was in a Sanford truck that night, Sanford replied that he was “lying because his truck was in Nashville.”
Another discrepancy was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks after her death.
Cell phone records show that they had known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers’ death, Tellis deleted Chambers’ messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
“He wiped her out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense will begin its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he thought the case would be referred to the jurors later that day.
The High Breed: What Is Conscious Hip Hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to change the negative attitude towards this genre by spreading positive messages through their music.
The High Breed, from Bristol, says hip-hop has moved away from the roots of political messages and draws attention to social issues.
They want to go back to the origins of hip-hop and re-populate conscious hip-hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently been reborn in the UK with artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black woman?
New York babysitter sues couple over 'racist' message
A New York nurse has sued the couple for discrimination after she received a false address message from a mother who complained she was "another black woman".
The couple denied being racists and called the lawsuit "rape."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, is upset to learn that Giselle Maurice, the new babysitter, was black when she arrived on her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEE, one more black," Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
However, she was not sent to her husband twice, but to Mr. Maurice.
According to the New York Post, when Plasco-Flaxman realized that she had acted carelessly, she was uneasy and dismissed Maurice, claiming that the previous nanny, who was African-American, had done her job badly and hoped to be replaced by a Filipino.
Maurice was paid for one working day and sent home by Uber.
Maurice has now sued the couple for compensation for dismissal and is seeking as much as $350 a day for her half-year of living and working in the client’s home for which she was originally hired, albeit without a contract.
“I want to show them that you can’t do things like that,” she told Post on Friday, adding: “I know this is discrimination.”
The couple responded to the accusations of racism by denying it, saying it was reasonable to fire Maurice because they feared they would not be able to trust her after insulting her.
“My wife sent her what she didn’t want to say.
She is not a racist.
We're not racist," Joel Plasc told the Post.
“Would you trust your children to someone you were disrespectful to when it was a mistake?
Your newborn?
I don't think."
Placas, who equated the lawsuit with "rape", said the wife had had a baby just two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation".
Are you going to judge this?
This is not a very nice behaviour," added the investment banking specialist.
While the case was being heard, the media rushed to condemn the couple on social media, criticizing their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared readers would not understand the talking bear
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It’s hard to feel like someone else reading the book for the first time before it’s published.
Now it’s very interesting to know what we know about Paddington’s tremendous success.”
Saying that her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before finding inspiration to write a children’s book about a teddy bear, would not be too upset if his work had been rejected, added that the 60th anniversary of the book’s release a year after his father’s death was both pleasant and sad.
Referring to Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of the family," she added that the father was quietly proud of his success.
"He was a pretty calm person and didn't like to brag," she said.
“Since Paddington was so much like himself, it felt like he had a child who achieved something: you’re proud of him, but it’s not really your job.
I think he had a similar view of Paddington's success story.
Although this was his work and the fruit of his imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone
After landing, her daughter was rushed to the Nice Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, where doctors were unable to save her life.
"Nadas kept calling and said the condition is really bad and is not expected to survive," Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I got a call from Nada saying she had two minutes to live and I had to say goodbye.
And I said goodbye.
I said to her, “Tashi, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
Medications given by doctors to support her heartbeat slowly stopped working and eliminated her from the body.
She died a little earlier and that was the end of it all.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing it was all going on.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was in an environment surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep it to myself.”
Finally, Ms. Ednan-Laperouse, now in mourning for her dead daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers who did not understand the difficult test she had to face.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
“My head was down and I was in tears all the time.
It’s hard to explain why, but it was on the plane that I felt great pity for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Postcards of mourning women are aimed at preventing suicides on bridges
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide are trying to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys on the Welsh Bridge distribute postcards with inspiring messages and phone numbers for people to call and call for help.
Tyler, Davis’ son, was 13 when he became depressed and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
The 45-year-old resident of Leeds, Davis, said her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said that his smile lit up the room.”
But he quit before he died because he was in a "truly dark place."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, found his suicidal brother.
Davis said: “I’m constantly afraid of a chain reaction.”
Davis wrote the postcards, “so that people know that there are people around who can be contacted and talked to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t sit in silence, you have to speak.”
Humphreys, a longtime friend of Davies, lost her 15-year-old partner, Mark, who died shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he was depressed, he was depressed and he didn't complain about anything," she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
At Christmas, the situation was absolutely bad: when the children unwrapped their gifts, he did not look them in the eyes and did not react in any way.
She said his death was a huge trauma for them, but they have to overcome it: “It has left a void in the family.
It breaks our heart.
But we all have to go on and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance after FBI probe
I thought if we could actually get something he asked for -- a limited-time and extensive investigation -- maybe we'd bring a little bit of unity," Flake said Saturday, adding he feared the committee was "breaking apart" in the firm grip of supporters.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to launch an investigation?
Their contradiction is determined only by time.
There are only five weeks left before the November 6 midterm elections, and if Republicans are expected to turn out badly, their efforts to elect the person they want to run for the country’s highest court will be greatly weakened.
George W. Bush called the senators to try to convince them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for Bush at the White House and met his wife Ashley, Bush's former personal secretary.
What will happen when the FBI reports?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It was still unclear whether Kavanaugh could get 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break ties and endorse him to the Supreme Court.
Since Kim’s rise to power, the number of North Korean defectors has ‘decreased’
A South Korean lawmaker said the number of North Korean defectors to South Korea had fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park, citing data from the South Korean Unification Ministry, said 1,127 defectors were identified last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the main factors were tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher prices for people smuggling.
Pyongyang made no public comments.
Many North Korean defectors are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many have fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarised zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China views defectors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly returns them to their homeland.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks at the heart of the stalled talks on denuclearisation.
This follows a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, when the two agreed in principle to work towards making the Korean Peninsula a nuclear-weapon-free zone.
On Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the U.S. of keeping the sanctions unchanged.
“Without trust in the United States, we cannot trust in our national security, and under these circumstances we will not unilaterally disarm first,” Ri told the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical' and says he is unfit to serve in the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's candidate "hysterical" and said he was unfit to serve in the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made the remarks in an interview with the Texas Tribune festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
“I just can’t help thinking that if a woman did this, she would be said to be hysterical,” Pelosi said in her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has emotionally denied accusations that she sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In her opening remarks about the family and high school years, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes beginning to cry or cry.
He also utterly denounced the Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against him “a grotesque and coordinated destruction of reputation” orchestrated by liberals furious at Hillary Clinton’s loss in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he showed bias towards Democrats.
"I think he's disqualifying himself from his statements and from attacking the Clinton and Democrat parties," she said.
Asked whether she would seek Kavanaugh's removal if his candidacy was approved and the Democrats got a majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi objected.
“If he lies to Congress or to the FBI, he is unfit to serve not only in the Supreme Court but also in the court where he is currently serving,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the District Court of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions on the Affordable Care Act or in the Roe v. Wade case because he was considered a conservative judge.
During the confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided asking whether he would reverse certain Supreme Court rulings.
“Now is not the time to say, with hysterical, biased personality, as a judge, ‘How wonderful!’” Pelosi said.
The power that women should use
This is a legitimate criticism – the anger she has accumulated for months and even years, which she cannot express without tears.
“When we get angry, we cry,” Miss Steinem told me 45 years later.
“It doesn’t seem unusual to me, does it?”
She continued: “I was greatly helped by a woman, a company manager, who told me she was also crying when she was angry, but she developed a method: when she was angry and started to cry, she would tell the person she was talking to: ‘Maybe you think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm really angry."
And she just kept crying.
I thought it was genius.”
Tears are considered an acceptable expression of anger, partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories is of one of my first jobs in the office, where mostly men were working and where I once started to cry because of unspeakable rage. Then an older woman, a harsh manager, who I always feared a little, grabbed me by the shackles and dragged me to the stairwell.
“Never let them see you cry,” she said.
They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad, so they'll be happy to beat you."
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught abusing an adulterer aboard the Monkey Business and withdrew his candidacy, Schroeder, deeply disappointed, concluded that there was no reason not to run for president herself.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” he told me laughing after 30 years.
There were seven other candidates at the time, so there was no need for another one.
Someone called me "The Snow Maiden with Seven Dwarfs."
With the campaign starting late, there was little time left to raise money, so she swore she would not announce her candidacy until she had raised $2 million.
It was an unequal fight.
She noticed that some of the men who donated $1,000 to her were given only 250 each.
“Did they think I was getting a discount?” she asked.
In a speech announcing the launch of a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions — gratitude to the people who supported her, a system of frustration that made it extremely difficult to raise funds and directly reach voters instead of representatives, and anger over sexism — that she wept.
“You would have thought I was nervous,” recalled Schroeder’s press response to her speech.
You would have thought I was supported by the Kleenex napkin business.
I was wondering what would be in the tomb.
“She was crying?”
How China and the U.S. will benefit from China’s trade relations
The first salvos in the U.S.-China trade war have been set in motion, and while the battle is far from over, experts say the rift could eventually benefit Beijing.
US President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year after he imposed taxes on key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The sharpest row came this week when new tariffs came into force, affecting $200 billion worth of goods, effectively taxing half of China’s exports to the United States.
Beijing responded by imposing a five-to-ten percent tariff on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has vowed to fight the United States for its teeth, and the world’s second-largest market is unlikely to come down in the near future.
Washington would only ease sanctions if China complied, but bowing to the US in public would be too difficult for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
But experts say if Beijing plays its part properly, the difficulties of a trade war with the United States could have a positive impact on China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of these markets.
“That a sudden political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would derail the economies of both countries is actually much more dangerous than observers have so far admitted,” said Abigail Grace of the Asia New American Security Center.
Syria's foreign minister says country ready to take back refugees
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild the country after more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
"Thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism, the situation in the territory has become much more stable and secure," he said.
The authorities are continuing efforts to restore the areas destroyed by the terrorists and restore the normal situation.
All the conditions are already in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions against everyday life and well-being.
The United Nations estimates that 5.5 million Syrians have fled Syria since the start of the war in 2011.
Six million people still in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, it also stressed that the country would not accept conditional support or assistance from countries supporting the uprising.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team that defeated the U.S. team in the final score of 16.5-10.5 won the 2018 Ryder Cup at Le Golf National near Paris, France.
The United States has lost for the sixth time in a row in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup since 1993.
Europe regained its crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored 14.5 points, enough to defeat the United States.
US star Phil Mickelson, who had struggled throughout the tournament, fired a blow from the starting field directly into the water on the 16th hole in a 3 day match against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian player Molinari was one of only four players to score 5-0-0 since the tournament took its current form in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth 5:4 was beaten by the lowest-ranking European team player Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the world's highest-ranking player, lost 2-1 to Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup tournament.
Sergio Garcia, a veteran of eight Ryder Cup tournaments, became the most successful European player of all time, scoring 25.5 career points.
“I rarely cry, but today I can’t control myself.
It's been a rough year.
I am very grateful to Mr. Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am very happy, very happy that we have returned the cup.
It all depends on the team, and I am glad that I was able to help,” said S. Garcia, emotionally charged after the victory of the Europeans.
He passes the baton to his compatriot John Ram, who beat US golf legend Tiger Woods 2:1 in a game of singles on Sunday.
“I’m incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, and I grew up watching him play,” said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now holds a 13-21-3 Ryder Cup career record.
It’s a weird statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 of the biggest prizes and is only down to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team failed to hit the drive lawn over the weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played at a high level throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after the disappointing performance: “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
There was a certain moment this morning when we were putting pressure on the Europeans.
We fought.
I'm wearing my hat against Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will regroup, I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and am proud to be their captain.
You have to bow your head.
Our opponents were superior.”
Red Tidal News: Concentration Declines in Painelas, Manatia, and Sarasota
The Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission said in a recent report that the total concentration of "red tides" in the Tampa Bay area is declining.
According to the FWC, more fragmented flowering was observed in Pinelas, Manati, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, suggesting a decline in concentration.
The "red tide" blooms cover about 130 miles of coastline from Northern Pinelas to the southern counties of Li.
Flowering areas can be found about 10 miles off the coast in Hillsboro County, but fewer than last week.
"Red Flood" was also observed in Pasco County.
Last week, it was reported that the concentrations in Pinelas County and along the coast were average, along the Hillsborough County coast from low to high, in Manati County from background to high, in Sarasota County and along the coast from background to high, in Charlotte County from background to medium, along the Lee County coast from background to high, and in Collier County.
There are still reports of respiratory irritation in Pinelas, Manati, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
There have been no reports of respiratory irritation in northwest Florida in the past week.
