Welsh members of parliament are afraid not to be taken seriously
Several members of the National Assembly recently became appalled at a proposal to change the name from assembly member or AM (assembly member) to member of the Welsh Parliament or MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The reaction came because of plans to change the name of the Welsh parliament's parliament.
Members of several political parties are concerned that they may be ridiculed.
A Labour member said his group is worried about you "MWP rhymes on Twp and Pwp"
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, "twp" means silly and "pwp" means shit.
A member of the Plaid party said that the group "is not satisfied" and has proposed alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative member said his group has an "open mind" when it comes to the name change, but added that the MWP is not far from the word "muppet".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced not unlike the English Yorkshire dialect's pronunciation of the letter u.
The National Assembly's delegation, which is now writing bills to introduce the name change, said, "The final decision on which members of the National Assembly should be named will of course be up to the members themselves."
A 2017 Welsh official decision empowered the National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the delegation published the results of a public hearing on the naming proposals that demonstrated great support for calling the Assembly the Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of Members of the National Assembly, the delegation prefers Welsh Member of Parliament or WMP, while the MWP election received the most support during the public hearing.
The National Assembly members have reportedly made other proposals, but the struggle to become one has given the leader of the delegation, Elin Jones, head work. She is to file the bill in a couple of weeks.
The legislation of the reforms contains other changes to how the delegation will function as well, including rules on the disqualification of assembly members and the design of a committee system.
Assembly members will be able to vote on their names when debating the bill.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change the name of the country
Voters are due to vote on Sunday whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia."
The referendum was decided to resolve a conflict that has been going on for many decades with neighboring Greece, which has its own province named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the neighbouring country in the north represents a claim to the territory and has had many objections to Macedonia's membership applications to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the popular vote on the name change, said he will disregard the result.
Those who support the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price of becoming a member of the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Clocks Silence as Churches in Harlem, New York, Suffer
"The old ones I've talked to said that in the old days there was a bar and a church on every corner," Adams said.
"Today, none of the parts are found."
He said he understands why the bars are disappearing.
"People are socializing in other ways nowadays," he said.
"Bars are no longer stoves in the neighborhood that people usually visit."
As for the cows, he is concerned that the money from selling the property will not last as long as the tenants believe, "and sooner or later they are back where they started."
He added that churches can be replaced by condominiums filled with the kind of people who don't care about helping the historic places in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of those who buy condominiums in these buildings are white," he said. "and so comes the day when all the churches are closed, because it is unlikely that these people moving into the condominiums will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white parishes before Harlem became a black neighborhood - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's Church a decade later.
The original White Methodist Congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black parish that had preached nearby moved into the building.
Saint Martin was taken over by a black parish led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who also led the boycott of the shops at 125th Street, a main Harlem shopping street where owners were opposed to hiring or promoting blacks.
The building suffered major damage in a 1939 fire, but when Reverend Johnson's followers planned to rebuild it, they also ordered a new bell toy.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Johnson senior and successor in Saint Martin, was proud and called the bellgame "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played the bellgame in July called it something else: "A cultural treasure" and "a historical instrument that cannot be replaced."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also commented that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who left the church to play the larger carillon in the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said that Saint Martin did not find a replacement for him.
What has happened in St. Martin in recent months has become a complicated tale of architects and construction workers, some of them added by the leaders of the laity in the church, and others of the Episcopal Diocese.
The sacristy, which leads the parish and consists of the leaders of the laity, wrote to the diocese in July with concerns that the diocese "would ask the sacristy to pay," although the sacristy was not involved in the diocese's appointment of architects and construction workers.
Some of the members of the parish have complained of the lack of openness from the diocese.
13-year-old injured by shark during lobster dive in California
Authorities report that a 13-year-old was attacked by a shark on Saturday while diving for lobster in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel commented on KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy crying for help. He paddled away to the boy with a group and pulled him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought only the boy was thrilled to have caught a lobster, before he realized that the boy was shouting "something bit me!
Something bit me!"
"His whole collarbone was ripped off," Hammel said that he observed as he reached the boy.
"I screamed that everyone had to get out of the water: There's a shark in the water!" added Hammel.
The boy was picked up by an air ambulance and taken to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, and his condition is critical.
It is unclear what type of shark it was that attacked the boy.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles said in a press conference that a shark was observed in the area a few weeks earlier, but that shark was not a dangerous black shark.
Giles added that the boy suffered serious injuries to his upper body.
Authorities closed access to the water from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours to investigate and secure the area.
Giles commented that there are more than 135 different species of sharks in the area, but most are not believed to be dangerous.
Store chain Sainsbury's invests in beauty products
The British retail chain Sainsbury's will compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams' beauty products and offer department store services in the store.
As part of an investment in Britain's beauty market, worth <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and continuing to grow as fashion and interior sales go down, Sainsbury's will test out their beauty products in 11 stores next year, and more stores if it becomes a success.
The investment in beauty products comes at a time when the shelves that used to be filled with TVs, microwave ovens and interiors are now empty.
Sainbury's said they will double the number of beauty products to 3,000 products and offer the Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman, and Dr. PawPaw brands for the first time.
They should give the brands L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees more space and have separate areas for each brand such as in the Boots stores.
The store will also relaunch its own makeup series Boutique and make most products vegan, which will attract more young customers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will test the sale of its perfumes in two of Sainsbury's stores; the first opened in Croydon, London, last week, and the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and a shift towards buying small amounts of food every day from local small stores means that large retail chains need to find new ways to reach customers.
Mike Coupe, managing director of Sainsbury's, has commented that the stores will look more and more like department stores, while the store chains are trying to fight low-cost stores Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food goods.
Sainsbury's has merged with the Argos interior chain in hundreds of stores and introduced several Habitat stores, since they bought up both chains two years ago. Sainsbury's claims that this has increased the grocery store and thus defended the acquisition.
The store chain's previous attempt to renew the beauty and pharmacy departments was not a success.
Sainsbury's collaborated with Boots in the early 21st century, but this came to an end as the parties did not agree on how to share the profits from the pharmacies in the stores.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold pharmacy chain Celesio, which had 281 pharmacies and owned pharmacy chain Lloyds, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
They added that Lloyds still has a role to play and is to offer an extended luxury series of skin products, including the brands La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, commented, "We have changed how the beauty shelves will look and be experienced to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also added colleagues with special expertise who will be able to offer beauty services.
Our brands are designed to suit all needs, while the attractive environment and practical placements mean that we are now an attractive beauty destination that challenges the old way of acting."
Peter Jones "furious" after Holly Willoghby withdraws from deal worth <0xC2><0xA3>11 million
The star of the television program Dragons Den, Peter Jones, is "furious" after TV host Holly Willoughby pulled out of a deal with his lifestyle brand worth <0xC2><0xA3>11 million to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby does not have time to promote their interior and worship brand Truly.
The couple's collaboration has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The host of the program This Morning, 37, made the news known on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has left the star of Dragons Den, Peter Jones, amid the development of their new collaboration on a lifestyle brand to focus on her own contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones was "furious" when the golden Holly confessed during a strained meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of Jones' business in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that Holly's new contracts - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - mean she no longer has time to collaborate on the Truly interior and belonging brand.
The collaboration has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was thought to double Willoughby's estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to announce she will not be working with Truly, while Jones escaped Britain to calm down in one of her holiday homes.
One source said, "Truly was certainly at the top of Holly's priorities.
It would be her long-term plan for the future, and would last for many decades.
Her decision to withdraw has surprised everyone involved.
Nobody believed their own ears on Tuesday, Truly was so close to launch.
There is a warehouse in Marlow filled with goods ready for sale."
Experts believe that the decision of the This Morning host, who is one of the richest stars in the UK, may cost the company millions due to hefty investments in products, from cushions to candles to clothing and interiors, and may cause delays with the launch.
And it can mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, who is the mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close friends of Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby created the brand Truly together with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
Couple holiday together and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the brand ambassador for the M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin hosting ITV's program I'm A Celebrity.
A source near Jones said last night, "We're not commenting on his business."
Tough conversations "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the media for making a comment some might perceive as "unpresidential" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Said Trump with his nonsense voice as a "news speaker".
"I haven't given up anything."
He commented that Kim is interested in a new meeting following their first meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump called a major step towards the disarmament of the nuclear weapons program in North Korea.
But the negotiations on the nuclear weapons program have stopped.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, the top diplomat from North Korea Ri Yong Ho told world leaders in the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea has not received a "similar response" from the United States regarding North Korea's early disarmament.
Instead, he added, the United States continued with sanctions to pressure North Korea.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
"It's going great between us and North Korea," he said.
"We were going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He added that his work to improve relations with Kim has brought positive results - the end of rocket testing, aiding in the release of hostages and the return of the leases to US soldiers.
He defended his unusual approach in terms of relations with Kim.
"It's so easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get in, we had around 200 people standing right there," Trump said, pointing to the group standing in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroy island and kill hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, foreign aid organizations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of residents of Lombok had to flee, no one declared a national state of emergency, which is required to receive international emergency aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have been very clear that they don't want international help, so it's a bit challenging," Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is still not certain whether employees with foreign passports are allowed to work in the field.
Sutopo, the spokesman for the National Crisis Agency in Indonesia, said that authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organizations are allowed to provide emergency assistance.
Although Indonesia is prone to earthquakes often, the country is not particularly prepared for the forces of nature.
In the Aceh area, they have built shelters for tsunamis, but they are not common in the rest of the country.
Despite warnings of tsunamis in Palu, there was no alarm, most likely leading to more victims.
Travelling between the Indonesian islands is usually quite challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship docked in Lombok to treat those injured in the earthquake is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on the improvement of infrastructure in Indonesia during the presidential election, and has spent a lot of money on new roads and railways.
However, a lack of funding has made it difficult for the administration of President Joko, and next year there are elections again.
President Joko is also being pressured in terms of sectarian tensions in Indonesia, while members of the Muslim majority have welcomed his conservative beliefs.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to flee as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using machetes, arrows and bows, and other primitive weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge saves Liverpool vs. Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea by scoring in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received the ball from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 metres from Chelsea's goal while the position was 1-0.
He pushed the ball to the left before kicking it up and towards the goal.
The attempt sealed high above the penalty area and faked towards the right upper corner of the goal.
Finally, the ball fell over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and into the goal.
"I was just trying to get into that position to take the ball, and I knew that players like Shaq are trying to get as far forward as possible, so I was just trying to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and drop the ball once without thinking about it, and then I shot the ball."
Chelsea led 1-0 after the break after scoring in the 25th minute by Belgian star Eden Hazard.
Before the goal, Hazard gave the ball to Mateo Kovacic before spanning off near the midfield into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic quickly took the ball on the midfield.
Then he shot it beautifully and led Hazard into the penalty area.
Hazard ran faster than Liverpool's defense and scored with his left foot right past goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will play against Naples in the group stage of the Champions League at 15 on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea are scheduled to play against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Number of victims in Indonesia tsunami increases to 832
The number of victims in the Indonesia earthquake and tsunami has increased to 832, the country's emergency agency reported early Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings that collapsed in the earthquake, which occurred on Friday and had a strength of 7.5 followed by 6-foot-high waves, the spokesman for the emergency agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, reported in a press conference.
The town of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is now covered with collapsed buildings.

Parliament statue of Cromwell becomes last victim of "the rewriting of history"
The removal of the statue would be the karma of Cromwell and the Taliban-like destruction of several cultural and religious artefacts in England as his Puritan followers did during the 17th-century Civil War.
However, the Cromwell Association described Crick's proposal for the removal of the statue as "stupid" and "an attempt to rewrite the story."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Association, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate about the removal of statues, that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would become a target.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil War was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor, Thomas, in the century before.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's excellent representation of Cromwell is evidence of public opinion in the 19th century, and is part of the historiography of a figure that many still finds it worth celebrating."
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was in the 19th century, and is still today, seen as a defender of parliament against external pressure, and in his case it was of course against the monarchy.
Whether this representation is correct or not, is still a topic of discussion in historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century has shaped the development of our nation, and Cromwell was an individual who we know represented one side of that distinction.
What he achieved as Lord Protector is also worthy of celebration and commemoration."
Killer pig attacks and kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, surnamed Yuan, was found dead, with cut arteries and covered with blood, near a pig bin at the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou Province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to give pigs vaccines on a farm on 30 May, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He had recently left with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, he found his cousin dead, and discovered that the gate to one of the pig's legs was open.
He said that in the bin there was a large male pig with blood around its mouth.
The autopsy showed that a 250 kg heavy pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and broken," said the cousin, named Wu, to the Guiyang Evening News.
Surveillance cameras show that Yuan arrived at the market at 04:40 on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed him did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market leader told Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent him from attacking others, while police gathered evidence of the crime scene.
Yuan's family is now negotiating compensation with the leader of the market.
Although rare, such attacks from pigs have occurred before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 295 kilogram pig held a Welsh farmer trapped between him and a tractor, until his wife scared the pig away.
After a farmer in Oregon became eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba reported to CBC News that pigs are not aggressive to normal but that the taste of blood can trigger the animals.
"They just want to play.
They like to bite a little, they're curious... they won't hurt you.
You just have to have enough respect for them," he said.
Remains of Hurricane Rosa brings rain to the southwestern United States
As predicted in the weather forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weakening over the cool waters along the northern coast of Mexico.
Nevertheless, Rosa will carry sprouting rain to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the next few days.
Rosa had winds up to 136 km/h and was a Category 1 hurricane until 05:00 in the eastern time zone of the United States on Sunday, and the hurricane center was 620 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa will move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low pressure is forming over the Pacific Ocean, moving eastward towards the west coast of the United States. Pink approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, and will move tropical humidity northward to the southwestern United States.
Pink will bring up to 25 centimeters of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
The tropical humidity will react with the low pressure and cause thick rain in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, between 3 and 10 centimeters of rain can create dangerous floods and possible landslides in the desert.
Tropical humidity will cause rains of between 5 and 7 centimeters per hour in some parts of the southwestern United States, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Between 5 and 10 centimeters of rain is expected in parts of the southwestern United States; especially over much of Arizona.
Dangerous floods can occur due to scattered terrain and tropical rain.
It is warned against hiking in the desert on foot due to the danger of tropical rain.
Rain can turn gorges into flooding rivers and lightning and thunderstorms will bring strong winds and dust.
The coming low pressure will also bring rain to parts of the coast in southern California.
Total rainfall of over 1 centimeter is possible, which can create small floods and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainy town for the season in the region.
Spreading tropical rains will start in Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, before rain increases late Monday and Tuesday.
The Four Corners region can expect a lot of rain on Tuesday and Wednesday.
October may witness intense temperature fluctuations throughout the United States while the Arctic is getting colder, but tropical regions will still be quite hot.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic differences in temperatures, even between small areas.
Sunday was an example of dramatic temperature differences in central United States.
There is almost 20 degrees temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, late summer heat will try to build up and spread again.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to experience a warm start in October, with 25 degrees and up from the southern part of the vast plains to parts of the northeastern United States.
New York City could reach 25 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
The long-term forecast indicates that there are high chances of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States through the first half of October.
More than 20 million watch Brett Kavanaugh hearing
On Thursday, more than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in the U.S. Supreme Court and the woman who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six different TV channels.
At the same time, the political discussion surrounding the case continued, with interruptions in the regular television programs by various broadcasters to reveal the latest news on Friday: an agreement reached by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake that the FBI will investigate the charges within the next week.
Ford told the Supreme Court committee that she is 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh touched her when he was drunk and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said, during an emotional interrogation, that he is 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people saw the hearing on Friday, according to Nielsen.
The company reached this number by finding the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC.
The numbers were not clear from other channels showing off, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also has trouble counting viewers watching from the office.
To put this in perspective, there is a similar number of viewers watching an American football final or the Oscars.
Fox News' hosts have supported Kavanaugh, and the channel was also the one with the most viewers during the day with 5.69 million viewers, Nielsen said.
ABC was in second place 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
People are still interested after the hearing.
Flake was in focus during the drama on Friday.
After Flake, who is a moderate Republican, declared that he is on Kavanaugh's side, he was filmed by CNN and CBS as Protestants shouted after him on his way to a hearing with a judges committee on Friday.
He stood and watched on the ground for several minutes while the Protestants yelled at him on CNN live.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you believe he is telling the truth to our country?"
Some said to him, "You have power, while so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office has spoken out, and before going into the elevator he said he would have more to say during the committee hearing.
Broadcasting agencies showed the hearing on television when the judges committee would vote for or against the nomination of Kavanaugh to the full-seat Senate and further vote.
But Flake said he could only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations against Kavanaugh within the next week, which Democrats have also requested.
Flake was partly overjoyed after talking to his buddy, Democrat, and Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators afterwards, Flake made a decision.
Flake's decision proved to have power, because it became clear that the Republicans could not vote for Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the complaints against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May blames critics for "playing politics" in terms of Brexit
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May, blames critics of her plans to leave the EU for "playing politics" with Britain's future without regard to national interests, in an interview with The Sunday Times newspaper.
Theresa May is in Birmingham, England, to attend the Conservative Party's conference on September 29, 2018.
Next to May's interview on the front page of the Sunday Times stands an interview with former Secretary of State Boris Johnson, in which he attacks the so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and says that the proposal for Britain and the EU to collect each other's fees is "quite absurd."
Wayde Sims shooting in the United States: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson for Sims shooting
Police have arrested a man suspected of the fatal shooting where Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from Louisiana State University (LSU), was killed.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and imprisoned for wilful murder, police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana say.
An official video shows the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost their glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses on the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to a report from the WAFB channel, which is linked to CBS.
After interrogating Simpson, police said he admitted to shooting Wayde.
Simpson's bail was set at $350,000, reports local newspaper The Advocate.
The East Baton Rouge coroner publicized an early autopsy report on Friday showing that the cause of death was a shot in the head that went into the neck.
The Baton Rouge police thank the Louisiana State Police Special Forces, the State Police's crime lab, Southern University police and local residents for helping them find Simpson.
The athletic director of LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the local police for being "aware in achieving justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2 meter tall basketball player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
On average, he scored 5.6 points with 2.6 setbacks per game last season.
Friday morning LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team is "troubled" after Wayde was killed.
"This is something we're always afraid of," Wade said.
Volcano spewing ashes over Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached southern parts of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Emergency Prevention is asking Mexicans to stay away from the volcano on Sunday after activity increased in the crater and the center recorded 183 gas and ash emissions within 24 hours.
The center had observed several rumblings and quakes.
Photos on social media show thin layers of ash on cars in various Mexico City neighborhoods, including Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano is known as "Don Goyo" and has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists within the anniversary of the independence vote
Six Protestants were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters for independence bumped together with police forces, and thousands of other protesters protested against independence one year after the vote on possible detachment from Spain.
A group of masked separatists were held back by police forces while throwing eggs and powder coatings that created dark clouds of dust in streets that are usually full of tourists.
Collusion also broke out later in the day, and police used batons to prevent escalation.
For several hours, the separatists shouted "Don't forget, don't forgive" while the protesters against self-determination shouted, "Long live Spain."
Local news channels reported that fourteen people were being treated for minor injuries following the protests.
The mood is still pressed in the region and many will still have independence one year after the October 1 vote, which was called illegal by Madrid but which was celebrated by separatists in Catalonia.
Most voters voted for independence, but there was also low turnout among those who opposed independence and boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to prevent the rioting and violent clashes occurred in the region.
Groups that were too independent slept in tents on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the state police.
However, the demonstration went off the pile, but it was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in the separatist protests with his wife, said he no longer has hopes of independence in Catalonia.
"Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying out of joy to be able to voice for independence, but now we're stuck again," he said.
Although they won the regional elections last December, the Catalan parties that are too independent are struggling to retain power this year, while many of their leaders are in exile or arrest while awaiting trial for their role in organizing the popular vote and the ensuing declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the protests in support of police on her phone, said the conflict was harassed by police officers on both sides.
"The tension is increasing more and more," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been part of ongoing trials since last year, declared that he will run for European Parliament next year.
"To run as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to condemn the return of democratic values and the oppression we have experienced from the Spanish state," he said.
Londonderry, Northern Ireland: Men arrested for deliberately crashing car into house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after crashing into a house intentionally repeatedly in Londonderry, Northern Ireland.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 local time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the car caused damage to the entrance gate and the building itself.
A crossbow may have been used to shoot at the car.
Menga shot gives Livingston 1-0 win over Rangers in Scottish football
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secures says
Excited Livingston surprises Rangers and Steven Gerrard experiences his second shot after 18 games as coach for the Ibrox club in Glasgow.
Dolly Menga's shot proved to make the difference while Gary Holt's side evened with Hibernian in others.
Gerrard's side has no away wins in the Scottish Premiership league this season, and is scheduled to play against the Hearts, which they are eight points behind, next Sunday.
Prior to that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna of the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston has six consecutive victories, and head coach Holt has still not lost since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses chances against away team
Holt's team should have hired long before they scored, creating more problems for the Rangers with their direct play.
Scott Robinson broke through, but had low efforts towards the goal, which meant Alan Lithgow had to work hard after the encounter with Craig Halkett's heading over the goal.
The home team was happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause trouble for the away team.
And that's how the decisive goal became scoring.
The Rangers agreed to a free kick and Livingston made an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson went against Menga, who took a touch and scored from the middle of the penalty area.
Prior to that, the Rangers dominated the ball, but saw that home defense was solid and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was focused.
This pattern continues into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to save a goal.
Scott Pittman tried to score, but was stopped by Rangers' keeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow flicked wide after the ball was returned from Livingston.
Passes were sent back and forth in the Livingston penalty field, while two penalties—after Halkett's challenge to Glenn Middleton, and one for hand—were worn away.
'phenomenal' from Livingston analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal struggle and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
Each player played fantastically and still impresses on the curve upwards.
Their playing and playing style has hardly changed since they returned to the top class, but much of the thanks go to Holt for the way he has shocked the team since becoming a coach.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was intense, organizing a military-level defense, while Menga distracted Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall throughout the fight.
The Rangers, by contrast, were not motivated.
Still as good as they have been under Gerrard, they were not good enough this time.
They did not play well enough, only cutting up the home half once, which should make the Rangers realize that they are no longer reaching up.
Erdogan is welcomed in Cologne
The leaders of Turkey and Germany smiled under the blue sky when they met to eat breakfast on Saturday, September 29, in Berlin.
It is the last day of Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which is hoped to repair relations between the two NATO countries.
Countries have differed in terms of human rights, press freedom and Turkey's role in the EU.
Erdogan went to Cologne to open a large, new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police prevented a crowd of over 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque due to "security reasons," but many of Erdogan's supporters showed up to see his president.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan - many of them Kurdish - also showed up to condemn Erdogan's policies and the German state's decision to welcome him into the country.
The dueling Protestants reflected the distinction between German Turks, who view Erdogan as a hero, and others, who view him as an autocrat.
Car Accident in Deptford, London: Cyclist Killed After Car Collision
A cyclist has lost his life in a collision with a car London.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy Deptford road in southeast London, at 10:15 a.m. local time.
The driver stopped and ambulance personnel arrived quickly, but the man died at the scene.
The collision occurred only a few months after another cyclist died when the driver ran off in Childers Street, about one mile (1.6 km) from today's accident.
London police reported that they are in the process of identifying the man and informing his family.
Roads have been closed and buses have to run around the area, while other motorists have been urged to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison in England: Six guards injured in riot
Six prison guards have been injured in a riot in a men's high-security prison, says the prison office in England.
Ongoing disorder erupted in HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. local time on Sunday.
Special "Tornado" forces are enlisted to calm the rebellion, involving eight prisoners in a secluded part of the prison.
The guards have been treated for minor injuries to the face.
A prison spokesman said, "Specially trained guards should calm down the ongoing rebellion in HMP Long Lartin.
Six guards have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we are clear that those responsible will be reported to the police and may have to sit in jail longer."
There are more than 500 people in HMP Long Lartin, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the UK.
In June, it was reported that the prison director was being treated for injuries, after a prisoner was attacked.
And in October last year, special forces had to come to the prison to calm down a serious riot, where prisoners threw billiard balls at the guards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with embarrassment (to the benefit of drought areas)
Tropical lows are rare in Arizona, but it is precisely such a weather phenomenon that is heading towards Arizona in early next week, in which the remnants of Hurricane Rosa move southwest across the desert and create fear of tide.
The National Weather Service has issued warnings of flooding on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and south and east Nevada, southeast California, and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to move directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, and may be giving rain as early as late Monday.
The Phoenix National Weather Service tweeted that only "ten tropical cyclones have had tropical storm or low pressure status within 300 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that reached 60 miles within the Arizona border."
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center report between 5 and 10 centimeters of rain, with isolated amounts up to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim area of Arizona.
It can rain between 2 and 5 centimeters in other areas of the southwestern desert, including central parts of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, with isolated totals up to 10 centimeters.
For areas outside flood risk, the rain from Rosa can be a blessing in the dry.
Although embarrassment is a serious concern, this rain is likely to benefit areas of the southwestern United States that are prone to drought.
According to drought monitors in the United States, extreme drought is present in over 40 percent of Arizona, which is the second-highest drought category, reports weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will move across the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
With winds of over 135 kilometers per hour, Rosa is on Sunday morning 619 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm encounters colder water in the Pacific and therefore calms down.
It is expected to reach the coast of Mexico by tropical storm force, Monday afternoon or evening.
It's going to rain a lot in parts of Mexico, which can increase the risk of embarrassment.
"Rains between 7 and 15 centimeters are expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with the possibility of up to 25 centimeters," reported weather.com.
Rosa will pull north along Mexico like a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which will pull further up through Arizona and into southern Utah Tuesday night.
"The biggest danger with Rosa or the remains of this one, is a lot of rain in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the American southwestern desert," said the National Hurricane Center.
This rain is expected to create life-threatening floods in desert areas and landslides in mountain areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton, England: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested, suspected of murder after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset, England.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 4:00 a.m. on Saturday.
He was transported to hospital, and his condition is stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested last night in the Radstock area, reports Avon and Somerset Police.
Police have urged people who may have mobile recordings of what happened, to make contact.
Trump says Kavanaugh "suffered" under how "bad and angry" Democrats were against him
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the relentless and unreasonable tactics of the Democrats," Trump said during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has "suffered" under how "bad and angry" the Democrats were through the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday, emotionally denying the charge from Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago, when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified to her accusations during the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that the "American people saw how brilliant and brave" Kavanaugh was that day.
"A voice to Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to one of the most skilled lawyers of our time, a lawyer with flawless public service," he said to a crowd of followers in West Virginia.
The president also referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke of the importance of voting in the United States midterm elections for Republicans.
"Five weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm really running," he said.
"That's why I travel around to fight for good candidates."
Trump argued that Democrats are out to "oppose and block."
The first important Senate vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place late Friday, a Republican representative told CNN.
Hundreds killed in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, number of killed increases
At least 384 people have been killed, many of them taken by huge waves on beaches, while a severe earthquake and a tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities reported on Sunday.
Hundreds of people gathered to take part in a festival on the beach in the town of Palu on Friday when the waves, which were six feet high, hit the beach at sunset, taking many people while destroying everything they came across.
The tsunami came after a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the warning of the tsunami came yesterday, there were still people on the beach who didn't leave immediately and so they became victims," stated Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the crisis relief agency in Indonesia BNPB, in Jakarta.
"As if the tsunami was not enough in itself, it drew cars, tree trunks, houses; it hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had travelled over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
Some climbed trees to avoid the tsunami and survived that way.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Photos from the air published by the emergency agency show many destroyed buildings and shops, distorted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to hit the coastal town on Saturday.
The earthquakes could be marked in the surrounding area, which has a population of 2.4 million.
Indonesia's Agency for Testing and Testing Technology (BPPT) stated that the energy from Friday's earthquake was about 200 times stronger than the energy from the atomic bombs over Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, located at the end of a long, narrow wave, may have increased the size of the tsunami, the agency said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of the dead have been found under the remains of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and that 29 are still missing.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and the size of the destruction may be greater along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
"We haven't heard anything from Donggala, communication has been cut," Nugroho said.
"More than 300,000 people live there," stated the Red Cross, adding that their employees and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse," said the Red Cross.
The crisis agency was criticized on Saturday for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, although authorities said waves came within the time period warned.
An amateur video shared on social media shows a man on the top floor of a building shouting desperately to people down the street to warn them of the coming wave.
A few minutes later, a wall of water hits the coast, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to verify the video at first.
The quake and tsunami caused power outages and cut communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate emergency relief.
The military has started the process of sending in cargo aircraft with emergency aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities report, but the refugees still need food and have other basic needs.
The city's airport was reopened to accept emergency aid, but will continue to be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
The employees of World Vision from Donggala have arrived safely in Palu City, and have set up tents in the backyard of their office. On their way to the city, they passed completely destroyed areas, Doseba said.
"They told me they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
It's very bad.
As emergency relief organizations begin work to help those affected by the tsunami, some have complained that foreign emergency workers with expertise in crisis management have been denied entry to Palu.
Under Indonesian law, foreign aid organizations and their employees cannot start work until Indonesia has declared the area a national crisis zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It's a crisis at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Red Cross of Indonesia.
"When the state says 'OK, this is a national crisis,' we can open for international emergency aid, but they haven't updated their status yet."
It is evening again in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, and friends and family of those who are still slowing down are still hoping for a miracle, but know that such natural disasters do not plague end well.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued from the sewer.
On Sunday, a woman was rescued from the remains of a collapsed building, where she had a doctor trapped next to her dead mother for two days.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, coached two of the slowed-down paragliders from the Asian games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
A man called Monday said that any of those trapped in the Roa Roa hotel were his students.
"As one with a lot of experience in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden to carry," he said.
Gendon told that he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the paragliders from Palu, who had taken part in the local beach festival, after hearing that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed.
But his messages showed only a gray chin, instead of two blue chins.
"I think that means the messages didn't come out," he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 from ATM in Newport, Levee, United States
On Friday, thieves stole $26,750 from a worker at Brink's company in what he was filling up an ATM in Newport, Levee, United States, according to a Newport police press release.
The worker had just emptied an ATM in the entertainment area and was delivering more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy stated in the press release.
As the worker was busy, a man "jumped up behind the worker" and stole a sack of money to be delivered.
Witnesses observed several suspects as they escaped the scene, according to the press release, but police were unable to determine the number of people involved in the robbery.
If someone has information about who was involved, they should call the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name - to Ye.
He declared the name change on Twitter on Saturday, writing: "The creation formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has had Ye as a nickname for a while, using the name as the title of his eighth album, which he released in June.
The name change came just before he was scheduled to perform on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show after she cancelled due to "emotional reasons," said the program host.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current stage name, West has previously stated that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I think the word 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year when he discussed the album title with radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
The name has changed from Kanye, meaning the only one, to just Ye - to reflect the good we do, the bad we do, our confusion, everything.
The album reflects on who we are."
Kanye is one of several famous rappers who have changed his name.
Sean Combs is formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he declared that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has collaborated with West in the past, has also changed the writing style of the name with and without hyphens and uppercase letters.
Future president of Mexico vows not to send military against civilians
The future president of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has vowed to never send military forces against civilians. The country is soon to mark the 50th anniversary of the bloody treatment of students.
Lopez Obrador pledged on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he "will never use the military to oppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the military shot down peaceful protesters and killed about 300 people, at a time when left-wing student movements were spreading in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly support to students and opening several free universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of access to education have led young people to join criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its investment in artificial intelligence
Since China is working more actively on artificial intelligence, the United States should double its investments in research on the subject, says the investor and user of artificial intelligence, Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments came after various parts of the U.S. government expressed their views on artificial intelligence, although the U.S. lacks a formal strategy for the use of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year, aiming to be number 1 in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"A doubling of the budget for artificial intelligence research would be a good start, since all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence," Lee said.
A doubling in funding could double the chances of the next major breakthrough in artificial intelligence taking place in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, who published the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" this month via publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO (CEO) of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the largest artificial intelligence companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University with an artificial intelligence system that beat the highest-ranked player of the game Othello, and later he worked as a leader in Microsoft Research and was Chairman of Google in China.
Lee recognized previous technology competitions organized by the U.S. state, such as the "Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge" and asked what time the next competition should be, allowing him to join and identify the next visionaries.
Scientists in the United States usually have to work hard to get support from the state, Lee said.
"It's not China taking the academic leaders, it's the big companies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have hired excellent students from universities to work with artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States strengthen its research on artificial intelligence.
"I think that doctoral students in the field of artificial intelligence should be granted automatic residence permits," he said.
China’s government announced its next-generation artificial intelligence plan in July 2017.
China's National Federation of Natural Sciences funds students at academic institutions, not unlike the U.S. National Sciences Federation and other state organizations' way of distributing money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of the academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint artificial intelligence center, intended to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House declared the formation of an artificial intelligence committee.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI (Artificial Intelligence) Next.
The National Science Association invests more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
At the same time, no one has been working on the bills on national security and artificial intelligence for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country's name
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday in a referendum whether they should change the name of the Republic of North Macedonia to resolve a decades-old conflict with Greece, which has been trying to prevent Macedonia from becoming a member of the EU and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, insists that the name of the neighbouring country in the north represents a claim to their territory, and has used its veto to vote against membership of Macedonia in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the new proposed name, but nationalist opponents argue that the name change may undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of the population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, and a boycott has cast doubt on how far the referendum will reach the at least 50 percent of the population it needs to be valid.
The question on the seat of the referendum is: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership and agree on the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price of the name change is worth membership of the EU and NATO. Macedonia is one of the countries that achieved independence after the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I am here today to voice for the future of this country, for the youth of Macedonia, so they can live freely under the umbrella of the EU, because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the vote is not binding under the law, a sufficient number of Members of Parliament have said that they will follow the result of the vote to make it decisive.
In order for the name change to take place, Parliament needs two-thirds of the dissolution.
The state election committee reported that nothing unusual had happened by 13:00.
Only 16 percent had voted, as opposed to 34 percent in previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 of all registered voters voted.
"I am voting for my children, we belong to Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voiced in Strumika in the Macedonian People's Referendum whether to change their name and open to join NATO and the EU on September 30, 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, organized a boycott of the referendum in front of the parliament of Skopje, by setting up tents and chairs.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we are not to change the name of our country," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us under the name Macedonia, we can go to others, like China and Russia, and become part of the Eurasian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev has stated that membership of NATO will attract investors to Macedonia, which has over 20 percent unemployment.
"I think the majority is going to vote for the change, of which 80 percent of our citizens will become a member of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He said that a "yes" result can be interpreted as a "confirmation of our future."
A poll last Monday by Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters are going to take part in the referendum – which is below the required figure.
Another poll by the Telma TV channel in Macedonia, showed that 57 percent of voters plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, the channel said 70 percent would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to close, at least 50 percent must vote, plus one vote.
If the referendum does not close, it could damage the policies of the left-wing government that took over in May.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero navigates through Brighton defense and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling wrecked Brighton defense which led to 2–0 win for Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy, scoring in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker accepted a pass on the midfield at the start of the sequence.
He crashed past three Brighton defensive players and reached open field.
Suddenly, Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He got around one defender, before running past several others on the edge of the Brighton penalty field.
He got past a pass on the left and found Sterling.
The English striker used his first kick in the field to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton keeper Mathew Ryan with a shot right into the right end of the goal.
"Aguero still struggles with his feet," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him playing 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored when he did."
But it was Sterling who gave them sky blue the first advantage in the Premier League game.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball deep inside Brighton territory.
He beautifully kicked the ball along the left end of Leroy Sane's field.
Sane kept the ball as he led Sterling towards the goal.
The sky blue pointer kicked the ball into goal just before slipping out of the pitch.
City will play against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a spoiler against the Rockies in American baseball
With the Nationals eliminated from "playoff contention", there was not much reason to force a new start.
Scherzer has a high competitive instinct, and hopes to take the "mound" on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if it can lead to a "playoff" for the Rockies, who lead with one game over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies won at least 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but are looking forward to locking in the First Division title.
"Although we're not playing for anything, it's worth playing because of the atmosphere here in Denver, with the crowd and the other team most likely playing at the highest level so far this year.
Who wouldn't want to play with such relationships?"
It is still unclear who will start in the Nationals on Sunday, but Scherzer may be going to "pitch".
Scherzer, who then starts for the 34th time, threw a "bullpen session" on Thursday and is going to "pitch" normally on Sunday.
Scherzer, coming from Washington, is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 "strikeouts" in 220 2/3 "innings" this season.
Trump gathers voters in West Virginia
The president obscurely referred to his first election for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while speaking of the importance of voting for Republicans in the midterms in the United States.
"Everything we've done so far is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the big, big -- I'm not running, but I'm running around everywhere to fight for the best candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You can see this terrible, terrible group of Democrats, you see it's happening right now.
And they are convinced that they will certainly take back power, you see how horrible they are, how disgusting they are.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to take power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we're not going to give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "oppose and block."
"And you can see it based on the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "angry and nasty and nasty and dishonest."
He referred to Senator and Democrat Dianne Feinstein, who made his audience bow.
"Do you remember her answer?
Was it you who leaked documents?
Uh, uh, what?
No, eh no, I'm expecting - it was really bad body language - the worst body language I've seen."
Labour is no longer tolerant.
They are intolerant to those who say what they think
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, it was not surprising.
After all, I am the last in a number of Labour MPs who have been told that I am not welcome - just to say what I mean.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated the same way because she protested anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
In terms of the importance of conducting responsible economics, national security, Europe, and other similar issues on which Jeremy ironically disagreed with previous leaders.
The call for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated, "We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
In my last eight years as Labour MP, Friday meetings have been just like that.
Unfortunately, today's meeting was not like that, and the promise of "sniffler" politics is long forgotten, if at all it was followed.
It has become more and more evident that different points of view are not tolerated in Labour, and that each opinion is judged by the leaders of the party.
This happened shortly after Jeremy became the party leader, when colleagues I used to agree politically suddenly expected me to change my mind and agree on matters I would never agree on - whether it was about national security or the EU internal market.
When I speak in public it doesn't matter what I say, I always get mugged on social media and people want me to resign while they criticize center politics and say I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments against me are at least political.
I admire my colleagues who get gender-discriminatory and racist harassment directed at them every day, and who are still professional and do not resign.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this time period is how normalized harassment of police officers has become.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should be more tolerant.
In essence, we are no longer a tolerant party that has something for everyone; for every motion of censure and for every change in party rules, the party becomes narrower and narrower.
I've received a lot of advice over the last two years from people who have said I have to take it easy and not be so loud, so maybe people will "like me better."
But that's not why I chose to join politics.
When I joined Labour, when I was still in school 32 years ago, it was because I was angry at Thatcher and how the government was failing the country. My classroom was collapsing, so I would have better public services for those who need them the most - whether it was as a councillor or government minister.
I have never hidden my political opinions, even in previous elections.
No one in Nottingham East can have doubted what I stand for and which of the current leaders I do not agree with.
To those who voted for the bill on Friday, I can only say that when the country rushes towards a Brexit that will harm private, local agencies and public services, I don't understand why people care about wasting their energy questioning my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But in fact, the only message I have directed is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to the voters in the electorate, whether they are Labour voters or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no one can make me resign or change my policy and prevent me from serving you the way I think is best for you all.

Ayr 38–17 Melrose: Invincible Ayr goes to the top in Scottish rugby
Two late "tries" may have changed the result a little, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this very entertaining Tennent's Premiership game today.
They now stand at the top of the podium as the only invincible team out of a total of ten.
It was their sovereign defense and ability to take chances that gave the home team and their coach, Peter Murchie, good reason to be happy.
"We've been put to the test in the last games, and we're still invincible, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Ayr deserves praise, they were better at taking chances than us."
Grant Anderson had a "try" for 14 minutes, where Frazier Clima tried a "conversion," putting Ayr in front, but a yellow card from Scotland captain Rory Hughes of the Warriors allowed Melrose to gather, and Jason Baggot took an "unconverted try."
Clima received a penalty just before the break, he scored and "converted" a "solo try" to give Ayr 17-5 before the break.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's "try," which was "converted" by Baggot, reduced the swinging money by five points.
There was a long break when Ruaridh Knott was seriously injured and laid on a stretcher, and from the restart, Ayr faked forward through a "try" from Stafford McDowall, which Clima "converted."
The acting captain of Ayr, Blair MacPherson, was given a yellow card, and again Melrose tried an "unconverted Bruce Colvine try," at the end of a series of aggressive games.
The home team played back, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card to tackle Clima without the ball from the penalty lineup, MacPherson scored a "try."
Clima "converted" again after Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong's "box kick" and sent the "flanker" Gregor Henry away from the home team's fifth "try."
The star of the Scottish series, Still Game, starts new career in the restaurant business
Scottish Still Game star, Ford Kieran, seems ready for a new career in the restaurant business, after it was discovered that he is the CEO of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC program, which he writes and plays with his partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last, and it seems that Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official lists, he is CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor will not comment on the matter, but a source from the Scottish Sun newspaper has hinted that Kiernan would involve himself in the "successful restaurant business" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia hopes court will open waterway to Pacific
Sailors patrol naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings flag with sea blue flags.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are covered with the motto: "The sea is ours. We are right
and duty to return to it.”
In landlocked Bolivia, the people can still remember a coastline the country lost to Chile, in a bloody conflict over resources in the 19th century. They long to sail in the Pacific again.
These hopes are perhaps stronger than in many decades while Bolivia awaits the verdict of the International Court of Justice to come on October 1, after five years of jurisdiction.
"Bolivia has drive, serenity and is united, and of course expects a positive result," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians are going to look at the verdict of the International Court of Justice, hoping that the Court of The Hague supports Bolivia's claim, and that Chile - after decades of negotiations - gives Bolivia an independent exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic native president of Bolivia - who is striving to be elected again next year - has good reason to hope for a positive result.
"Now we will soon be returning to the Pacific," he promised in late August.
However, some analysts do not believe the court will allow Bolivia access to the sea - and that little would have changed itself if they had access.
The Netherlands-based United Nations Court of Justice has no power to transfer Chilean territory to Bolivia and has stipulated that they will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
That the court's verdict comes only six months after the last proceedings, indicates that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
The last four years have far from promoted Bolivia's cause, they have done the opposite.
"The issue of access to the sea has been taken over by the current Bolivian administration," said Zárate.
Morales, with his belligerent rhetoric, has killed what was left of Chile's goodwill, Zárate thought.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue negotiations, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss the issue afterwards.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The former president, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who is Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to open new relations with Chile" and a chance to "set a line at 139 years of disagreement and rather benefit both," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, used this maritime issue to win votes.
"Bolivia will never give up the right of access to the Pacific," he added.
"The verdict is a possibility to see what we need to do to forget the past."
North Korea says they won't abolish nuclear weapons if they can't trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his nation cannot be the first to abolish, if they cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to follow up on the promises they made during the meeting in Singapore between the U.S. and North Korean leaders.
Ri's comments come at a time when U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pomepo, seems to want to restart his locked-in nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the Singapore meeting with North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un.
Ri says the United States has a false hope that North Korea will submit if the United States continues with sanctions and opposes any declaration of the end of the Korean war.
Washington refuses to agree to any declaration of the end of the war, without Pyongyang abolishing first.
Both Kim and the U.S. President, Donald Trump, will hold a new meeting.
But many are critical that Pyongyang is serious about the demolition and that the country most likely sees its weapons as a guarantee of security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare the second Kim-Trump meeting.
Paris shows that massive headgear is the last fashion on its way to a shopping street near you
If you want to upgrade your hat collection or block the sun completely, then you don't need to look any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have revealed a number of large and special headwear in their SS19 collection. The headwear amazed the audience during the Paris fashion week.
Highly impractical hats can be seen on Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their shocking creations right onto the catwalk.
The most magnificent garment was a lavish, beige Valentino hat with a feather-like, wide brim that covered the models' heads.
There were also other oversized idols during the fashion show, including a jewel-decorated watermelon, a wizarding hat, and even a pineapple - but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a collection of bizarre masks - just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had lips that were sewn together and resembled Hannibal Lecter more than haute couture.
One of the creations resembled diving gear, complete with snorkel and mask, while another looked like a melted ice in biscuits.
If you like this enormously dramatic fashion, you can just enjoy it.
Fashion experts predict that the huge hats come for sale in a shopping street near you.
The oversized hats come right after "La Bomba", the straw hat with the 60-centimeter-wide brim that has been seen on celebrities from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the highly impractical hat, which was everywhere on social media, has now sent a new creation out onto the catwalk – a straw beach bag the same size as the bikini-dressed model that wore her.
The beach bag, with color of burnt orange and fringes topped with a white leather handle, was the most eye-catching part of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection during the Paris fashion week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage commented to FEMAIL: "I expect to see large hats and beach bags in the fashion stores next summer - the designer has made such a big impression that I doubt it is possible to ignore the demand for oversized worship."
John Edward: Global citizens need language skills
Private schools in Scotland are known to be at a high academic level, and this continues in 2018 with excellent exam results, which are only enhanced by individual and joint success in sports, arts, music and other community initiatives.
With over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), work to offer the best services to the students and their parents.
Self-employed schools aim to prepare their students for advanced and higher education, career paths and the role of global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we see that modern languages are popular electives in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, the message goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, the message goes to his heart."
This is an important reminder that we can't just lean on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
By looking at the exam results from this year, we can see that languages are at the top of the league tables with the highest standing grades for independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who took foreign languages received A.
The data, collected from SCIS's 74 member schools, shows that 72 percent of students received A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who took German, 69 percent of those who took French, and 63 percent of those who took Spanish also received A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital qualities, which children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Languages such as electives are seen as equivalent to the STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering studies, and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Employment and Properties Selection in 2014 showed that 17 percent of employers struggled to fill positions due to a lack of language skills in applicants.
Therefore, language in school is more and more important in order to prepare the youth for work.
With multiple job opportunities for linguists, these properties are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what kind of career a youth chooses, if they have learned a second language, they have a decent advantage in the future with such a skill.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a multilingual person advantages in a competitive world.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in 2013, 75 percent could not speak any language other than English well enough to keep a conversation going, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15 percent.
This is why it is so important to invest in language education for our children.
Knowing more languages, especially the languages used in developing countries, can give children a better chance of finding good jobs in the future.
In Scotland, each school is different in terms of the language they teach.
Many schools focus on the classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are classified as important in the UK as we look forward to 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, there will always be an abundance of languages to choose from in independent schools, and teachers who are specialists in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated and want to create a learning environment that will prepare children and provide the skills they need to close, no matter what the future brings.
One cannot deny that in this global, business-oriented environment, languages are vital for the country's future, so this must be mirrored in the education sector.
Modern languages should be called "international communication properties."
Autonomous schools will continue to offer this choice, thus offering diversity and high competence for Scotland's young people.
I'm fine with the fair.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council for Independent Schools
LeBron will make his debut at the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait time is soon over for fans looking forward to seeing LeBron James debut at the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the pre-season game on Sunday, against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, how long he will play has not yet been determined.
"It's going to be more than a minute and less than 49," announced Walton on the Lakers official website.
Lakers reporter, Mike Trudell, tweeted that James will most likely play for a limited time.
After training this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' pre-season schedule.
"I don't need pre-season games at this stage of my career to get ready," he said.
Trumps West Virginia Rally Time, YouTube
President Donald Trump begins a whirlwind of campaigns tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of Trump's five planned stops for the coming week, including stops in friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote on hold to choose to fill the Supreme Court vacancy, Trump aims to build support for upcoming mid-term elections since Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when votes are to be given in November.
What time is Trump going to be in West Virginia tonight, and how can you see it online?
Trump's gathering in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 19:00 tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia collection online below, via live stream on YouTube.
Trump will likely address this week's hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who became excited about allegations of sexual abuse, with an expected affirmative vote from the Senate on hold for up to a week while the FBI investigates.
But the primary goal of this cavity of gatherings is to help Republicans face the November elections and gain some momentum (drive).
Thus, President Trump's campaign says these five next week gatherings are aimed at "encouraging volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majoritys they have in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so critical to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we enter the busy campaign season," a Trump campaign spokesman said who refused to be informed to Reuters.
Planned for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the evening's gathering may bring supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw coverage from Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is in demand in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come and try to give him a boost in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political researcher at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA show belly for match to keep hope alive on Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursomes could only be what this Ryder Cup one needed.
The swinging pendulum of momentum is a completely invented sports bypass, but one that players really believe in, and never more than on competitions like these.
So where would they say that moment is now?
"They had a six-point lead, and now there are four, so we're taking it as a little moment , I guess," Jordan Spieth said as he walked off for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, four points ahead with twelve more in play.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel they have some wind in their sails, and they have a lot to be encouraged by, not least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day, and each has three points from four.
Spieth has been lethal from tee to green and leads by example.
The guttural screams of the celebration became higher as his round continued, searching an important putt to take match four all-squao.re when he and Thomas had been two down by two.
His putt that won the game at 15, was met with a similar scream, the kind that tells you that he thinks the American team is not out of this.
"You've actually just got to dig deep and worry about your own fight," Spieh said.
That's all each of these players has left now.
18 holes to make a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the invincible story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's strange but cute couples are four out of four and can make no mistake.
"Moliwood" was the only pair not to shoot a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine (the last nine holes on an 18-hole course) on Friday morning.
That race, and the way their energy seems to flow both to and from this noisy, engaged audience, cementing that they are the players to be beaten on Sunday, and there would be no more popular players to seal a potential European victory when the sun sets over Le Golf National, than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
Talk about European honor becomes even too early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did brief work by Sergio Garcia, the morning fireball hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine, the Spaniard and Swede dug into a hole they never got close to climbing out of.
But on Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to watch close because of the interaction between opponents, the advice they give, and the advice they don't give and the way that a strategy can change at a moment's notice.
Europe has played better as a team so far and takes a significant lead into the last day, but this foursome session also showed that Team USA has the stomach of the game that someone, especially Stateside, had doubted.
Europe takes 10-6 lead in Ryder Cup final
Europe will have a healthy advantage into the last day of the Ryder Cup after coming out of Saturday's fourballs and foursome games with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two wins over a struggling Tiger Woods to take their fight so far at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side lay a bid to keep the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominating a failed American side tomorrow's fourballs, taking the series 3–1.
The United States offered more resistance in foursomes and won two games, but they could not bring in the deficit.
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points from the 12 singles games on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, called "Molliwood" after a startling weekend, are only the second pair to win four points from their opening in four games in Ryder Cup history.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs, they made out so great to beat an outspoken Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more coveted 5 and 4.
Woods, who struggled through two games on Saturday, showed sporadic brilliance, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in fireballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, quitting for this morning's fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes to a 2 and 1 defeat by Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – ranked one and three in the world.
Europe still did not get everything they wanted on a pleasant, windy day southwest of Paris.
Three-time big winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas put the reference to the Americans by two points on Saturday.
They won a brave 2 & 1 win over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 & 3 in foursomes when they had lost the two holes in the opening.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history, a team has returned from a four-point base and entered singles, although as holders, Furyk's side only needs to draw to keep the trophy.
However, having been the second best for two days, it looks like a Sunday counterattack will be outside them.
North Korea says there is no talk of rusting down unilaterally without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that if sanctions continue, distrust of the United States will increase and that the country would by no means give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Government's Annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant measures" to improve conditions over the past year, for example, they have stopped nuclear and missile tests, dismantled the nuclear test site and promise not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we're not getting anything equivalent back from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances, it is not possible that we unilaterally disarm first."
While Ri, a well-known North Korean, has voiced several complaints about Washington's opposition to a "phased" approach to the abolition of nuclear weapons, in which North Korea would be rewarded for taking gradual steps, his resignation proved significant in not rejecting unilateral nuclear degradation, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint resignation issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first summit ever angered between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work for "decreasing nuclear power in the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea has wanted a formal end to the 1950–53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted talks to ease tough international sanctions in North Korea.
"The United States insists on "decreasing nuclear power first" and increasing the pressure of sanctions to achieve its purpose by coercion, and they even contradicted the "declaration to end peace," Ri said.
"The belief that sanctions can crack us is a false hope among those who are not interested in us.
But the problem is that as the sanctions continue, our distrust will only increase."
Ri did not mention anything about the plans for a new summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. president highlighted at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader, Moon Jae-in, over the past five months and added: "If the party in this call for the decommissioning of nuclear weapons were South Korea, and not the United States, the decommissioning of the Korean peninsula would not have stopped as it has now done"
Yet the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was not possible to stop North Korean missiles against the U.S. mainland, after evil President Trump called Kim a rocket man on suicide mission.
Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said that much work still had to be done and that sanctions had to remain in place until North Korea deploys its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a timeframe for this, saying, "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, told the F.N.'s Security Council on Thursday that: "Sanctions to the Security Council must still be vigorously upheld and without fail until we get the complete, final, verified decommissioning of the nuclear weapons."
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to throttle funds for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and afterwards said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a new summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said progress had been made, but a few hours later North Korea condemns him for making "gangster-like claims."
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States took "similar measures."
He said Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" he was seeking were safeguards promised by Trump in Singapore, and steps towards normalizing his relationship with Washington.
Harvard students take courses in getting enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has helped all students get more sleep, in an effort to fight the growing macho culture of studying in caffeine drinks all night. That is, you use caffeine to stay awake all night to study.
One academic found that students at top universities often carelessly when it comes to the most basic thing - how to take care of yourself.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the course, which he believes is the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the impact sleep deprivation has on learning.
"At the end of it, a girl came up to me and said, 'Why am I being told this now, in adulthood?'
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleeping - which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, rolled out for the first time this year, explains to students what is important for how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and managing director of the university's health services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after students got seriously worse sleep during the week.
The hour-long course involves a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a picture of a dorm room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, coaches and books to be told about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation, as well as the importance of evening routines.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
'We know that it won't change the behavior of students right away.
But we believe they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know, the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes, Prof. Czeisler added.
The pride culture of 24 hours still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students mean that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Ensuring you get enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student's secret weapon against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - even avoiding gaining weight, since sleep deprivation puts the brain in smelting mode and makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler develop the course, having been a student with him last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to push for a course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all doctoral students to complete a similar study program before starting at the prestigious institution.
Prof Czeisler recommended that students should consider setting an alarm for when to go to bed, and also for when to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" coming from electronic monitors and LED lighting, which can reset the inner clock overall, leading to problems falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga goals bring down Gerrard's men
The Rangers went on another defeat away when Dolly Menga's post sent Steven Gerrard's uncovered side to a 1–0 loss at Livingston.
The Ibrox side were looking to take their first win away since the 4–1 triumph at St Johnstone in February, but the team of Gary Holt only caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as a leader, giving eight points, a round under Ladbrokes leader of the Premier League , Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes before half time, and a Ranger lineup with a lack of inspiration never seemed to match.
As the Rangers now fall down to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and is just behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And there may be additional problems in stock for the Rangers after lineman Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound, after an item was apparently thrown from the away side.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team sweeping Ayr into the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt , on the other hand, went with Livy 11 who took a point with a dream shot last week, and he would have been enthusiastic about the way his veldrilla outfit took the chokehold on his opponents on each shift.
The Rangers may have had the ball the most , but Livingston did more with the ball they had.
They should have scored after just two minutes when Menga's first post sent Scott Pittman over to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder failed in his giant chance.
A long free kick from Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot far on the re-inning.
The Rangers took control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the final third round.
Alfredo Morellos definitely knew he should have a penalty of the 20 yard mark when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson waved away the wish of the Colombian.
The Rangers only managed two shots on goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly concerned by Lassana Coulibaly's header and a tame shot from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opening in the 34th minute may have been against the rules of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it just because of the "shot".
Again, Rangers fail to handle a deep dead ball from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher hit Scott Robinson's ball, who stayed cool to pick out Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard pretended during the break to exchange Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the change caused an immediate effect when the wing player created a hatch for Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rushed forward to block.
However, Livingstone continues to outsmart the guest team to play exactly the game they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett sending forward long shots on long shots.
Holt's team could have increased their lead at the end, but McGregor succeeded well in preventing Jacobs in it, until Lithgrow left a long post from the corner mark.
Ranger's reserve, Glenn Middleton, had a new claim for punishment when he backed up with Jacobs, but again Thomson overlooked it.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and WE RECAP ... the day when the one who was to become the physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and targeting radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the apparatus known as the Geiger counter.
As a scientific pillar ever since, the Geiger counter also became a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", with the seemingly unlikely lazy cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Mann: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "There is a Geiger counter, it can be used to find radioactive minerals, for example uranium.
When you put these earphones on, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms caused by the radioactivity of the minerals."
Evans: "Yes, now it bubbles!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" red cells.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" red cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize red cells, as part of the treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, and changing them in the laboratory
They can then see a protein that is common in many cancers, and then re-inject
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccines, who teaches the immune system to recognize red cells, experienced the ovarian cancer disappearance for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, modifying them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common in many cancers, called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "drives the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to extracting immune cells from patients and "teaching" them how to target cancer cells has worked in treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West commissioned a Pro-Trump diatribe, wearing a MAGA hat, after visiting the TV show Saturday Night Live. .
It didn't go so well.
Kanye West was piped out in the studio during Saturday Night Live after an incredible feat in which he praised U.S. President, Donald Trump, and said he would run for election in 2020.
After taking his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town, in which he wore a Make America Great-caps, he gave the Democrats a tirade and reiterated his support to Trump.
"So many times I talk to a white person, and they say, 'How could you like Trump, he's racist?'"
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago, he said.
The SNL started the show with a number alongside comedian Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in the Senate court committee on the allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcast, the footage of West's tirade was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock tried to mock West with the post.
Vest had also complained to the public that he was having a hard time backstage because of his headwear.
"They bullied me behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go out there wearing that hat."
They bullied me!
And then they say I'm in a submerged place," he said, according to Washington Examinor.
West continued, "Do you want to see the sunken space?" saying that he would "put on the superman cap, because this means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love."
His comments led to pipe-out at least twice from the audience, and SNL cast members seemed embarrassedly affected, Variety reported, with a person there telling the publication: "The whole studio was dead silent."
West was brought in as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, as her former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West confused many with a performance of the song I Love it, dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received the support of the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner who tweeted: "To one of the most courageous spirits: THANK YOU FOR STANDING UP TO THE PUBLISH."
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West "just simply was just who he is and it's absolutely amazing."
"But I did NOT choose to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his 'art') who I believe embraces and vomits out ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free.
We are, too," she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said that he was now "formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
Fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg has been named Snoop Lion and of course the last music legend Prince, changing the name to a symbol and then the artist formerly known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington goes out against toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-swinging role as Jon Snow in HBO's elective medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, has gone out against the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such roles on the screen often cause young boys to feel that they must be tough to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes something has gone wrong and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he knows "quite strongly" to address the problem.
"Personally, I'm convinced that something has gone wrong with the masculinity." he said.
"What have we learned men as they grow up, as far as the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that TV is partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to very male characters.
He continues, 'What is innate and what is being taught?
What is being learned on television and in the streets, what makes young boys feel they have to be this particular side of being a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions of our time - how do we change it?
For it is clear that something has gone wrong for young men.'
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not make Game of Thrones precursor or sequel when the show ends this summer, saying he is "finished with battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will play in a remake of Sam Shepard's True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he is looking at the meeting with his wife Rose to be the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this show, so that way it gave me my future family and my life on," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the designated Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health officials say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted through sex, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the amount of people who contracted HIV in this way was reduced to almost zero, Chinese health professionals said at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, from year to year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT/HBTQ persons is claimed to be widespread.
Because of the conservative values of the country, studies have shown that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the diseases come from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that adding lack of information from the GOP Senator, it explodes in 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'.
United States Rep. Maxine Waers denounced on Saturday allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information about three Republican U.S. Senators on the Wikipedia pages of lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the allegations were pedaled by "extreme-right" polls and websites.
"Lies, lies, and more contemptible lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers of Americans Sens. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on Thursday, was sent by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on the allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court elect Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came sometime after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was linked to Waters' office and released the information to a member of Waters' staff, Hill reported.
"This unfounded claim is entirely false and an absolute lie," Waters continues.
"One of my employees - whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these unreasonable and false claims - was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded claim is entirely false and an absolute lie."
Water's speech quickly received online criticism, including from former White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests she doesn't have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they did not do, they must not be angry.
They must not be tough.
They must not question the motives of the shoulder.
They must be calm and peaceful."
Fleischer turned out to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of Democrats by Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being apparently too angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate trying to take over Water's place in the mid-term election, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if that's true," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had notified "the right governments and the law enforcement entities of these false claims.
"We will make sure the perpetrators are exposed," she continues, "and that they will be held legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to each and every one of my co-workers."
Johnny English strikes again - spy fool by weak Rowan Atkinson
It is traditional to look for Brexit peculiarities in any new movie with a British angle, and it aches applicable to this revival of Johnny England's action-comedy spoof franchise - which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and which was revived in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will self-ironic satire recounting how open-minded we are become the new export opportunity in the country?
In any case, the big-eyed, incompetent Johnny English with the rubber athletic has for the second time been renewed his license to fuck things up - his name signals more than anything else that he is a broad comedian for cinematographers in non-English-language countries.
Of course, he is the silly, secret agent who despite his bizarre desires to spread some glamour has received a little bit of Clouseau, a dash of Mr Bean and a portion of that guy contributing a simple tune to the Fire Carts, themed during the 2012 London Olympic Opening Ceremony.
He is also originally based on the traveling and international mysterious man Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, leaving chaos behind.
There are one or two nice moments in this last JE outing.
I loved Johnny English approaching a helicopter while wearing a medieval armor suit while the rotor blades hit his helmet.
Atkinson's gift of physical comedy is on the screen, but the humor feels quite weak and oddly redundant, especially since "serious" film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now safely offer comedy as an ingredient.
The humor feels like it is aimed at children rather than adults, and to me Johnny England's noisy accident is not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's replica claustrophobic nonsense in the person in Bean.
The permanent current assumption now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain's super-secret web network of spies, revealing the identities of all agents Britain has in the field, to the dismay of the agent at work - a unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last straw for a prime minister who is a pompous and war-torn figure, who already has a complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her very best with this quasi-Theresa-May character, but there is not so much in the script to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that once every active spy has been charged, she must bring in someone who is retired.
And that means the incompetent Johnny English himself, who works as a teacher at a somewhat elegant establishment , but gives unofficial lessons on how to work undercover: a couple of nice jokes here, since English offers a School of Rock-type academy for spying.
English is sent back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former understanding assistant Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, moved over to a submarine driver's job, an over-enthusiastic role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
So Batman and Robin's ability to make things go terribly crazy in Her Majesty's Secret Services is back fully in the face of Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls dangerously under the charismatic technology enchantment of the billionaire, who claims that he can solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey of farce-like game: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a fine French restaurant; they create chaos and smuggle themselves aboard the Volta yacht; and English purely triggers anarchy as he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
All stops are certainly pulled out to the last sequence, but as gracious and undisciplined as it is, there is quite a lot of children's TV all over it.
Quite moderate things.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but think: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talents?
Labour Labour denies that they continue to work out a plan for the English to work a four-day week but be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour party is now considering a radical plan that wants the British to work a four-day week - but get paid for five.
The party, according to the report, wants corporate executives to send further savings made through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers, by giving them an extra day off.
Then employees would be able to enjoy a three-day weekend - but still receive the same salary.
Sources said the idea would "fit" with the party's economic agenda and plans to increase benefits for employees.
The change to a four-day week has been approved by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from the changed economy.
An older source from Labour told The Sunday Times: A policy message is expected to be announced before the turn of the year.
'It doesn't happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is a desire that fits into the approach the party has to balance the economy for the benefit of the worker, as well as overall to the party's industrial strategy.'
The Labour Party would not be the first to approve such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week in its 2017 campaign.
However, the ambition is not currently approved by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour party spokesman said, 'A four-day workweek is not party politics and it is not considered by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to reinforce his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said that he was firmly determined to take back power from "faceless executives" and "profits" in wealthy businesses.
The plans of the shadow chancellor also mean that current shareholders in the water companies cannot get back their full efforts as a Labor government could make "deductions" due to perceived misconduct.
He has also confirmed plans to put employees on board of directors and created Inclusive Ownership Funds (including ownership funds) to provide 10 percent of the equity in private sector enterprises to employees, which would receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500, approximately $5,000.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, tells in the "60 Minutes" TV program whether the FBI's inquiry into Kavanaugh could make them change their minds
The FBI investigation into complaints against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and it raises the question of to what extent the finding of the agency could influence some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley in "60 Minutes" asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, if the FBI could uncover anything that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said on my way into the hearing, I said, I've spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, that claim came out and said, 'Have you done it?'
He was determined, determined, unambiguous.”
Graham's voice, however, seems to be seen in stone.
"I've made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh, and it would take a dynamite accusation to change me," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she names couldn't confirm it.
That's 36 years.
I don't see anything new changing."
What is Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York hosts the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an enormously impressive array of stars performing and an equally impressive mission; ending poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flock to Central Park's large lawn, to not only enjoy watching Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes perform, but also to increase awareness of the true goal of the event to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concert observers had to complete a number of tasks, or "actions" as volunteer work; sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or other meaningful ways to help increase awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how much success has Global Citizen been with 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a real way to persuade people to demand a call to action, or just another case of so-called "clicktivism" - people feel they are making a real difference by signing an online appeal or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, participating in and pushing for a variety of goals.
It states that these actions have helped world leaders announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group showed 390 commitments and announcements as a result of their actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or raised.
The group estimates that the secured funds so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the most important commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers committed to "helping children reach their full potential"; promising to give Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and global citizens, just like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a footnote in history," — told the Ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, the audience during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after taking more than 5,000 actions to demand that the UK improve on nutrition for mothers and children, the British government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional treatment.
In answer to one of the common questions on their website, they ask, "What makes you think that we can end extreme poverty?"
Global citizen replied, "It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But as the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements lead us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among some of the actors performing at this year's New York event, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use Fleet as "blockade" to prevent Russian energy exports - Interior Secretary
Washington can "if necessary" resort to its fleet to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, international secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria—especially where they operate at the invitation of the legitimate government—is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reason they are in the Middle East, is that they want to convey energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe," he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to tackle it.
"The United States has this ability, with our Fleet, to ensure that the sea routes are open and, if necessary, blocked to ensure that their energy does not go on the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the attendees at the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, an ideal group that presents itself as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually the same.
"The economic solution on Iran and Russia is more or less to exploit and replace fuel," he said, referring to Russia as a "one-trick pony" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements come as the Trump administration has been on a mission to increase exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the far cheaper option for European consumers.
In connection with this, officials in the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which according to Trump made Berlin Moscow's "prisoner".
Moscow has repeatedly underlined that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is set to double its existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's eager opposition to the project is driven solely by economic reasons, and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the position that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. attitude has drawn backlash from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has urged the United States to stay away from the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state disrupts our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, chairman of the German Federation of Industry (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "run hard" to run for president in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would take a "basic look" at running for president after the midway election.
During a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running as a candidate.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our bad government, and that includes a woman at the top," she said according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will consider thoroughly running for president."
Warren addressed President Donald Trump at the City Hall meeting, saying he is “leading this country in the wrong direction.”
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren has been harsh in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court elect Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI inquiry before the vote."
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren's own voters do not think she should run as a candidate in 2020.
51 percent of "probable" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run as a candidate, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/ Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent supported such a candidacy.
The survey showed more support for a round by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed with regard to a potential 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin argues for Track Palin's PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) at Donald Trump gathering
Track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq after being enlisted in September.
He was arrested and charged with a violence incident at home on Monday night
"What my own son is going through, what he is going through when he returns, allows me to relate to other families that are characterized by PTSD and some of the wounds that our soldiers return with," she told the audience at a gathering for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said about his son and other war veterans that "they're coming back a little changed, they're coming back hardened, they're coming back wondering if the respect for what they and fellow soldiers and pilots and all other military, have done for the country, exists".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was charged with physical violence at home against a woman, for disrupting a report of violence at home and the storage of a weapon while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support challenge for new asylum policy
Eighteen states and districts in Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy denying asylum to victims fleeing gang violence or violence at home.
Representatives from the 18 states and district filed a friend-of-court briefly Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged the policy, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff's full name in Grace v. Sessions fits that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and the elective gang member sons" abused her, but U.S. officials denied her application for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The lawyers of the States supporting Grace, describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large amount of applicants for American asylum, as nations face pervasive problems with gangs and violence at home.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision from the immigration law, which allowed illegal immigrants fleeing violence at home, to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores many decades of state, federal, and international law."
"Federal law requires that all asylum cases be judged for the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such an obstacle is contrary to this principle," said friend of the court briefly.
Lawyers further claimed in the summary that the policies that deny immigrants access are damaging the United States economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "offer necessary work".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims who fled abuse and gang violence in June.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their home country due to persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion," said Sessions on June 11 in his announcement of the policy.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems—even all the serious problems—that people face every day across the world.
Desperate rescue work in Palu while death toll doubles in race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation became increasingly serious.
"It feels very excited," said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, who comforted her febrile baby zone at an evacuation center in the devastated city, Palu.
"Every minute ambulances arrive with bodies.
Clean water is hard to find."
Residents are observed returning to their destroyed homes, searching through water damaged properties and trying to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals destroyed by the earthquake, which had a magnitude of 7.5, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had broken his back and shoulder, were resting outside Palu's Military Hospital, where patients were being treated outdoors due to still strong aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes while he told him that he felt the powerful earthquake shake the hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter on the fifth floor.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed into the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help, but then it became quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
US ambassador blames China for "bullying" with "propaganda ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a 4-page advertisement in a U.S. daily newspaper and highlighted the mutual benefits of trade with the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to China Daily's paid subsidy in the Des Moines Register - the state of Iowa's largest salsa newspaper - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. Congressional elections on November 6, a charge China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in U.S. elections marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in an escalating campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to support trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a growing trade war that has seen them in turn increase taxes on each other's imports.
China's retaliation tariffs early in the trade war were designed to meet exporters in states such as Iowa that supported Trump's Republican party, Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had injured U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
"China," Branstad wrote in a section of Sunday's Des Moines Register, "now doubles the bullying by running propaganda ads in our own free press."
"In its dissemination of propaganda, the Chinese government uses America's beloved tradition of freedom of speech and a free press by posting a paid ad in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at the newsstand down the street here in Beijing, you will find limited deviant voices and will not see any true reflection of the various opinions that the Chinese people may have on China's problematic economic path, given that the media is under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party "he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers deviated from the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say what a newspaper.
Republicans forewarn female voters ahead of midterm with Kavanaugh Debacle, Analysts warn.
As many top Republicans are stand-by and defend Supreme Court elect Brett Kavanaugh in the face of multiple charges of sexual assault, the analyst has warned that they will likely see a setback, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
Emotions around this have been extremely high, and most Republicans are on have registered that they already wanted to move on with a voice.
These things cannot be undone, says Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, to The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last moment imprint for an FBI investigation will be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday - they are not going to forget it tomorrow, and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday. Washington, DC newspaper.
On Friday morning Protestants sang "November is coming!" while demonstrating in the hall of the Senate when Republicans, who run the Court Committee, chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to be outside the chart," Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, said to the news page.
"People are saying that it's already been loud, it's true.
But it can get louder, especially among female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29-year-olds, who, while they don't like the president, often don't vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing the allegations of sexual assault directed against named Supreme Court nominees, analysts suggested that a setback could follow if Republicans pushed forward with the confirmation.
"This has become a confused mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, in early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the vote of the committee or final vote or whether Kavanaugh is seen on the bench, it's also about how Republicans have handled this and how they have treated her," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that contributes to electing Democrats, pointed out for the news channel.
But Americans seem to be a bit split about who they should believe in in the wake of Ford's and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a little more siding with the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
Additionally, 38 percent said they believed that Kavanaugh probably or definitely lay during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Under pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, and also at least another complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified to the Senate Judicial Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh completely abused her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her the genitals while attending a party during the time they were studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new Internet to meet Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest project of technology legend, Inrupt, is a company building Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where data is stored and which people have access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the meaning of Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data warehouse" or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, memo lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive; Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in one browser and all at the same time.
What is unique about the personal online store is that it is entirely up to the user who can access all kinds of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data."
The idea of Inrupt, according to the Managing Director of the company John Bruce, is that the company should bring resources, process, and appropriate capabilities to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM and some hired developers with contracts to work on the project, as well as a community of volunteer encoders.
From this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about not introducing a complete change in which all their business models are completely turned on their heads overnight.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a post on the medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new online collection built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a voice of great influence in the debate on net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and CEO of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this next era online," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Won: WW1 Victoria Cross divine celebration
The only English church divinity to win a Victoria Cross during World War I as a fighter has been celebrated in its hometown 100 years afterwards.
Lt. Col. Pastor Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918, in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won the highest British military honour.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic", that the stone would be unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning achievement.
According to the London Gazette, Lt Col Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September 1918 "through a very thick shutter and under heavy fire from fields and machine guns."
He later ran up to the front line, and with the "greatest gallantry" the line carried forward before he alone rushed forward with a field rifle and knocked out three of the group.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know I could never live up to, but something I'm humble of."
He and his brother Dr James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he felt very honored to play a role in the parade, adding that "the value of a real hero is shown by the support given by many people."
The MMA fans were up all night watching Bellator 206, they got Peppa Pigs instead
Imagine this, you've been up all night to see a packed Bellator 206 but then you won't see the main event.
The San Jose account contained 13 games, including six on the main card and was shown live throughout the night in the United Kingdom on channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepare to meet, viewers in Britain were once again stunned when coverage changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were little impressed after they had stayed awake until the early hours especially for the game.
A fan on Twitter described switching to the children's comic book as "a kind of sick joke."
"It's public regulation that at 6 a.m. if the contents weren't appropriate that way, then they had to switch to the children's program," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the transfer.
"The Peppa Pig, "Yes."
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they will be working on planning to include British viewers in the future.
"I think that when I think about replay, I think we can probably figure it out," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday, and we won't figure this out until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when it went over, there were a lot of lyrics going back and forth, and not all were friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't; it was a public problem.
I can promise you, next time it's not going to happen.
We keep it for five games instead of six – as we usually do – and we tried to hand it over to the fans, and we just went over.
This is an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" due to sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says that in his upbringing he felt worse than everyone because of his sexuality - but that gave him the motivation to be a success.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until he went to high school that "not everyone is like me."
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out about gays' rights to give others "hope".
He also said becoming a parent made him care less about winning the Olympics.
The regular reporter in the cross-country shows, Kirsty Young, has taken months off due to illness.
What could look like a lost one in Laverne's first program, Daly said he felt "less than" everyone else who grew up because "it wasn't socially acceptable to equal boys and girls."
He said, "To this day, the feeling of feeling less than and feeling differently has been the real things that have given me the power and strength to succeed."
He would prove that he was "something," he said, so he didn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze Olympic medalist has become a professional LGBT campaigner and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without branches and wanted to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "surprised me."
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" - he went to his first Olympics aged 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar heights and downs.
The couple became parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that all "his" perspective had changed.
"If you'd asked me last year, it's all about I need to win a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his dad did not accept that he would die and one of the last things he had asked for was if they had tickets to London 2012 – when he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him you're not going to be on the front row," he said.
"I held my hand when he stopped breathing, and it wasn't until he had actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally recognized that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to dive in in front of a home audience at an Olympic game, where fans had no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first song choice – Proud of Heather Small – which had vibrated with him in the build-up to the Olympics and still gave him goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs are on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Out of shape, Mickelson sits on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he must reverse his form to avoid it being an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played in the two-year event for a record 12th time, was put on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk before Saturday's golf game in fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as he has often been for the United States, the five-time winner splits his day between being a cheerleader and working on his game within reach of the hope of correcting what bothers him.
Never the most competent long shots. Not even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is best at hitting with the long shot on the narrow, French main court, where balls hit outside if the golfer is not accurate with the strokes.
And if the track itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson will meet in the ninth game Sunday, exact British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, four points down by starting the 12 singles matches, make it to a warm start, Mickelson's match may be quite decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, not that he could say much else.
"He completely understood the role he had today, gave me a pat on the back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has great confidence in himself.
He is a Hall of Famer, and he has added so much to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think he was playing two games.
I imagined more, but that's how it became, and that's how we thought we had to do.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record in most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It may mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never quite matched the heights of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk said his proximity added some intangible features to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's entertaining, he likes to keep fun with people and he's a nice guy to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players had fun getting a deal with him too, this week, which was fun to see.
He contributes much more than just playing."
Europe Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that great leadership may soon disappear
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, the European captain, knows by experience that a significant lead on his way into the last-day singles of the Ryder Cup can easily be turned into an unpleasant trip.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 game at Valderrama, where a side captain of Seve Ballesteros held a five-point advantage over the Americans, but only came across the finish line with the nose leading by the narrowest margins, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2–131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You continued to remind yourself that we had a big lease on Valderrama; we had a big lease on Brookline, where we lost, and on Valderrama, where we won, but only barely," said Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, after seeing Klasse 2018 win 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So the story will show me and everyone on the team that this is not over.
You're going to open in full tomorrow.
Go out there and do all the right things.
This is not over until you have your scores on the board.
We have a goal, and that's trying to win this trophy, and that's where the focus stays.
I've said all along, I'm focusing on the 12 players who are on our side, but we're so well aware of what's left on the other side - the biggest players in the world."
Delighted with how his players have performed on a tough golf course, Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn added: "I would never take the win on advance.
Tomorrow is another day.
Tomorrow there are the individual achievements coming out, and that's another thing to do.
It’s great to be out there with a partner when things are going well, but when you’re out there individually, you’re being tested to the fullest of your capacity as a golfer.
It's the message you need to convey to players; get the best of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner, and he must go and get the best of himself too."
In contrast to Bear, opposite number Jim Furyk will be on the lookout for his players to perform better individually than they did as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself has been at both ends of the turnaround on the big last days, having been part of the winning team in Brookline before ending as a loser when Europe pulled off the "Miracle of Medinah."
"I remember every fucking word of it," he said in response to being asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had gathered his players on their way into the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to get started with the fast start that you saw at Brookline, which you saw at Medinah.
When that momentum is allowed to go one way, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We set up our line-up accordingly and get the boys going in a way that feels good, you know, we're trying to do something magical tomorrow" .
Thomas has been assigned the task of trying to lead the game and faces Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the top half of the scheme.
"I went with this group of boys in this order because I think it covers all the way through," said Bjorn about his choices of singles.
Germany's new warship postponed once again
The newest frigate of the German Navy should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace aging Cold War ships, but it will not be there until at least next year due to improper systems and disgraceful costs, local media reported.
Launching of the Rhineland-Palatinate, the leader ship of the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed for the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper, citing a military spokesman.
The vessel should have joined the fleet in 2014, but the worrying problems after delivery bothered the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy back in 2007, come as a replacement for the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will contain a powerful cannon, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some hidden technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years away from home-level ports.
Yet continuous delays mean that the pioneering warships, which supposedly allow Germany to exercise power abroad, will already become outdated when they enter service, Die Zeit notes.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year, when the German fleet officially refused to accept the vessel and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the German fleet has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media quoted a number of important "software and hardware errors" that rendered the warship unusable if deployed on a combat task.
Software failures were particularly important as the ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be operated by a crew of around 120 sailors - only half the workforce on older Bremen frigates.
It also turned out that the ship is dramatically overweight, reducing performance and limiting the ability of the fleet to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton Rhineland-Palatinate is believed to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans in World War II.
Aside from the wrong hardware, the price of the entire project - including training of the crew - also becomes a problem.
It is said to have reached staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - up from initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion (EURO)
Problems associated with the latest frigates, become particularly important in light of the recent warnings that Germany's fleet power is decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee of the German Parliament, acknowledged that the fleet in fact "has almost an end of distribution-capable ships".
The officer said the problem has built on over time, because old ships were discontinued, but no replacement vessels were delivered.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates were able to join the fleet.
National Trust eavesdrop on secret life of bats
New research conducted on a property in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their hunt for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study of researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and soprano pipistrelles and also brown long-eared and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at important locations around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also perform mobile screenings using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of bat calls and what species do what.
A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed landscape-scale image of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, natural science advisor for the NTS, hopes the results will uncover which areas of habitat, natural homes, are most important to the bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as the acquisition of meadows and how it is best to maintain forested areas for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across Britain have declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects resting places and loss of habitat/residence.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, such as flying paper and some chemical treatments of building materials, and also attacks by pet cats.
Bats are not really blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to find faults and obstacles in their flight route.
NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, resting place inspections and sometimes save lives.
The organization has even created Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve on the Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Property manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal territory for them.
"Here at Threave we have a great area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, many veteran trees and all the good habitats.
But there is a lot about bats that is still unknown, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us understand more about what they need to thrive."
He underlines the importance of checking for bats before performing maintenance within property, as it is possible that indefinite destruction of a single settlement can kill up to 400 female bats and young, and perhaps eradicate an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them or destroy their resting places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to come in and help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don't know how their populations are moving."
Ronaldo dismisses rape allegations in what lawyers sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has labeled the rape charges against him as "fake news", saying that people "want to stand out" by using his name.
His lawyers are set to sue German news magazine Der Spiegel, who published the allegations.
Portugal and the Juventus forward have been accused of assaulting an American woman, called Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He is claimed to have paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a live instagram video, Ronaldo, 33, says to his 142 million followers just hours after the charges, that the charges are "fake news."
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news, says five times the Gold Ball winner into the camera.
"They want to market themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
They will be known for saying my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and all good, "the player added and smiled.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called "an inadmissible reporting of suspicions within the area of privacy", according to Reuters
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damage in an amount equal to the severity of the violation , which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident is said to have taken place in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the player's room, where he is alleged to have selected her anally, according to documents filed at Clark County District Court, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told him he was "99 percent" a "good guy" and failed by "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex but that there was consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had photographs taken of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed on a settlement because she felt "scared by retaliation" and was worried about "being publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to change her place of residence as she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he moved to Italian giant Juve in a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: UK 'would forever regret' losing car manufacturers
Britain "would regret it forever" if it lost its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, business secretary Greg Clark has said.
He added that it was "if" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the effect of border delays in the event a non-agreement Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, with 90% being exported to the rest of the EU.
"My perception is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production stops at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's Managing Director at Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers have raised fears of leaving the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns revolve around what car manufacturers say is the supply chain risks in the event of a non-agreement Brexit.
Toyota's production line is operated on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts coming every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars ordered.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29, disruptions at the border may occur which the industry says can lead to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's worth of fixtures at its Derbyshire factory, the company said, and thus production would be stopped.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's Checker's plan for future relations with the EU is "just calibrated to avoid border controls."
"We need to have a deal. We want to have the best deal that will allow, as I say, not only to enjoy the success today, but for us to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's daily program.
"The evidence from not only Toyota, but other manufacturers is that we certainly need to be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term they warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years, and is the Unite Union Association at the facility, said that his members are more concerned with: "After my experience, when these jobs go, they will never come back.
A spokesperson for the government said, "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House says
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with Deputy Leader Attorney Rod Rosenstein could be "pressed back a week" as the fight against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian electoral interference, links between Trump aides and Russia and potential obstacles to justice by the president.
The extent to which Trump will dismiss the general of the trial attorneys or not, thus putting Mueller's independence at risk, has fuelled Washington's gossip for months.
Earlier in the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing a lease to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president using the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, and it was reported that he was about to dismiss.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, then at the UN in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer" not to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid crashing with the Senate Commission hearing where both Kavanaugh and one of the women who have charged him with sexual harassment, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, delaying full vote from the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "There has been no set date. It may be this week, but I can imagine that it will be delayed another week because of everything else that is happening in the Supreme Court.
But we get to see, and I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters will probably disagree with it: Sanders has not held a press briefing for the White House since September 10.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of orientation was not due to a dissatisfaction with TV reporters' game for the gallery, although she said, "I don't disagree that they do."
She mentioned and that direct contact between Trump and the press is going to increase.
"The president is holding more press conferences than any president has done before," she said - rightly without providing evidence of the allegation. "We have looked at the numbers."
Sanders says updates will still happen, but "if the press gets the chance to ask the President of the United States directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We've been trying to do that sort of thing a lot, and you've seen us do it often over the last few weeks, and it's going to take over instead of a press briefing if you can talk directly to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences with visitors.
It is unusual for the president to hold press conferences alone.
In New York this week, the president perhaps demonstrated why, performing leading the reporters without shame, and almost bizarre.
Health Secretary writes about Brexit fears to EU workers at the NHS in Scotland
The health secretary has written to EU workers working at the NHS in Scotland to express gratitude and a wish that they continue after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter although less than six months remain before Britain withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to taking on the costs of applications that have the status of decided for EU residents working in delegated public services.
In the letter, Freeman wrote the following: "During the summer, negotiations regarding withdrawal between the UK and the EU have continued, and it is approaching the expected conclusion this fall.
Yet the British government has stepped up preparations in case there is no deal.
I understand that this must be a difficult time for all of you.
Therefore, I now want to repeat how much I appreciate the contributions of all employees, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from the EU, and beyond, bring with them valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve work in the health sector and are beneficial for patients and society.
Scotland is clearly your home, and we would like you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes acute surgery after head injury
Linebacker Christion Abercrombie, who plays at the Tennessee State Tigers, went through an emergency operation after wearing an injury to the head when the team lost 31–27 to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, the newspaper The Tennesseean reports.
Tennessee State head coach, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury occurred just before the break.
"He came to the sideline and collapsed, in a way," Reed said.
Coaches and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before placing him on a stretcher and taking him back for further evaluation.
An official spokesman from Tennessee State, told the WSMV that Abercrombie had finished operating at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
There are no details on the extent of the damage yet, Harris said, adding that Tennessee State is still trying to figure out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie attends his second year of university, and is in his first season after being transferred from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles before being injured in Saturday's game, and is now up for 18 overall this season.
Foreign buyers must pay a higher document fee when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers must pay a higher documentary fee when buying property in the UK. The additional income should be used to help the homeless, according to the new plans of the Conservatives
The decision will neutralize Corbyn's success in attracting young voters
The increase in the document fee will be added for those who do not pay tax in the UK
The Treasury expects an increase of up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year - to help the homeless
Theresa May will today announce that foreign buyers will have to pay a higher document fee when buying property in the UK. The additional income will be used to help the homeless.
This decision will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success Jeremy Corbyn has had in attracting young voters who earn a lot, promising to offer reasonable housing.
The increase in document fees will be added for individuals and firms not paying taxes in the United Kingdom, and the extra money will strengthen the government's desire to reduce the number of strays.
The fee, which comes in addition to the current documentary fee, includes the higher levels introduced two years ago on second residence and rental residences, can be as much as three percent.
The Treasury expects the decision to receive up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
Approximately 13 per cent of new buildings in London are purchased by residents outside the UK, making it harder for first-time buyers to enter the housing market.
Many prosperous areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost towns" due to the large number of foreign buyers who most of the time reside in other countries.
This new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson would cut the documentary fee to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction firms of keeping prices up by obtaining properties but not using them, and asked Theresa May to give up quotas on reasonable sites to fix Britain's "residential shame".
Corbyn has announced a series of conspicuous proposals for housing reform, including controlled rent and the termination of expulsions for no reason.
He will and will give the council greater power to build new settlements.
May said, "Last year I said that I would dedicate my position to bringing back the British dream - that life should be better for each new generation.
That means fixing the ruined housing market.
The United Kingdom will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
Yet it may not be right that it should be as easy for individuals who do not live in the UK, or foreign firms, to buy housing as it is for hard-working, British residents.
For many people, the dream of own dwelling has come too far away, and the humiliation of being wanderers is real.
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland'
The head of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says that his "ultimate ambition" is to become manager of Scotland at some point.
The Scotsmen (42) are excited about the challenge of reviving the club from the north-east. Currently, they are in third place in League One, only three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer, having led St Mirren back to the Scottish major leagues last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B national team game, and that was it," Ross told Scotland's BBC Sportsound.
"But I grew up seeing Scotland at Hamden along with my father, and there's always been something that's pulled me back.
That possibility can only come if I'm successful as a club manager."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says he has not been anxious to come after so many established names in such a large club, since he has previously declined approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At the moment, success for me will be measured in whether I 'can get this club back in the Premier League.'
Given the structure and facilities of this club, there is no doubt that they belong in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get them there, but I can probably only see myself as successful if I manage to get the club back there".
Ross is only three years into his career as a manager, after a period as an assistant boss at Dumbarton and a 15-month period in the coaching apparatus of Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third level, transforming St Mirren, who was about to relegate, into the title winner of the championship series the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now, than he ever did while playing in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was another road separation," he says about leading Alloa.
"I genuinely believed that being a manager suited me much better than being a player.
It sounds bizarre, because I did well, lighted well and liked it relatively well.
But playing can be tough.
There are a lot of things you are limited to getting through every week.
I still notice it when it comes to the stress and pressure of the job, but it feels right to be a manager.
I've always wanted to be a manager, and now I am. It's the most comfortable thing I've felt in my own body in my entire adult life."
Sunday, September 30, you can hear the entire interview on Sportsound, Radio Scotland, between 12 and 13.
Examination shows that the perfect time for a pint is at 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday
The summer heat wave has led to an increase in the earnings of struggling pubs in the UK, but and increased pressure on restaurant chains.
In July, sales increased by 2.7 per cent in child nutrition - but for the restaurant industry it declined by 4.8 per cent, the statistics show.
Business advisor Peter Martin, who is responsible for the statistics, said: "The current sun, and the fact that England was in the World Cup longer than planned, means that July followed the pattern for June where pubs went up 2.8 percent, only that restaurants became even harder framed.
The decline of 1.8 per cent in the restaurant industry only got worse in July.
Pubs and bars selling drinks made it significantly better and went up more than restaurants went down.
Pubs selling food also received and noticed the sunset, although not as dramatic as for restaurant owners.
It may seem as if people just want to go out for a drink.
Among pubs and bars, the drinking room had increased by 6.6 percent this month, while food had declined by three percent.
Paul Newman, analyst for travel and leisure at RSM, said, "These results are the continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather, and the impact of a huge social or sports event, will still be the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the nightlife industry.
It is not surprising that the restaurant industry will still be struggling; a 4.8 per cent annual drop in sales would be painful to get on top of an ongoing cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not come at a worse time for operators engaged in food. Time will show if the more moderate temperatures that have been in August can provide a long-awaited respite."
The total sales increase across pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the depreciation in the release of brands.

One in five children have secret social media profiles that they hide from their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - have secret social media profiles that they hide from parents and teachers, shows a survey
Survey of 20,000 students on secondary reveals an increase in "fake Insta" profiles
This news has increased fears that sexual content is being posted
Twenty percent of students say they have a "head" profile they show their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - make social media profiles that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students in high school revealed a sharp increase in "fake Insta" profiles - a reference to the Instagram photo-sharing platform.
The news has increased fears of sexual content being posted.
Twenty percent of students say they have a sterile "head" profile they refer to parents, while they and have private profiles.
A mother who stumbled upon the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who urged others to "choose me".
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) at different schools, found that 40 percent of those between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, and half of these admitted to having private users.
The head of the HMC, Mike Buchanan, said, "It's disturbing that so many teens are being tempted to create places online where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle becomes ‘the voice of the athletes’ in the Scottish athletics board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of Scottish Athletics as non-executive director at the board's annual general meeting.
Doyle is the most decorated track athlete in Scotland, and chairman Ian Beattie describes the event as a great opportunity for those leading the sport to take advantage of her extensive experience at an international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh has a lot of respect across Scotland, the United Kingdom and the world's athletic community, and we are confident that the athletics of Scotland can benefit from getting it into the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I'm eager to serve as a voice for athletes, and I hope I can be contributing and helping the sport in Scotland."
The American, who has gold from both the 200m and 400m in Atlanta in 1996 among his total of four Olympic golds and is now a regular guest at the BBC, was unable to go after a drip.
On Twitter, he wrote, "Today it's been a month since I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said it was only the time that could tell me if I was going to get well again, or to what extent.
It's been exhausting work, but I've been completely well again, learned to walk again, and today I'm doing flexibility boots!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Split opinions on the Internet about breast pump advertising comparing mothers to dairy cows
A breast pump company has split public opinion on the Internet with an advertisement comparing breastfeeding mothers to dairy cows.
To mark what has been described as "the world's first still-going, sedentary breast pump", technology company Elvie released a small-scale advertisement inspired by music videos to demonstrate the freedom the new pump gives mothers extracting milk.
Four real mothers dance in a tall-filled barn of cows, to a song that includes lyrics like, "Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see a tail" and "In case you didn't notice it, these aren't teats, they're my pups."
The chorus continues: "Pump it out, pump it out, I feed these kids, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies".
The advertisement, which is published on the company's Facebook page, has, however, created controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, and many say it highlights the "horror" of the dairy industry.
"Very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and feed to produce milk, only that the calves are stolen from them just days after birth," writes one.

Another commented: "Understandably traumatic for both mother and child
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?"
Another added: "What a reality-distant advertisement."
Others defended the advertisement, and a lady admitted that she thinks the song is "festive."
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
I would have one if I was still breastfeeding.
Pumping made me feel net like a cow.
This advertisement is a little crazy, but I took it for what it is.
This is a brilliant product," wrote one.
Another commented: "This is a fun advertisement aimed at mothers who pump (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like cows.
This is not an advertisement that boasts or judges the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women reveal that they have all danced with the discreet pump wrapped in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who pump, say they feel like cows.
The Elvie pump is completely silent, however, having no leads or tubes, and its discreet inside a nursing bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their cubs, and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balardin, partner and creative director of Mother, commented, "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product, that it deserves a daring and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between mothers mining milk and milk cows, we wanted to put the spotlight on breast pumping and challenges associated with it, and at the same time demonstrate the incredible sense of freedom the new pump will bring, in an entertaining and recognizable way.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has made headlines.
During fashion week in London, a mother of two appeared on the podium for designer Marta Jakubowski, while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children quietly moved to tent camp on the Texas border
The number of imprisoned immigrant children has peaked even though monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part due to the strict policies the Trump administration has imposed making it more difficult to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and they fear that standing up and accepting a child may threaten their own possibility of staying in the country.
The risk of it increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult family members will be required to submit fingerprints, and that this data will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement cited Congress and said the agency has arrested dozens of people who have applied to be sponsors of single minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had nothing on their records before.
"Nearly 80 percent of those who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors are in the country illegal, and a large proportion of these are criminal foreigners.
So we're going to continue pursuing these people," said Albence.
According to employees in the camp, new rules have now been introduced to handle the children. The rules require that some of them now have to go to court before a month has passed, compared to the previous 60 days.
Many will attend via video calls and not at personal attendance, to have their case tried before an immigration judge.
Those who are not qualified for freedom will be deported quickly.
The longer the children are in custody, the more likely they are to develop anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts, say the camp staff. Reports that have appeared in recent months say the same.
Proponents say that these concerns are greater at large facilities such as Tornillo. Due to the size of the facility, signs of children's wear and tear are more likely to be overlooked.
They added that moving children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally, or say the hatred of friends, can amplify the trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria urges US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw instantly
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called for Syrian refugees to return home, although the country is now at war in its eighth year.
Moualem, who and serves as deputy prime minister, said that emerging forces are staying illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of defeating terrorism, and "will be treated accordingly".
"They must withdraw instantly and without preconditions," he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that "the war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been removed from their homes.
He said Damascus will continue to "fight a holy struggle until all Syrian territories have been cleansed" for both terrorist groups and "the illegal presence of aliens."
The United States has approximately 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for the training and counseling of both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
When talking about the refugee problems, Moualem said it was safe for them to come back, and he blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading irrational fears" about the environment that caused the refugees to stay away.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate the return," he said.
"They make politics out of something that should be a purely humanitarian problem."
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no help for reconstruction in Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war is in place.
Diplomats from the UN say that a recently established agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib, which is the last major rebel fortress, has created a possibility to continue pushing forward with political talks.
The Russo-Turkish treaty averted a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province where three million people live.
However, Moualem underlined that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action will be directed against jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front, who are linked to Al-Qaeda, who "will be exterminated."
The UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to soon assemble the first meetings of a new committee consisting of government and opposition members to draft a post-war law for Syria, paving the way for the election.
Moualem set terms for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be limited "to review the articles of the current Constitution," and warned of disruption.
Why Trump is going to win another term
With that logic, Trump will win the 2020 re-election if, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope, the presidency does not end early due to scandals and impeachment.
It would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic ending of a presidency ever!"
At the time of writing, there is no sign that viewers have been bored.
Since 2014, CNN has doubled its best-time rating to 1.05 million, while MSNBC has almost tripled its to 1.6 million.
Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers in best time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has doctors at the top of the cable rating with as much as 3.5 million viewers in evenings of big news.
"This is a fire that people are lured by, because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer in the ABC drama "Designated Survivor," which deals with a cabinet secretary becoming president after an attack destroys the congressional building.
Nell Scovell, old comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
She recalls a trip in a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he would vote for Trump.
Why that? she asked.
"Because he makes me laugh," he replied according to Scovell.
There is entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the story that comes from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families are allowed to be together again and the health of the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond being an informed citizen when you find yourself at the sixth hour to see a panel of experts debate Bob Woodward's use of sources with "deep background" for the book "Fear," Paul Manafort's bomber jacket of ostriches for $15,000 ("a garment thickened by arrogance," said the Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy's uh beatomh
Personally, I'm never going to look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Parts of what he does that makes it feel like a reality show is that he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, a daily manager at Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars," about that show going on with Trump's employees and daily disputes (going into a game with the NFL, praise Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss a single episode, otherwise you won't hang out anymore.
When I met Fleiss this week, it was over 25 degrees and sun outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he was sitting inside watching MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
He was unable to turn away, not when Brett Kavanaugh faced the Senate Commission and the future of the Supreme Court hung in a thin thread.
"I remember when we did all these crazy shows in the past and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Money from the outside flows into the densest middle election match
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district sees an abundance of money, thanks to a restructuring of the districts of Congress that led to two sitting members fighting for the same seat.
The recently converted suburban district of Pittsburg promotes Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district through a special election in the spring of last year.
Lamb fights another sitting member, Republican Keith Rothfus, today representative in the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, who largely overlaps with the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January ruled that the old districts were illegally formed to benefit the Republicans.
The competition for the 17th district has launched a gunfight for funding the campaigns, between the major parties' money arsenal, the Democratic Congressional Selection and the Republican Congressional Selection.
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a snap in a closely followed special election in Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The seat had been heard by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by over 20 points.
Political experts have given Democrats a scarce advantage.
The U.S. considered punishing El Salvador because of support for China, but withdrew
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing without negative reactions from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama to partners evicted the Trump organization's leadership group.
The Secretary of State decided to bring back the U.S. chiefs of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the "last decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the ministry's spokeswoman, in a statement early this month.
However, punishment was considered only against El Salvador, which receives an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed penalties, containing cuts to financial support and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and their high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings developed, North American and Central American officials postponed a conference on security and economic prosperity to follow up on a similar gathering last year that was seen as a step forward to prevent immigrants coming to the United States.
However, in mid-September, top administrators announced that they wanted the conference to continue, and therefore put a stop to the assessment of the penalty for El Salvador.
It has now been said that Vice President Mike Pence will meet the conference, which has been scheduled for mid-October, as a signal of the relevance the administration puts on the gathering, the diplomats said.
And the three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new harsh messages or penalties from Washington.
A Bolton spokesman would not comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal considerations on the pretext of anonymity.
Their description was confirmed by an outside analyst who works closely with the administration and also spoke under the pretext of anonymity.
Study History
Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstacles to justice is awaited, as there is now significant evidence in the public protocols.
According to the reports, Mueller is said to have turned the focus of the investigation towards whether Trump's campaign conspired with Russia's ideas attacks on our election.
If Congress were to change directors, Trump would have to stand trial in this body, preparing to convince voters and possibly a jury of his peers.
It's a lot of "whatever", and I don't mean to suggest that Trump's fall is inevitable—nor for his counterpart in Europe.
There are choices to take for us all on both sides of the pond, which will affect how long the fight can be.
By 1938, German officers were ready for a coup d'état against Hitler, had only the West resisted him and helped the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and missed a chance to avoid the years of bloodshed this entailed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and democracy's inexorable march is accelerated or postponed.
Americans are facing several of these turning points now.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in deep water ever since this newspaper revealed that last year he proposed to intercept the president in secret, speculating that he is unfit for his role.
Rosenstein says The Times' description is inaccurate.
"How will we react if the recently requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair—or he is accepted by the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual assault, and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we in the mid-election vote for a Congress that holds Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will face a long winter.
But I don't think we're mistaken, because of what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied the country I have my embassy in.
She survived, immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me off guard to light Sabbath lights on the table begging the swastika.
When this is my legacy, how can I not be an optimist with regard to the future?

Rangers Graham Dorrans are optimistic before meeting with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will welcome Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that scoring over the Australians, after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will give them a good starting point to qualify from Group G of the European League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance this season before the 2–2 result against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use this result as a springboard for bigger things.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game with the belief that we could get something, and came out again with a point.
Maybe we could have taken it towards the end, but all in all, a tie is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, and then we came out in the second half and were the better team.
On Thursday, there will be another great European evening.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it will be a tough game. They got a good result in their previous game, but with the crowd behind us, I'm sure we can run on and get a positive result.
The last year has definitely been tough, with everything that has happened to my injuries and the changes in the club, but now everything feels good.
The stable is good and the boys thrive; the training is good.
Hopefully we can run on now, put the previous season behind us and be successful."
Women Lose Sleep Over This Fear About Retirement Savings
Despite the fact that participants in a survey had clear thoughts about how they would be taken care of, few talked to family members about it.
Approximately half of those who participated in a survey from the Nationwide insurance company said they were talking to their spouses about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their kids about it.
"People want a family member to take care of themselves, but they're not taking the necessary steps to have that conversation," says Vice President of Nationwide, Holly Snyder.
Here's where you start.
Talk to your spouse and your kids: You can't prepare your family to take care of you if you don't make your wishes known well in advance.
Work with a counselor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as these choices can be a big part of fixing the costs.
Bring in a financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you figure out how to pay for these expenses.
The financing options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance, a cash-valued life insurance to help pay the expenses, or that you insure yourself with your own wealth - as long as you have the money.
Create legal documents: Avoid legal battles before they start.
Get a health power of attorney in place, so that you appoint a person you trust to supervise your medical treatment and to ensure that professionals act in accordance with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
You can also consider a power of attorney for your finances.
You should choose a person you trust to make financial decisions and make sure your bills are paid if you don't have the option yourself.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine that your old parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write down all these details in a written plan, so you're ready.
"It's not just about the finances, but who are the doctors?" Martin asked.
"What kind of medication is that?
Who will take care of the dog?
Have the plan ready."
Man shot several times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man has been shot several times with an air rifle in what he was heading home after a walk in the city.
The victim in his 40s was in the area around Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach, and hand.
Police officers describe the shooting, which occurred around 2:30 a.m. local time, as a "random act".
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and police are calling for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a severe earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, say public officials. The number of dead is expected to increase.
Without the ability to communicate, relief workers have received no information from Donggala, an area north of Palu located closer to the epicenter of the quake which had a strength of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster was a fact.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of central Sulawesi Province, and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the quake and tsunami hit.
Donggala is an area that stretches over more than 300 km of coastline to the northwest of the island.
The area, which is an administrative region lower than a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the berry beam of the economy of central Sulawesi Province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel extraction is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the other side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to the disaster reduction office in Indonesia.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed and hundreds of houses destroyed by a tsunami in Donggala.
In 1996, the west side of Donggala was hit by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic Circle of Fire in the Pacific Ocean and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major quakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Aceh Province in northern Sumatra on 26 December, triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of these in Aceh.
2005: A series of major earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Several hundred died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, the most populated island in Indonesia, triggering a tsunami that crashed into the south coast killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people lost their lives.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit one of the Mentawai islands off Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of about 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: A small quake hit the Pidie Jaya area of Aceh causing destruction and panic when people were reminded of the 2004 quake and tsunami.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but more than 100 lost their lives due to buildings crashing.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok and killed more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed several thousand buildings and left several thousand tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested and charged with domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Governor of Alaska and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested, charged with assault.
According to a report released by Alaska State Police, Palin (29) was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering in reporting domestic violence and opposing arrest.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to call the police to report the offences.
Palin is being detained in Mat-Su jail, and is being held on bail $500, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court Saturday and pleaded "not guilty" when asked, the network cited.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanours, meaning he may be imprisoned for up to one year and receive $250,000 in fines.
He has also been charged with a Class B offense, which can be punished with a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
It is not the first time Palin has been charged with any crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is up in the veteran court in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic attacks, interfering in a reporting of domestic violence and holding a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend had claimed that he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son's violent behavior to PTSD that stems from when he served in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds lost their lives
At least 384 people have lost their lives after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The quake, with a magnitude of 7.5, triggered a tsunami and has destroyed several thousand homes.
Electricity and communications networks are down, and the numbers of casualties are expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck just outside the central part of Sulawesi, located northeast of the capital Jakarta.
Videos showing the dramatic moment where the quake hits are flourishing on social media.
Several hundred people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore.
Federal prosecutors rarely want death penalty for suspect in New York terror
Federal prosecutors in New York want the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspect in the terrorist attack that killed eight people -- a rare punishment that has not been carried out for a federal offense in the state since 1953.
Saipov (30) reportedly used a Home Depot rental car to carry out an attack on a bicycle path along the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan in October, where he drove down pedestrians and cyclists on the road.
In order to justify a death penalty, prosecutors must be able to prove that Saipov murdered the eight victims "intentionally" and that he "intentionally" inflicted them serious, bodily harm, according to a note filed in the southern district of New York.
Both of these incidents may be the basis for a possible death penalty, the court document states.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury handed over a list of 22 charges, including eight charges of murder aimed at extortion of money, commonly used by federal prosecutors in the context of organized crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for "substantial planning and deliberation," prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried out the attack as "disgusting, cruel and depraved".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the note states.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the last time the southern district of New York has sentenced the death penalty in a case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
On June 19, 1953, both were executed in the electric chair.
Saipov, originally from Uzbekistan, showed a lack of remorse in the days and months that followed, according to court documents.
He told the detectives that what he had done was best known, police said.
Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching videos from ISIS on the phone, the prosecution says.
He also requested to have the ISIS flag in the hospital room, police said.
He has not pleaded guilty on all charges.
David Patton, one of the federal, public defenders representing Saipov, says they are "clearly disappointed" with the decision of the prosecution.
"We believe that the decision to go after the death penalty, rather than accepting a statement of guilt for life in prison with no possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma of the incident for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defenders had previously asked the prosecutors not to go after the death penalty.
Tory MP thinks Nigel Farage should hire Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the People's Army" today, during a protest at the Tory National Assembly.
The former leader of the British Independence Party said the politicians had to "feel the pressure" of the Eurosceptics – as one of Theresa May's MPs suggested that he should lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservative, mean Member of Parliament Peter Bone told the protesters in Birmingham that Britain "would have been out" now, if Farage was Brexit minister.
With the challenge May faces to reconcile her deeply divided ranks has been underlined by a separate protest in the city, held by the Tories wishing to remain in the EU.
The Prime Minister struggles to keep plans with the Chequers compromise on track following attacks by Brexiteers, Remainers as well as the EU.
Allies insist that she will push for an agreement with Brussels, despite the backlog – forcing the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between her package and "chaos".
Bone told Leave Means Leave grouping in Solihull that he wanted to "reject Chequers"
He suggested that Farage should be given noble rank and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had ruled, we would be out now," he said.
The Wellingborough Member of Parliament, added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we must reject Chequers".
To mark his opposition to the EU, he said, "We did not fight world wars to be subordinate.
We will make our own laws in our own country".
Bone dismisses the claim that the people's opinion has changed since the 2016 election: "The idea that the British people have changed their opinion and want to stay is completely untrue".
Brexit advocate from Tory, Andrea Jenkyns, also participated in the march. She told reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people!"
"Chequers are not popular in the population, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is not popular in our party or our activists who frequent the streets and get us elected in the first place.
Please, drop Chequers and listen to me.”
In a message addressed to May, she adds: "Prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises".
Farage said that police officers must "feel the heat" if they come to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us - the people - and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them that 'we're not going to let them get away with it'."
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: "I want you to make the political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
"We are mobilizing the people's army in this country that gave us say in Brexit and should not rest until we have become an independent, self-governed, proud Britain.
At the same time, the Remainers marched through the streets of Birmingham before holding a two-hour meeting in downtown.
A handful of activists waved "Tories Against Brexit" banners after launching the group this weekend.
Labour colleague Lord Adonis made fun of the Conservatives for security problems they had with a party app during the opening of the conference.
"This is the people telling us that they can have all computer systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus plus, for a frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a total farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to take a "careful look" at running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will take "a close look at running for the presidential election" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democrat from the Massachusett spoke about his future during a town meeting in the west of the Massachusett Saturday.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was but as a board member in Trump's 2016 Massacre House campaign.
She has been the center of much speculation that she might want to try her hand at Trump in 2020.
The incident in Holyoke on Saturday, was her 36th meeting with voters in a town hall since Trump took office.
One participant asked if she planned to run for president.
Warren replied that it is time "that women go to Washington to fix our destroyed government, and that includes a woman at the top."
Arrest made in the shooting of Louisiana State University player Sims
Baton Rouge police announced Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in the case where Louisiana State University (LSU) basketball player, Wayde Sims, was shot and killed Friday.
At 11.00 local time, police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson (20), in a press conference for ET.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying a man seen on the video clip.
Sims (20) was shot and killed early Friday in the southern area of the university.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound in the head and eventually died as a result of it," Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told media Saturday, writing 247sports.
Wayde went to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
In interrogation, Simpson has admitted that he was on the scene, with weapons, and admitted that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without drama and placed in custody at the Department of Police in eastern Baton Rouge.
A third-year student of nearly two feet, raised in Baton Rouge, Sims played 32 games, ten of them from the start of last season, where he averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 returns in each game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after team orders give victory over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team orders would play a major role in the race.
Bottas got a good start on the race, allowing Hamilton to take care of himself in defending his position for the first two rounds and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was first into the depot and allowed Hamilton to enter traffic at the back of the course, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes ran into the depot a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton ended up in front after some action side-by-side which caused the Ferrari driver to reluctantly leave the inside free in danger of not being able to defend himself at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started, on his 21st birthday, in the rear row and was in seventh place at the end of the first round.
After that, he led much of the race as he went for a quick finish with the goal of running past Kimi Raikkonen who was in fourth place.
He entered the depot in the 44th round, but failed to increase speed in the last eight rounds while Raikkonen won fourth.
It's a difficult day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend, and was a real gentleman who let me by.
The team has done an exceptional job having both first and second," said Hamilton.
It was really bad body language
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Dianne Feinstein at an election meeting on Saturday due to her insistence that she does not close the letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which she accuses Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
During a speech at a West Virginia election meeting, the president did not mention the testimony Ford had given to the Senate Commission directly, but rather commented that what is going on in the Senate showed that people were "bad and awful and spoke falsely".
"The only thing that can happen, and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and nasty and unpleasant and speak false," he said.
"When you look at publications and leaks and then say, 'Oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you close it?
Do you remember her answer... did you close the document - "Oh, eh, what?
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn't let it."
Wait a moment.
Lach we... No, we didn't lach it," he added, mimicking the senator.
Feinstein received the letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh from Ford in July, and it was played earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's charges, I didn't leave her story," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential, as she asked."
But her refusal did not fall into the good soil of the president, who commented on it at Saturday's election meeting: "I tell you, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
While continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who has been charged with bad sexual behavior by three women, the president suggested that Democrats use the charges for their own gain.
"They are determined to take back power in every way they see necessary.
You see the naughtiness, the cowardice, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to gain power and control," said the president according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars - Belfast Giants (5-3)
Patrick Dwyer scores two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The stars from Dundee compensated for the loss to the Belfast Giants on Friday by winning the return game 5–3 on Saturday.
The Giants received an early two-goal lead due to attacks by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalized before Dwyer once again sent the Giants into the lead.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before two goals by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the win.
It was the third loss in the league this season for the boys of Adam Keefe, who defeated Dundee 2–1 in Belfast on Friday.
This was the fourth meeting between the teams this season, where the Giants have won the last three games.
Dwyer's opening came in the fourth minute after an assist from Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford served an assist to Beauvillier who doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what was a busy opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game in the 14th minute, before Matt Marquardt provided Cownie's equalization in the 16th minute.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants took the lead into the break when he scored his second goal for the evening on the brink of the first half.
The home team regrouped, and Bouchard once again mourned an equalization with a brilliant goal after 27 minutes played.
Late in the second half, Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen obtain Dundee's lead for the first time in the game. He, on his part, secured the victory with the fifth goal for the team halfway in the final half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of the last five games, will face Milton Keynes at home in the next game, which is on Friday.
Flight attendant loses life to ensure hundreds in aircraft escape earthquakes
An airliner in Indonesia is hailed as a hero after losing his life in what he continues to ensure that a plane with hundreds of passengers got safely into the air.
More than 800 people have lost their lives and many have slowed down after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi and triggered a tsunami on Friday.
Strong aftershocks continue to disrupt the area, and there are many trapped in debris in the city of Palu.
However, despite his colleagues fleeing for life, Anthonius Gunawan Agung (21) refused to leave his post in the control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu, although it swinged wildly.
He stayed to make sure that the aircraft on the runway, Batik Air Flight 6321, took off safely.
He then jumped down from the control tower when he believed it collapsed.
He later died in the hospital.
The spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia reported.
We sent a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in a larger city.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"This is heartbreaking," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities are afraid that the number of casualties will increase to thousands, while the country's emergency relief agency says access to the small towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number of dead is increasing as we find bodies trapped under buildings. Many of them we can't reach," agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
Waves of up to six metres have destroyed Palu, which is scheduled to hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Emergency aid comes in with military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance arrives with several bodies.
It is difficult to find clean water.
The small shops have been robbed."
Jan Gelfand, leader of the Red Cross of Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is struggling to help the survivors, but we don't know what they will find when they arrive.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
The President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo came to Palu on Sunday and told the military in the country: "I ask you all to work around the clock to do everything you can to help with the evacuation.
Are they ready?” reported CNN.
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake earlier this year in Lombok, killing 550 people.
Flight crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports man slowed after lagoon plane crash
The airline operating an aircraft that crashed in a Micronesia lagoon in the Pacific reports that a man has been slowed down, having stated earlier that all 47 of the passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the aircraft before it sank.
Air Niugini stated that as of Saturday afternoon they do not know where the male passenger is.
The airline said they are working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not provide any more details about the passenger, and his age and nationality are unknown.
Local boat owners helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water as it tried to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
Authorities stated on Friday that seven people have been sent to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, and all were in stable condition.
It is still unknown what caused the crash and what actually happened.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon not far from the runway.
Some witnesses believed the plane flew past the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was very low.
"It was extremely good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes added that he and other passengers were able to water through the water, which reached them to life, to the emergency exits of the plane before it sank.
He said the flight crew panicked and screamed, and he sustained a head injury that was not serious.
The U.S. Navy said that nearby sailors, working to repair a dock, also rescued passengers with a rubber boat that they used to carry passengers to shore before the plane sank at about 30 meters.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network website shows that 111 people have died in crashes of PNG-registered airlines' aircraft in the past 20 years, but none of them flew with Air Niugini.
Analysts create timeline overnight when woman was burned alive
The prosecution presented all evidence on Saturday during the appealed trial of a man charged with burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in intelligence analysis.
He presented to the jury how he puzzled recordings from cell phones to find out what happened the night Jessica Chambers (19) was killed by the defendant, Quinton Tellis (29).
According to The Clarion Ledger newspaper, Rowlett told us that he used location data from several cell phones showing Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, contrary to what Tellis explained earlier.
When the location data showed Tellis' cell phone was with Chambers' cell phone at the same time as he said he was with friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he was out of town that day.
When prosecuted, Tellis asked if he was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said that he "laughed, because my car was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
But their cell phone bills showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers died, Tellis deleted messages, calls, and Chambers' contact information from his mobile phone.
"He deleted her from his life," Hale said.
The defense is due to close the case on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to go to the jury later that day.

Another black person?!
New York babysitter sues couple for fired after "racist" text message
A babysitter in New York sues a couple to fire her based on discrimination after she received an incorrect text message from her mother complaining that she was "another black person."
The couple have denied being racist, comparing the lawsuit to "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, was dissatisfied when she saw that the babysitter she had hired, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work for the first time in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEEEEI, EVEN ONE BLACK PERSON," wrote Plasco-Flaxman in a text message to her husband.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent him to her babysitter Maurice, twice.
After realizing her mistake, the unhappy Plasco-Flaxman fired babysitter Maurice, saying that the previous babysitter, who was African-American, had done a bad job, so now she wanted someone from the Philippines, according to The New York Post.
Maurice was paid for one day's work before they sent her home in an Uber.
Now, Maurice sues the couple to get compensation for firing her; she wants $350 per day for six months for the job she should have had, even if it was without a contract, where she would live with her family.
"I want to show them it's not okay to do that," she told The New York Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple have denied they are racists, saying that firing Maurice was the only thing they could do after insulting her, because they were afraid she would take revenge.
"My wife had sent her something she didn't intend to say.
She is not a racist.
We're not racists," said husband Joel Plasco to The New York Post.
"But would you let someone you've offended take care of your children, even if you didn't mean to offend them?
Your newborn baby?
Think about it.”
Plasco compared the lawsuit to "extortion," saying that his wife was seven months pregnant and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are you really going to attack a person in such a situation?
It's not a nice thing to do," said investor Plasco.
As the case progresses, the public has been quick to judge the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
The publisher behind the Paddington books was afraid that people would not like a talking bear, reveals new letter
The daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the approval of the first book, commented: "It's hard to imagine what it was like to read the book for the first time, before it was published.
It's very fun to know now how successful Paddington became."
Jankel said her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book about the little teddy bear, would be optimistic even if the book had been rejected. She added that she had mixed emotions during the book's 60th anniversary, because her father died last year.
As for Paddington, whom she described as "a very important member of the family," she added that her father was proud on the inside of how much success he made.
"He was a pretty quiet man, and he never bragged," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having children accomplishing something: you get proud of them even if it's not really you behind it.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always gave all the praise to Paddington himself."
My daughter was going to die and I had to say goodbye on the phone
When she landed, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice in a hurry, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say it was really bad, that they didn't think she was going to make it," said Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then Nad called to say that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, dear.
I'm coming soon to be with you.
I'll be back soon.
The medications doctors had given her for her heart to continue pumping were slowly moving out of her system.
She had already died and now her body was turning off.
I just sat there, knowing this was happening.
I couldn't owl or scream, because I was in a room surrounded by families and people.
I really had to keep everything inside."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, had to board the plane with other passengers who had no idea what she had just gone through.
"Nobody knew anything," she said.
"I sat with my head bent while the tears fell."
It's hard to explain, but it was on the plane that I felt how much sympathy I had for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Grieving women hang patches on bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who lost their loved ones who committed suicide are trying to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have pinned notes on a bridge in Wales to inspire and get people thinking of committing suicide to change their minds and call the numbers on the notes.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he began struggling with depression and took his life when he was 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel the way I know myself every day."
Davis, who is 45 years old and lives in Lydney, said her son was a talented chef with a smile that forged.
"Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They said his smile lit up every room."
But before he died, he quit work, for he was in a "really dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother was the first to find Tyler after he took his own life.
Davis said, "I'm still concerned that my little brother may have been affected by Tyler's death."
Davis wrote the notes "to let people know that there are other people out there who care and with whom they can talk, even if it's a friend.
Don’t sit there alone—you need to talk to someone.”
Humphreys, who has been Davis' friend for many years, lost her partner Mark after they had been together for 15 years and he had recently lost his mother.
"He never told me he was sad or depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed that he started behaving differently.
He was in the basement emotionally on Christmas Day, when the children opened their gifts he didn't even look at them."
She told us that his death was very traumatic for the children, and they continued to work through the trauma: "There is a huge void in our family now.
We are completely destroyed.
But we all have to fight to live on."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in a thin thread as FBI starts investigation
"I thought that if we actually got something similar to what he's asking for — a limited investigation — then maybe we could achieve some loneliness," said Flake on Saturday, adding that he's afraid the committee "collides" in the middle of a partisan backlock.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
They hesitate because of the timing.
The United States midterm elections are only five weeks away, on November 6, and if Republicans don't do well, this will make it difficult for them to elect Kavanaugh in the U.S. Supreme Court.
George W. Bush has called senators to have them support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and was introduced to his wife Ashley in that way, then has been Bush's secretary.
What happens when the FBI presents its report?
They are going to vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats sit.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh will be able to gather at least 50 votes in the Senate. With 50 votes, Mike Pense, the Vice President of the United States, can give him the final vote and confirm him in the Supreme Court.
Number of drop-offs in North Korea 'decline' under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, reports a South Korean lawmaker
Park Byeong-seug referred to data from the South Korean Ministry of Unit, saying that there were 1,127 dropouts last year – compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said tighter borders between North Korea and China and more expensive smuggling charges are the main reasons the number has dropped.
Pyongyang has not spoken publicly.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors receive South Korean citizenship.
Seoul reports that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the 1953 Korean War.
Most fled via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the strictly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean countries.
China views defectors as illegal immigrants and not as refugees, and often sends them back forcibly.
Relations between North and South Korea – which is still technically at war – have improved in recent months.
This month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to negotiate the disarmament of nuclear weapons.
These talks come after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed to work for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean foreign minister Ri Yong-ho accused the United States of achieving nothing since then.
"Without being able to rely on the United States, we cannot rely on our country being safe, and in such a situation we cannot disarm our weapons first," Ri said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterically," saying he can't serve in the Supreme Court
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated for the Supreme Court, "hysterically" and said he has too much temperament to serve in the U.S. Supreme Court.
Pelosi called Kavanaugh "hysterical" in an interview during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
"I know that if a woman had behaved that way, she would have been called 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said of Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Court on Thursday.
Kavanaugh was emotional and denied all charges of sexually harassing Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In Kavanaugh's opening speech, he was very emotional and shouted at times with lumps in the throat while telling about his family and the years onwards.
He criticized the Democrats in the committee, calling the charges against him "grotesque and a planned assassination of his reputation," organized by liberal police officers who were angry that Hillary Clinton did not win the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi added that she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proves he can't serve in the Supreme Court, because it shows he's prejudiced against Democrats.
"I think the way he behaved disqualifies him, and what he said about the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi made an objection when asked if she would try to get Kavanaugh to resign if he is elected to the Supreme Court, and if Democrats achieve majority in the House of Representatives.
"I can say this—if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he can't serve in the Supreme Court, nor in the court he serves now," Pelosi added.
Kavanaugh is a judge of Washington, D.C.'s Federal Court of Appeals.
Pelosi also said that as a Democrat she is concerned about potential judges from Kavanaugh against the law known as Obamacare and the case of Roe vs. Wade, because Kavanaugh is known to be a conservative judge.
In the hearings to confirm Kavanaugh, he avoided answering questions about whether he would reverse certain decisions in the Supreme Court.
"It's not the right time for a hysterical, prejudiced person in the Supreme Court who expects us to say he's great," Pelosi said.
And women must swing the sword
It's a fair, bitter criticism, after months and years of rage, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we are angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you think?"
She continues, "I got a lot of help from a woman in a high firm position, who said that she branched when she was angry, but developed a technique where she said to the person who made her so angry that she branched, 'You think maybe I'm sorry because I was crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just continues.
I thought it was brilliant.
Tears serve as a way to get out the mind, but there are many who misunderstand it.
In one of my strongest memories from a previous job, where most of my colleagues were men, I was in a situation where I was branch of anger, and a woman who was older than me took me by the neck – she was a cold leader that I had always been terrified of – and dragged me out into the hallway.
"Never let them see you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're furious.
They think you're sorry and that they won because they made you cry."
Patricia Schroeder, who at the time was a Congresswoman, a Colorado Democrat, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, Hart was caught unfaithful on a boat called Monkey Business, and withdrew from the campaign. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought she might as well run for president as herself.
"I hadn't really thought through it well enough," she said to me while laughing, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates running for office, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the situation "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since the campaign had already taken place for a while, she had not raised enough money, so she promised that she would only run if she was able to raise $2 million.
It was impossible.
She discovered that her supporters who gave $1,000 to men only gave her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she asked.
Declaring that she would not run for office anyway, she was so emotional and full of gratitude to those who had supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target the voters instead of the delegates, and anger at gender discrimination, that she began to cry during the speech.
"You would think I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder said of how the press reacted when it branched.
"You should have thought that Kleenex was my main sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to write on my tombstone?
"How Branch?"
How the US-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The opening salves of the US-China trade war were eye-opening, and while the battle continues, a rift between the two countries may be a long-term benefit to Beijing, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump first shot this year taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The battle escalated this week, with tariffs on articles worth over $200 billion, which in effect means half of all goods from China to the United States are taxed.
Beijing has taken retaliation and imposed tariffs of between five and ten percent on U.S. goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to respond to the United States for every shot they fire, and the second largest economy in the world is most likely not going to go down at first.
To get Washington to quit, China must do as the United States wants, but bowing to the United States is too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Yet, experts say that if Beijing keeps its head cold, the U.S. pressure could have a positive effect on the Chinese economy in the long term, by diminishing the degree of dependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can cause both economies to sink is more dangerous than people have the darn to admit before," said Abigail Grace, a researcher who focuses on Asia at the Center for American Security, a think tank.
Syria 'ready' for return of refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says they are ready to accept refugees who will return voluntarily, and ask for help to rebuild the country that has been destroyed after more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country are making progress.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terror," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to regain normal areas.
All prerequisites are now in place for refugees to be able to return voluntarily to the country they had to travel from due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that detrimental to daily life and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
An additional six million people in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government would gladly accept help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that they will not accept assistance or assistance with terms from countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost on European soil six times in a row, and they have not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe took back the crown in that team until the Danish captain, Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, reached the 14.5 points they needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson struggled most of the tournament, hitting the ball in the water from the tee at hole 16, par 3, and gave the victory to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari did well in all his rounds and became one of four players who has ever received 5-0-0 since the tournament started its current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was knocked out 5–4 by the player with the lowest ranking on the European team, Danish Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, with the world's highest rank, became 2 and 1 after English Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, who has participated in eight Ryder Cups, became the most winning European with 25.5 points in his career.
"Usually I didn't cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
So thankful that Thomas chose me and believes in me.
I'm so, so happy to get the trophy back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help," said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He makes the relay stick on to fellow countryman John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2–1 in singles games on Sunday.
"I feel an enormous pride in beating Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him," said Rahm (23).
Woods lost all four of his games in France, and now has a 13–21–3 I Ryder Cup record up through his career.
A remarkable statistic from one of the world's best players, who has won 14 major titles and has only been defeated by Jack Nicklaus.
The American team struggled to find the fairway all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who impressed with high-level golf throughout the tournament.
Jim Furyk, the American captain, stated after a disappointing display from his team: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
There were periods this morning where we made it hot for Europe.
- Me fought.
Hats off to Thomas.
He is a solitary captain
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the PGA in America and our committee for the Ryder Cup and get on with it.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be the captain.
You have to take off your hat.
We got rounded."
