AM in Wales are worried about "appearing as a puckon"
Some AM, members of the Wales National Assembly, are confused about a proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament – Member of the Wales Parliament).
The proposal comes after plans to change the name of the National Assembly to Wales Parliament.
AM across the political spectrum are worried about being mocked.
An AM for Labour said his group was worried because "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For readers who don’t know Welsh: Twp means stupid in Welsh and pwp means shit.
An AM for Plaid said the group was generally “dissatisfied” and has suggested other options.
A conservative Welshman said his group is "open" to the name change, but pointed out that it was a short step from MWP to Mupp.
In this context, W is pronounced in Welsh like the letter U in English in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently compiling legislation for the name change, said: “The final decision on what members of the Assembly will be called is, of course, up to the members themselves.”
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which found strong support for calling the Assembly to the Wales Parliament.
Regarding the title of AM, the Commission proposed Welsh Parliament Members or WMP, but the MWP received the most support in a public consultation.
AM apparently suggests other options, but problems with reaching a consensus may cause problems for Presiding Officer Elin Jones, who is expected to file draft legislation on the amendment within a few weeks.
The legislation for the amendments also includes other changes to how the Assembly works, including rules for disqualification of an AM and the design of the comitology system.
They may vote on what they should be called when debating the legislation.
Macedonia holds a referendum to change its name
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum is an attempt to end a dispute that has been going on for decades with neighboring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the neighbouring country represents a claim to its territory and has repeatedly protested against its attempts to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov opposes the referendum on the name change and has said that he will ignore the result.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the name change is the price they have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's are silent as churches in Harlem run into trouble
“Older people I talk to say there was a bar and a church on every corner before,” Adams said.
“Now there is neither.”
He said it's understandable that the bars are disappearing.
“People are getting along differently these days,” he said.
“Bars are no longer like the area’s living room, where people go on a regular basis.”
Regarding the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not be enough as far as the leaders expect and that "sooner or later they will end up on the square one again".
He also pointed out that churches can be replaced by apartment buildings with owner-occupied apartments filled with people who do not help remaining churches.
"The absolute majority of people who buy apartments in the buildings will be white," he said. "This will eventually lead to the closure of all the churches, because those who move into the apartments will probably not become members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white parishes before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin’s a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had a church nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of shops on 125th Street, a shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote black people.
The building was seriously damaged in a fire in 1939, but when Reverend Johnson's congregation planned the renovation, they also built the bell tower.
Reverend David Johnson, father Johnson’s son and successor at St. Martin’s, proudly called the music game “the bells of the poor.”
The expert who played the glockenspiel in July had a different name for it: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also pointed out that it was the world’s first glockenspiel played by a black musician – Dionisio A. Lind, who moved on to the larger glockenspiel at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's did not replace him.
The events of the past few months at St. Martin’s are a complicated story with architects and entrepreneurs – some employed by the Church’s laity, others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The church assembly – the governing body of the church consisting of laymen – wrote to the diocese in July, expressing concern that the diocese would “try to transfer the cost” to the church assembly, despite the fact that the church assembly had not been involved when the diocese hired architects and contractors.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency from the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old who dives after lobster in California
On Saturday, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who popped after lobster in California on the first day of the lobster season, according to officials.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m., near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had dived with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy crying for help and paddling there with a group of others to pull him out of the water.
According to Hammel, at first he thought the boy was just happy to have found a lobster, but then he realized the boy was screaming, "I've been bitten!"
“I have been bitten!”
When Hammel came to the boy, he noticed that all the keybones had been worn up.
"I called everyone to get out of the water. 'There's a shark in the water!'" said Hammel.
The boy was taken to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and his condition is stated to be critical.
It is unclear what shark it was.
Lifeguard captain Larry Giles told the media that a shark had seen the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had been determined that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles also said the victim suffered trauma injuries on his upper torso.
Access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas was blocked for 48 hours for investigative and security reasons.
Giles mentioned that there are over 135 shark species in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's enters the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's takes on Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with department store-like beauty courses with beauty specialists.
As part of a significant push into the UK’s <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow despite the fashion and household markets falling, the larger beauty walks will be tested in 11 stores across the country and implemented in more stores next year if they are successful.
The investment in the beauty market is part of supermarkets’ attempts to fill the shelves that were previously taken up by televisions, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury’s said they intend to double their beauty range to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with highlighted areas, such as in stores like Boots.
The retail chain is also relaunching its boutique makeup brand so that most of the products are vegan – which is what more and more young customers demand.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will test stands in two Sainsbury’s stores – the first one opened in Croydon, south London, last week and the second one opens in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Shopping online and the trend of buying smaller amounts of food every day in local stores means that supermarkets have to do more to attract customers.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that their stores will look more and more like department stores in an effort to fight cheap stores like Aldi and Lidl with more services and products other than food.
Sainsbury's has Argos booths in hundreds of stores and has also acquired a number of Habitat booths since they bought both chains two years ago, which, according to them, has increased food sales and made the acquisitions more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to give the beauty and pharmacy departments a facelift failed.
Sainsbury's tested a collaboration with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended after a dispute over how the revenues from Boots' sales in the supermarkets would be distributed.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s sold its pharmacy business with 281 stores to Celesio, who owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
They argue that Lloyds would play a role in the plan by adding an expanded range of luxurious skin care products, including brands like La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s commercial director, said: “We have given our beauty walks a new look and feel to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who can advise customers.
Our range of brands has been designed to meet every need, and with an appealing environment in convenient locations, we are now an alluring beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones 'furious' after Holly Willoughby pulls out of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones is "furious" that TV presenter Holly Willoughby is pulling out of a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby does not have time with their brand Truly, with casual clothing and accessories.
Their business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop.
This Morning presenter, 37, announced his decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has angered Dragons Den star Peter Jones by pulling out of their lucrative lifestyle brand at the last minute – to focus on their new deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was "furious" at a tense meeting at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire on Tuesday when the TV favorite admitted that her new deal — worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million — meant she was no longer able to focus on their Truly brand, with casual clothing and accessories.
The business has been compared with Gwyneth Paltrow’s brand Goop and was expected to double Willoughby’s estimated fortune of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced she was leaving Truly on Instagram, Jones flew to one of her vacation homes.
One source said, "Truly was definitely Holly's top priority.
That would be her long-term future for the coming decades.
Her decision to retire shocked everyone involved.
No one could believe it happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There's a warehouse full of goods ready to be sold at headquarters in Marlow."
Experts believe that the This Morning presenter’s decision to withdraw could cost the company several million dollars due to significant investments in everything from pillows and candles to clothing, as well as the risk of further delays in launch.
This could be the end of a long friendship.
Three-child mother Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, took the role of chairman in March.
The couple vacation together and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will be the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of “I’m a Celebrity” on ITV.
A source near Jones said last night, "We're not commenting on his business."
Hard talk "and then we fell in love"
He joked that the mass media would criticize him for a comment that some would consider "unworthy of a president" and for being so positive about North Korea's leaders.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in a "news anchor" voice:
“I haven’t given up anything.”
He said Kim wants a second meeting after Trump hailed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
But the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the meeting in Singapore in June, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a "corresponding response" from the US after North Korea's first step in disarmament.
He noted that the US instead continues sanctions intended to maintain the pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech to his supporters.
"North Korea is doing well," he said.
“We were about to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a great relationship.”
He said his attempts to improve relations with Kim have had positive results – an end to rocket tests, freed hostages and returned the remains of U.S. soldiers.
And he defended his different way of talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to behave like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this crowded arena, we’d have around 200 people here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake devastate Indonesian island, killing hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although over 10% of Lombok's population had lost their homes, it was not declared a state of emergency, which is required for international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have been very clear that they are not asking for international help, which complicates the whole thing," Ms Sumbung said.
Save the Children gathers a team to go to Palu, but it is still unclear whether foreign staff can work there.
Mr Sutopo, the spokesman for the Natural Disaster Agency, said Indonesian officials were evaluating the situation in Palu to determine whether international organizations should be allowed to participate in the aid work.
Given Indonesia's constant earthquakes, the country is still sadly unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, but they are rare on other coastlines.
The absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, despite a warning issued, probably contributed to the loss of lives.
Even under perfect conditions, traveling between Indonesia’s many islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters further complicate logistics.
A hospital ship anchored in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it takes at least three days to reach the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on promises to improve Indonesia’s worn-out infrastructure in his election campaign and has spent large sums on roads and railroads.
But insufficient funding has plagued Mr. Joko's administration ahead of next year's election.
Mr. Joko is also pressured by persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority has adopted a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands lost their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, bows and other primitive weapons.
Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge signed at the last minute against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri around 30 meters from Chelsea's goal when his team lagged behind 1-0.
He transferred the ball to the left and scooped a kick at the far post.
The attempt flew high above the target area towards the upper right corner of the net.
The ball finally fell over Kepa Arrizabala’s jump and ended up in the net.
"I was just trying to end up in a position to access the ball and players like Shaq are always playing forward as much as possible, so I was just trying to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching and didn't think much about it but just kicked."
Chelsea led 1-0 after the first half after a goal in the 25th minute from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The blue striker hauled a pass back to Mateo Kovacic, spinned off near midfield and sprinted to Liverpool side.
Kovacic made a quick give-and-go at midfield.
Then he got a superb kick that brought Hazard into the target area.
Hazard ran out of defense and got the ball in the net at the far pole with a left-footed kick past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool are fighting against Naples in the group stage of the Champions League at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy at 15:00 on Wednesday.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League in London at 15:00 on Thursday.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll for the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, according to the country's disaster agency early Sunday.
Many people were reportedly stuck in the rubble of buildings that collapsed in the 7.5-mile earthquake that struck Friday and triggered waves of up to six meters, the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference.
The city of Palu, with over 380,000 inhabitants, was full of debris from collapsed buildings.
Police Arrest 32-Year-Old Man Suspected of Murder After Woman Shot to Death
A murder investigation has begun after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 p.m. with a knife wound at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have asked people in the area who saw or heard anything to come forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "We are at an early stage of the investigation, but I ask anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have filmed something with a car camera to contact us because they may have information crucial to our investigation."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman found lives in Birkenhead and that the body was found inside a property.
In the afternoon, friends who think they know the woman have arrived at the site to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police inform the victim's closest relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to enter his apartment, but police said no one is allowed to enter or exit the building.
He became speechless when he found out what had happened.
The residents of the building have been informed that it will take several hours before they are allowed back in.
A police officer told a man that the whole area is being treated as a crime scene.
A crying woman appeared at the scene.
She says, "It's so awful," over and over again.
At 2:00 p.m. there were two police cars inside the lockdown and another one just outside.
A number of police assistants stood inside the fence with an overview of the apartment building.
Persons with information are asked to send a DM to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 and enter log 247 from September 30.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell's latest victim of quarrel over rewriting history
A ban would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's proposal "foolishness" and "trying to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would be dragged into the ongoing debate about removing statues."
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Cromwell’s mistake might have been sacrificed for what his ancestor Thomas did 100 years earlier.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s magnificent representation of Cromwell reflects the 19th-century view of and is part of the historiography of a man who many still believe should be praised.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than now, believe that Cromwell defended Parliament against pressure from the outside, in his case from the monarchy.
Whether this is a correct representation is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
But the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has undoubtedly affected the development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-known person who represents one side of the matter.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be praised and celebrated.
Killer pig kills farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, who is only identified by his surname Yuan, was found dead with a broken artery and covered in blood in a lane at the marketplace in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to inject vaccines into pigs in a pig herd on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He is reported to have traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a nearby pigsty was open.
He said there was a big pig in the pig's nest with blood on its mouth.
A forensic investigation confirmed that the 250 kg heavy pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and twisted,” the cousin identified with the surname Wu told Guiyang Evening News.
A surveillance camera filmed Yuan when he came to the market to feed his pigs at 4:40 p.m. on Thursday.
His body was found an hour later.
The pig that killed the farmer did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked up to avoid more attacks while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market managers are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
It is rare for pigs to attack humans, but it has happened before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and caused him serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing 300 kilograms pressed a farmer in Wales against a tractor until his wife scared it away.
When a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the taste of blood can serve as a “catalyst.”
"They're just playful.
They're sniffing, they're very curious, they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them respect,” he said.
Remains of Hurricane Rosa for heavy rain to Southwestern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens when it travels over cooler waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
But Rosa will bring flooding rain to northern Mexico and southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa had a wind force of up to 135 km/h, category 1, at 5 EST on Sunday and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to travel north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a trough begins to form across the Pacific Ocean and travels east towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the peninsula of Baja California like a tropical storm on Monday, it will force deep tropical moisture north into the southwestern United States.
Pink will bring up to 25 cm of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture interacting with the approaching troughs will create extensive heavy rainfall in the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Locally, 2.5–10 cm of rain will cause dangerous flooding, clay flows and possibly landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will lead to 5–7.5 cm of rain per hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5-10 cm of rain is expected in some places in the southwestern United States, especially in much of Arizona.
Sudden floods are possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered tropical rain.
It is absolutely not recommended that anyone go into the desert on foot when tropical rain is expected.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into rushing rivers and thunderstorms lead to strong local winds blowing around sand.
The approaching trough brings some local heavy rain to parts of the southern California coastline.
It is possible with a total of over a cm of rain, which can lead to clay flows and slippery roads.
It would be the first rainfall in the area during the rainy season.
Some dispersed tropical rains will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before rains become more widespread later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corner on Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
October may mean intense temperature changes throughout the United States, as the Arctic cools down but the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic temperature changes at short distances.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences in the central United States on Sunday.
There is a 10-degree difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, the remaining summer heat will try to spread again.
Large parts of the central and eastern United States are expected to have a warm start in October with around 30 degrees from the Great Plains to parts of the northeastern United States.
New York could get 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about five degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast suggests a high chance of warmer temperatures than the average in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's interview
Over 20 million viewed Thursday’s arresting testimony from Brett Kavanaugh, who was nominated to the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continued and the normal broadcast was interrupted for Friday’s last-minute twist – Arizona Senator Jeff Flake’s deal with the FBI where they were given a week to investigate the charge.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she is absolutely sure Kavanaugh touched her when he was drunk and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh gave a passionate testimony and said he was absolutely sure it didn’t happen.
It is likely that the number of viewers last Friday was higher than the 20.4 million stated by Nielsen.
They counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN; Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The number of viewers was not immediately available to other TV networks that showed the interrogation, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has problems counting people looking from offices.
In comparison, there are as many viewers as for a football game in the playoffs or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose presenters have shown strong support for Kavanaugh’s nomination, had the most viewers with an average of 5.69 million during the day-long interrogation, according to Nielsen.
ABC had the second highest number of viewers with 3.26 million.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was in focus during Friday's drama.
After the Republican office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS filmed protesters screaming at him as he tried to take a lift to an interrogation with the Judiciary Committee on Friday morning.
He looked down at the floor for several minutes while the protesters screamed at him, as was shown on live broadcast by CNN.
"I'm right in front of you," said a woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
They also said, "You have power when so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had issued a statement and before the elevator doors closed, he said he would have more to say after the hearing with the committee.
The TV networks broadcast live several hours later when the Judiciary Committee voted on whether to pass on Kavanaugh’s nomination to a vote by the entire Senate.
But Flake said he would only do so if the FBI were to investigate the allegations against the nominee in the coming week, as the minority Democrats have insisted.
Flake was partially convinced by his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision had a major impact, as it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'political games' around Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "political games" about Britain's future and to undermine the nation's interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK on 29 September 2018.
In another interview next to her on the front page of the paper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying the proposal for Britain and the EU to collect each other’s customs duties was “totally unreasonable.”
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson for LSU player's death
The police have arrested a suspect for the death shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and jailed for murder, Baton Rouge police said.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said Sims dropped their glasses in the battle.
Police found the glasses at the scene and found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS subsidiary WAFB.
After interrogating Simpson, the police said he admitted to shooting Wayde.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to the Advocate.
The forensic surgeon in East Baton Rouge Parish released a preliminary report last Friday, according to which the cause of death was a gunshot wound in the head and into the neck.
Police would like to thank the Louisiana State Police Refugee Operations Force, the police state court lab, the Southern University police and residents of the area for help with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for their "diligence and pursuit of justice".
The Sims were 20 years old.
The 1.98-metre forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "broken" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"You're worried about this all the time," Wade said.
Volcano spewing ashes over Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatépetl volcano has reached the southern part of Mexico’s capital.
On Saturday, the National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity had been detected in the crater and they recorded 183 emissions of gas and ash over the course of 24 hours.
The center discovered several mullets and quakes.
Photos on social media showed thin layers of ash on windscreens in areas of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted increased activity in the volcano that stands 72 km southeast of the capital since a 7.1 earthquake hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protesters clashed with riot police while thousands took part in rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists held back by riot police threw eggs and paint powder on them, leading to dark dust clouds on streets that are usually full of tourists.
Battles also broke out later in the day and police used their batons to stop them.
For several hours, the independence groups shouted "never forget, never forgive" while the unionists shouted "long live Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries caused by the protests, according to local press.
The atmosphere is still tense in the region, which longs for independence a year after the October 1 referendum, which was considered illegal by Madrid but was hailed by Catalan separatists.
An overwhelming majority voted for independence, but participation was low as most opposed to secession boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year when police tried to stop the vote at polling stations in the region.
Independence groups camped during the night on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place anyway, but was forced to take a different route.
The electrician Narcis Termes, 68, took part in the separatist protest with his wife and said he no longer believes that Catalonia will become independent.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy over being able to vote, but now we've got stuck," he said.
Despite a decisive but marginal gain in regional elections in December, Catalan parties in favour of independence have had difficulty maintaining the impetus this year, as many of their best-known leaders are living in self-imposed exile or in detention pending trial for their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police on his mobile, said the conflict had been fueled by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who has been in custody since the end of last year, announced that he intends to run for the European Parliament next year.
"Candidating to the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the return of democratic values and the subjugation we have experienced from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men Arrested After Car Driving Into House
Three men - 33, 34 and 39 - have been arrested after a car was driven into a house in Londonderry repeatedly.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent, around 19:30 BST on Thursday.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself were damaged.
An armbrush may also have been fired at the car.
Menga wins Livingston 1-0 against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the win
Livingston shocked the Rangers and sentenced Steven Gerrard to his second loss in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's strike proved to be the difference when Gary Holt's side was split second with Hibernian.
Gerrard’s side still hasn’t gotten a away win in the Premiership this season and faces Hearts, with eight more points, next Sunday.
Rangers Rapid Vienna will host the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston extends his winning streak to six games – head coach Holt has still not experienced a loss since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses out on chances against crossing visitors
Holt’s team should have taken the lead long before they scored; their straightforwardness gave the Rangers all sorts of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through but dragged his performance across the goal, and then Alan Lithgow could only shoot wide after slipping in to measure Craig Halkett's nod across the goal.
The home team was content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could attack in certain games.
And that’s how the decisive goal was made.
The Rangers gave up a free kick and Livingston took advantage of an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up to give Menga a chance, scoring from the center of the goal area.
At that point, the Rangers had dominated the ball, but the home team's defense was impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was left virtually alone.
The same pattern continued in the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor's feet and Lithgow shot wide from another of Livingston's determined games.
Crossings constantly entered Livingston’s target area and were handled without problems. Two penalties – after Halkett’s challenge by exchanger Glenn Middleton and one by hand – were dismissed.
"Fenomenal" from Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Fenomenal performance and results for Livingston.
Each one was outstanding and continues to exceed expectations on the way up.
Their playing style and staff have barely changed since they returned to the upper level, but Holt deserves the credit for galvanizing the team since its arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was outstanding and led a skillfully organized defense, and Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on a full girdle straight through.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
They have had their moments under Gerrard, but they did not live up to the standard.
Their last ball didn’t hold the measure – they only opened the homepage once – and it’s kind of an alarm clock for the Rangers, which is in the middle.
Erdogan gets a mixed welcome in Cologne
Saturday was a day of smiles and blue skies (September 29) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany ate breakfast together in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany – to repair relations between NATO allies.
They have become divided over human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the world’s largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police claimed that they prevented 25,000 spectators from gathering outside the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters – many of them Kurdish – also made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him to Germany.
The dueling protests show the divided views of a visitor who is considered a hero by some German Turks and condemned as a monopoly ruler by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in car crash
A cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The crochet took place near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a well-trafficed road in Deptford in southeast London, around 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped the car and paramedics were called, but the man died at the scene.
The crash took place a few months after another cyclist died in a hitting accident on Childers Street, about a mile from the crash on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said they are trying to identify the man and inform his immediate relatives.
Roads have been blocked off and buses have been rerouted and drivers are asked to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured in turmoil
Six prison guards have been injured in riots at a high-security prison for men, according to the Prison Office.
The riots broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 BST on Sunday and are still going on.
Specialized "tornado guards" have been called there to deal with the unrest, involving eight prisoners on a grand piano.
The guards were treated on site for minor injuries to the face.
A Prison Service spokesperson said: “Specifically trained prison personnel have been sent there to deal with the ongoing incident on HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and are clear that those behind this will be attributable to the police and may receive extended prison sentences.”
HMP Long Lartin holds over 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison was being treated in hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot police were called to the prison to deal with serious riots where staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flooding (dry areas may benefit)
It’s rare that tropical lows reach Arizona, but that’s exactly what’s likely to happen at the beginning of next week when Hurricane Rosa’s remaining energy pulls out across the desert in the southwestern United States, at risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings for sudden floods for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to travel directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, bringing rain late on Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or low pressure status within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 65 km of the Arizona border.
The National Hurricane Center’s latest models predict 5–10 cm of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other parts of the desert in the southwestern United States, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to receive 2.5–5 cm of rain with a risk of up to 10 cm.
In areas without the risk of sudden flooding, Rosa’s rain can be a blessing, as the region is hit by drought.
Floods are very serious, but some of the rain will probably be beneficial because the southwestern United States suffers from drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the second-highest category, reported weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa will first travel across the peninsula of Baja California in Mexico.
Rosa, still with hurricane force this Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 135 km/h, is located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and travels north at 20 km/h.
The storm encounters cooler water in the Pacific Ocean, which calms it down.
It is expected to reach Mexico’s landmass as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Parts of Mexico can get heavy rain, which poses a considerable risk of flooding.
"A total of 7.5–15 cm of rain is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with a risk of up to 25 cm," reported weather.com.
Rosa will then travel north across Mexico as a tropical storm and reach the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which will then travel through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The biggest danger from Rosa and its remaining energy is very heavy rain in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the desert in the southwestern United States," the National Hurricane Center said.
The rain is expected to lead to life-threatening sudden floods and mud flows in the desert, as well as landslides in mountainous terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested for attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital and the situation is reported to be "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, police in Avon and Somerset said.
The police are asking anyone who may have filmed what happened to the cell phone to come forward.
Trump Says Kavanaugh "Suffered, Badness, Anger" From Democratic Party
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the recklessness and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump told his supporters in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "suffered from the evil, the anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that he sexually abused her decades earlier when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified before Congress about his accusation.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people saw the brilliance and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote to affirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to affirm one of the most skilled legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a first-class history of serving the public," he told his supporters in the audience in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh’s nomination when he spoke of the importance of Republicans voting in the upcoming midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lives.
“I’m not running, but I’m running,” he said.
“That’s why I go around fighting for great candidates.”
Trump claimed that the Democrats are trying to “resist and hinder.”
The first decisive vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected to take place by Friday, according to information to CNN from an assistant to a senior Republican leader.
Hundreds of dead in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, number rises
At least 384 people died, many swept away when giant waves crashed against the beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to authorities last Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when up to six-metre-high waves crashed against the beach in the twilight, sweeping many to a certain death and destroying everything in their way.
The tsunami came after an earthquake of 7.5.
“When the tsunami warning came yesterday, people stopped on the beach instead of immediately running away, and they fell victim to the tsunami,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster agency BNPB, said at a meeting in Jakarta.
"The tsunami wasn't alone, it dragged cars, logs and houses. It hit everything in its way," Nugroho said. He also said that the tsunami had travelled on the open sea for up to 800 km/h before hitting the coastline.
Some climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 facilities in Palu.
Aerial photos released by the disaster agency show that many buildings and shops are destroyed, bridges are twisted and have collapsed, and a mosque is surrounded by water.
Aftershocks still hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with a population of 2.4 million.
The Indonesian Bureau of Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the amount of energy released in the massive earthquake last Friday was 200 times the size of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The city is located at the end of a long, narrow bay, which may have made the tsunami bigger, according to the agency.
Nugroho described the devastation as “extensive” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have collapsed.
Dead victims were found under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, and 540 people were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and injuries could be even worse along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communication from Donggala "was completely paralyzed without any information," Nugroho said.
"There are over 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, and its staff and volunteers are heading to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could get much worse," they said.
The agency was criticized on Saturday for not informing that the tsunami had struck Palu, but authorities said the waves had appeared by the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man upstairs in a building is heard shouting frenetic warnings about the tsunami to people on the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water crashes against the beach and sweeps away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately authenticate the video.
The earthquake and tsunami led to a major power outage that interrupted all communications around Palu, making rescue work more difficult for the authorities.
The military has started sending cargo flights from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but evacuated people are still in great need of food and other supplies.
The city's airport has been opened for relief work and will remain closed for other traffic until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit facilities in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths in the tsunami in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
Employees from World Vision in Donggala have made their way to Palu where they seek shelter under tarpaulins on the yard outside the office, but they saw devastation along the way, according to Mr. Doseba.
"They said they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Aid groups have begun the harsh work, but some complained that foreign aid workers with extensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and staff from abroad may only be used if a state of emergency is declared after a disaster.
This has not yet happened.
“It’s still a regional disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the authorities say it’s a national disaster, we can let in international aid, but that status hasn’t been announced yet.”
When the second night fell in Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, relatives and friends of missing people still hoped that their loved ones would prove to be the miracles that illuminate gloomy natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescue workers rescued a woman who had been stuck in a wreckage for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, Indonesia’s national paratrooper team coach, had trained two of the missing paratroopers for the Asian Games, which ended in Indonesia earlier this month.
Others who were stuck at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Monday, were his students.
“As a paragliding veteran, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr Gendon told me that hours after the paratroopers heard that the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu participants attending the beach festival.
But his messages received only one gray tick, instead of two blue ones.
“I think that means the messages weren’t delivered,” he said.
Thieves take $26,750 during ATM refill at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who filled up an ATM at Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport police press release.
The driver of the car had emptied an ATM in the entertainment facility and was going to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in the announcement.
While he was busy, "another man jumped up behind the Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money to be delivered.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, according to the press release, but police did not specify how many were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about the identity of the perpetrators should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
He announced the name change on Twitter on Saturday, saying: "The creature that is formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been called Ye for a long time and used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The name change comes before his participation in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande in the program, who cancelled for "emotional reasons" according to the program's creators.
Ye is an abbreviation of West's current professional name, but he has also said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
“I think ‘ye’ is the word most used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year when he talked about the title of his Big Boy radio album.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It went from Kanye, which means ‘the only one’, to just Ye – a reflection of our good, our evil, our confused, everything.
The album is a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of a number of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has previously been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who previously collaborated with West, has previously written his name with and without hyphens and capitals.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use the military against civilians
Mexico’s recently elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed to never use the military against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador pledged at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday that “never use the military to oppress the Mexican people.”
Troops fired guns at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 600 people during an era when left-wing student movements took root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has sworn to support young Mexicans with monthly grants to students and by opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and inadequate educational opportunities are attracting young people to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double AI funding
Now that China is becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount it spends on research in the field, according to inventor and AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment comes after several parts of the U.S. government have made statements about AI, although the U.S. does not have an overall formal AI strategy.
China announced its plan last year with the goal of becoming a leader in AI innovation by 2030.
“It would be a good start to doubling the budget for AI research, given that all other countries are so far behind the United States and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
A double budget could double the chance of the next major AI breakthrough being made in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview earlier this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published earlier this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most prominent AI companies – Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he worked on an AI system that beat the top-rated American Othello player, and later he sat in the management of Microsoft Research and was CEO of Google’s China department.
Lee mentioned earlier technology competitions from the U.S. government, such as the Robot Challenge from the Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked what would be the next in order to identify future visionaries.
In the United States, researchers often have to work hard to get funding from the government, Lee said.
“It’s not China that takes the academic leaders from us, it’s the companies,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired leading personalities from universities to work on AI.
Lee said new immigration policies could also help the U.S. with AI innovation.
“I think green cards should be offered automatically to doctoral students in AI,” he said.
The State Council of China issued its development plan for the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
In China, the National Natural Science Foundation provides grants to individuals at academic institutions such as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distributing funds to researchers in the United States, but the quality of the academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to bring together partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And earlier this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative they call AI Next.
NSF is currently investing over $100 million a year in AI research.
U.S. legislation that would create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has made no progress in months.
Macedonian referendum on name change
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday whether the country's name should be changed to "North Macedonia Republic", which would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that has hindered the country's attempts to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and claims that the name of its neighbour in the north constitutes a requirement for its territory and has therefore prevented Macedonia from joining NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the name change would undermine the identity of Macedonia’s Slavic majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has led to doubts about whether the minimum 50 per cent participation required for the referendum to be considered valid will be reached.
The question on the ballot in the referendum is the following: "Are you in favour of membership of NATO and the EU with approval of the agreement with Greece?"
However, supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth renaming if it allows Macedonia, one of the countries formed when Yugoslavia split, to join the EU and NATO.
"I am here to vote for the future of our country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because that means safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
The referendum is not binding, but enough Members of Parliament have said that they intend to follow the outcome in order to consider it decisive.
The change of name requires a majority of two-thirds of Parliament.
According to the State Election Commission, no irregularities had been reported at 1 p.m.
But participation was only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the last 2016 parliamentary election when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I vote for my children, we belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko vote in the Macedonian referendum on the country's name change, which would open the way for membership of NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
Outside the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, arranged a small stage and place out chairs in front of the tents that have been set up by those boycotting the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads in the air, not sneak in through the back door," Kavardarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not welcome us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
According to Prime Minister Zaev, membership of NATO would lead to much-needed investment in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
“I think the absolute majority will vote yes, because over 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said.
He said a "yes" result would be a "confirmation of our future."
According to a survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters thought to vote in the referendum, which falls below the minimum required attendance.
According to another survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57 percent of the participants thought they would vote on Sunday.
70% of them would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to count, 50 percent of registered voters must vote plus one.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious setback for the Western-minded government’s policy since it took over in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero makes his way through Brighton's defense to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling beat Brighton's proposal in Manchester City's 2-0 win at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
Aguero made it look ridiculously simple when he scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a pass from the midfield at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between Brighton's three defenders and set out in the open field.
Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He made his way around a defender and ran away from several others at the edge of Brighton's goal area.
Then he pushed a pass to Sterling on the left.
The English forward used his first kick in the goal area to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot in the right side of the net.
"Aguero has problems with his feet," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him playing for 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored at that moment.”
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the initial lead in the Premier League game.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep inside Brighton's territory on that game.
He sent a nice kick along the left side of Leroy Sane.
Sane took a couple of kicks and led Sterling to the far post.
The Sky Blues forward kicked the ball into the net the moment before it ended up out of reach.
City will face Hoffenheim in the group stage of the Champions League at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany at 12:55 on Tuesday.
Scherzer wants to play against the Rockies
The Nationals have been eliminated from the playoffs, so there was no need to force one to start.
But competition-oriented Scherzer wants to throw on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, who are a game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West, still have a chance for the playoffs.
The Rockies got a wild card spot with a win of 5-2 over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking for their first division title.
"We're playing for nothing, but we can get a chance to rub the rubber in the knowledge of the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and that the other team would play at a higher level than any other team I would face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to be there?”
The Nationals have not announced their start for Sunday yet, but according to reports, they are inclined to let Scherzer throw under the circumstances.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, warmed up in the bullpen on Thursday and would throw on his normal rest Sunday.
Washington’s right-handed pitcher is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 200 2/3 innings this season.
Trump speaks in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated for the Supreme Court, when he spoke of the importance of Republicans voting in the upcoming midterm elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lives.
This is one of the big, big ones ... I'm not running, but I'm running. That's why I'm going around fighting for sovereign candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You see a horrible, horrible group of radical Democrats, you see it happening here and now.
They are determined to take back power whatever it takes, you see their cruelty, their awfulness.
They don't care who they have to hurt, who they have to drive over to take over power and control. That's what they want, power and control. We're not going to let them get it."
Democrats, he said, are fighting to “oppose and hinder.”
"You've seen that in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "angry and mean and terrible and false."
He mentioned the Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was met with a loud booing from the spectators.
“Do you remember what she said?
“Did you leave the document?”
'Eh, eh, huh?
No, no, no, I'm expecting a...' It was really bad body language, some of the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a broad church.
They don’t tolerate people who say what they think.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the latest in a series of Labour MPs who are told that we are not welcome, just because we say what we think.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way when she stood up against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on the security of the nation, on Europe – ironically, topics similar to what Jeremy criticized former leaders for.
In the announcement of the meeting with Nottingham East Labour on Friday, it was stated that "we want the meetings to be welcoming and productive."
For most of my eight years as Labour’s local MP, the GC meetings on Fridays have been just that.
But now, unfortunately, many meetings are not, and the promise of "friendly, gentler" politics has been forgotten a long time ago, if ever it even began.
It has become increasingly obvious that disagreements are not tolerated within the Labour Party, and every opinion is judged on the basis of whether the party leader accepts it.
This started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, when colleagues I thought had a similar political view that I expected to take a turn and take positions that I would otherwise never have agreed on – whether it was about the security of the nation or the EU internal market.
Every time I speak in public – and it doesn’t really matter what I say – I follow a tirade of rabble on social media that demands my dismissal, criticizes mid-politics, and says I shouldn’t even be in Labour.
And this doesn't just affect me.
In fact, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments addressed to me are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of these colleagues as they face a stream of sexist and racist insults every day but never give up.
One of the biggest disappointments with this era’s policies is the level of insults now considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn argued last week that Labour should promote a culture of tolerance.
But in reality we are no longer this broad church, and with every distrust and change in the rules of selection, the party becomes ever narrower.
I've been given a lot of advice over the last two years about flying under the radar and not being too straightforward, so "it's okay."
But that’s not why I became a politician.
Ever since I joined Labour as a school student 32 years ago, provoked by the Thatcher government’s neglect that literally caused my primary school classroom to collapse, I’ve been trying to fight for better public services for those who need it most – both at the local level and as a minister of government.
I have never concealed my political views, and that includes the recent elections.
No one in Nottingham East can in any way have been confused about my views on policies and topics where I disagree with the current leadership.
To those of you who promoted the petition on Friday, I just want to say that when the country is moving towards a Brexit that will harm households, businesses and public services, I don’t understand why anyone would want to waste time and energy on my loyalty to Labour’s party leaders.
But my main message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituency – both Labour and others: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threats of deposing me or political comfort will prevent me from doing what I think is best for all of you.
Chris Leslie is an MP for Nottingham East.
Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Unsuccessful Ayr at the top
Two last-minute attempts may have distorted the result a bit, but there’s no doubt Ayr deserved to triumph in this delightfully entertaining Tennent’s Premiership match.
They are now at the top, the only undefeated side of the ten.
In the end, it was their superior defense, as well as their ability to take chances, that gave the home team the win, and coach Peter Murchie has every right to be satisfied.
“We’ve been tested during our matches so far and are still unbeaten, so we’re obviously happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Ayr deserves it, they took better chances than us."
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, which was converted by Frazier Clima, gave Ayr the lead but a yellow card for Scotland's captain Rory Hughes, who was allowed in by the Warriors for the match, allowed Melrose to let the numbers speak and Jason Baggot made an unconverted attempt.
Clima extended Ayr's lead with a penalty, and at the end of the first half he scored and converted a solo attempt to give Ayr a lead of 17-5 in the break.
But Melrose got a good start in the second half and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was converted by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
It was then a long wait for a serious injury for Ruaridh Knott, who was carried off the pitch, and after the restart, Ayr increased the lead again with an attempt by Stafford McDowall, who was converted by Clima.
Ayr's acting captain Blair MacPherson then received a yellow card, and Melrose again forced the extra man to pay with an unconverted attempt by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of heated pressure.
But the home team recovered and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tackling Clima without the ball, McPherson made a touch down from the penalty line-out behind Ayrs maul.
Clima converted, which he did again almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong's box kick and sent away flanker Gregor Henry for the home team's fifth attempt.
Still Game star seems ready for new career in restaurant business
Still Game star Ford Kiernan appears ready to enter the restaurant business after it is discovered that he has been named CEO of a licensed restaurant business.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC's popular series, which he writes and plays with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last of the series, and Kiernan seems to be planning for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment, but a source on the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to enter Glasgow's "blooming restaurant industry".
"The sea belongs to us": coastless Bolivia hopes that the court opens the way to the Pacific again
Sailors patrol a rig-covered headquarters for the Navy in La Paz.
Public buildings have a blue flag.
The Navy's bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon carry the motto: "The sea belongs to us.
It is our duty to recover it.”
In coastless Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource conflict is still strong – and it is also the desire to sail the Pacific once again.
This hope is higher than it has been in several decades now that Bolivia is awaiting a decision of the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of consideration.
"Bolivia has the drive, a mood of unity and peace, and of course awaits the result with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the ruling of the International Court of Justice on large screens across the country, hoping that the Court of The Hague will judge in favor of Bolivia’s demand that Chile, after years of irregular discussions, have to negotiate with Bolivia to allow them their own outlet to the sea.
The decision on Monday is also of great importance to Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic native president who is facing a controversial fight for re-election next year.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe it is unbelievable that the court judges in favor of Bolivia, and that not much would change even if it does.
The UN Court, based in the Netherlands, is not entitled to allocate Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the decision is announced only six months after the final arguments suggests that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And the last four years may have hurt rather than promoted Bolivia’s chances.
"The question of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
She claims that Morales’ aggressive rhetoric has tarnished Chile’s remaining benevolence.
Bolivia and Chile will eventually continue the discussion, but it will be extremely difficult to do so afterwards.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, did not consider that the Court’s decision had been taken unusually quickly.
It will give Bolivia “an outstanding opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “stop 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – used the issue of the sea as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific," he said.
“The decision is a chance to realize that we have to move on from the past.”
North Korea Says Nuclear Disarmament Requires Confidence in US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said the nation would not disarm its nuclear weapons unless it can trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to fulfill the promises made during a summit in Singapore between the two rival leaders.
His comments came as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems on the verge of resolving the stalemate of nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's a "desire" that continued sanctions and U.S. protests against a statement to end the Korean War will ever tame North Korea.
Washington is hesitant about agreeing to the statement without Pyongyang first initiating significant nuclear disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want another summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang really intends to get rid of an arsenal that the country probably sees as its only chance to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows reveal latest line huge headgear on the way to stores near you
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or completely block the sun, we have the right thing for you.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have unveiled a range of crazy, oversized headgear for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which dazzled the style icons at Paris Fashion Week.
Incredibly impractical hats have taken over Instagram this summer, and the designers have sent their eye-catching creations on the catwalk.
Valentino’s main creation was an exaggerated beige hat with a feather-like wide hat board that completely took over the models’ heads.
Other oversized accessories included jewel-decorated watermelons, a wizarding hat, and even a pineapple – but they’re not meant to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also unveiled a selection of bizarre worms, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful worms had stitched lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation resembled a wetsuit with a snorkel and a dive mask, and another looked like a melted ice cream pan.
And if you continue that huge fashion, you're in luck.
Fashion experts predict that the huge hats may be heading to stores near you.
The oversized hats come shortly after La Bomba – the straw hat with a board of 60 cm that has been seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the incredibly impractical hat that has taken over social media sent out yet another great creation on the catwalk – a straw beach bag that was almost as big as the model in the swimsuit that held it.
The terracotta raffia bag, with raffia fringes and a white leather handle, excelled in the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags in stores next summer – the designer has had such a big impact that it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language Skills Crucial for Global Citizens
Scotland’s independent schools maintain outstanding academic performance and this continued in 2018 with yet another set of outstanding test results, only reinforced by individual and collective advances in sports, art, music and other community engagement.
With up to 30,000 students in Scotland, the schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible service for their students and their parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further education, their chosen career and their role as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement customized curricula, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and in demand topics in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart.”
It’s a powerful reminder that we can’t just rely on English when we build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year’s test results show that languages are at the top of the list, with the highest number of approved results in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received A in the final examination Higher Grade.
Data collected from SCIS 74 member schools showed that 72 percent of students who studied Mandarin received an A in Higher Grade, and 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French, and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as crucial skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages as a subject choice are now considered as important as natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics on curricula in independent schools and beyond.
A survey conducted by the UK’s Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that employers had difficulty filling their vacancies for various reasons, with 17 percent attributed to a lack of language skills.
With that said, language skills are becoming all the more necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more future jobs requiring language skills, these skills are becoming necessary in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career choice, they will have a real advantage in the future if they have adopted a second language.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a multilingual person a competitive advantage.
According to a survey of more than 4,000 adult Britons published by YouGov in 2013, 75 percent responded that they couldn’t speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation in it, and where French was the only language that came up with a two-digit percentage (15 percent).
That is why it is so important to invest in language education for our children.
Being able to speak several languages, especially those used in developing countries, gives your child a better chance of finding a meaningful job in the future.
In Scotland, each school will teach different combinations of languages.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages considered most important to the UK by 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests, there will always be a number of languages to choose from within independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools strive to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills needed to succeed, no matter what the future holds in store.
In a global economic environment, it is undoubtedly language that continues to be crucial for the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scotland’s youth.
I'm fine with the fair.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron makes Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans looking forward to seeing LeBron James make his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's first season game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he plays has yet to be determined.
“There will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' pre-season schedule.
“I don’t need pre-season games at this stage of my career to get ready,” he said.
Trump's West Virginia campaign event, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is holding his first campaign event tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It’s Trump’s first of five planned appearances next week, including events in places he has a lot of support, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Pending a confirmation vote by his candidate for the Supreme Court vacancy, Trump aims to build support for upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress ahead of the upcoming November elections.
What time is Trump’s West Virginia rally tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump’s Wheeling, West Virginia campaign event is scheduled for 19:00, tonight Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s West Virginia rally online below via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address this week’s interrogation of the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who became tense after allegations of his sexual assault, with an expected delay in the Senate vote of up to a week while the FBI’s investigation of the case is underway.
But the primary purpose of these events is to help Republicans get some meat on their feet before the November elections.
Thus, President Trump said these five gatherings next week are aimed at “engaging volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Control of Congress is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we enter the hectic campaign period,” a Trump campaign spokesman said.
The night’s event, scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, could draw in fans from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract attention from Pittsburgh’s media,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who has slipped behind in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come there to try to give him an increase in polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA struggling to keep hope alive for Sunday’s singles
After three one-sided sessions, the party competitions on Saturday afternoon could have been what it took for this Ryder Cup.
The moment’s swinging pendulum is a completely invented sporting concept, but something that players really believe in, and more than ever before in competitions like these.
So what momentum is it about now?
“They had a six-point lead and now it’s four, so we’re wearing it as a little momentum I guess,” Spieth said.
Europe has the advantage, of course, of four points advance with twelve more to win.
Americans, as Spieth says, feel like they have a little wind in their sails, but they have a lot to be encouraged by, not least in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and combed three points out of four each.
Spieth has been sharp from tee to green and leads by example.
The win streak scaled even higher as his round continued and he lowered a decisive putt to take the game four all-square when he and Thomas had lagged behind with two after two games.
His putt that won them the match at 15 met with a similar roar, with the conviction that the American team is not yet out of the game.
“You really have to dig deep and worry about your own match,” Spieth said.
That’s all these players have left now.
18 holes to win.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe’s odd but adorable couples are four out of four and now nothing can go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple that didn't do a bogey on Saturday afternoon and they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
These achievements and crowd reactions state that they are the players to beat on Sunday and there is no more popular player who could come home a potential European victory when the sun sets over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both, at the same time on different holes.
However, it is too early to speak of European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made the process short with Sergio Garcia, the four-ball hero of the morning, along with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on front nine sunk the Spaniard and Swede in a hole they never even got close to crawling out.
On Sunday, however, there is no one to help you out of the hole.
Four-ball and foursome are so fascinating to see up close because of the interaction between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give, and how a strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and taken a significant lead for the last day, but this foursome session also showed that Team USA has a fighting spirit that some, especially on the US side, had doubted.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 in Ryder Cup final day
Europe will have a strong advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after coming out of Saturday's four-ball and foursomes matched with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two victories over a besieged Tiger Woods and came home with four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, who fought to keep the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that never really got started during this morning's four-ball 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance in the foursome and won two games, but that was not enough for victory.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 singles matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, named "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend, are only the second pair to win four points from their first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in four-ball, they beat an exhausted Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who made his way through two games on Saturday, showed single moments of brilliance, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in four-ball and foursome, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested during this morning’s four-ball and returned to partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes for a 2&1 win over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – ranked 1st and 3rd in the world.
Europe didn’t have the wind all the way, but it was a nice, windy day just southwest of Paris.
Three-time winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They came home the 2&1 victory over Spain’s Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in four-ball and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in foursome after losing the two opening holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team come back from a four-point draw in the singles matches, however, Furyk’s side only needs a tie to keep the trophy.
After being second best for two days, it looks like a counterattack on Sunday can be hard to get through.
North Korea says it will “never” disarm unilaterally without trust
The North Korean foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions deepened their distrust of the United States and it was not possible for the country to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization’s Annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “significant measures to show its goodwill” over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear testing facilities, and vowing not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons technology.
"However, we do not see a corresponding response from the United States," he said.
“Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no chance that we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first.”
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington’s opposition to a phased approach to nuclear power that would lead to North Korea being rewarded as it took gradual steps, his statement seemed significant, as it did not reject a unilateral nuclear solution altogether as Pyongyang previously did.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim promised to work towards “the dismantling of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula” while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea’s security.
North Korea has sought a formal end to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the US has said that Pyongyang must first decommission its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also declined negotiations to ease tough international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States insists on ‘decommissioning first’ and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its purpose by coercion and even objects to the ‘declaration to end the war’,” Ri said.
“The notion that sanctions can get us on our knees is a dream come true for those people who lack knowledge of us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions deepen our distrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leaders highlighted at the UN earlier this week.
The minister instead pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: "If the party in this issue of nuclear disarmament were South Korea and not the United States, the Korean peninsula's nuclear disarmament would not have reached such a deadlock."
Yet the tone of Ri’s speech was dramatically different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea’s future capability to reach the U.S. mainland with rockets was inevitable after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim a “rocket man” on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, commended Kim for his courage to take action for disarmament, but it said that much work remains to be done and that sanctions must remain until North Korea is disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timeframe for this, saying that "if it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the United Nations Security Council on Thursday that “the continuation of the Security Council’s sanctions must continue with force and without fail until we realize a complete, final, verified disarmament.”
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to stifle funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile program.
Pompeo met with Ri at the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said progress had been made, but North Korea accused him a few hours later of making "gangster-like demands".
North Korea promised a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile plant and also a nuclear power complex if the US took "corresponding action".
He said Kim had told him that the “corresponding measures” he was seeking were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and are moving toward normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Take Courses on Getting Enough Rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has gotten all PhD students to improve their sleep habits in an effort to fight the growing macho culture of studying through caffeine-filled “virtues.”
An academic study found that students at the world’s leading universities are often unsuspecting when it comes to the very basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he considers to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the impact sleep deprivation had on learning.
“At the end of it, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why don’t I know this until now, in my last year?’
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep — which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was held for the first time this year, explains to students the importance of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The hour-long course covers a range of interactive tasks.
Part of the course includes a picture of a student room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation and the importance of good sleep habits.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A map of campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that it won’t change students’ behavior directly.
But we believe they have the right to know — just as one has the right to know about the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes,” added Professor Czeisler.
The pride culture of being “worthy” still exists, he says, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Ensuring you have enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student’s “secret weapon” to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said – even to avoid weight gain because insomnia puts the brain in a state of starvation and makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course and has studied one of his courses last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course was an eye-opener and inspired him to campaign for a campus-wide course.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all doctoral students to complete a similar study program before starting their studies at the high-performance department.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm for when to go to bed and when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electronic displays and LED lighting, which can make you turn around around the clock, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mengas goal lowers Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another loss today when Dolly Menga’s strike sent Steven Gerrard’s uneven side to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox side was looking to take home their first win on the road since February's 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team delivered Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager to leave his team eight points behind Ladbrokes Premiership leader Harts.
Menga hit seven minutes before half time and the Rangers never evened out the result.
While the Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and is just behind the Hibernian on goal difference.
And there may be more problems at stake for the Rangers after lineman Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after an object was thrown from the far end.
Gerrard made eight changes in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Livi 11 who took a point from Hearts last week and he would have been delighted at the way his well-oiled games overcame opponents every time.
The Rangers may have dominated, but Livingston did more with the ball control they had.
It should have been a goal already two minutes into the game when Menga’s first pass allowed Scott Pittman through to Allan McGregor’s goal, but the midfielder missed his big chance and shot outside.
A deep kick from Keaghan Jacobs then reached team captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only reached the rear pole.
The Rangers took control of the game, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game during the last third of the game.
Alfredo Morelo probably felt that he should have been punished when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson waved away the Colombian’s call.
The Rangers only scored two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly easily took Lassana Coulibaly's nick and a tame kick from Ovie Ejaria.
Livi’s opening shot in the 34th minute may have gone against the spirit of the game, but no one can deny that their servants deserved it.
Once again, the Rangers failed to manage Jacob's fixed situation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher fit Scott Robinson, who remained calm and chose Menga for an easy finish.
Gerrard acted at the break when he switched Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and the switch gave almost immediate effect when the outsider hit the ball into Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block the attempt.
But Livingston continued to get the opponents to play exactly the kind of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping up long pass after long pass.
Holt's side could have strengthened his lead in the final stage, but McGregor managed well to stop Jacobs before Lithgow nodded outside after the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton had yet another late claim for punishment when tamped with Jacobs, but again Thomson looked away.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from Sunday's calendar: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today ... the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the manikin called Geiger Meter.
Geiger meters have become a cornerstone of science since then and also figure big in pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring the seemingly unlikely cowpoke scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
“What the hell is that?”
Rogers: "It's a Geiger meter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity of the minerals.
Evans: "Yes, it pops now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” cancer cells
New cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to “see” cancer cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory
They can then “see” a protein that is common to many cancers and then re-injected.
A trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with various cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize cancer, saw her ovarian cancer cells disappear for over 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can “see” a protein common to many cancers called HER2, and then re-inject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "promotes the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancers," Prof Berzofsky explained.
A similar method of taking immune cells from patients and “teaching” them how to target cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West supported Trump by wearing a MAGA cap, after his SNL appearance.
It didn't go so well
Kanye West was expelled from the studio during Saturday Night Live after a staggering performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for the post in 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town where he wore a Make America Great cap, he rallied against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“So many times when I talk to a white person, they say, ‘How do you like Trump, he’s racist?’
“Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago,” he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee on the sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the playback of West's exposition was uploaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear whether Rock was trying to get West to make the speech.
West had also complained in front of the audience that he had been harassed backstage for his headgear.
"They bullied me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out there with that cap on."
They bullied me!
And then they say I fell low," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to sink low too?" and said he would "put my supermancape on, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
“Test with love.”
His comments attracted more burops at least twice from the audience and employees from SNL seemed embarrassed, Variety reported. One person said, "It became deadly quiet in the studio."
West had come in as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West confused many with his performance of the song I Love It, dressed up as a Perrier Bottle.
West received support from the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest souls: THANK YOU FOR STOPPING YOU TO THE MOB."
But the talk show's host, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West simply "was herself and it's absolutely wonderful."
“But I chose not to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his ‘art’) who I think embraces and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free.
We are too, she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "the creature formerly known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rap colleague, Snoop Dogg has called himself Snoop Lion and of course the deceased music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.
Judge for attempted murder after knife-cutting restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear at the Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The allegations will be examined by the prosecution.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington battles toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-swinging role as Jon Snow in HBO’s violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, has spoken negatively about the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such roles on screen mean that young boys often feel they have to be tough to be respected.
In a statement to Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes “something has gone wrong” and questioned how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity during the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his co-star in Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also she 31, admitted that he feels "pretty strong" to tackle the problem.
"I personally feel pretty strong, right now - where have we gone wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"How have we brought up men with regard to the problems we are seeing now?"
Kit believes that TV may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
He continued, “What is innate and what is learned?
What is being taught on TV and on the streets that makes young boys feel that they have to be in a certain way to be a man?
I think that’s really one of the big questions of our time – how do we change it?
It is clear that something has gone wrong for young men.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not make any Game of Thrones sequels when the series comes to an end next summer, saying he's "ready with battlefields and horses."
From November, Kit will play in a remake of Sam Shepard’s True West which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks the meeting with his wife Rose was the best experience from Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife thanks to the series, so that way it gave me my future family and my future life," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, whom Kit's character Jon Snow falls in love with, in the Emmys-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced an increase of 14% in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been affected in the country, the health authorities say.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted via sex and marked a change from previous years.
Traditionally, HIV spreads rapidly through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way had fallen to almost zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 from year to year.
HIV transmission through intercourse is an acute issue in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be widespread.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will sooner or later marry women.
Many of the cases of infection are due to insufficient protection during intercourse in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies staff leaking GOP senator’s duties, disguising “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters condemned on Saturday allegations that one of her employees had posted personal information on three Republican U.S. senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that these claims were disseminated by right-wing extremist websites.
"Lies, lies and more reprehensible lies," Waters said in a statement.
The released information reportedly contained home addresses and phone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual assault against the nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came sometime after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Water’s office and released the information about a member of Water’s staff, Hill reported.
"This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"My staff - whose identity, personal data and security has been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false claims - were in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie.”
Water’s statement quickly received criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests she doesn't have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they did not do, they must not be angry.
They must not be defiant.
They must not question the motive of the questioner.
They have to be calm and calm.”
Fleischer appeared to be trying to compare Water’s reaction to Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics accused of appearing angry during Thursday’s interrogation.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who ran for Waters in the middle of the term, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"It's true," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had warned "appropriate authorities and law enforcement entities of these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators will be exposed," she continued, "and that they will be held legally accountable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all my employees."
Johnny English Strikes Again: A Powerless Spy Parody by Rowan Atkinson
It is now tradition to look for Brexit meanings in every new film with a British tilt, and the same seems to apply to this remake of the latest Johnny English action comedy – a series of spy parodies kicked off in 2003 with Johnny English and brought back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will sharp satire about how obviously bad we are become the nation’s new export commodity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face has his license to fuck sake renewed for the second time - his name signals more than anything else that he is a broad comic creation intended for cinema audiences even in non-English-speaking countries.
He is, of course, the crazy secret agent, who despite his bizarre claims to smoothie glamour has gotten a little bit of Clouseau, a bit of Mr Bean and a measure of the guy from the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
He is also originally based on the traveler and international mysterious man that Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV ads that create chaos wherever he goes.
There are one or two great moments in the latest JE movie
I loved when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and when the rotor blades briefly struck his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is shown, but the humor feels rather low-key and strangely superfluous, especially since the "serious" film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now offer comedy as an ingredient.
The humour feels like it’s adapted for children rather than adults and for me, Johnny English’s weird tricks aren’t as inventive and focused as Atkinson’s silent movie great-grandfather in the role of Bean.
The constant topic is now that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain’s super-secret web network of spies, revealing the identities of all Britain’s agents out in the field, to the agent in the great dissatisfaction of the service – an incredibly small role for Kevin Eldon.
It will be the last straw for a prime minister who is a pompous and hard-working figure, already suffering from a complete collapse of his political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing her very best with this quasi-Teresa-May character, but the script doesn’t offer much to work with.
Her intelligence adviser informs her that once each active spy is busy, she must use someone who has retired.
And that means the stuttering Johnny English in his own high person, now employed as a teacher in some affluent institution, but offering unofficial lessons in the art of working undercover alongside.
English was sent back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with his former longtime sidekick Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine captain, a jolly hockey sticks role in which Vicki Pepperdine is close to being thrown away.
So Batman and Robin are back after everything went so terribly wrong at Her Majesty's Secret Service and encounter Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister will fall hard for the charismatic tech billionaire, who claims he can solve Britain’s computer trouble: the unfortunate Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of farce: dressed up as waiters, they set fire to a flashy French restaurant; they create chaos as they smuggle themselves aboard Volta’s luxury yacht; and English triggers sheer anarchy as he tries to use a VR headset to get acquainted with the inside of Volta’s house.
There is certainly a lot of work behind the latter sequence, but despite the fact that the film is both charming and fast-paced, it has an air of children’s TV around it.
Pretty moderate all in all.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I can’t help but think: Can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that matches his talent?
Labour denies drafting a plan to allow British workers to work a four-day week but get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour party is considering a radical plan that the British work a four-day week - but get paid for five.
The party wants business leaders to hand over savings made by the revolution in artificial intelligence (AI) to workers by giving them an extra day off.
It would see employees enjoy a three-day weekend – but keep the same salary.
According to sources, the idea would "fit" with the party's economic agenda for the benefit of the workers.
Switching to a four-day week has been approved by Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of economic change.
A senior Labour official told The Sunday Times: A review of the policy is expected to be published before the end of the year.
“It will not happen in a day, but a four-day working week is an endeavour that fits into the Party’s approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of the worker and the overall industrial strategy of the Party.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, even the party The Greens promised a four-day working week during their 2017 election campaign.
However, this objective is not endorsed by Labour as a whole.
A Labour spokesman said: "A four-day working week is not the party's policy and it is not something on which the party agrees."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week’s Labour conference to communicate his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from “faceless leaders” and “sneakers” on state corporations.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that the current shareholders of water companies cannot get back their entire effort, because a Labour government can make "deductions" because of what they perceive to have been wrong actions.
He also confirmed plans to put employees on corporate boards and create so-called Inclusive Ownership Funds where 10 percent of the private company’s equity is handed over to its employees, who then stand to receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy on "60 Minutes" to discuss whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change their views
The FBI's investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination for the Supreme Court by at least one week, raising the question of whether the agency's investigations could prompt some Republican senators to change their stance on the matter.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, “60 Minutes” correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal anything that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
"I said when I went into the hearing, I've talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, the claim came out, and said, "Did you do that?"
He was determined, convinced, unambiguous.”
Graham's voice, however, seems unshakable.
"I've already decided on Brett Kavanaugh and it would take a dynamite charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she names couldn't verify it.
That was 36 years ago.
I don’t see anything new changing.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that features a hugely impressive line-up of stars performing and an equally impressive mission; to fight world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people pilgrim to Central Park’s Great Lawn, not only to enjoy artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event’s real goal: to fight extreme poverty by 2030.
According to a 2012 statement, the Global Citizen Festival is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to fight poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
To get a free ticket to the event (if you weren’t ready to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers would perform a series of tasks, or “actions” such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, calling or in other meaningful ways help raise awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been with 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to convince people to act, or is it just about so-called “clicktivism” — people who feel they’re making a real difference by signing an online application or writing a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has registered more than 19 million “documents” from its supporters who have fought for a variety of goals.
It states that these measures have helped to spur world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements stemming from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or funded.
The group estimates that the assets collected so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the most important commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership between investors and actors committed to “helping children develop to their full potential,” promising to give Rwanda $35 million to help combat malnutrition in the area after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens, just like you, we can make social injustice as malnutrition is a footnote in history,” Tracey Ullman, the ambassador for the partnership, told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 measures were taken requiring the UK to improve the diet for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the project, Power of Nutrition, which includes diet programs targeting 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the common questions on its website: "What makes you think that we can fight extreme poverty?"
Answered Global citizen: "It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who perform at this year’s New York event, hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use its fleet in a "blockade" to block Russian energy exports, Interior Minister says
The government can “if needed” resort to its fleet to prevent Russian energy players from entering the markets, including in the Middle East, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria – especially where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government – is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I think they’re in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, just like they do in Eastern Europe, the southern parts of Europe,” he said.
And according to him, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, with our fleet, to ensure that the sea routes are kept open and, if necessary, to apply a blockade, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants in the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that calls itself the “energy consumer’s voice” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they really are the same.
"The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less to exploit and replace fuels," he said, referring to Russia as a "day-slide" with an economy that relies on fossil fuels.
The statements come after the Trump administration has aimed to increase exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, in order to replace Russia, the far cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, the Trump administration’s officials, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin Moscow’s “prisoner.”
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double its existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
They argue that Washington’s opposition to the project is driven only for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position was backfired by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading trade association, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has urged the United States to stay away from the EU’s energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I strongly dislike a third party disrupting our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take a "decent thinker" if she's going to run for president in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would take a "decent reflection" on her participation in the US presidential election after the midterm election.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running for office.
“It’s time for women to get to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes a woman at the top,” she said.
"After November 6th, I will take a lot of thought to run for president."
Warren weighed in on President Donald Trump during the city hall meeting, saying he "tapped this country in the wrong direction.
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing for our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been outspoken in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, “Of course, we need an FBI investigation before we vote.”
However, a vote released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren’s own supporters did not believe she would run for office in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "true" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run, according to a survey conducted by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The survey showed more support for a candidacy by former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent for a potential candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed with regard to a potential 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin cites Track Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“What my own son is going through, what he’s going through now that he’s back, I can relate to other families experiencing PTSD and some of the trauma that our soldiers are returning with,” she told the audience at a gathering for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest “the elephant in the room” and said of his son and other war veterans that “they are coming back as other people, they are coming back hardened, they are coming back wondering if there is respect for it that their colleagues, soldiers and pilots and all other members of the military, have given to the country.”
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with domestic violence against a woman, attempting to obstruct a report of domestic violence and gun possession in drunk state, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, as well as the District of Columbia support the challenge of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a judicial review of a new U.S. policy denying asylum to victims fleeing gang-related violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district filed a friend-of-the-court application on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenges the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the policy has not been disclosed.
She said her partner “and his violent gang member sons” beat her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was imprisoned in Texas.
States lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, countries that produce a large number of asylum seekers, as nations facing major gang and domestic violence problems.
The new US asylum policy amended a 2014 immigration decision that allowed illegal immigrants to seek asylum to escape domestic violence.
The District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
“Federal law requires all asylum applications to be assessed on the basis of specific facts and circumstances to which the claim relates, and such a provision is contrary to that principle,” according to the friend-of-the court report.
Lawyers further argued in the report that policies that deny immigrants’ entry are damaging the U.S. economy, arguing that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “deliver necessary labor.”
In June, Justice Secretary Jeff Sessions ordered judges in asylum cases to cease granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said when the policy was announced on June 11.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems - even all the serious problems - that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue operations in Palu as the death toll doubles in the search for survivors
For the survivors, the situation was becoming more and more gloomy.
"It feels very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who comforted her febrile boy in an evacuation center in the city of Palu.
"The ambulance is picking up dead bodies all the time.
Clean water is a scarce commodity.”
The residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, roaming through water damaged possessions and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, which were injured in the 7.5 earthquake, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered from a broken back and shoulder, rested outside Palu's Army Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to continued strong aftershocks.
With tearful eyes, he told me that the violent earthquake shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We couldn't escape.
I was pushed into the ruins of the wall, I think,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, and then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. ambassador accuses China of “bullying” with “propaganda ads”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in an American daily about the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China Daily paying a supplement to the Des Moines Register — the state’s best-selling newspaper — after accusing China of trying to participate in the U.S.’s 6th congressional election, which China denies.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing tried to interfere in US elections marked what US officials told Reuters is a new phase in an escalating campaign from Washington intended to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to use advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war with raised tariffs on each other’s imports.
China’s retaliation tariffs early in the trade war were designed to affect exporters in states like Iowa that support Trump’s Republican party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a debate article in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, “now is doubling the bullying by posting propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“The government of China uses America’s dear tradition of freedom of expression and a free press to spread propaganda by publishing paid advertisements in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, in the newspaper kiosk on the street here in Beijing you will find a limited number of dissenting voices and will not see any true reflection of the different views that the Chinese people may have about China’s troubled economy, because the media is controlled with an iron hand by the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers nobbled the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans frighten women voters ahead of midterm election by Kavanaugh fiasco, analysts warn
With many top Republicans defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh facing multiple allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned there will be a setback, especially from women, in the upcoming election.
The feelings around this have been extremely high, and most Republicans have already shown where they stand in the election.
It’s not possible to turn back the clock,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts Senator Jeff Flake’s (R-Arizona) last attempt at an FBI investigation will be enough to reassure angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn.
On Friday morning, the demonstrators shouted “November is coming!” as they demonstrated in the hall of the Senate building when Republicans controlling the Court Committee chose to go ahead with Kavanaugh’s nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go to the ceiling," Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst, told the news site.
"People say it's already been loud, it's true.
But it could be higher, especially among still indefinite female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who, even though they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony with allegations of sexual assault against the nominated candidate for the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that a setback could follow if Republicans pushed through the confirmation.
"This has become a confused mess for the GOP," Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee's vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh gets through, it's also about how Republicans have handled this and how they've treated her," Guy Cecil, head of Priorities USA, a group that helps Democratic election campaigns, told the news channel.
But Americans in general seem to be divided about who to believe in in the wake of Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimony, and the latter seems to be the one they believe in the most.
A recent YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed in Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh was likely or definitely lying during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Under pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as those of at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate court committee on oath last week that Kavanaugh violently attacked her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court exposed his genitals to her while they attended a party during their time as students at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is a company based on Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people get access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is “world domination.”
“We have to do it now,” he said about the startup company.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “personal online data store” or a POD.
It can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser at the same time.
What is unique about the personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user who can access what kind of information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data.”
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company’s CEO John Bruce, is that the company should bring the resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some software developers to work on the project, and a group of volunteer encoders.
As of this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to “Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change where all business models are put at the helm overnight.
"We're not asking them for permission."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web created by Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and head of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic about this new era of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Priest rewarded with Victorian Cross during World War I celebrated
The only clergyman in the Church of England to have been awarded a Victoria Cross during World War I is now celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt. Col. Reverend Bernard Vann received the award for his actions during the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he had been awarded the British military's most prestigious award.
A memorial stone was uncovered by his two grandchildren during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" that the stone would be revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather was awarded the prize.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lt Col Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under heavy fire from field and machine guns."
He later rushed up to the shooting line and led the line forward with "great bravery" before solely deciding the battle.
Lt. Col. Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I could never live up to, but something I am very humble to.”
He and his brother Dr James Vann also laid down a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "felt very honored to play a part in the parade" and added that "a true hero's courage is demonstrated by the support that will be given by many people".
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206 and instead got to see Greta Gris
Imagine this, you’ve stayed up all night to see Bellator 206 just to be denied watching the main event.
The show from San Jose featured 13 matches, including six on the main card and was shown live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet, British viewers were surprised when the show suddenly changed to Greta Gris.
Many were not impressed after staying awake until the early hours of the morning to watch the game.
A fan on Twitter described the program change to a cartoon children's program as "a sick joke."
“It was the government’s decision that the content wasn’t appropriate that early in the morning, so they had to switch to children’s programs,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s vice president of marketing and communications when asked about the broadcast.
"Greta pig, yes"
Bellator’s CEO Scott Coker said they will be working on their scheduling to better include UK viewers in the future.
“I think we’ll be able to find a solution in terms of the replay,” Coker said.
"But it's six in the morning on a Sunday there and we won't be able to solve this until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, the change of program upset many.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
In fact, it was a state issue.
I can promise that it won’t happen next time.
We will show five matches instead of six - as we normally do. We took water over our heads in our quest to please the fans.
This is an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" due to sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he felt inferior to his peers during his upbringing because of his sexuality - but that also spurred him to become successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize he wasn’t like everyone else until he went to high school.”
When speaking in the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said he cared less about winning the Olympics after becoming a parent.
The popular show's regular host, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off due to illness.
During his one-off appearance on Laverne's first show, Daley tells how he felt "less worth" than others during his childhood, because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said, “This feeling of feeling less worth and feeling different has been a real source of the power and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “someone,” he said, so that he didn’t betray everyone when they eventually found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile advocate of LGBT rights, taking advantage of his appearance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to convince more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he took the floor because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without restrictions and wanted to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said his fall in love with a man – American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – “came as a surprise.”
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
“When you go through so much at such a young age” – he attended his first Olympics at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later – he said it was hard to find someone of the same age with similar life experience.
The couple became parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole life perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it was all about winning gold," he said.
“But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said Dad didn’t accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he had asked was if they got their tickets to the 2012 London Olympics – where he wanted to sit in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him, you won't be able to sit on the front row, Dad," he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn’t until he had actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally admitted he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I just knew this was what I had dreamed of my whole life — to dive in front of a home crowd at an Olympic arena, there was no better feeling,” he said.
It also inspired his first song selection - Proud by Heather Small - a song that had followed him up to the Olympics and that still gave him tremors.
Desert Island Discs will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson out of shape on the bench during Saturday's Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will break a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but then he must fix the shape to avoid an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played for the 12th time in a row, was benched by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of events, as he has often been for the United States, the five-time winner spent his day between acting cheerleaders and practicing his game in the hopes of getting a chance to show off his ability.
He has never been the straightest of drivers, not even at the peak of his career and the 48-year-old is not in shape in front of the tough course at Le Golf National, where the long ruff often penalizes misses hard.
It’s not just the course that deters, in the ninth game on Sunday, Mickelson meets champion Francesco Molinari, who together with novice Tommy Fleetwood won all four games this week.
If the Americans, who are 4 points below before the 12 singles matches, have a headwind at the start, Mickelson’s match could be crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, not because he could say much else.
“He completely understood the role he had today, gave me a pat on the back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“His self-confidence is not wrong.
He is a celebrity and he has contributed so much to these teams in previous seasons and over the past week.
“I probably didn’t think he would be able to play two games.
I thought he could do more, but now it's what it is, and we'll have to settle for it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson passed Nick Faldo's record for the most Ryder Cup games played.
It could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never fully lived up to the heights of his individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, but Furyk said his presence brought other qualities to the team.
“He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, he’s quick, he likes to joke with people and he’s a good guy to have on the team,” he explained.
“I also think the younger players enjoyed playing against him this week, which was fun to see.
He adds so much more than just games.”
The European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great leadership may soon be a mere memory.
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead in the last day singles in the Ryder Cup can quickly turn into an unpleasant experience.
Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballestero held a five-point advantage over the Americans but ultimately won by the smallest margin possible with the result 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2–131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You'll be reminded that we led big at Valderrama, we led big at Brookline where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won with difficulty," said Bjorn (in the photo) after seeing the 2018 class win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday and leads 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will prove to me and everyone on the team that this is not over.
Tomorrow we give it all.
Going out and doing everything right.
This is not over until we see the point on the board.
Our goal is to try to win this trophy and that is where our focus is.
I’ve said it all the time, I’m focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we’re well aware of what’s waiting on the other side – the best players in the world.”
Björn was pleased with his players’ performance on a tough golf course, adding: “I would never be able to do this myself.
Tomorrow there are new challenges.
Tomorrow it is the individual achievements that matter and that is a completely different thing.
It’s fun to be out with a partner when it’s going well, but when you’re out there on your own, your ability as a golfer is fully tested.
That’s the message you need to convey to the players, to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he also has to go and get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bear, opponent Jim Furyk will want players to perform better individually than they did as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of major reversals in the final days of a competition, both in the winning team in Brookline before ending as a loser when Europe drove "Miracle at Medinah".
"I remember every fucking word of it," he said in response when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, had gathered his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you would like to go out as fast as at Brookline, as at Medinah.
When the pace starts in one direction, there will be a lot of pressure on these mid-games.
We made our line-up and placed the guys as we wanted to, you know, create some magic tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the fight and faces Rory McIlroy in the top game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter face the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
"I joined this group of guys in this order because I think it's enough all the way," said Bjorn about his single choices.
Germany's new warship postponed again
The German Navy's newest frigate would have been launched in 2014 to replace Cold War warships, but it will not be launched until at least next year due to faulty systems and high costs, local media reported.
Commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the lead ship of the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quotes a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the fleet as early as 2014, but the problems that arose after delivery were fatal for the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered by the fleet in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen frigates.
They will include a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and naval missiles, as well as some stealth techniques, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to station the newest frigates for up to two years without contact with home ports.
But continuous delays mean that the pioneering warships – which allow Germany to project power abroad – are already obsolete when they are put into operation, Die Zeit writes.
The fateful F125 frigate made headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into operation and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyards in Hamburg.
This was the first time the fleet returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media reported a number of important "software and hardware failures" that rendered the warship worthless if used on a combat mission.
Software deficiencies were particularly important because ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half of the crew of older Bremen-class frigates.
It also emerged that the ship has a significant excess weight, leading to deterioration in performance and limiting the Navy's ability to perform future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Apart from faulty hardware, the entire project’s price tag – including crew training – also becomes a problem.
It is said to have amounted to staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - compared to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion in the initial stage.
Problems affecting the latest frigates become particularly important in light of the latest warnings that Germany's naval power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament’s Defence Committee, admitted that the fleet is actually “starting to lack of fully equipped ships”.
The official said that this is a growing problem as old ships are being dismantled but no replacement ships were provided.
He regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the navy.
National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of Bats
New research conducted on a property in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their hunt for food.
We hope that the results will shed new light on the behavior of unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland, will follow southern and dwarf pistils as well as brown borrowed and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of bat sounds and which species do what.
A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed area picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation advisor for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important to bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as the creation of meadows and how best to maintain forest land for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the UK have declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects nests and loss of habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can aircraft and certain chemical treatments of building materials as well as attacks from domestic cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technology to find insects and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
The organization has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, review nests, and sometimes perform rescue operations.
The organization has also established Scotland’s first and only dedicated bat reserve at the Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
Property manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal area for them.
"Here at Threave, we have a good area for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, lots of veteran trees and a variety of favorable habitats.
But there’s a lot about bats that’s still unknown, so the work we do here and on other properties helps us understand more about what they need to thrive.
He stresses the importance of searching for bats before performing maintenance within real estate, as it is possible that accidental destruction of a single nest could kill up to 400 females and young, and possibly wipe out an entire population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, disturb or disturb them or destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species, we don't know how their populations are."
Ronaldo rejects rape sentence while his lawyers threaten to sue the German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape allegations against him "fake news" and says people "want to market themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
Portugal's and Juventus forward have been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, at a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a Live video on Instagram, Ronaldo dismissed the reports as "fake news" when he spoke to his 142 million followers, just hours after the claims were reported.
"No, no, no, no.
What they said today was fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
“They want to market themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be known by using my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a lucky man and all good," said the player, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over allegations they have called "an unlawful reporting of suspicions of privacy," according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for “moral injury to an amount equal to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident was reported to have taken place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her he was "99 percent" a "good guy" betrayed by the "last percent".
According to the documents, Ronaldo had confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was with consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took photographs of her injuries at a hospital, but later agreed to a settlement because she felt "fearful of retaliation" and was worried about "being humiliated in public".
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to cancel the settlement as she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged assault, and this summer he moved to Italian giant Juve in an agreement of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: UK 'will forever regret' losing car manufacturers
Britain “would regret it forever” if it lost its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was “disturbing” that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, they will temporarily cease production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer announced that the effects of delays at the border in the event of no contract being concluded could result in job losses.
The Burnaston plant – which manufactures Toyota’s Auris and Avensis – produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
"My opinion is that if the UK leaves the EU by the end of March, we will see production stops at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota CEO at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers have communicated their concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main problems relate to what car manufacturers say are risks to the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is operated on a “just-in-time” basis, with parts coming every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars ordered.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29, it could lead to border disruptions that the industry says can lead to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day’s consumption in stock at its Derbyshire factory, the company said, and hence production would be forced to be stopped.
Clark said Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU is "exactly calibrated to avoid border checks".
"We need a deal. We want the best deal that enables, as I say, not only success at the moment to be appreciated now, but for us to seize this opportunity," he said on BBC Radio 4's program Today.
“The statements from not only Toyota but other manufacturers are that we absolutely need to be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term warned that increased costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the head of the Unite trade union at the factory, said that his members are increasingly worried: "My experience is that these jobs will never come back.
A government official said: "We have presented an accurate and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House says
Donald Trump's meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "shot in another week" while the fight against the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the elections, relations between Trump and Russia, and the president’s potential obstacle to justice.
Whether Trump will fire the Deputy Attorney General, thereby endangering Mueller’s independence, has fueled Washington’s whims for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing eavesdropping equipment to record conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of deposing the president via the 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday he went to the White House, and reports of his resignation appeared.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was then at the United Nations headquarters in New York, to be held on Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer" not to fire Rosenstein but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a conflict with the Senate Judicial Committee's hearing where Kavanaugh and one of the women who have accused him of sexual irregularity, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh, further delaying a full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, spoke in Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "A date for that has not been set, it could happen this week, or a postponement by a week considering all the other things happening at the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see, and I always like to keep the press up to date.”
Some reporters would dispute that claim: Sanders has not had a press conference from the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences was not due to any disapproval of TV reporters who “play for the gallery,” although she said, “I agree with the fact that they play for the gallery.”
She then said that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
“The president holds more questioning sessions than any president before him,” she said, adding without quoting evidence: “We’ve looked at these figures.”
Conferences will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press gets the chance to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it's infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to do this often and you have seen us do a lot in recent weeks and it will replace press conferences, and you can then ask questions directly to the President of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why, with spontaneous statements and sometimes bizarre appearances in front of the assembled reporters.
Health Minister writes to EU staff at NHS Scotland regarding concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health has written to EU staff working in Scotland’s NHS to express the country’s gratitude and desire to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter less than six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to cover the cost of discontinued status applications for EU citizens working in the country's decentralised public sector.
In the letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal have continued, ahead of decisions that are expected to come in the fall.
But the UK government has also intensified its preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I know that this must be a very worrying time for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to reiterate how much I value the efforts of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and the rest of the world, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health care and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 loss to Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He came to the sideline and just collapsed," Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before being placed on a stretcher carried out for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State representative told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was operated on at the Vanderbilt Medical Center hospital.
Harris added that "there is no information on the type/extent of the injury yet" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year redshirt student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, giving him a season total of 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp tax when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp tax when buying property in the UK, and the extra money will be used to help homeless people, according to the Tory Party's new plans
The measure will neutralize Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters
The increase in stamp tax will apply to those who do not pay tax in the UK
The UK Treasury Department expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp tax when buying property in the UK. The extra money will be used to help homeless people, which will be announced by Prime Minister Theresa May today.
The measure will be perceived as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters with promises of more affordable housing and targeting high-income earners.
The increase in the stamp tax will be levied on individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK. The extra money will give a boost to the government's efforts to combat homelessness.
The additional fee is in addition to the current stamp tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on holiday homes and homes purchased to be rented out. It may be up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance believes that the measure will withdraw up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built properties in London are bought by people living outside the UK, which drives up prices and makes it harder for first-time buyers to get a foot in the housing market.
Many affluent areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become ghost towns due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new move comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in the stamp tax to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused major construction companies of keeping prices up by buying up land without using it, and urged Theresa May to waive quotas on affordable housing to resolve Britain’s “deplorable housing situation.”
Jeremy Corbyn has launched a striking array of proposals for housing reform, including hiring ceilings and an end to evictions without the tenant’s fault.
He also wants to give the municipalities more opportunity to build new homes.
Theresa May said: “Last year I said that I would devote my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream that life will be better for each new generation.
This means solving problems in the housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it may not be right when it is equally easy for people who do not live in the UK, and also for companies based abroad, to buy homes that are too hard-working residents of our country.
For too many people, the dream of owning their home has become just a distant dream, and homelessness is still an unworthy fact.”
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to coach Scotland"
Sunderland leader Jack Ross says his “final goal” is to become Scotland’s coach.
The 42-year-old shooter looks forward to the challenge of breathing life into the club from northeast England, currently in third place in League One, three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I played a match in the B national team and that’s all,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportsound.
“But when I grew up, I watched a lot of Scotland at Hampden with my dad, and that has always attracted me back.
But that chance can only come if I manage a club.”
Ross’s representatives as coaches for Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O’Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former leader of Alloa Athletic says he was not worried about succeeding such established names in such a large club. He has previously declined offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Right now, I’m judging success by the answer to the question, ‘Can I get this club back to the Premier League?’
"This club definitely belongs in the Premier League, given its structure and talents," he said.
“It’s not easy to get there, but I would probably only see myself as successful here if I could get the club back there.”
Ross has only been a coach for three years, after a period as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and a 15-month stay as a member of the Hearts coaching team.
Then he helped Alloa get back from relegation to the third division, lifting St Mirren from being close to relegation to becoming the winner of the championship title the following season.
Ross says he is more satisfied now than ever during his playing career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a crossroads," he recalls, referring to when he took command of Alloa.
“I really thought leadership was right for me, in a completely different way than playing.
It sounds weird, because I had good results and could live on it fairly. Besides, I had some great successes.
But playing can be tough.
There’s a lot you have to go through every week.
There is still stress and pressure at work for me, but exercising feels just right.
I've always wanted to train and now I do. I feel better than I've ever felt in my adult life."

A survey shows that the perfect time to have a beer is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday.
The summer heatwave has meant increased revenue for the country’s struggling pubs, but the restaurant chains have faced greater pressure.
Figures showed that pub and bar groups increased sales by 2.7% in July, but restaurants' revenues decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin of CGA, which compiled the figures, said: “Continuing beautiful weather and the fact that England stayed in the World Cup longer than expected meant that we saw a similar pattern in July compared to June, when pubs went up by 2.8%.
The decrease in restaurants’ turnover by 1.8% in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars that mainly offer drinks showed the absolute best result with figures for the same period last year that had gone up more than the restaurants had gone down.
Pubs offering food also had a hard time in the beautiful weather, although it was not as dramatic as for restaurant owners.
People just seem to want to go out and drink something.
The turnover of managed pubs and bars increased beverage sales by 6.6% that month, and food sales fell by 3%."
Paul Newman of RSM, a food and entertainment analyst, said: “These results are a continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and major sporting events are still the most important factors when it comes to sales in the grocery market.
It is not surprising that the restaurant groups are still experiencing difficulties, although a 4.8% decrease in sales each year is particularly difficult to manage in addition to ongoing cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come more untimely for companies driven by food sales. Time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we have had in August give some much-needed respite."
The total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened establishments, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the fact that fewer new brands are now launched.
The Coffer Peach Tracker for the UK pub and restaurant industry collects and analyzes data on the performance of 47 active groups with a combined turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and is an established benchmark in the industry.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
One study shows that one in five children, sometimes as young as 11 years old, have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school and high school students shows an increase in the number of fake Instagram pages
The result has increased the concern that there is sexual content posted there
20% of students said they had a “main account” that they showed to their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11 years old, create social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school and high school students showed a rapid increase in the number of "fake Insta accounts", a reference to the Instagram photo sharing service.
The result has late on the concern that it is sexual content posted there.
20% of students said they have a clean “main account” that they can show to their parents, and they also have private accounts.
A mother who stumbled upon her 13-year-old daughter’s secret side found a teenager who urged others to “rape me.”
According to the study, conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, 40% of children between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
HMC chairman Mike Buchanan said: “It’s worrying that so many teens are attracted to creating places on the internet where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be "the voice of the athletes" on the board of the Scottish Athletics
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Board of Directors of Scottish Athletics as an external member of the Board of Directors at the Annual General Meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most acclaimed athlete, and Chairman Ian Beattie describes the election as an outstanding opportunity for those leading the sport to benefit from her broad international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh has gained great respect throughout the Scottish, British and international sports world, and we are confident that the athletes in Scotland would benefit greatly from her becoming a member of the board of directors," Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I want to be a voice for the athletes and I hope I can contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, has a total of four Olympic gold medals and is now an expert commentator on the BBC. He lost the ability to go after a mini-stroke.
He tweeted: “Today, a month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that time would tell if I would recover, and to what extent.
It’s been hard work, but I’ve fully recovered, learned to walk again and now I’m doing mobility exercises!
Thank you for all the encouragement!”
Advertising for breast pumps comparing moms with cows sharing the internet
A company that sells breast pumps has caused disagreements on the internet with an ad that compares breastfeeding mothers to cows being milked.
To draw attention to the launch of what is said to be “the world’s first silent portable breast pump,” consumer technology company Elvie has released a music video-inspired commercial with humorous credits to showcase the freedom the new pump gives mothers pumping breast milk.
Four real moms are dancing in a hay-filled barn with cows to a song with lines like, "Yes, I milk myself, but have no tail" and "If you didn't know, this isn't a brook, it's tits."
The refrain continues: "Pump out, pump out, I feed the babies, pump out, pump out, I milk the ladies."
But the commercial, which has been posted on the company’s Facebook page, has caused controversy on the internet.
The film has received 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, and has met mixed reactions from viewers. Many say it sheds light on the dairy industry's "horrors".
“A very bad decision to use cows to market this product.
“Just like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their young are taken from them just a few days after birth.”

Another commented: “You understand that it’s traumatic for both mother and child.
But why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children?"
Another adds: "What a reality-shifted commercial."
Others defend the film, and a woman admits that she thinks the song is "hysterically funny."
“I think this is genius.
I would have gotten one if I was still breastfeeding.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
The commercial is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
This is a brilliant product,” someone wrote.
Another commented: "This is a funny commercial that turns to moms who pump (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feel like 'cushions'."
This is not a film that pays tribute to or condemns the dairy industry.”
At the end of the film, the women reveal that they have all danced with the discreet pump tucked into the bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the fact that many women who pump milk say they feel like cows.
But the Elvie pump is completely quiet, has no cables or tubes and can be worn discreetly in a breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balarin is a co-owner and ECD at Mother, and she says: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between women pumping breast milk and dairy cows, we wanted to shed light on breast pumping and its challenges, while at the same time demonstrating in an entertaining and easily recognizable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump provides.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a two-child mother appeared on the catwalk wearing clothes by designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp near the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has skyrocketed even though the number of people crossing the border each month remains relatively unchanged. This is partly due to the harsh rhetoric and harsh policies put in place by the Trump administration has made it more difficult to place the children with references.
In the past, most of the reference persons themselves have been paperless immigrants, and are afraid to put their own opportunities to stay in the country at risk by declaring themselves willing to accept a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential reference persons and other adult members of the household would be required to provide fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Agency, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to be references for unaccompanied minors.
The Authority later confirmed that 70 % of those arrested were not previously known by law enforcement authorities.
"Almost 80% of the persons who are either themselves reference persons or family members of reference persons are illegally located in the country, and a large proportion of them are criminal aliens.
So we continue to persecute these individuals," Albence said.
In order to speed up the handling of children’s cases, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within one month of their detention, rather than after 60 days, as was formerly the practice, according to staff at the centres.
Many of them are present on video link rather than in person to bring their lawsuit for legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are not deemed to have the right to protection are deported quickly.
The longer children are detained, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbreaks or attempts to escape, according to staff at the shelters and reports that have come from the system in recent months.
Proponents say that concerns are rising at larger facilities like Tornillo, where signs that a child is having difficulty are more likely to be ignored, due to the size of the facility.
They add that if children are moved to the tent town without having enough time to prepare emotionally and say goodbye to friends, the trauma that many are already struggling with can be exacerbated.
Syria demands U.S., French and Turkish “occupation forces” to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the war in the country being in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said that the foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "will be dealt with accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the General Assembly.
Moualem stressed that “the war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He said the government in Damascus would continue to “fight this holy battle until we have freed all Syrian territories” from both terrorist groups and “all illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who mainly train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in the war-torn country.
As for the refugees, Moualem said the circumstances are good for them to come home, accusing “certain Western countries” of “spreading irrational fears” that keep refugees away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return," he said.
“They are politicizing something that should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The US and EU have warned that there will be no aid for reconstruction in Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity to move forward with political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement deterred a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian troops against the province, which has three million inhabitants.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had “clear deadlines,” and expressed hope that a military intervention would be directed against jihadists, including fighters from the Al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who “will be wiped out.”
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government members and members of the opposition, to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set out conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the group's work would be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current Constitution", and warned of interference.
Why Donald Trump will win a re-election
With that logic, Donald Trump would win the 2020 re-election unless his presidency is terminated prematurely by impeachment and scandal, as many liberal viewers probably hope.
In what would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale of a presidency ever!”
There is no indication that the viewers are tired.
Since 2014, best-time viewing figures have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN, and are almost three times as high, 1.6 million, on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at best time, which is an increase from 1.7 million four years ago. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has topped the charts for cable channels with as many as 3.5 million viewers during major news nights.
“This is like a fire that people are attracted to, because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, who runs the show for ABC’s drama Designated Survivor, about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell is a longtime comedy writer and has written "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club." She has a different theory.
She recalls a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he would vote for Donald Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,'" Nell Scovell tells me.
In the chaos there is an entertainment value.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, Washington’s reporting can determine the future of the abortion case, Roe vs. Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the prosperity of the global economy.
Shutting off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Yet it goes beyond being an informed citizen when one has suddenly sat and watched for six hours on an expert panel debating Bob Woodward's use of "deep background sources" for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich bomber jacket ("a garment filled with hybris," as the Washington Post said, Trump bespoke) and the meaning of Storm by Daniel.
I will never see Super Mario the same way again.
“Part of what he’s doing that makes it feel like a reality show is that he’s coming up with something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about the Trump franchise’s rotating cast and daily intrigues.
If you miss a single episode, you will be left behind.
When I spoke to television producer Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sun and 27 degrees outside his house on North Kauai, Hawaii, but he was sitting owl-watching MSNBC while he was recording a CNN broadcast.
He couldn’t work himself out, not when Brett Kavanaugh was to be brought before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was in the balance.
"I remember when we did all those crazy programs in the past and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Money from outside flows into the smoothest race ever before the mid-year elections
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania’s 17th congressional district is receiving a lot of money, thanks to the restructuring of a congressional district that has led two members to compete for the same seat.
This recently outlined Pittsburg suburban district is represented by Democrat Conor Lamb, who took his place in another district at a special election last spring.
Lamb campaigns against another member, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutional changed to the Republicans' advantage.
The contest in the new 17th district has sparked a campaign funding battle between the major party economics sections, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a bare win in a broadly watched special election in March to Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
That seat had been held by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts had given the Democrats a certain lead.
The U.S. Considered Punishing El Salvador for China Support, But Then Backed
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Donald Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and had a hotel in Panama, until the shareholders evicted the Trump organization’s leadership team.
U.S. State Department officials decided to summon the heads of U.S. missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to "new decisions taken to no longer recognize Taiwan," U.S. State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
However, only sanctions were planned against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for drug control and development and financial support.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have hit the Central American country hard with its high unemployment and murder statistics.
As the internal meetings progressed, U.S. and Central American officials launched a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity to follow up on a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step in the right direction to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, effectively putting an end to considerations of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence will now speak at the conference, which is now scheduled to take place in mid-October, which is a sign of how important the presidential administration considers the meeting to be, the diplomats said.
And the three U.S. ambassadors returned silently to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesperson for John Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberations against the promise of anonymity.
Their accounts were confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration who also spoke anonymously.
Study History
The next unavoidable step could be Special Investigator Robert Mueller’s report on Donald Trump’s alleged abuses in court, for which there is now tangible evidence in public records.
Mueller is also reported to direct his investigation into whether Donald Trump’s campaign cooperated with Russia in its attacks on the US election.
If Congress changes the majority, Trump will be held accountable to that assembly just as he prepares to once again run for the election, and perhaps ultimately before a citizen’s jury.
There are many uncertain factors in this, and I do not want to say that Trump will inevitably fall, nor do his colleagues in Europe.
We all have to make different choices, on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how protracted the fight can be.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the Western countries had resisted him and backed the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of bloodshed that followed.
History revolves around such decisive events, and the relentless advance of democracy is either accelerated or slowed down.
Americans are now facing several of these decisive events.
What should we do if Donald Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls what will happen to Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble ever since this newspaper reported that last year he suggested secretly recording the president, speculating that he would not be suitable for office.
Rosenstein says The Times reporting isn't right.
“How are we to respond if the FBI investigation just requested by Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair, or if he is allowed to enter the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that holds Donald Trump accountable?
If we fail in these trials, democracy is facing a dark period.
But I do not think we will fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew and was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial residence.
She survived, immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me to light the Sabbath lights on the table decorated with the swastika.
With that as a legacy, how could I be anything but optimistic about the future?”

Graham Dorrans at Rangers is optimistic about the meeting with Rapid Wien
Rangers will host Rapid Wien on Thursday, knowing that victory against the Austrians after the impressive Spain match against Villarreal that ended in a draw earlier this month will put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G in the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance for the season, until the 2-2 match against Villarreal. But he believes the Rangers can use the result as a springboard to greater success.
“It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team,” said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game believing we could get something, and went away with a point.
Maybe we could have gotten it in at the end, but in general, a tie was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half. We came back in the second half and were the better team.
Thursday is going to be an important night in Europe again.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it will be a tough game. They got a good result in their last game, but if we have the crowd with us we can certainly advance and get a good result.
Last year was very tough, with everything that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club, but now we have a good feeling.
The squad is good and the guys are having fun, the training is good.
Hopefully we can move forward now, put last season behind us and succeed well.”
Women sleep poorly because of fear of retirement savings
Although the participants in the survey had a clear picture of how they want to be cared for, few spoke to their family members about it.
Approximately half of the people who participated in the nationwide study said they had talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% said they had talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t take the step and talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here's how you can start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to take care of you unless you say how you want it in good time.
Work with your counselor and family and discuss where and how you want care. Your choices can have a big impact on the costs.
Get help from your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for the costs.
Your choices of funding for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance solution, a hybrid life insurance solution with cash value to cover costs, or self-insurance with your own funds, if you can afford.
Establish legal documents: Avoid legal disputes from the start.
Establish a health authority, so that you can appoint a trusted person who will oversee your medical care and ensure that the health professional follows your wishes, if you become unable to communicate.
Also consider a power of attorney for your finances.
You then choose a trusted person who can make financial decisions in your place and make sure that your bills are paid if you yourself are unable to.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine that you have an elderly parent who ends up in an emergency medical condition and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write down such details so that you are ready.
“It’s not just the economy that’s at stake, but who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
“What medicines are these?
Who takes care of the dog?
Make sure the plan is ready.”

Category: Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Palu in Indonesia on Friday, according to officials. The death toll is expected to rise.
Communications are excluded, and rescue personnel have not yet been able to obtain any information from the Donggala administrative area, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake. The earthquake measured 7.5 on the Richter scale.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu after the disaster.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, and is located in a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi. The city's population was estimated at 379 800 people in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is an administrative area that stretches along more than 300 km of northwest Sulawesi coast.
The administrative area, which is an administrative region under a province, had in 2017 a population estimated at 299,200 people.
The pillars of the economy of Central Sulawesi are fisheries and agriculture, in particular the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last hundred years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Management Authority.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
Also in 1996, Western Donggala was hit by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Circum-Pacific seismic ring of fire, which is often hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 triggered a tsunami that affected 14 countries. 226,000 people died along the Indian Ocean coasts, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake on the Richter scale struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that struck across the southern coast killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of magnitude 7.5 struck one of the Mentawai islands off Sumatra. A tsunami of up to ten meters was triggered. Dozens of villages were destroyed and around 300 people were killed.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya administrative area of Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as people were reminded of the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people were killed by buildings that collapsed.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok. More than 500 people died, most of them on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested accused of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, a 29-year-old from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, for interfering with a report of domestic violence, and for opposing the arrest, according to a report released on Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a female acquaintance who tried to call the police and report the alleged crimes.
Palin is detained in Mat-Su detention and is being held on a $500 bail to be paid if the suspect violates the bail terms, according to KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, declaring himself "guaranteed not guilty" when he was asked to state his position, according to the TV channel.
Palin is suspected of three less serious Class A offences, which means he may face up to a year’s imprisonment and $250,000 in fines.
He has also been accused of a minor class B crime, which is punishable by one day in jail and $2,000 in fines.
This is not the first time Palin has been accused of crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with violence against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged crime.
The case is now being handled by the Alaska Veterans' Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, interfering with the reporting of domestic violence and of possession of weapons under the influence of that incident.
His girlfriend accuses him of beating her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she linked her son’s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress syndrome, which stems from his military service in Iraq.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of Dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia last Friday.
The earthquake, which measured 7.5 on the Richter scale, triggered a tsunami and has destroyed hundreds of homes.
Electricity and communications are down, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just outside central Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
Movies that show when it hit are now circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami struck across the coast.
Federal prosecutors plead for rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist attack in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are calling for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people. It is a rare punishment that has not been enforced for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a rental truck from the Home Depot construction and interior design chain to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan. He mowed down pedestrians and cyclists in his way at the attack, which took place in October.
To justify a death sentence, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious bodily injuries, according to the letter of intent on the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both charges may result in a death sentence, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov was prosecuted by a federal jury of 22 points, including eight cases of murder to support patronage, which is often used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, as well as assault and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for "extensive planning and intent," the prosecutors said, and at the same time described the way Saipov carried it out as "disgusting, cruel and inhuman".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco injury and loss.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The Southern District of New York has not been prosecuted in a case urging the death penalty for a decade.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was most recently enforced in a federal case in New York in 1953. The married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of stamping for espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were both executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, who is a Uzbek citizen, according to the court documents, showed a lack of regret during the days and months following the attack.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he was happy with what he had done.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired by the attack after watching ISIL videos on his phone.
He also asked for the IS flag to be placed in his hospital room, police said.
He has pleaded not guilty to the 22 charges in the prosecution.
David Patton is one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov. He stated that they are "obviously disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that the decision to invoke the death penalty instead of agreeing to life imprisonment without the possibility of conditional release if the defendant pleads guilty only prolongs the trauma caused by these events to all those involved,” Patton said.
Saipov's team of lawyers had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tories MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be given responsibility for Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's army" today during a protest at the Tories conference.
The former UKIP leader said politicians must "feel the heat" of the EU sceptics when one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested he would lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative member Peter Bone said at the Birmingham march that Britain would have already "resigned" if Nigel Farage had been Brexit minister.
But the challenge facing Theresa May in bringing the deeply divided supporters to reconciliation has been exacerbated by EU-positive Tory members, who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his compromise plan, the Chequers agreement, alive under attack from Brexit supporters, people who want to stay in the Union and the EU itself.
Her allies have insisted that she should push and try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the setback, forcing Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between her package solution and "chaos".
Bone said at a mass meeting organized by the Leave Means Leave organization in Solihull that he wanted to "spool the Chequers deal."
He suggested that Nigel Farage should have been made equal and given responsibilities in the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had stood at the helm, we would have been out by now," he said.
Peter Bone, who represents the district of Wellingborough in Parliament, added: "I will stand up for Brexit, but we have to flush the Chequers agreement".
He clarified his opposition to the EU, saying: "We have not fought world wars to become subjects.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone dismissed the allegations that public opinion would have changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British would have changed their minds and now want to stay is completely untrue."
Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns from the Tory Party was also on the march and spoke to the journalists. "I just want to say, 'The Prime Minister, listen to the people.'
The Chequers agreement is unpopular with the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular in the party and with our electoral workers who are out on the streets making sure we get elected.
Put aside the Chequers deal and start listening."
And she added a sharp message addressed to Theresa May: “Prime Ministers may keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Nigel Farage said at the meeting that politicians must be allowed to "feel the heat" if they should fail the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s about trust between us, that is, the people, and the political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to tell them, ‘We’re not going to let you get away with it.’”
In front of the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, who are close to betraying Brexit, feel the heat.
We are mobilizing the people’s army in this country that gave us victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud Britain.”
At the same time, EU supporters marched through Birmingham and then held a two-hour mass rally in the city centre.
A group of activists waved banners with the text "Tory members against Brexit" after the group launched this weekend.
Labour MP Lord Adonis of the House of Lords mocked the Conservatives for the security issues they encountered with a party app when the conference opened.
“It’s these people who say they can have IT systems in place and all the technology for the Canada plus plus agreement, for frictionless borders and free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a pure farce.
There is no good Brexit,” he added.
Warren Plans a “Real Thinker” to Candidate for President
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would take a "decent thought about running for president" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about his future at a city hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren has often criticized President Donald Trump, and is now running for re-election in November against Republican State Representative Geoff Diehl, who was deputy president of Donald Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She has been the subject of speculation that she may be tackling Donald Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th city hall meeting with voters since Donald Trump took office.
One person asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren replied that it's time "for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government. That means a woman at the top."
A person arrested for the death shooting of the LSU basketball player Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect had been arrested for the death shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Police in Baton Rouge announced that Dyteon Simpson, 20, had been arrested at a press conference at 11:00 p.m. for ET.
They had released a film of the shooting on Friday to help identify a man seen in the pictures.
20-year-old Sims was shot dead near Southern University campus early on Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and eventually died of this," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday via the 247 sports news site.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he had been on the scene and had a gun, and he admitted that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
Sims was a junior player, 198 cm tall and grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 matches with 10 starts last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 rebounds per match.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world championship after team orders gave him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that Mercedes’ team orders would play a major role in the race.
Bottas got a good start and almost hung Hamilton on dry when he defended his position during the first two laps, inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went to the depot first and let Hamilton drive into the back of the group, which should have been crucial.
The Mercedes went to the depot a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went forward after some wheel-to-wheel action where the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside free at the risk of bidding in place after a double move to defend himself in the third curve.
Max Verstappen started in the back row and was seventh at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led a large part of the race and kept the tyres to reach a fast finish and drive over Kimi Raikkonen and be four.
In the end, he came to the depot on the 44th yard but failed to raise the pace during the remaining eight yards when Raikkonen went up in fourth place.
It’s a tough day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman who let me pass.
The team has done an exceptional job and got a one and a two,” Hamilton said.
Really bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a mass rally on Saturday for insisting she has not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated for Supreme Court justice, is accused of sexual assault.
The president, speaking at a mass meeting in West Virginia, did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee; instead, he commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "bad, nasty and lying."
“The only thing that could have happened and the nice thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry, nasty, nasty and liars,” he said.
“You see press releases and leaks and they say, ‘No, I didn’t do that.
I haven't done that.'
Do you remember?
Did you leak, Dianne Feinstein?
Do you remember her answer? 'Did you leak the document?' 'Oh, what?'
Oh, no, no.
I haven't leaked it."
Wait a minute.
'Have we leaked... No, we haven't leaked anything,' he added, imitating the senator.
The letter detailing Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July, and leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak would have come from her office.
"I haven't obscured Ford's allegations, I haven't leaked her story," Feinstein told the committee.
"She asked me to keep this confidential, and I kept it confidential, as she wanted."
But her denial doesn't seem to fit the president, who, during Saturday night's meeting, commented this way: "I'll tell you one thing, that was really bad body language.
She may not have done it, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president continues to support the candidate to the Supreme Court, who has been accused of sexual assault by three women, and he suggested that the Democrats used the accusations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to take back power by all necessary means.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to drive over to get power and control," he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars-Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Belfast Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars sanctioned Friday's loss in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by winning the return game with 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Belfast Giants got an early two-goal lead through Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie signed for the home team before Dwyer re-established the Belfast Giants.
Francois Bouchard signed for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third loss in the Elite League of the season for Adam Keefe's team, who came from behind and beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season for the two teams, and the Belfast Giants had won the three previous matches.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 on assist from Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford gave the assist when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In the intense first period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt delivered to the Cownie who signed at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Belfast Giants were in the lead at the first break when he scored his second goal for the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard signed once again with a goal in power play at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, and he secured the win with his team's fifth halfway through the final period.
The Belfast Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play at home against Milton Keynes at their next match on Friday.
Air traffic controllers died in order for hundreds of people on a plane to escape from earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is now hailed as a hero after his death as he ensured that a plane with hundreds of people on board could take off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Heavy aftershocks continue to plague the area and many are stuck in the rubble in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wildly swaying control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He stayed to make sure Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the runway, could take off safely.
Then he jumped from the control tower when he thought it was going to collapse.
He later died in hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision may have saved hundreds of people's lives, according to Australian television channel ABC News.
“We arranged for a helicopter from Balikpapan on Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
We are devastated to hear this," he added.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the death toll could rise to over a thousand people. The country's disaster relief agency says that there is limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The death toll is believed to continue to increase because there are still many bodies left in the rubble, and many have not been reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson for the agency.
Up to six meters high waves have devastated Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are flying in aid and supplies.
The 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance arrives with dead bodies.
There is little clean water.
Minimarkets are looting everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is struggling to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will face there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived at Palu on Sunday and told the country’s military: “I ask you all to work day and night to complete all tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?” according to CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini reports missing man after plane crashes into lagoon in Micronesia
The airline responsible for the plane that crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia in the Pacific now reports that a man is missing. Earlier, it was said that all 47 passengers and crew had escaped from the sinking plane and were safe.
Air Niugini said in a press release that a male passenger was still missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately answer questions about more details about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water as it attempted to land at the airport on the Chuuko Islands.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that their condition was stable.
It is still unclear what caused the crash and what the course of events looked like.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both stated that the plane landed in the lagoon without reaching the runway.
Some witnesses believed the plane slipped past the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane flew in very low.
"It's extremely good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others managed to wade through waist-deep water to the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said the cabin crew panicked and screamed, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said seamen working nearby to develop a shipyard also helped in the rescue work by using an inflatable boat to drive people ashore before the plane sank in the 30-metre deep water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in accidents involving airlines registered in Papua New Guinea in the past two years, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any of them.
Analysts draw a timeline for the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor's office closed Saturday's plea in the second trial of a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett spoke for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he had used cell phone lists to jiggle together the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers’ movements the night she died.
Rowlett said he had received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the night she died, contradicting his earlier claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the records showed that his cell phone was with Chamber’s cell phone during the time he said he had been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday, saying he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he "lies because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis stated that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile phone lists showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final deployment on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip Hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol thinks hip hop has come a long way from its origins in political messages and tackling social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently gained a boost in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
A black one again?
A nanny in New York sues a couple for dismissal after a "racist" text message
A nanny in New York sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving an incorrect text message from her mother, who complained that she was "a black again".
The couple denies being racist and compares the mood to “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, was horrified when she realized that the new nanny Giselle Maurice was black when she came to her first day of work in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEY NOT A BLACK AGAIN," Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a text message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice, twice.
After realizing her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman was "bad at heart," and fired Maurice, claiming that their former nanny, who was an African-American, had done a bad job and that she was instead expecting a Filipino woman, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for a day's work and sent home by taxi.
Now she sues the couple to get compensation for the dismissal. She requests compensation in the order of $ 350 per day for the job she was initially hired to do, which would be for six months and where she would live with the couple. However, she had no contract.
"I want to show them that you don't do that," she told the New York Post on Friday. "I know it's discrimination."
The couple dismissed the allegations that they were racists, saying that the only straight thing was to terminate Giselle Maurice’s employment. They were worried that they would not be able to trust her when they had insulted her.
"My wife had sent her something she didn't mean.
She's not a racist.
We’re not racists,” Joel Plasco told The New York Post.
But would you entrust your children to someone you would have been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Seriously."
Plasco compared the mood to “extortion” and said his wife would give birth two months later and was in a “very difficult situation.”
“Should I go to such a person?
It's not very nicely done," added investment banker Plasco.
The legal process is still underway, but public opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media and criticized them for their behavior and reasoning.
Paddington publishers didn’t think readers could relate to a talking bear, reveals a new letter
Paddington author Michael Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, commented on the letter as follows: "It's hard to imagine what it was like for a person to read it for the first time before it was published.
It’s very funny, given what we now know about Paddington’s great success.”
She told me that her father, who had worked as a cameraman on the BBC before he was inspired by a little toy bear to write the children's book, had been optimistic when his work was rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the first edition was "bitterly delighted" after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important member of our family," adding that her father was proud in silence of his final success.
"He was quite quiet, and not a boastful person," she said.
"But Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who succeeds in something. You become proud of the child even if it's not you who has accomplished it.
I think he saw Paddington's success a little bit that way.
Even though it was his creation and his imagination, he always gave Paddington himself the glory.
My daughter was going to die, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
When she landed, her daughter had been rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that it was really bad, and that she was not expected to get well," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I received a call from Nad saying that she was going to die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "I love you so much, Tashi, my darling.
I'll be back soon.
I'll come to you.
The medicines that doctors had given her to keep her heart alive slowly ebbed out and left her body.
She had died just before and now everything was turned off.
I just had to sit there and wait and know that all this was happening.
I could not cry or scream or cry, because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to get myself together.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, who were completely unaware of the difficult trial she was going through.
"Nobody knew about it," she said.
"I bent my head down, and the tears ran all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but on the flight I felt an overwhelming compassion for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Lamenting women put up postcards to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones due to suicide work to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have put up cards on a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and phone numbers to call for support.
Sharon Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he started suffering from depression, and took his life when he was 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel as bad as I do every day,” she says.
Sharon Davis is 45 years old and lives in Lydney. She tells us that her son was a promising chef who had an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew who he was because of his smile.
They said his smile brightened the room."
But he stopped working before he died, because he was “in a very dark place.”
Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, was the one who found his sibling after he committed suicide in 2014.
Sharon Davis says, "I worry about consequences all the time."
Sharon Davis created the cards “to let people know that there are people you can go and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t sit still, talk about it.”
Kelly Humphreys, who has been friends with Sharon Davies for years, lost her partner for 15 years, Mark, some time after his mother's death.
“He hadn’t said he felt depressed or depressed or anything,” she says.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed that he was behaving differently.
On Christmas Day, he was at the bottom, and when the kids opened their Christmas presents, he had no eye contact with them or anything."
She says his death was a very hard blow to them, but they have to get through it.
It's tearing us apart.
But we all have to fight.”

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is at stake when the FBI opens an investigation.
"I thought that if we could achieve something similar to what he requested - an investigation that is limited in time and scope - maybe we could get some agreement," said Jeff Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would "split" due to deep-rooted bias.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate the case?
Their reluctance depends entirely on the timing.
The midterm elections will take place in just five weeks, November 6, and if Republicans make a bad election, as is expected, they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the man they want elected to the country's highest court.
George W. Bush has taken the phone and called senators to influence them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for Bush in the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was the personal secretary of George W. Bush.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are now 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the deadlock and confirm his election to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors "slumps" under Kim
The number of North Koreans defecting to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, who quotes data from the South Korean Ministry of Reunification, says that 1,127 people resigned last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said harsher border controls between North Korea and China and higher fees for human traffickers are important reasons.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of defectors from North Korea are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and whose border is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China sees the defectors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often sends them back by force.
The relationship between North and South, which technically is still at war with each other, has improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focusing on the stalled negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This happened after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in general terms to work for the Korean Peninsula to become free of nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, accused the US sanctions of the lack of success since then.
"Without trust in the United States, there is no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances we absolutely cannot disarm ourselves unilaterally first," Ri said in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and says he is inappropriate to serve on the Supreme Court
Minority leader in the House, Nancy Pelosi, called the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and said he was temperamentally inappropriate to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi’s comments came in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had behaved like that, she would be called 'hysterical'," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh became emotional when he denied allegations of sexually assaulting Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh became very emotionally touched, and from time to time he almost screamed and the voice stuck as he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the committee, saying the accusations against him were a “grotesque and coordinated murder of character” organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, as it showed that he is biased to the detriment of the Democrats.
"I think he is disqualifying himself with his statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked whether she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he was elected, and whether the Democrats would get a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I can say this - if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not only inappropriate to sit in the Supreme Court, but also to work in the court he's in right now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the Washington D.C. Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about what decisions Kavanaugh might make against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion case Roe vs. Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would change certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
It is not a time for a hysterical and biased person to sit in court and expect us all to applaud,” Pelosi said.
Women have to stand up.
It’s a just criticism, months and years of anger boiling over, and she can’t get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
And she continued, "I got good help from a woman who was CEO somewhere. She said she also cried when she got angry, but had developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying she said to the person she was talking to, 'You might think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she continued.
I thought it was brilliant.”
Tears are allowed to get out of anger in part because they are often fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories from one of my first jobs in a male-dominated office, where I once cried out of indescribable anger, was that I was caught in the collar by an elderly woman. It was a cold boss that I had always been a bit afraid of, and she dragged me into a staircase.
"Don't let them see you cry," she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sorry and they’re happy that they managed to push you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was caught with an unmarried affair on a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew from the campaign, a very frustrated Schroeder felt that there was no reason not to investigate the idea of running for president himself.
"It wasn't a well-thought-out decision," she said with a laugh to me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates. The last thing they needed was one more.
Someone called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Since she was late, she lagged behind with the pengain collection, promising not to enter as a candidate if she did not earn $2 million.
It was a project doomed to failure.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men only gave her $250.
"Do they think I'll get a discount?" she asked.
When she announced in a speech that she would not launch a formal presidential campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions, gratitude to those who had supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism, that the vote stalled.
"You could have thought I had a nervous breakdown," Schröder recalls, referring to the reactions of the press.
“You could have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, ‘What are they going to write on my tombstone?’
'She cried?'"
Why the US-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The opening tyranny of the US-China trade war was deafening. The war is far from over, but the split between the countries could benefit the Chinese government in the long term, according to experts.
US President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by imposing tariffs on key Chinese exports such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation came this week, with new tariffs on goods worth $200 billion, meaning in practice that half of all goods entering the United States from China are customs duties.
Beijing has responded with the same coin every time, recently throwing between 5% and 10% charges on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has pledged to match US action, and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to step down in the foreseeable future.
Getting Washington to back down means bending to demands, but publicly crawling for the US would be far too embarrassing for China’s President Xi Jinping.
However, experts believe that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the pressure from the US trade war could provide a positive support for China in the long term, by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“A swift political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create conditions for economic panic in either country, and it’s actually far more dangerous than viewers have previously wanted to admit,” said Abigail Grace, a research assistant with a focus on Asia at the Center for New American Security.
Syria "ready" for returning refugees, according to foreign minister
Syria says it is ready to accept voluntarily returning refugees and calls for help to rebuild the country, which is in ruins after the more than seven-year war.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country are now improving.
"The situation on the ground today is more stable and secure, thanks to our successes in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rebuild the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
There are now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
According to Al-Moualem, the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that it does not receive conditional support or assistance from countries that have supported the uprising.
Europe resigned with victory in the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europa has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won again when the Danish captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn's team achieved the 14.5 points required to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight hard for most of the tournament, ended up in the water at the knockout of the 16th hole Par 3 course, losing to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shone in all rounds and became one of four players to ever make 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format was introduced in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was knocked out 5 & 4 by the European team’s lowest-ranked player, Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's top-rated player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 & 1 against Ian Poulter from England, who may have made his last Ryder Cup.
Spanish Sergio Garcia, a veteran with the eight Ryder Cup behind him, became the tournament’s most successful European ever with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
I am so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to win back the victory.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could be of help," said a touched Garcia after the European team's victory.
He handed over the relay to his compatriot John Ram who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in singles on Sunday.
"What an incredible pride, to beat Tiger Woods. I grew up watching him," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France, and now has the score 13-21-3 for his career in the Ryder Cup.
A remarkable statistic for one of the world’s best players ever, who has won 14 major titles, which has only been surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled throughout the weekend to find the fairway, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-class golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after the team's disappointing performance: "I'm proud of these guys, they've fought.
It was time this morning when we raised the temperature in Europe.
We took the fight.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played really well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the U.S. PGA Tour and our Ryder Cup committee, and we're going to move on.
I love these 12 guys and am proud to be captain.
You have to bow and bow.
They played better than us.”
Algae flowering: Lower levels in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fisheries and Wildlife Commission shows a general decrease in concentrations of algae bloom for parts of the area around Tampa Bay.
According to the Commission, uneven blooms are reported in the areas around the major municipalities of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, which may indicate decreased levels.
The algae bloom extends along more than 20 miles of coastline, from northern Pinellas to southern Lee.
Spots can be seen about one and a half miles out into the sea outside the big municipality of Hillsborough, but in fewer places compared to last week.
Algae blooming has also been observed in the large municipality of Pasco.
Medium concentrations in or off the coast of Pinellas have been reported over the past week; off the coast of Hillsborough low to high concentrations, background concentrations to high concentrations in Manatee, background concentrations to high concentrations in or off the coast of Sarasota, background concentrations to medium concentrations in or off the coast of Lee, and low concentrations in Collier.
Reports of respiratory irritation continue to come from the major municipalities of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
There were no reports of respiratory irritation in northwest Florida last week.
