The Germans are worried about ‘looking like fools’.
Uggur is in some councillors due to a proposal to have their title changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Welsh Parliament).
Concerns arise because of a plan to change the name of the council to the Welsh parliament.
Leaders from all walks of life are concerned that it could make them laugh.
A working-class official said his party was concerned that “it rhymes with Twp and Pwp.”
For readers who live outside of Wales: in Welsh, twp means mad and pwp means faeces.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party said the group was "dissatisfied" and made other proposals for the name.
A Welsh Conservative Councillor said his party had an "open mind" about the name change, but pointed out that there was not much difference between the word MWP and Muppet.
In this context, it can be noted that the Welsh character w is presented in the same way as u in Icelandic.
The Council, which is now working on a bill to submit the name changes, said: “The final decision on all names of members of the Council will, of course, rest with the members themselves.”
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Council the power to change its name.
In June, the Council published the results of a public survey that showed great support for calling the Council the Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of councillors, the council chose the WMP (Welsh Parliament Members), but the MWP received the most support from the public in the surveys.
According to the news, administrators are now making other proposals, but it could be difficult to reach an agreement for the chairman of the council, Elin Jones, who is to file a bill on the changes within a few weeks.
The reform proposal will also include other changes to the work of the Council, including rules on the dismissal of officers and the organisation of the committee system.
Councillors will be able to pay a final vote on their title when the debate on the bill begins.
Macedonians to vote in elections for name change in the country
Voters will vote on Sunday whether to change the name of their country to “Republic of North Macedonia.”
This case was put to the vote in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long argued that the name of its northern neighbours is equivalent to a claim on its territory and has often objected to their applications for membership of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who disagrees with the name change vote, has said he will not see the elections as valid.
However, supporters of the vote, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have said that the name change is simply the price that needs to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
Church Bells of St. Martin's Sounds Churches in Harlem Have Difficulties
“The elderly people I’ve talked to told me that in the past you could find a bar and a church on every corner of the street,” Adams said.
“Nothing can be found here today.”
He said it's understandable that bars are diminishing.
“People have different ways to meet,” he said.
“Bars are no longer the centers of the neighborhood where people come together regularly.”
As far as the churches are concerned, he is concerned that the money earned from the sale of assets will not last as long as leaders expect, “and sooner or later they will be back on track.”
He added that possibly churches would be replaced by residential buildings that would be full of people who will not help save the remaining shelters in the area.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and consequently will speed up the closure of these churches forever, because it is unlikely that most people who move to these apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white churches before Harlem became the center of blacks - the Metropolitan Community Church was built in 1870, and the St. Martin's Church a decade later.
The original white methodist church moved away in the 1940s.
A black community that had worked nearby took over the building.
The Black Church took over St. Martin’s Church under the guidance of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who initiated the circumvention of the shopkeepers at 125th Street, Harlem’s main shopping street, who were desirous of hiring or hiring black workers.
The building was severely damaged by a fire in 1939, but members of the congregation of Reverend Johnson made plans to rebuild it and also had the clock built.
Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Reverend Johnson, proudly called the clock “the clock of the poor people.”
The expert who played the clock card in July called it a different name: “Cultural Fund” and “a unique historical instrument.”
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first clock game in the world played by black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, but he moved on to the larger clock game at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin had no one else in his place.
Over the past few months, numerous architects and contractors have made their way to St. Martin, some hired by church leaders and others by the bishopric.
The Council, which oversees the parish and is appointed church leaders, wrote to the diocese in July, expressing its concern that the diocese "would endeavour to transfer the costs to" the Council, even though it had not participated in the recruitment of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the bishopric.
Shark wounds 13-year-old boy who succumbed to lobster in California
According to authorities, a 13-year-old boy was attacked by a shark and injured on Saturday when the boy was diving for lobster in California on the first day of the lobster fishing season.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then rode along with a group of others to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was just an excitement to catch lobster, but then “he realized the boy was shouting, ‘I was bitten!
I was bitten!"
All the bones on him were torn up," Hammel said of what he saw when he came to the boy.
"I shouted to everyone to get out of the water, 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hammel added.
The boy was taken by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he is seriously injured.
It is not known what type of shark attacked the boy.
The chief of the coast guard, Larry Giles, said at a media conference that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but he was not of a dangerous species of shark.
Giles added that the victim had suffered serious injuries to the upper part of the body.
The authorities closed shore access from Ponto Beach beach in Casablad to Swami’s beach in Encinitas for 48 hours, for research and security purposes.
Giles said there were over 135 different species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plan to harass Britain's cosmetics market
Sainsbury’s intends to compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with mall-style cosmetics shelters and specially trained assistants.
This is part of the plan to enter the UK’s <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion cosmetics market, which is worth <0xC2><0xA3>2 billion and is growing steadily as sales of fashion and household products are decreasing. Larger cosmetic shelves will be tested in 11 stores across the country and will be installed in more stores next year.
Investing in cosmetics is part of a way for supermarkets to use shelves that were previously used by televisions, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury’s says it intends to double its range of cosmetics into up to 3,000 product types, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Current products from L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also get increased space with marked areas similar to those found in stores like Boots.
The store also intends to resume sales of its Boutique cosmetics range so that the majority of the products are vegan-friendly, but younger consumers are increasingly demanding it.
In addition, the fragrance shop Fragrance Shop will test product stands in two Sainsbury’s stores, the first opened in Croydon, south London, last week and the next will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and the increased tendency of consumers to buy small amounts of food daily in convenience stores mean that supermarkets need to put more effort into getting people to come to them.
Sainsbury’s CEO Mike Coupe said the stores would look more and more like shopping malls as the retail chain tries to fight low-cost retailers Aldi and Lidl with more services and products other than food.
Sainsbury’s has put Argos stores in hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of Habitat stores since the two chains were purchased two years ago. According to them, it has increased sales and made purchases more profitable.
The first attempt of the store to revive its cosmetics and pharmaceutical departments was not successful.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots around 2000, but it ended as a result of a dispute over how to share the proceeds of drug sales in the supermarkets.
The new policy comes after Sainsbury’s sold its 281 pharmaceutical stores to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds pharmaceutical stores, at <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
According to the policy, Lloyds will play a role in these plans by adding a wide range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Sainsbury’s Marketing Director Paul Mills-Hicks said: “We’ve transformed the look of our cosmetic shelves to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in special training for staff who will be available for advice.
Our brand range is designed to meet all needs. Enchanting environments and convenient locations make us an exciting cosmetics store that transforms old shopping habits."
Peter Jones is "furious" after Holly Willoughby quits <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Peter Jones, the star of the series Dragons Den, became "very angry" after television presenter Holly Willoughby quit his <0xC2><0xA3>11 million contract with his company to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for their home and accessories brand, Truly.
The company had been similar to Goop, the brand name of Gwyneth Paltrow.
Willoughby, a 37-year-old star on the show This Morning, announced her decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has left Peter Jones, the star of Dragons’ Den, with a sore forehead by quitting her involvement in a popular lifestyle company at the last minute to focus on new and profitable deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones has been “suspicious” at a difficult meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of her business in Marlow, Buckinghamshire when the popular TV lady admitted she didn’t have enough time for the Truly home and accessories brand because of the new deals worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million.
The company has been similar to Goop, the Gwyneth Paltrow brand, and was intended to double Willoughby's assets, but their estimated value is <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was going to withdraw from Truly, Jones flew from the UK to stay at one of her many summer homes.
A source said: “Truly was the longest on Holly’s list of priorities.
This was to be her future project that would earn her income for the next two decades.
Her decision to quit was completely open to all.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so short that the line went to market.
There is a full stock of products at Marlow Headquarters that are ready to go on sale.”
Experts believe that the elimination of This Morning, one of Britain’s most popular stars, could cost the company millions due to huge product investments, ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and household goods, and potentially cause further delays in the product line going on sale.
It could also be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been friends of Jones and Tara Capp, his wife, for a decade.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined them as chairman in March.
The couples spend their summer vacations together and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin, a television producer.
Willoughby will be the official representative of the brand M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the show manager of I’m a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, “We don’t want to say anything about his business.”
It was a difficult time, and then we fell in love.
He responded to the criticisms he received from the media, for saying something that many would consider inappropriate for the president, and for being so positive in the eyes of the North Korean leaders.
Why has Trump given up so much?
Trump said and imitated a reporter’s voice.
“I haven’t given anything.”
He noted that Kim was interested in another meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step towards North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
However, talks on the elimination of nuclear weapons have been halted.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, the chief ambassador to North Korea, told the international leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday in the north had not received an "appropriate response" from the United States at the first steps of North Korea towards the nucleus.
He said that instead, the United States continued to uphold trade bans in order to maintain pressure.
Trump was more positive in his speech.
“We are very close to North Korea,” he said.
“We were going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have lost their lives.
Our relationship is great now.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results -- missile tests have ended, hostages have been released, and U.S. soldiers' remnants have been returned home.
He also took an unusual approach to discussing his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to behave like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into a crowded stadium, there were only 200 people standing there,” Trump said.
Floods and earthquakes in Indonesia have damaged hundreds of islands
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, international aid organizations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok had to flee their homes, a state of emergency was not declared, but it is a prerequisite for an international community to begin relief activities there.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they are not going to ask for international assistance, so this is difficult," Ms. Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet known when foreign aid workers can start working in the area.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the country’s disaster relief agency, said Indonesian advisers were evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international organisations should allow aid.
Given the prevalence of earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is sadly unprepared to defend against natural forces.
Flood protections have been erected in Aceh, but they are rarely seen on other coastlines.
It appears that the lack of flood protection missiles in Palu has further increased casualties, even though a warning has been issued.
Even under the best conditions, it can be a challenge to travel between the many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters make planning even more complicated.
An ambulance that has been lying at the port in Lombok to warm up the victims of the earthquake is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to get to the new accident site.
President Joko Widodo made it the main focus of his election campaign to rebuild Indonesia’s narrowed transport routes and he has spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
However, the lack of funds has plagued Mr. Joko's board, but elections will be held next year.
Mr. Joko also has to contend with persistent tensions between religious groups in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted more conservative religious policies.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to leave their homes as the Christian movement and Muslims fought in the streets with sows, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge, Liverpool player, equalises against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League by scoring the 89th minute of Saturday's game at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received a shipment from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from Chelsea's goal when his team was under 1-0.
He rolled the ball to the left and then tried to score a goal towards the far pole.
The ball flew high over the goal and towards its right corner.
The ball eventually went over Kepa Arrizabalaga, which jumped up, and into the net.
"I just wanted to try to get to this position, to catch the ball, and players like Shaq always play it as early as possible so I tried to make as much time as I could," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante come and touch once and didn’t think so much about it, just took the shot.”
Chelsea were over 1-0 in the half after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
In the draw, Chelsea forward gave the ball with a heel to Mateo Kovacic and then jumped from the center over to Liverpool half of the game.
Kovacic allowed the ball to move quickly in the middle.
Then he sent the ball forward and sent Hazard in for a penalty win.
Hazard ran off the defenders and scored in the far corner with a left-footed shot past Alisson Becker, Liverpool’s goalkeeper.
Liverpool will play against Naples in the Premier League semi-finals at 15:00 on Wednesday at San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play against Videoton in the UEFA European Championship at 15:00 on Thursday in London.
Death toll rises to 832 after flood in Indonesia
The number of deaths caused by the earthquake and flood in Indonesia has risen to 832, according to a report from the country’s disaster agency earlier Sunday.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency’s spokesman, said at a news conference that a number of people had been buried when buildings collapsed in the earthquake that occurred on Friday and was 7.5 points on the Richter scale. The earthquake caused floods that reached up to 6 meters in height.
The city of Palu, which has over 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with ruins from buildings that had collapsed.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been initiated after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old woman with a stab wound was found at 7:55 this morning near Grayson Mews on John Street and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have urged people in the area to show up if they saw or heard anything.
Investigator Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation has just begun, but I would like to ask everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead to contact us if they saw or heard anything suspicious.
I would also like to ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who might have caught something in the picture with their car cameras to contact us, because they could have important information for our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman who died had lived in Birkenhead and was found inside an apartment.
In the afternoon, people who thought they knew the woman came to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues and the police say they are working to let the victim’s closest relatives know.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews tried to get back to his apartment, but police told him no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
Residents have now been told that many hours may pass until they are allowed back in.
A police officer told a man that the whole area was now considered a crime scene.
A weeping woman came to the scene.
She keeps saying, “It’s so horrible.”
At 2:00 p.m., two police cars were inside the marked area of the police and one car just outside it.
A number of police officers stood inside the designated area and watched the apartment buildings.
Anyone who could have any information is asked to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact the Crime Line anonymously on 0800 555 111 and give the number 247 from September 30.
Cromwell's statue of the British Senate is the latest memorial to be accused of "redoing history."
The prohibition of the statue would be a poetic justification for the Taliban’s destruction of his superstitious Puritan escorts on so many of England’s cultural and religious treasures.
The Cromwell Society, on the other hand, said that Mr. Crick's proposal was "a fool" and "an attempt to rewrite the story."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the ongoing discussion on the removal of the statue, it was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside Westminster Palace would be for the battle.
The opposition of the English Civil War to the cultural symbols was neither Cromwell's decree nor his execution.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his forefather Thomas in the century before.
The magnificent statue of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, marks the 19th-century era and is part of a history that many believe is not yet worthy of praise.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is thought by many, perhaps in the late nineteenth century rather than today, to have been the protector of the Senate against external pressure, in his case of the empire.
There is still a lot of historical controversy as to whether this description is entirely correct.
However, it is likely that the conflicts that were in the mid-17th century have shaped the evolution of our nation and that Cromwell is a well-known individual who represents one side of their conflict.
It is worth paying tribute to and commemorating his achievements as the protector of the state.”
A pig attacks a Chinese farmer and kills him.
Pigs attacked a Chinese farmer and killed him on the market in southwestern China, according to local news.
The man, whose only surname is “Yuan”, was found dead with a broken artery and covered blood near a stall at the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, according to news from the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to inject vaccines to pigs in a pig herd on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He had traveled with his uncle from neighboring Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning his uncle found him dead and saw the door of a nearby pig house standing open.
He said that inside the stall there had been a large bark with a bloody mouth.
A trial confirmed that the 250 kg belly had killed the farmer, according to the report.
“My uncle’s feet were bloody and wounded,” he told Guiyang Evening News.
A security camera footage showed Yuan coming to the market at 4:40 in the morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by Yuan or his uncle.
The owner of the market told Evening News that the pig had been locked up so that it did not attack anyone else while the police collected evidence on the scene.
According to the news, Yuan's family and market owners are in talks about compensation for his death.
There are recorded instances of pigs attacking people, although rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts and seriously wounded the man.
Ten years earlier, a wise farmer squeezed 300 kg of pork on a tractor until his wife dragged the animal away.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, another farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that blood flavors can arouse aggression in them.
“They’re just playing.
They like to cheat and are curious... they don’t want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them respect,” he said.
Remains of hurricane Rose carry heavy rainfall over southwestern U.S.
As prophesied, the force of the hurricane Rose is decreasing as it crosses the cooler seas of the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rose will carry heavy rainfall that could cause floods in northern Mexico and southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rose became a Category 1 hurricane with winds of up to 136 km per hour, at 5 a.m. east coast time on Sunday, and was located about 600 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rose is scheduled to go north on Sunday.
At the same time, the formation of the Pacific Ocean is low and it will move east towards the west coast of the United States. When Rosa arrives at the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will therefore accompany a large tropical storm to the north into the southwestern part of the United States.
The rose will accompany up to 25 cm of rainfall in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Subsequently, the tropical smog will mix with the approaching lowlands, creating heavy and widespread rainfall over the southwestern region in the coming days.
Local 2.5 to 10 cm of precipitation can cause dangerous rapid floods, soil movements and possible creeps in the desert.
High temperatures will cause up to 5 to 10 cm of precipitation per hour in some places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Precipitation is expected to be up to 5 to 10 cm in some parts of the southwestern part, especially in most of Arizona.
There is a possibility of sudden floods with snare conditions due to the extent to which tropical rains are dispersed.
People are strongly advised not to go on foot into the desert when there is a risk of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can turn rivers into torrential streams, and thunderstorms can lead to blizzards and dust storms.
The approaching lake will carry local debris in certain areas of the Southern California coastline.
There is a possibility of more than 1 cm of precipitation which could cause slight movement of the soil and hail on roads.
This is the first rainfall in the rainy season.
Several scattered tropical showers will begin approaching Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before rainfall spreads across larger areas late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread across four counties on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
As the Arctic region cools, it is likely to experience significant changes in temperature in October throughout the United States, but the warming of the Arctic continues.
Sometimes this can cause large temperature fluctuations over short distances.
A good example of a large heat dissipation in the central United States was seen on Sunday.
There is a nearly 7-degree thermal difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, persistent summers will try to build up and spread out again.
Much of the Central and Eastern United States is expected to have a warm start in October, with temperatures around 25 degrees or more from the southern plains to the northeast.
The temperature could go up to 25 degrees in New York City on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term weather forecast suggests that there is a high probability of above-average temperatures for the eastern part of the United States in the first part of October.
More than 20 million people attended interrogation of Brett Kavanaugh
Over 20 million people watched the thrilling testimony of nominated Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh on Tuesday and the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault that was supposed to have occurred in the 1990s. The testimony was broadcast on six different channels.
At the same time, the political stalemate continued and television stations paused their regular schedule to publish the latest news on Friday: Jeff Flake, an Arizona Senator, filed a bill that allowed the FBI to investigate the allegations for one week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was confident that Kavanaugh had drowned her and tried to strip her at a school party.
Kavanaugh said in an emotional testimony that he was confident that it had not happened.
More people are likely to have watched the trial than the 20.4 million people Nielsen said would have watched on Friday.
The company measured average viewing on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Numbers were not immediately available for other TV channels showing the interrogations, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen usually has trouble measuring people’s views in offices.
To put this in context, this audience is similar in size to the finals of football or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, most people watched the interviews, which took all day, on Fox News Channel, or 5.69 million. The reviewers of that channel have faithfully shortlisted Kavanaugh.
ABC was in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
There was still a lot of interest after the trial.
Flake was the centre of attention on Friday.
After this Senator's party office issued an announcement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, filmmakers picked up CNN and CBS footage of the protesters shouting at him on Friday morning, as he tried to get into the elevator to attend a meeting of the Judiciary Committee.
He sat down for a few minutes as the shame rained on him on CNN live broadcast.
A woman said, “I’m right here in front of you.”
“Do you think he’s telling the people the truth?”
People said to him, “You have power while so many women stand powerless.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement and before the elevator door closed, he said he would further comment at the committee meeting.
The cable and television stations were all broadcast live later when the Judiciary Committee chose whether to pass Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate.
Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations against the nominee next week, but a minority of Democrats have encouraged it.
Flake was partly convinced after a conversation with his friend, Chris Coons, a Democratic senator.
Flake made his decision after a conversation with Coons and several other Senators thereafter.
Flake's vote was crucial because it was clear that the Republicans did not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has given permission to investigate the FBI's allegations against Kavanaugh.
Britain's Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'being in a political game' over Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of “being political” about Britain’s future and undermining the country’s interests.
Theresa May, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, will attend the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, which was posted next to her interview on the cover of the paper, Boris Johnson, her former foreign minister, granted the so-called Chequers plan on Brexit, saying that the proposal that Britain and the European Union should charge each other customs duties would be “absolutely erroneous”.
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson in connection with LSU player's death
Police have arrested one suspect for the death of Wayde Sims in a fatal shooting, who was a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Twenty-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and imprisoned on second-degree murder charges, according to police in Baton Rouge.
Authorities posted a video of the clash between Sims and Simpson and said Sims have lost their glasses in the clashes.
Police found the glasses on the scene and said they had found Simpson’s genetic material on them, according to WAFB, CBS’ sister-in-law.
Police say Simpson has confessed to the interrogation after shooting Wayde and killing him.
According to his lawyer, a certain amount of security was $350,000.
The forensic physicist’s office in East Baton Rouge County released a preliminary report on Friday stating that the cause of death is a gunshot in the head and down the throat.
Authorities wanted to thank the Louisiana Police Special Forces, the Crime Investigation Department, the Southern University Police Department, and local citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, chairman of LSU Sports, thanked law enforcement officials for “his zeal and his search for justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The tall two-metre frontman grew up in Baton Rouge where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He scored 5.6 points on average and took 2.6 rebounds for each game in the last season.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said on Friday morning that the team was “sadly beaten” and “shocked” because of Wayde’s death.
“It’s something you worry about all the time,” Wade said.
Mount of Fire spits ashes over Mexico City
Popocatepetl ash from the volcano has reached the southern capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday advised Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity increased in the tank and 183 cases of gas and ash emissions were recorded over a 24-hour period.
The center was monitored by vibrations and quakes from the volcano.
Social media images showed a thin layer of ash on car windows in Mexico City’s neighborhoods, such as Xochimilco.
Earth physicists have noticed increased activity in the volcano, which is 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, from the 7.1 earthquake on Richter that hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The mountain, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police in Conflict with Catalan Separatists Right Before the Birthday Independence Vote
Six were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independent protesters attacked the anti-police and thousands took part in protests on the occasion of the first anniversary of the controversial elections in Catalonia to declare independence.
A group of masked separatists stoned eggs and threw dust paintings into the streets, usually full of tourists.
The fighting also erupted later that day and police used clubs to keep the fighting under control.
Separatists shouted, "We don't forget and we don't forgive" for a few hours while their opponents shouted against them, "Long live Spain."
Fourteen of the protesters needed attention for minor injuries they suffered in the protests, according to local media.
A year after the October 1 referendum in Madrid was declared illegal by the authorities, much of the tension continued in the independence-minded region, but was welcomed by the Catalan separatists.
The majority of the electorate voted for independence, but participation was poor as most of those who opposed separation ignored the elections.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to stop the elections at polling stations across the area, which resulted in a conflict.
Groups of independents had stayed out overnight on Friday to prevent protests in support of the country's police.
The protest took place but was forced to go another way.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician, took part in the protests of separatists with his wife, saying he was no longer hopeful that Catalonia would gain independence.
“Last year we had our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy over being able to vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite having achieved the necessary but scarce victory in the regional elections in December last year, Catalonia’s independent parties have had difficulty keeping up this year, with many of the most well-known leaders either in voluntary exile or in detention pending trials for their role in organizing.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who raised the protest in support of the police on his phone, said politicians of both states had encouraged the dispute.
“The tension is increasing,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been imprisoned and awaiting trial since late last year, announced that he would present himself to the European Parliament next year.
“My offer in the European elections is the best way to condemn the backlash in the field of democratic values and the oppression that we have seen the Spanish government apply,” he said.
Londonderry: Man Arrested After Driving a Car to a House
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after driving repeatedly to a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7.30 p.m.
Investigator Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself had been damaged.
It is also possible that the gun was shot from a crossbow towards the vehicle.
Menga scores a 1-0 win in Livingston against Rangers
First goal Dolly Menga secured the victory of Livingston
Livingston, who came from the lower division, brought the Rangers into the open and Steven Gerrard had to endure his second loss in 18 games as the manager of the Ibrox team.
Mark Dolly Menga made the difference and Gary Holt's team is now in second place with Hibernian.
Gerrard’s team has not yet won in the Premier League this season and plays against Hearts, who are eight points ahead in the top spot next Sunday.
For that game, the Rangers will face Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
At the same time, Livingston is still undefeated in the league with six wins, and Holt's head coach has not had to experience a loss since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston Loses Opportunities Against Relentless Visitors
Holt's team should have been over long before scoring a goal, but their scrutiny caused Rangers a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson managed to break through but hesitated in his attempt to score, and Alan Lithgow then shot a pass after sliding through the defense to receive a header from Graig Halkett across the goal.
The hosts allowed the Rangers to play in front of them quietly, knowing that they could cause trouble to guests in the right places.
And that’s how the goal was scored.
Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined Menga, who took the lead and scored from the middle of the tie.
At that stage, the Rangers had dominated the ball but the defense of the locals was unbreakable and Liam Kelly, the goalkeeper did not have to put much effort.
This continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos managed to defend from Kelly.
Scott Pitman was stopped by Allan McGregor, the Rangers' goalkeeper, and Lithgow shot from goal after a defeat from Livingston.
The questions steadily fell to Livingston's penalties but were kicked off, and two penalties - after Halkett's defense against Glenn Middleton, and one left-handed - were dismissed.
"Beautiful" by Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont, BBC Scotland reporter at Tony Macaroni Stadium
Excellent performance and results for Livingston.
For a normal person, they stood out wonderfully and continued to exceed all expectations on their rise.
Their playing style and team members have barely changed since they got back to the top division, but Holt is highly commended for having put the team together since their arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Halkett, the captain, was tremendously good and led a full-scale defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on his toes all the time.
The Rangers, on the other hand, lacked inspiration.
As good as they have been under Gerrard's rule, they played far below expectations.
They went bad at completing their parishes and only once managed to open up half the field of the locals so this should be an awakening for the Rangers who are now sitting in the middle of the division.
Erdogan receives a cross-border reception in Cologne
The sky was smiling and bright on Saturday (September 29), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met over breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations between the two nations.
Disputes have arisen between them on issues such as human rights, freedom of the media and Turkey’s accession to the European Union.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new giant mosque.
The city is home to most of the Turkish population outside of Turkey itself.
The police used security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but a large number of supporters came to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan – many of them Kurds – also listened and condemned both Erdogan’s policy and the decision of the German government to invite him to the country.
The two protest groups reflect the contentiousness of this visitor, who is hailed as a hero by some Turks in Germany and hated as a dictator by others.
Collision in Deptford: Cyclist killed in car crash
A cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a multi-storey street in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city, at about 10.15 a.m. local time.
The driver of the car stopped and the ambulance provided care, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
The crash occurred a few months after another cyclist died in a collision where a driver drove off on Childers Street, 1.5 km from Saturday’s accident site.
The police said she was working on identifying the man and letting his closest relatives know.
The road has been closed and the buses have been redirected and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Guards Wounded in Disturbance
Six prisoners were injured when riots broke out in a male security prison, according to a report from the Prison Department.
The riots broke out at Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. on Sunday and are still raging.
"Tornado" special forces have been called into the area to try to curb the riots, which eight prisoners are engaged in, and are only in one of the prison's wings.
The guards were treated for minor injuries to the face at the scene.
A prison agency spokesman said: “Specially trained prison guards have been summoned to deal with cases at Long Lartin Prison.
Six employees have been charged with injuries.
There is no violence in our prisons and we clearly assume that the responsible officers will be handed over to the police and could expect to spend even more time behind bars and beatings.”
Over 500 prisoners are in the Long Lartin prison, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the jailer had had to go to the hospital after a prisoner attacked him.
And in October last year, a riot police force was called to the place to tackle a serious disturbance to peace, attacking staff with billiard bullets.
Hurricane Rose threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden floods (dry areas could benefit)
It is uncommon for tropical lows to pass across Arizona, but it is likely to happen early next week when the remnants of hurricane Rose pass over the southwestern part, with the risk of sudden flooding.
The country’s meteorological office has already issued rush hour warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and southern and western Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rose is scheduled to cross Phoenix on Tuesday and arrive late Monday with rainfall.
The Phoenix Meteorological Institute said on Twitter that “only ten hurricanes have reached strength to be classified as tropical storms or lows in less than 320 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 60 miles of the Arizona border.
Latest forecasts from the country's hurricane center predict 5-10 cm of precipitation, with occasional precipitation up to 15 cm in the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Precipitation is likely to be 2.5 to 5 cm in other areas in the southwestern part, including the central part of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin (The Great Basin), with the possibility of unique precipitation up to 10 cm.
For those who are not at risk of sudden flooding, the rainfall from Rosu could be a blessing because there are great droughts in the area.
Although flooding can cause a lot of damage, some of this rainfall will have a positive effect, as drought is now in the southwest.
According to the U.S. Drying Authority, at least a very high drought is in over 40 percent of Arizona, which is the second-highest category," according to news from weather.com.
First, a hurricane will hit the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa was still classified as a hurricane on Sunday morning with a maximum wind force of 136 km per hour and is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and travels northwards at 19 km per hour.
The storm passes over the cooler sea in the Pacific, and its power diminishes.
He is expected to land in Mexico as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or Monday night.
There is a possibility of heavy rainfall in some areas of Mexico, with a considerable risk of flooding.
“Precipitations are expected to reach 7.5 to 15 cm in Baja California and into northwestern Sonora, with the possibility of up to 25 cm of precipitation,” a statement from weather.com said.
Rose will then hold north across Mexico as a tropical storm, then reach the Arizona border early on Tuesday morning as a tropical low. She will then continue up through Arizona and reach southern Utah late on Tuesday night.
“The main threat expected from Rose or its remains is extremely high rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and southwestern U.S. Desert,” the country’s hurricane center said.
These precipitations are expected to cause life-threatening rapid floods and soil movements in the desert, and creep into the mountains.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested for attempted murder, after a 16-year-old boy was found with a knife wound in Somerset.
The teen was found injured on the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 a.m. local time on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where his condition is said to be "steady".
One 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old and one 20-year-old man were arrested at night in the Radstock area, according to police from Avon and Somerset.
The police have asked for witnesses who may have phone recordings of what happened.
Trump says Kavanaugh has “feel the evil and the anger” of the Democratic Party
“A vote in support of Kavanaugh’s judge is a vote that rejects the Democratic Party’s ruthless and outrageous practices,” Trump said at a meeting with supporters in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had “feel the evil and the anger” of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before the Senate on Thursday, denying the allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her several decades ago when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified before the committee on his allegations.
The president said on Saturday that "Americans had seen the genius and humanity and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
“The vote to confirm Kavanaugh’s judge is a vote that confirms one of the smartest lawyers of our time, a lawyer with an impressive CV as a public official,” he told a group of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh’s nomination when he spoke of the importance of Republican supporters taking part in the mid-term elections.
“It’s five weeks in one of the most important elections in our lives.
“I don’t want to, but I really do,” he said.
“That’s why I’m going across the board to fight for great candidates.”
Trump said Democrats were working to “tackle and block.”
The first key floor vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination will take place no later than Friday, according to a CNN interviewee.
Hundreds of people died in earthquakes and floods in Indonesia, and the number of dead is likely to increase
At least 384 people were killed and many were washed away by huge waves on the shores of the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when up to six-metre-high waves swept the beach at sunset, washed out a large number of people at sea and destroyed everything that had happened to them.
The tidal wave formed after an earthquake of 7.5 degrees on Richter.
“When the tidal threat arose yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not flee immediately, so it killed their lives,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian Disaster Response Agency, told an information meeting in Jakarta.
“The tidal wave didn’t come alone, it dragged cars, trees, houses, it hit everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tidal wave had travelled across the open sea at 800 kilometers before hitting the beach.
Some climbed a tree to escape the tidal wave and survived, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were transferred to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the Disaster Management Agency showed many destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and unused bridges and mosques surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to ride across the coastal town on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes occurred in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Food and Technology Agency said the energy released by the earthquake on Friday had been about 200 times greater than that of the atomic bomb that fell on the city of Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical location of the city, which lies at the end of a long and narrow bay, could have increased the size of the flood wave, the agency said.
Nugroho said the damage was “serious” and that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of a number of victims were found trapped under the collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and property damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km north of Palu in an area called Donggala which is closer to the source of the earthquake.
Communication "is completely down and no information is received" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
"Over 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
“It’s already a tragedy, but it could get much worse,” the Red Cross said.
The agency was criticized by many on Saturday for not letting it know that a flood had flooded Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived within the time the warning was issued.
In a video posted on social media, a man could be heard shouting from the top floor of buildings to warn the people on the street below that a flood wave was approaching.
Just a few minutes later, the tidal wave hits the beach and carries away buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to confirm the video.
The earthquake and flood caused power loss, which hindered communication around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to plan relief operations.
The military is starting to send aid aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, according to authorities, but people who have been helped by the area still need food and other necessities.
The city's airport has only been reopened for relief operations and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit refugee centers in Palu on Sunday.
More than 800 people have died in Indonesia after a flood.
The situation is very bad.
World Vision staff from Donggala have reached the city of Palu safely, as it seeks shelter in camp towns that were set up in the garden outside their offices. Destruction blazed at them on the way, according to Mr. Doseba.
“People said they’ve seen many houses destroyed,” he said.
The situation is very bad.
Aid groups have begun hard work, but some have complained that foreign aid workers with a high level of expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, supplies and personnel may only begin to arrive if the accident site is declared a disaster area.
It has not been done yet.
“This is still a local accident site,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government has declared that this is a disaster area, we can open for foreign aid, but no declaration has yet been made.”
When the second night fell on Palu after the earthquake and flood on Friday, friends and their families who are still missing kept hoping that their loved ones would be one of the miracle stories that cast hopeful hope on the depressing headlines that accompany natural disasters.
On Saturday, a young boy was rescued.
On Sunday, relief workers rescued a woman who had been trapped under shelter for two days with her mother’s body by her side.
Gendon Subandono, the trainer of the Indonesian glider team, had been the trainer of two gliders who are now missing, for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others locked up in the Roa Roa hotel were his students, including Mr. Monday.
“As a man with long experience in flying, I have my own emotional burden to bear,” he said.
Mr Gendon said that within hours of news being received within the glider group that the Roa Roa hotel had crashed, he had sent WhatsApp messages in desperation to the contestants who stayed in Palu and participated in the beach festival.
His message, however, showed only gray signals, instead of blue ones.
“I think that means that the message was not received,” he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 while filling an ATM in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves robbed $26,750 from Brink, who was filling an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from Newport police.
The driver of the car had been emptying an ATM at the entertainment area and was filling more money on it, police officer Dennis McCarthy said in the announcement.
While he was at work, another man “run behind the Brink employee” and stole a money bag intended for delivery.
Witnesses saw many suspects fleeing the scene, according to the report, but the police did not state how many were involved in the case.
Those who may have information about the suspects are asked to contact the Newport police on phone 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
He tweeted the change on Saturday, writing: “The creature that was previously known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, has been called Ye for some time and used the name as the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change comes before his participation in the Saturday Night Live episode where he is expected to announce his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces Arianna Grandi in the show, but she quit for "emotional reasons," the producer said.
West has previously said that this name has a religious meaning for him, but it is also a abbreviation of his current name.
“I think ‘ye’ (you) is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you,’” West said earlier this year when he talked about the name on his album to the radio broadcaster Big Boy.
“So I’m you, I’m you, I’m you.
It went from Kanye, which means the one, and over to just Ye - to be just a reflection of the good in us, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of many famous rappers who have changed his name.
Sean Combs has been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he would rather be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, a former West collaborator, has also written his name with and without strings and capitals.
Mexico’s President-elect vows not to use the military against civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the elected president of Mexico, has vowed to never use force against civilians, now that the country will soon commemorate the 50th anniversary of bloody revenge days of students.
On Saturday, in Tlatelolco Square, Lopez Obrador pledged to “never use the military to oppress the Mexican people.”
Soldiers shot at a peaceful protest in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when the leftist student movement was taking root in all of Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to help young people in Mexico by giving all students a monthly scholarship and opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and a lack of educational opportunities attract young people to crime.
The U.S. should double its capital for artificial intelligence
Now that China is increasingly active in the use of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the funding it spends on research in this field, says inventor and artificial intelligence user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments were made after various departments of the U.S. government issued notifications of artificial intelligence, even though the U.S. does not have a formal overall program on artificial intelligence.
China, on the other hand, announced its plan last year: it aims to be first in innovation with artificial intelligence by 2030.
“It would be a good start to doubling the capital going into artificial intelligence research, given that all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are waiting to see the next big discovery in the field of artificial intelligence,” Lee said.
“Doubling capital could double the likelihood of the next major discovery of artificial intelligence being made in the United States,” Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, the author of the book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” published this month by publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China’s largest artificial intelligence companies.
He worked with artificial intelligence systems at Carnegie Mellon University in the 1990s, which won the U.S. Best Player at Othello, and later was CEO of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese department at Google.
Lee spoke of previous technical competitions held by the U.S. authorities, such as the Defence Department robotic competition, and asked when the next competition would be held, to spot the next entrepreneurs.
“Scientists in the United States often have to put a lot of effort into getting funding from the government,” Lee said.
“It’s not China that attracts the main thinkers, it’s the companies,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired geniuses from universities to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policies could also help the United States strengthen its artificial intelligence research.
“I think those who have a PhD in artificial intelligence should be granted a residence permit automatically,” he said.
China’s parliament released its future artificial intelligence plan in July 2017.
The Chinese Institute of Natural Sciences provides funds to people working at universities, similar to the National Science Foundation and similar government agencies do in the United States, but the quality of science work is worse in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a artificial intelligence center, which is intended to cooperate with both industry and educational institutions, and the White House announced the formation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced that it had invested $2 billion in a project called AI Next.
As far as NSF is concerned, it invests over $100 million annually in research into artificial intelligence.
At the same time, the U.S. legislation, which was intended to create a Security Council on Artificial Intelligence, has not progressed for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change name of country
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday to decide whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia" in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has closed their application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province named Macedonia, claiming that the name of its northern neighbours is equivalent to a claim on its territory and therefore refused them entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will undermine the identity of the majority of Macedonians of Slavic origin.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not participate in the vote and a campaign to ignore it has raised doubts that participation will reach the 50 percent minimum required for the vote to be valid.
The question on the ballot paper is: “Will you join NATO and the EU by agreeing to the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say this is a fair fee for Macedonia to join alliances such as the EU and NATO, which is one of those that were formed after the fall of Yugoslavia.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country for the young people of Macedonia so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the result is not legally binding, enough senators have said they will comply with it and bind it into law.
The change of name would require the approval of two-thirds of the Senate.
The election committee said that nothing unusual had been announced at 1 a.m. after noon.
However, the turnout was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62-year-old voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted in the Macedonian referendum on whether to change the name of the country, which would pave its way into NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, worked on preparing a small area and setting up chairs in front of tents that had been erected by those who will ignore the vote.
"We are enthusiastic about NATO and the EU, but we want to become members with our heads high, not going through the service door," Kavardarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to China or Russia and become part of the Eurasian Union.”
Zaev’s prime minister said that NATO will transfer the necessary funds to Macedonia, where the rate of unemployed is over 20 percent.
"I think the largest majority will agree that over 80 percent of citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said.
He said that approval would be “a confirmation of our future.”
A poll published on Monday by the Macedonian Policy Research Institute showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, which is lower than the minimum required.
A second poll from Telma TV showed that 57 percent of respondents were going to vote on Sunday.
Seventy-five percent of them said yes.
In order for the referendum to be valid, attendance must be 50 percent plus one vote.
If the vote is not approved, it could mean the first serious shock to the policy of the government, which is in favour of the Western countries, since it took effect in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero, player of Manchester City, goes through all the defensive Brighton and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defended Brighton 2–0 against Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored his goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentinian forward received a transfer in the middle of the field at the beginning of the attack.
He jumped past three Brighton defenders and then went out to the open stadium.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green-clad defenders.
He passed one defender and then ran away from a few more right next to Brighton.
Then he sent to the left and found Sterling.
The English forward used the first touch within the penalty area to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to play Mathew Ryan, Brighton goalkeeper, with a shot in the right side of the goal.
"Aguero has some foot problems," Pep Guardiola, City's chief executive, told reporters.
“We talked about playing 55, 60 minutes.
Then it happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at this moment.”
But it was Sterling who gave them the blue first goal in the Premier League game.
The mark came in at 29 minutes.
Aguero received a shipment far inside the halves of Brighton in that parish.
He sent an elegant long ball to the left to Leroy Sane.
Sane kicked the ball several times and then sent Sterling towards the far pole.
The forward City sent the ball into the net just before it ran out.
City will play against Hoffenheim in the Champions League at 12.55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Necker Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a knockout game against the Rockies
Since the Nationals team has been excluded from playing in the finals, there was not much reason to force a second start.
But the zealous Scherzer hopes to throw on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies still have a chance to make it to the finals, but they have a one-game advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western Division.
The Rockies got at least a wildcard seat with their 5-2 win at the Nationals on Friday night, but the team is still striving to reach their first league title.
“Even though we play for free, we can at least play for the electrified atmosphere in Denver as well as the other team is sure to play their best game of the year.
Why shouldn’t I want to compete in such a situation?”
The Nationals have yet to announce who will be the first pitcher in Sunday's game, but it is believed that they will let Scherzer throw in these circumstances.
Scherzer, who was to start a game for the 34th time, took a practice session on Thursday and would throw on Sunday, which is his usual Sabbath.
This right-handed pitcher at Washington is 18-7 with 2.53 ERAs and 300 blows in 220 2/3 cycles in this season.
Trump visits West Virginia
The president was referring indirectly to the case surrounding Kavanaugh, the nominated Supreme Court judge, when he spoke of the importance of Republican supporters taking part in the mid-term elections.
“Everything is going on in November.
It’s five weeks in one of the most important elections of our lives.
These are one of the big ones, big ones... I don’t offer myself, but if I do, that’s why I’m going across wide stadiums to fight for great candidates,” he said.
Trump went on to say, “If you see this horrific, radical group of democrats, you can see it happening now.
And they are determined to re-electe by whatever means necessary, you see the cruelty, the evil.
They don’t care who they hurt, over whom they need to go to take power and control, they just want to get power and control, we don’t give them that.
He said Democrats were working on “tagging and blocking.”
"And it has been seen the last four days," he said, saying the Democrats are "furious and evil and cruel and untrue."
He named the Senate Senator Dianne Feinstein, the ruling Democrat on the Senate Judgment Committee, and was answered with a loud voice from the audience.
“Do you remember her response?
Was it you who broke the document?
Ha, what.
No, no. I waited for one... it was really bad body expression, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer the tolerance of the Church.
He does not tolerate those who express their thoughts.
When the activists of Momentum in my class chose to criticize me, it was hardly surprising.
I am, after all, the last of many Senators of the Labour Party to have been told that we are not welcome, just for expressing our thoughts.
Joan Ryan, my fellow senator, received similar treatment because she strongly objected to prejudice against Jews.
In my case, the suggestion to appeal to me was made because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
The issues were the importance of having a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically similar issues as Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of the meeting for Nottingham East on Friday said, “We want the meetings to be unrecognizable and successful.”
In my eight-year career as a Senator of the Workers’ Party, Friday’s meetings have usually been just that.
Unfortunately, it is not the tone of many meetings today and the promise of "milder and better" politics has been forgotten, if it ever began.
It has become increasingly clear that differing opinions have not passed in the Labour Party and that all opinions are judged according to whether the party’s leaders consider them acceptable.
This started shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues, who I previously thought had similar political views as I did, began to expect me to take a complete turn and support views that I had never before agreed, whether it was about national security or the common EU market.
Every time I speak in public – and that doesn’t matter much what I say – there is a scream of disgrace on social media calling for my expulsion, denying central politics and telling me I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And this is not just my experience.
I know I’m more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since most of the comments I get to me are usually political.
I admire the professionalism and solidity of those who have to endure the hollowness of sexual or prejudiced insults daily but never retreat.
One of the biggest disappointments of this political era is how attacks and insults have become a normal part of everyday life.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should foster a tolerant culture.
The reality is that we are no longer a Church of tolerance, and with every distrust or change in election rules, the party becomes ever narrower.
I’ve been given a lot of advice over the last two years to look at me, not be too loud, and then I’d be “okay.”
But I didn’t want to participate in politics to do so.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, motivated by the neglect of Thatcher’s government that left my classroom behind in destitution, I have fought for better public service for those who need it most, whether I was in the city council or in the Senate.
I have never hid my political views, not even in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East can be in any doubt about my policy views and where I disagree with current leaders.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I just want to say that when the country heads towards Brexit, which will harm our homes, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to spend time and energy in my loyalty to the Labour Party leaders.
But my only message that I want to send is not to Nottingham Moments, but to those within my constituency, whether or not they are members of the Labour Party: I serve you with pride and I promise that no threats of deviation or political expulsion will dissuade me from doing what I think is best.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Defeated team Ayr goes to the top
Two late touch limits may have slightly distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr had the victory in this fun game of the day in Tennent's Premiership league.
They are now at the top of the list and the only team out of ten that is still undefeated.
In the end, it was their stronger defense and better use of opportunities that made locals more victorious and Peter Murchie coach had full right to be satisfied.
“We’ve had tough opposition in our games so far and we’re still unbeaten, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, “Ayr deserves praise, they took advantage of their opportunities better than we did.”
Mark Grant Anderson crossed Ayr on the 14th minute after Frazier Clima turned the attack on, but a yellow card on the Scottish captain, who was allowed to play the game with the Warriors, allowed Melrose to let the numbers count and Jason Baggot reached the touchpoint.
Clima boosted Ayr's lead with a penalty before scoring with a kick just before half and then a touchdown goal, overcoming Ayr 17-5 in half.
But Melrose started the latter half of power and touch mark Patrick Anderson, after Baggot turned the attack, reduced the mark difference to five points.
A long break was then needed to fuel serious injuries to Ruaridh Knott, who had to bear a playground, and afterwards Ayr continued to boost his lead by touching Stafford McDowall, after Clima turned the pitch.
Blair Macpherson, captain of Ayr, then received the yellow card, and Melrose took advantage of being a man again with a touchpoint from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a harsh attack.
However, homers returned strong and when Struan Hutchinson got the yellow card for tackling Clima without the ball, MacPherson scored a touchdown behind Ayr's defeat, after an extra kick.
Clima reversed the assault, as he did again immediately after the re-start, after Kyle Rowe caught kicking David Amrstrong from the penalty and sending him to Gregor Henry who scored the team's fifth touchpoint.
Star the Still Game series ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Ford Kieran, the star of the Still Game series, seems ready to move into the restaurant business after discovering that he was hired as the manager of a restaurant company.
Kieran, 56, plays Jack Jarvis on the BBC television series, which he co-writes and plays alongside his old companion from the entertainment industry, Creg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last, and it seems that Kiernan has plans for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the managing director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor didn’t want to say anything about the news, but a Scottish Sun reporter said Kiernan wanted to participate in Glasgow’s “living restaurant business.”
“The sea is ours”: the coastless country of Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific Ocean
The sails guard the naval headquarters in La Paz.
General buildings of the blue flag.
Floating stations from Titicaca Lake to the Amazon River are marked with the slogan: “We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to restore it.”
Across the country, Bolivia's landlocked coastline memorial, lost to Chile in bloody conflicts in the 19th century, is still in its freshest memory - along with its desire to sail the Pacific again.
These are perhaps the strongest hopes in decades, now that Bolivia is awaiting a ruling from the International Court of Justice in The Hague on 1 October after five years of litigation.
“Bolivia has the power, the unification and the humility, and of course it is waiting for the verdict with a positive mind,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the ruling of the International Court of Justice on large screens across the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will rule Bolivia in favor of their claim that Chile is obliged to grant Bolivia access to the sea, after decades of difficult negotiations.
The ruling on Monday is also extremely important for Evo Morales, the country’s president of the Indian tribes who will have a controversial fight for re-election next year.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he promised in late August.
But some analysts believe it is unlikely that the court ruled in favor of Bolivia, and that it would change little if he did.
The court, which is headquartered in the Netherlands, has no authority to grant land from Chile and has provided that the ruling will not affect the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the court’s ruling comes just six months after the final hearings indicates that the case “had not been complicated,” said Paz Sárate, a Chilean international law expert.
It is also possible that the past four years have not been an issue for Bolivia to advance, but have caused the country to return.
“The current government of Bolivia has stolen the issue of access to the sea,” Zárate said.
Morales’s speech has diminished all goodwill from Chile, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk sometime, but it will be very difficult after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Eduardo Rodríguez Velzé, former President of Bolivia and the country’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision had taken an unusually short time.
On Monday, Bolivia will have “a unique opportunity to open up a new relationship with Chile” and an opportunity to “end a dispute that reaches 139 years back in time, for the benefit of both countries,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using this issue as a political boost.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific,” he added.
“The decision is an opportunity to see that we need to recover from the past.”
North Korea says there will be no nuclear weapons unless it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said the country would never take down its nuclear weapons first if it could not trust Washington.
Ri made his speech on Saturday at the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made at a meeting of the leaders of the nations in Singapore.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has reportedly reopened talks on nuclear weapons more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's "dreaming" to maintain that the continued trade ban and US protests against the declaration of the end of the Korean War will someday bring down North Korea.
Washington will not accept the declaration unless Pyongyang first takes clearer measures to take down its nuclear weapons.
Both Kim and Donald Trump, the president of the United States want to meet again at another meeting.
Pyongyang is serious about taking down weapons that the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare the next meeting between Kim and Trump.
Paris Fashion Shows Introduce the Latest Line of Big Headwear That Will Come to Fashion Shops Near You
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or be completely hidden from the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed a variety of weird oversized hats for their SS19 line in the fashion scene that captivated the jet team at Paris Fashion Week.
A number of images of extremely unskillful hats have been posted on Instagram this summer and these designers have had their innovative creations on display at fashion shows.
The main work by Valentino was a large light brown hat with wide feathers that covered the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories include watermelons placed on gemstones, seal hats and even pineapples, but these items are not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also introduced a variety of weird masks, just at the right time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had lips that were stitched together and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than like high-tech masks.
One mask resembled a diving gear with a breathing pipe and glasses, while another resembled melting ice in bread form.
If you want to be in fashion, luck is with you.
Fashion experts predict that the big hats could soon come on sale in fashion stores near you.
Big hats come close to the heels of “La Bomba”, a straw hat with more than 60cm big beards that has adorned heads ranging from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The fashion badge behind the highly inappropriate hat, seen on all social media, was inspired by another large accessory that appeared in the fashion scene – a straw beach bag that was almost the same size as the swimwear model that wore it.
The orange boy's bag, with a punchline and a white leather handle, was the main feature of the La Riviera SS10 fashion line Jacquemus at Paris Fashion Week.
In an interview with FEMAIL, Luke Armitage said: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags appear in fashion stores for next summer – as the designer has caused so much impact, it should be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are a necessity for global citizens
The private schools in Scotland are known for their students’ outstanding achievements, and it has continued in 2018 with new, magnificent test results, which are still supported by individual and group achievements in sports, arts, music and other social traditions.
These schools have up to 30,000 students across Scotland, with The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) in charge of them, and they strive to provide their students and their parents with the best possible service.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for further postgraduate studies, the career they have chosen and their position as a global citizen.
As a teaching sector that can put together and teach after specially designed curriculums, we see that novelty continues to be a popular subject of study in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it touches his mind.
If you speak to him in his native language, it touches his heart.”
This is an important reminder that we can’t just rely on English to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year’s test results show us that languages are at the top of the lists with the highest proportion of students passing exams in private schools.
68 per cent of foreign language learners received the grade A.
The data, collected from 74 schools within the SCIS, showed that 72 percent of students received the excellence grade A in mandarin, while 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent of those who learned French, and 63 percent of those who learned Spanish also received the excellence grade A.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support foreign language as the essential skills that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
At the moment, languages, as an elective language, are placed in the same place as scientific learning materials (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in private school curricula and elsewhere.
A survey conducted in 2014 by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that for the reasons employers stated that it was difficult to recruit, it was 17 percent because of a lack of people with language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future jobs.
Now that more and more jobs require language skills, this skill is essential in a globalized world.
No matter what career career people choose, it will have a real advantage in the future if they learn another language, which is a skill that lasts a lifetime.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a multilingual person an advantage over the competitors.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov on over 4,000 adults in 2013, 75 percent of them were unable to speak another language well enough to sustain a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, or 15 percent.
Therefore, it is important for today’s children to invest immediately in language learning.
Multilingualism, especially in new markets, will give children a better opportunity to find meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, there is a difference between schools in what language they teach.
A certain number of schools will focus on more classical new languages, while others will teach languages that are considered to be most important to the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter where your child’s interest lies, they will always be able to choose from languages in private schools with specially trained teachers.
Scottish private schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
It cannot be denied that at this time, in a global business environment, languages continue to be essential for the future of the country, and it must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be viewed as “international skills in communication.”
Private schools will continue to offer choice, diversity and superiority for Scotland’s young people.
I'm fine with the fair.
John Edwards is the chairman of the Scottish Private School Council.
LeBron plays his first game for the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday.
The wait is coming to an end for fans who want to see LeBron James play his first game for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play on Sunday in the opening game of the season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It has not yet been determined how many minutes he will play.
“It will be longer than one minute and shorter than 48,” Walton said in a statement.
Mike Trudell, a reporter for the Lakers, said on Twitter that James would probably play for a limited time.
After training earlier this week, James was questioned about his plans for the Lakers’ six-game schedule for the start of the season.
“At this time of my career, I don’t have to play games for the season to prepare,” he said.
Timetable for Trump’s election in West Virginia and YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will hold a number of elections, the first of which will take place tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
He is one of five planned meetings next week, where he will also stop at friendly locations, including in Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote to confirm his election of a new Supreme Court judge has been put on hold, Trump aims to build up support for the next mid-term elections, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Senate when the vote will be paid in November.
What time is Trump’s election in West Virginia, and how can you watch him online?
Trump’s meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the meeting with Trump in West Virginia online below through direct broadcast on YouTube.
Trump is likely to debate the trial of Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court nominee, where tension prevailed over the allegations of sexual harassment. The Senate vote to confirm him as a judge was suspended for up to a week while the FBI investigates the allegations.
But the main goal of Trump’s meetings is to help the Republicans get on a better path, who are awaiting difficult elections in November.
As a result, the message from Trump’s campaign was that these five meetings, which will be held next week, are aimed at “filling the volunteers and supporters’ enthusiasm that the Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority they have in the Senate and in the Senate,” according to Reuters.
"The leadership of the Senate is so necessary for the President's plan that he will travel to as many counties as possible as a decent campaign period begins," an unnamed spokesman for Trump's campaign told Reuters.
The meeting tonight will be held at the Wesbanco Stadium in Wheeling, and supporters are expected to come from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and Pittsburgh media will tell him," according to West Virginia Metro News news agency.
The meeting on Saturday will be Trump’s second visit to West Virginia this month, which he defeated by over 40 percent difference in this state in 2016.
Trump wants to try to help Patrick Morrissey, the Republican candidate in West Virginia for the Senate, who is lower in the polls.
“It is not a good knowledge for Morrissey that the President needs to come and try to increase his popularity,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team demonstrates fighting will to keep hope alive for Sunday’s individual race
After three one-sided rounds, the game, which was on Saturday afternoon, could be exactly what it needed in this competition for the Ryder Cup.
Swings in success is a sport concept that has been invented and that players truly believe in, and never more than in competitions like this.
Where would they say that success is now?
“They had a six-point lead and now it’s four points, so success is more on our side now, I guess,” Spieth said.
Europe, of course, has the advantage, four levels ahead with twelve more at stake.
The Americans, as Spieth said, think they have some wind in the sails and they can be hopeful for many things, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each got three points out of four.
Spieth has played big all the aversion to flat and leads with his example.
The cheerleaders rose as the circle progressed, and he put down an important tip to pick up all four points in the game after he and Thomas had been two points below after two games.
His pussy, which assured them victory in the game of the 15th hole, received a similar shout of rejoicing, a shout of the kind that tells you that he believes that the American team still has hope of victory.
“You just have to dive deep and think about your own game,” Spieth said.
That’s all these players can do right now.
18 holes to earn points.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinaro and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable history of the Ryder Cup.
This strange but captivating European couple has won four games out of four and can do nothing wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple to get a scrub on Saturday afternoon, but they also managed to avoid scrub on Saturday morning, afternoon on Friday, and on the nine-hole field on Friday morning.
That game and how their energy seems to flow both to and from noisy audiences clearly shows that they are the couple who need to win on Sunday, and there would be no more popular player to seal a possible European team victory than Fleetwood or Molinari, when the sun sets over the Le Golf National stadium.
The best way to do this is to do both at the same time.
It is still too early to talk about the victory of the European team.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson played Sergio Garcia, the hero of the four, with Alex Noren.
Scotch and two doubles in the first nine holes dug the Spaniard and the Swine into a hole they never managed to scratch out of.
But on Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The four-balls and four-players are so exciting to watch in close proximity because of the communication between the couples, their advice, the advice they do not give and how the game plan can change in one stroke.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a considerable advantage before the final day, but this quarter-final also showed that the U.S. team has a fighting spirit that some had doubted it had, especially other Americans.
Europe with 10-6 lead before the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a good advantage before the end of the Ryder Cup after the ball and the quarterback of Saturday, with a 10-6 advantage against the United States.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two victories over Tiger Woods, who was struggling, and have won four points on the Le Golf National field.
European team Thomas Bjorn, who would like to regain the award-winning cup, which it lost on the Hazeltine field two years ago, showed great superiority over the U.S. team in the morning four-ball game, winning 3-1.
The U.S. showed more resistance in the quarterfinals and won two games but failed to win the scoring difference.
Jim Furyk’s team needed eight points from 12 individual games on Sunday to keep the cup going.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, and he and Molinari, who earned the nickname "Molliwood" after a fabulous weekend, are only the second pair to win four points from their first four games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-ball game, Woods and Bryson Dechambeau won 5–4.
Woods, who drew himself through two games on Saturday, showed his genius on a few occasions, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in four-balls and four-games, including seven consecutive games.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the morning's four-ball game, returned to his partner, Henriks Stenson in the quarters and won 2-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who are in first and third place on the list of the world's best golfers.
Europe, however, did not go all the way on this mild and eerie day southwest of Paris.
Triple winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the goal for Americans by two points on Saturday.
They won 2-1 against Jon Rahm of Spain and Ian Poulter in four-ball games and later came back and defeated Poulter and Rory Mcllroy 4-3 in the quarters after losing the first two holes.
It has only happened twice in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team has won a four-point difference at the start of an individual race, although Furyk's team only needed a tie to keep the cup going.
After being second best in two days, however, a counterattack on Sunday seems to be overwhelming.
North Korea says one-sided disarmament "impossible" without confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister said on Saturday that continued trade talks only jettisoned their distrust of the United States and it would be impossible for the country to deploy its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said at the UN annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant action to show goodwill" last year, for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, taking down the nuclear test site, and promising to stop the development of nuclear power plants.
"But we have not seen a similar reaction from the United States," he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there is no certainty about the security of our country and under such circumstances, it is impossible for us to take down our nuclear weapons unilaterally first.”
Although Ri has repeated familiar North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to a "staged" approach to nuclear disarmament, where North Korea would be rewarded for every step it took, his statement seemed special in the sense that he did not deny unilateral nuclear disarmament.
Ri referred to the joint statements made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting between acting US Presidents and North Korean leaders in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim promised to work on the "nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula" and Trump issued a pledge to ensure North Korea's security.
North Korea has sought a solution to formally end the Korean War in 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must leave its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also resisted calls to relax a strict trade ban on North Korea.
“The United States demands that ‘nuclear disarmament occurs first’ and increases the pressure by using trade bans to achieve its goal, and even protests the declaration to end the war,” Ri said.
“There are only dreamers who don’t know anything about us who think that business beans can bring us to our knees.
But the problem is that the ongoing business ban increases our distrust.”
Ri did not mention any plans for another meeting between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader spoke about at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister spoke of three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-In, South Korea's leader for the past five months, adding: "If the party involved in this nuclear weapons issue were South Korea instead of the United States, then this stalemate in the nuclear weapons issue would not be the nuclear weapons issue."
Despite this, the tone in Ri’s speech was very different from his speech last year when he said at the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target missiles from North Korea to the mainland of the United States after “the devil’s president” Trump called Kim a “missile man” in suicide.
Last year, Trump threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, but this year he praised Kim at the United Nations for his courage in taking steps towards disarmament, but said there was still much work to be done and that the trade ban would continue until North Korea had destroyed all its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timeframe whatsoever, saying, “If this takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the United Nations Security Council on Thursday: “The Security Council’s trade ban must continue until complete nuclear disarmament has taken place and it is confirmed.”
The Security Council unanimously agreed to increase the trade talks with North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to block funding for Pyongyang nuclear and missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times a year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that success had been achieved, but only a few hours later North Korea condemned him for making “criminal claims.”
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month to take down a rocket site and nuclear base if the United States takes “corresponding action.”
He said Kim had told himself that the “corresponding actions” he sought were security assurances promised by Trump in Singapore and actions toward normal relations with Washington.
Harvard students take classes for a long time
A new course at Harvard University has given all students more sleep in an effort to counter the growing tendency of students to wake up and learn all night with the help of caffeine tablets.
A study found that students at the best university in the world often know little or nothing about thinking about themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and the Women’s Hospital, designed the course and believes it is the first of its kind in the United States.
He got the idea to do the course after giving a lecture on the effect that sleep deprivation has on learning ability.
“At the end of the lecture, a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why is this being said to me for the first time now, in my final year?’
She said no one had told her anything about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told Telegraph.
The course, which is held for the first time this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleeping habits help learning ability and performance in sports and even contribute to general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the school’s director of health care, said the university had decided to introduce the course after finding that students were extremely sleepy over the week.
The course is an hour long and includes a variety of interactive tasks.
In one part is a picture of a room in a homestay, where students click on a cup of coffee, curtains, sports shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how performance in sports can worsen during lack of sleep, as well as the importance of a good routine for sleep.
In another section, participants are told how lack of long-term sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Maps of the school area with interactive symbols then encourage participants to think about their daily habits.
“We know that this will not change the behavior of the students.
But we feel they have a right to know this, just as a person has a right to know about the health effects of smoking cigarettes,” added Professor Czeisler.
The culture that honors those who wake up and learn all night is still present, he said, adding that modern technology and increased pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Assurance of getting enough sleep of good quality should be a "secret weapon" of students to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - even to avoid obesity, because sleep deprivation increases the call of the brain for food so that the body is starving.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student of chemistry and physics from California, helped Professor Czeisler put the course together, who was one of the professor’s choirs last year in his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and encouraged him to call for a course for all students in the school.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all master students to complete a similar course before they start studying at the university.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm clock, which reminds them to go to sleep, and to wake them, and keep in mind the damaging effects of blue light emitted by electronic displays and LED lights, which can confuse the internal clock of the body and lead to trouble with falling.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mark from Menga shoots down Gerrard's men
The Rangers were still struggling on the field when Stevens Gerrard's disintegrated team had to accept a 1-0 loss to Livingston, following a goal from Dolly Menga.
The Ibrox team wanted to make their first win on the field after their win at St Johnstone in February, but the Gary Holt team only gave Gerrards their second loss in his 18 games as manager. The team is now eight points behind Hearts, which is in the top spot in the Ladbrokes Premiership division.
Menga scored seven minutes before halftime and the Rangers team seemed to be lacking all inspiration and was never likely to equalize.
The Rangers now fall to sixth place, but Livingston goes up to third and are only behind Hibernian in goal difference.
Rangers could get into further trouble after liner Calum Spence had to receive care for a head injury after some object was thrown into him from the field half of the guests.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that swept Ayr away and came in a draw in the Betfred Cup.
Holt, however, remained with the same Livi 11 lineup that reached a level of Hearts last week and he would have been pleased with how well-trained his teammates dominated the resistance.
The Rangers were perhaps more with the ball, but Livingston created more opportunities with the ball it reached.
They should have scored just two minutes after the start of the game when Menga's first pass came Scott Pitman in front of Allan McGregor's goal, but he passed.
Long extra kicks from Keaghan Jacobs then ended with Craig Halkett but Alan Lithgow, his defender, shot past the pole.
The Rangers regained control of the game, but seemed to live in hope rather than faith in their game in the final third of the game.
Alfredo Morales certainly felt he should have been fined when a quarter of the game was over, when he and Steven Lawless came together, but judge Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's call.
The Rangers only scored two shots in the first half but Liam Kelly, former Ibrox goaltender, didn’t have to have much to do with defending the bald from Lassana Coulibaly and an easy shot from Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livi's 34th minute chance would have come despite the other team having the upper hand, no one can deny that they deserved it, though not just because of their perseverance.
The Rangers again failed to make anything out of a long extra kick from the Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his calm and chose to send to Menga who then scored easily.
Gerrard took on his part in the half and sent Ryan Kent in in place of Coulibaly, and the switches had an effect near the same time the backguard came in Morelos, but Kelly quickly responded and ran forward to close the shot.
Livingston, however, continued to trick the guests into playing the exact type of game they enjoy playing, and Lithgow and Halkett got each long shipment on the feet of another.
Holt's team could have increased their lead in the finals, but McGregor did well to deny Jacobs a chance before Lithgow ran to the mark from the corner.
Glenn Middleton, a Rangers deputy, wanted another penalty when he and Jacobs fell down together, but Thomson dismissed it again.
The Man Who Invented the Geiger Counter
Here is a page from our calendar “Sunday Morning”: 30 September, 1882, 136 years ago today and <0xC3><0x81>FRAM... this is the day that the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for studying and measuring radioactivity and that invention eventually led to a device called Geiger meter.
The Geiger meter has gained a firm place in the scientific world since then, but was also popular in the pop magazine, for example in the 1950 film “Bells of Coronado”, with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in unlikely roles as scientists:
He said, “What the hell is this?”
Rogers: “This is a Geiger meter, used to detect radioactive materials such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on you, you can hear the effect of the atoms because of the radioactivity in the stones."
Evans: “It’s really breaking right now!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” dangerous cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” dangerous cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to identify dangerous cells as part of treatment
The treatment involves taking immune cells from the patient and modifying them in a laboratory
They can then “see” protein, which is common in many cancer cells, and are then injected back into the patient.
Experimental-stage vaccines have shown positive results in patients suffering from different types of cancer.
In one woman who received the vaccine, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months. The vaccine teaches immune cells to identify dangerous cancer cells.
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient and modifying them in a laboratory so that they can “see” a protein called HER2 that is found in many types of cancer. Then the cells are injected back into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. Cancer Institute in Bethesday, Maryland, said: “Our findings indicate that the vaccine is highly effective.”
“HER2 stops various types of cancer from growing,” including breast, ovarian, lung, and rectum cancers, said Professor Berzofsky.
A similar procedure in which immune cells are taken from patients and they are "knowledged" to attack cancer cells has worked in the treatment of one type of leukaemia.
Kanye West held a long speech in support of Trump and wore the MAGA cap after appearing on the SNL television show.
It did not end well
Kanye West was featured in the studio on Saturday Night Live after a long speech praising President Donald Trump and saying he would run for president in 2020.
After performing the third song of the night, Ghost Town, where he wore the Make America Great hat, he spoke long against democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“I’ve talked so many times to white people who say, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s a racial hater?’
“If I was worried about racial hatred, I would have long since moved out of the United States,” he said.
SNL began the show with a play in which Hollywood star Matt Damon made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee over the allegations of sexual harassment by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the long-range West has not been released, the recording of it was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
Not sure if Rock wanted to make fun of West by publishing the recording.
West had also complained to the audience that he had received a bad reception in the backfield because of his hat roll.
“I was in the backyard.
They said to me, “Don’t go up to the field with this hat.”
They put me in bullying!
Then they say I'm in a deep hole," he said, according to news from the Washington Examiner.
West continued, “Do you want to see the deep hole?” and said that he would put on his superhero’s gown “because that means you can’t order me to do things. Do you want the world to progress?
“Test your love.”
His remarks were met with a bubble from the audience at least twice, and SNL actors seemed embarrassing, according to Variety, and one attendee said to the paper, "It became stone silence in the studio."
West had been invited to replace singer-songwriter Arianna Grande, whose boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with his stage performance as he sang the song I Love It, dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
West received support from Candace Turner, leader of the conservative TPUSA party, who tweeted: “To one of the bravest souls: THANK YOU FOR SHOWING MUCH MULTIMEASTERS.”
But chat director Karen Hunter said on Twitter that West was simply “being himself and it’s absolutely wonderful.”
“But I chose not to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his ‘art’) who I feel is supporting and spreading ideologies that are harmful to my society.
He's free.
“We are too,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now “the creature formerly known as Kanye West.”
He is not the first artist to change his name and footsteps in the footsteps of Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, has also called himself Snoop Lion and must not forget the music legend Prince Promise, who changed his name to a symbol and later called himself the artist who was formerly known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder after knife attack at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after being stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Tuesday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The defendant is expected to appear in a courtroom in Belfast on Monday.
The prosecutor will go over the charges.
Kit Harington, the Star of the Crown, Criticizes Poisonous Maleness
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent adventure series The Crown.
The actor, 31, however, has criticized the stereotype of the male hero, saying that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they need to be hard on themselves to gain respect.
In an interview with Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes “something went wrong” and wondered how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his co-star from The Crown, 31-year-old Rose Leslie, admitted that he had "strong opinions" on how to deal with this issue.
“Personally, I feel at the moment – what has gone wrong with maleness?”
“What have we taught men in their upbringing about the problems we are seeing now?”
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity, due to the highly masculine characters on television.
He continued: “What is congenital and what is taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets that makes young boys feel like they have to be a certain type of man?
I think that’s one of the most important questions of our time – how do we change this?
It’s obvious that something has gone wrong with young men.”
He also admitted in the interview that he would not play in any other Crown series after the season's like next summer and said he had had "enough of battlefields and horses."
Starting November, Kit will star in a remake of True West, a film by Sam Shepard, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother who is a thief.
The actor recently said that the best thing about having played in the Crown Games was to have met his wife, Rose.
“I met my wife in these shows, so they gave me somehow my future family and my life afterwards,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the lover of Jon Snow who played Kit in these Emmy Awards.
The couple married in June 2018, on the land of Lesliar's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China Reports 14% Increase in New Infections
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of people infected with HIV or AIDS.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people are infected in the country.
About 40,000 new infections were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new infections came with sex, which is a change from what was before.
Previously, the HIV virus spread rapidly in some parts of China due to donations of infected blood.
On the other hand, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has fallen to almost zero, according to Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people infected with HIV or AIDS has increased by 100,000 from year to year.
Sex-induced HIV infection is a serious problem within the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been illegal in China since 1997, but there is still a lot of discrimination against LGBT people.
Because of conservative values in the country, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men eventually marry a woman.
Many contractions are caused by inadequate contraception in these marriages.
Since 2003, China’s government has promised access for everyone to HIV drugs as part of a plan to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee has leaked data from Senators of the Republic, criticizing "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy doctrines"
Senator Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that one of her employees had posted personal information of three Republican Senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Democrat from Los Angeles said these allegations came from “extremely right-wing” extremists and websites.
"Lies, lies, and more nasty lies," Waters said in a statement.
The information published included the addresses and phone numbers of United States Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of whom are from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday from an unknown party at Capitol Hill during an interrogation at the Senate of Brett Kavanaugh, nominated by the Supreme Court, over allegations of sexual harassment.
The play came sometime after the three Senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState said the IP numbers identifying the source of the information were linked to Waters' office and disclosed information about one of her employees, according to Capitol Hill information.
"This unsubstantiated accusation is absolutely wrong and a pure lie," Waters continued.
“My employee – whose personal data and security are now at risk because of these incorrect allegations – bears no responsibility in any way for this misinformation.
This unsubstantiated accusation is absolutely wrong and a pure lie.”
Waters’ statement was quickly criticized online, including by Ara Fleischer, a former White House news representative.
“This denial is full of anger,” Fleischer wrote.
“That means she doesn’t have the temper to sit in the Senate.
When someone is accused for no reason, do not react with anger.
There can be no opposition.
You can’t ask for the reasons for what you’re saying.
It has to be calm and calm.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters’ reaction to the criticism of Kavanaugh judges, who critics said seemed too angry at the trial on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, the candidate Republican against Waters in the midterm elections, also said his opinion on Twitter.
“It’s a big deal, if it’s true,” he whispered.
In her statement, Waters said her office had "revealed these untrue allegations to appropriate authorities and law enforcement officials.
"We will ensure that the guilty are found," she continued, "and that they are held accountable for all the actions that are damaging and dangerous to all my employees."
Johnny English Strikes Again – A Spider-Man with Rowan Atkinson
It has become a habit to look for Brexit references in all the new films where Britain comes into play, and that seems to apply in this revival of the Johnny English comic series – which began in 2003 with the film Johnny English and rightly resurrected in 2011 with the film Johnny English Reborn.
Will this satirical argument about how clearly we are a new export opportunity for the country?
Whether that be the case or not, the outcast, gretty and clever Johnny English has been granted a renewed license for the second time to mess everything up - his name shows above all that he is a creative work designed for exhibitions in countries other than English-speaking countries.
He is, of course, the witty secret serviceman who pretends to have captivating characters, but is a little mix of Clouseau, that of Mr. Bean, and a little plain of the man who played one note for the song Chariots of Fire at the 2012 London Olympic Opening.
It is also originally based on the traveler and mysterious citizen that Atkinson once played in the forgotten Barclaycard television commercials, where he left everything to himself in chaos.
There is one or two great items in this latest Johnny English film.
I enjoyed seeing Johnny English walking on a helicopter wearing a medieval brow and the helicopter blades skulled in his helmet.
Atkinson clearly shows his oddities, but the humor seems rather powerless and oddly superficial, especially now that “serious” movies like James Bond and the Mission Impossible movies also offer no hesitation in joking.
The joke seems to be intended for children rather than adults, and I thought the adventures that Johnny English got into weren’t as imaginative and concentrated as Atkinson’s silent jokes in Mr. Beans’ artwork.
The main reason for this is that the UK is in serious trouble.
A computer hacker has managed to break into Britain’s secret network of spies and uncover the identity of all British spies, to the dismay of the spy who is on the watch – where, unfortunately, Kevin Eldon appears in too little role.
This is the final line for the prime minister, who is a proud and controversial figure and already in a state of disarray due to the enormous political hostility: Emma Thompson is doing her best with her role as a character to remind of Theresa May, but the script is not up to many fish for her.
Her advisers tell her that all active spies are in danger and that she must find someone who had already been seated in a sacred stone.
And that’s where Johnny English himself, now a director at some fine school, comes into play, but also secretly teaches how to be a spy: here are some funny jokes that English offers about a spy school reminiscent of the film School of Rock.
English is summoned back to Whitehall at an emergency meeting and meets Bough, his former tired companion, who plays Ben Miller again.
Bough is now a married man, his wife is a submarine manager, but in that energetic role, Vicki Pepperdine does not quite let her light shine.
The spy odor that messes up everything in her Majesty’s service has now returned to the gear and meets the hawk Ophelia Bulletovu, played by Olgu Kurylenko.
At the same time, the Prime Minister is about to be captivated by the magic of the fascinating billionaire in the tech sector, who claims to be able to get rid of Britain’s computer virus: it’s the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their trap journeys: they spark a fine French restaurant disguised as servants, they smuggle as they smuggle themselves into the luxury necklace of Volta, and English turns everything upside down as he tries to use virtual reality glasses to familiarize himself with the infrastructure of Volta’s house.
There is nothing to be spared in that final detail, but although the film is lively and energetic, it does contain some of the children’s material in its entirety.
Medium good material.
And just like the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but think: can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really matches his talents?
The Labour Party denies that it is preparing a four-day work week plan for Britain, with the same salary as for five days a week.
The Labour Party, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is now considering a radical plan that would allow Britain to work for four days a week, but get paid for five.
According to the party, it wants to allow corporate executives to take advantage of the savings generated by the revolution in artificial intelligence, and to allow employees to benefit from having one extra day off.
Employees can enjoy a three-day weekend without pay cuts.
Sources say that the idea would "fit" with the party's economic plan and its policy of improving the welfare of workers.
Trades Union Congress has supported a four-day workweek shortening, allowing workers to take advantage of changes in the economy.
A senior Labour official told the Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
“The change will not happen in one night, but four-day working week is a goal that matches the Party’s approach to transforming the economy for the benefit of workers and the Party’s overall industry policy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first party to support this idea, but the Green Party promised a four-day working week in its 2017 election campaign.
However, the goal is not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: “Four days of work week is not on the party’s policy sheet and the party is not considering implementing it.”
John McDonnell, the shadow ministry’s trade secretary, used the Labour Party conference last week to explain his ideas on the social revolution within the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from "unknown chief executives" and "profit collectors" supply companies.
The shadow minister's plans also mean that current shareholders in water supply companies may not get their full share back as the Labour Party government could impose a "withdrawal" for suspected wrongdoing.
He has also confirmed plans to put workers on corporate boards and create a joint holding fund to leave 10 per cent of the assets of private companies to their employees, who could receive <0xC2><0xA3>500 in dividends from them annually.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy Say “60 Minutes” Whether the FBI Investigation on Kavanaugh Could Get Them to Change Their Minds
The FBI's investigation into Brett Kavanaugh's allegations has caused at least a week-long delay in the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court, raising the question of whether its findings could lead Republicans to withdraw their support.
In an interview to be shown on Sunday, Scott Pelley, a reporter on the "60 Minutes" episode of Republicans and Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, asked if the FBI could reveal something that would get them to change their minds.
Kennedy appeared to be more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said when the trial started, I said I was talking to Kavanaugh’s judge.
I called him after the accusations were made and asked, “Did you do this?”
He was determined, steadfast, undoubted.”
Graham's vote, however, seems unchangeable.
"I have made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and it would take an incredible accusation to change that," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett firmly denied it," Graham added, addressing Christine Blasey Ford.
“No one who mentions her name could confirm it.
This case is 36 years old.
I don’t think anything new will change.”
What is the International Civil Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival will be held on Saturday in New York. It is an annual music event where a series of big stars will emerge and with a similarly impressive strategy; ending poverty around the world.
This is the seventh year in which the International Civil Festival is held and tens of thousands of people will flock to Central Park, not only to listen to music scenes from, among others, Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to draw attention to the real goal of the festival to put an end to the sore 20-poverty of the year.
The International Civil Festival, which was first held in 2012, is part of the Global Poverty Project, an international organization that seeks to end poverty by increasing the number of those who fight it.
To get free tickets to the event (except for those who want to pay for VIP tickets), concert attendees needed to complete a variety of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteering, sending emails to any of the world's leaders, making a phone call, or using other valid means to help target them.
But how much success has the festival achieved, now that 12 years are in the way of achieving the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free concerts a real way to persuade people to call for action, or is this just one so-called “click action” — where people feel it’s doing something that matters by signing up for a requirement list online or posting a message on Twitter?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, it has recorded over 19 million “actions” from its supporters, calling for a variety of different goals.
It says that these actions have helped to get the world’s leaders to declare commitments and policies equivalent to over $35 billion that will impact lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group counted up 390 commitments and announcements for its actions, of which at least $10 billion has been invested or raised.
The group estimates that the accumulated funds have hitherto directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One main commitment comes from The Power of Nutrition, an association of UK investors and executives working to “help children enjoy their fullest,” promising to provide $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country, after receiving 4700 Citizen Global messages on Twitter.
“With the support of the UK government, sponsors, governments around the world and internationals like you, we can make it a past social injustice as malnutrition,” said Tracey Ullmann, The Power of Nutrition’s representative, in a statement.
The group also said that after 5,000 appeals were sent that the UK should improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced the funding of the project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children and provide them with better nutrition.
On the list of common questions on the group’s website, one question is this: “Why do you think you can put an end to sore poverty?”
Global Citizen responded: “It will be a long and difficult task – sometimes we will fail constantly.
But, we will reach our limits, just like movements that fought for civil rights and the abolition of racial segregation ahead of us, because we are stronger together.
This year’s event will include Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Monáe. The event will be held in New York and the presenters will be Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use the US Navy as a "barrier" to prevent Russian energy exports, Interior Minister says
"If necessary," Washington could use the Navy to prevent energy from reaching markets in Russia, including the Middle East, said Ryan Zinke, U.S. Secretary of the Interior, according to a Washington Examiner report.
Zinke argued that Russia's assistance to Syria, especially as the country works at the discretion of the legitimate government there, was a proposal to explore new markets.
“I think the reason for their existence in the Middle East is because they want to do business with energy, like in Eastern Europe and its southern parts,” he said.
And, according to the official announcement, there are ways and methods to combat it.
"The United States can use the Navy to ensure that sea routes are open and to create barriers, if necessary, to ensure that the energy from them does not get to the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the Consumer Energy Alliance, a charity called “the voice of the energy consumer” in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington’s approach to dealing with Russia and Iran and said it was more or less the same.
“The economic option for Iran and Russia is more and less exploitation of energy sources and replacing them with others,” he said, saying Russia has only one card in its sleeve with an economy that would depend on fossil fuels.
The announcement comes as a result of the Trump administration’s desire to increase its exports of natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To do this, officials in Trump’s administration, including President Donald Trump himself, have tried to get Germany to stop participating in the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 project of putting in a new power line, which Trump says would make Berlin “capture” Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly claimed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 power supply, which will double the capacity of the current pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Russians say that Washington’s strong opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we share the view that energy should not be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The position of the United States has been criticized by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The German Federation of German Industries (BDI) has called on the United States not to change the EU energy policy and the bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
“I am very unhappy that foreign states are changing their energy sources,” said Dieter Kempf, chairman of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "consider seriously" running for president in 2020, she said.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "consider seriously" running for president after the mid-term elections.
Warren confirmed that she would consider attending a civil assembly in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and beat our government, and then we need a woman as a leader,” she said.
“After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for President.”
Warren spoke about President Donald Trump at the meeting, saying he was “going with the country in the wrong direction.
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been eager to criticize Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his nominee.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, “Of course, we have to have the FBI investigate the case before the vote takes place.”
However, a poll published on Thursday shows that the majority of voters in Warren’s state do not think that it should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts “probable” voters said the Senator should not run, according to a poll published by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent said they supported her offer.
The survey showed more support for Deval Patrick, the former prime minister, with 38 percent saying he supported his potential supply and 48 percent saying they were against it.
Among other popular Democrats who were discussed for a possible 2020 presidential nomination were former vice-president Joe Biden, and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he will make an official decision in January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin Talks About Track Palin’s Disaster Disorder at Donald Trump’s Election
Track Palin, 26, was in Iraq for one year after joining the army in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"My son is going through a lot of trouble after coming back, I feel with other families who are affected by traumatic stress disorder and the spiritual wounds our soldiers are returning home with," she told an audience at a Donald Trump poll in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest “the elephant in the room” and said that her son and other warriors “come back a little differently, they are hardened and wonder if there is any respect for what their fellow soldiers in the army and the air forces and other armed forces have done for the country.”
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, for attempting to obstruct the reporting of domestic violence and for gun violence under the influence of alcohol, according to Wasilla Police Department spokesman Dan Bennett.
18 counties and Washington D.C. support challenge against new asylum seeker policy
Eighteen states and Washington City support a legal challenge to the U.S.’s new policy of denying victims fleeing gang or domestic violence asylum.
Representatives of the 18 counties and the city submitted a court report on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who opposes the policy, according to a news report from NBC News.
The full name of the prosecutor in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against the federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said her spouse, "and his violent sons who were gang members," had violently abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her application for asylum on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
Prosecutors in support of Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala as countries where gang-related problems and domestic violence are growing, and the number of asylum seekers to the United States comes from these countries.
The new asylum-seeking policy revokes a ruling issued by the Immigrant Appeals Committee in 2014 to allow unregistered immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Washington prosecutor Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy “rejected several decades of federal and international law.”
“Federal law requires that all asylum applications be decided on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the application, and this policy violates this rule,” the court report said.
Lawyers further stated in the report that the policy of refusing immigration would be detrimental to the U.S. economy, arguing that immigrants were more likely to set up businesses and “given vital workforce.”
Jeff Sessions, a state prosecutor, ordered immigrant judges to stop providing asylum to victims who fled domestic and gang violence in June.
“Those who leave their home country because of persecution based on race, religion, ethnicity, or membership of a certain social group or political opinion can apply for asylum,” Sessions said in his statement on June 11.
Refugees were never meant to solve all the problems, not even all the serious ones, that people deal with every day around the world.
Desperate rescue operations in a race to find survivors in Palu, the number of dead doubles
The situation is becoming more difficult for survivors.
“There’s a lot of tension in the air,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she comforted her sick son at the aid center in the city of Palu.
“Ambulances bring bodies here all the time.
There’s little about clean water.”
Residents were seen returning to their desolate homes and searching for their possessions in water to try to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals are overcrowded and damaged after the earthquake, which measured 7.5 points on the Richter scale.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had a back and shoulder fracture, lay outside the Palu military hospital, where patients were encouraged to stay outdoors due to continued severe aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he told how he found the earthquake shaking his hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save ourselves.
I pushed up to the walls, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, saying his family had been in town to go to a wedding.
“I heard my wife call for help, but then silence.
I don’t know what happened to her or my daughter.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of “persecution” with “vegetation advertisements”
A week after China's official newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a US newspaper to discuss mutual benefits in trade between the two countries, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of exploiting US media to spread agitation.
U.S. President Donald Trump spoke last Wednesday about the Chinese newspaper’s advertisement in the Des Moines Register — the most popular newspaper in Iowa — after accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. parliamentary elections that will take place on November 6. China denies this accusation.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing wanted to interfere in the U.S. parliamentary elections marked what U.S. officials told Reuters that was a new stage in an expanding campaign from Washington to apply pressure on China.
While it’s normal for foreign governments to publish ads to push business, Beijing and Washington are in a ever-increasing trade war, with new tariffs on imports from both countries.
Chinese and US experts say China’s revenge tariffs early in the trade war were designed to harm exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported Trump’s Republican party.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former Governor of Iowa for the long term, which the state exports a lot of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad said in a Sunday paper in the Des Moines Register that “China is now intensifying its persecution by publishing propaganda ads in our own free media.”
“By spreading its fad, the government of China is taking advantage of the beloved U.S. free speech tradition and our free media by publishing a costly advertisement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad said in his article.
"On the other hand, there are few protesting ranks in the press on the streets of Beijing, and there is no true reflection of the different views that the Chinese might have on China's worrying economic policy, as the media is trapped under the heels of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the biggest newspapers in China escaped the offer to publish" his article, but he did not mention which newspaper it was.
Experts warn that Republicans are making female voters dismiss them for the mid-term elections with the Kavanaugh case.
Experts have warned of negative reactions, especially from women, in the next midterm polls, because many Republicans have backed and defended Brett Kavanaugh, a nominated Supreme Court judge, who has faced allegations of sexual harassment.
Very strong feelings have been around this issue and most Republicans have already publicly shown that they wanted to start voting.
“There’s no backing to these things,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School Institute at the University of Syracuse, told The Hill on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that the last-minute call by Republican Senator Jeff Flake on an FBI investigation would be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget tomorrow and not in November," MoveOn spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre said on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters sang “November is approaching!” as they protested in the Senate’s corridors when the Republicans running the ruling committee decided to continue nominating Kavanaugh, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony, according to Mic.
"The interest and enthusiasm of voters will rise above all power," Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news website.
“People will say that the interest has already been great and that’s true.
But he could be greater, especially among female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, aged 18-29, who dislike the president, but rarely vote."
Analysts predicted a setback if Republicans pushed for Kavanaugh to be confirmed, even before Ford’s testimony where she described her allegations of sexual harassment from him.
"This has become a big mess for the Republican Party," Michael Still, a former member of the Republican Party's national committee, said early last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee’s vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be left in the classroom, it’s also about how the Republicans have handled it and how they’ve treated it,” said Guy Cecil, chairman of Priorities USA, a group that helps vote for the Democrats.
However, Americans seem to disagree with who to believe after the testimony of both Ford and Kavanaugh, and a narrow majority support the latter.
A recent YouGov poll found that 41 percent of respondents believed, or probably believed, Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they believed, or probably believed, Kavanaugh’s testimony.
In addition, 38 percent of respondents said they believed Kavanaugh had probably or definitely lied in his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following the appeal from Flake, the FBI is now investigating the allegations made by Ford and from at least one other woman, Deborah Ramirez, according to a Guardian report.
Ford testified before the Senate ruling committee last week that Kavanaugh had attacked her when she was 17 and that he had been under the influence of alcohol.
Ramirez says Kavanaugh carried his genitals in front of her when they were both at a party at Yale University in the 1990s.
The man who invented the internet has plans to start a new internet to fight against Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the man who invented the Internet, plans to start a sprout company to fight against Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the Solid, open platform of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people are allowed to access any information.
In a private interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt was “world domination.”
"We have to do this now," he said of the company.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application uses technology from Solid to enable people to create their own "personal data store online" or POD.
There you can have a list of contacts, task list, calendar, music library and other personal and work related devices.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all in one browser and all at the same time.
The unique thing about the personal data store is that it is entirely up to the user who can access any information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment by using data.”
According to John Bruce, CEO of the company, the idea of Inrupt is that the company provides resources, processes and appropriate skills to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
Now the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers hired as developers to work on the project, and a group of volunteer developers.
As of this week, technology developers around the world can create their own independent applications with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team shouldn’t be in talks with “Facebook and Google about whether to bring about a complete change that would put their current business model on the head in one night.
“We don’t ask for permission.”
Berners-Lee wrote in an article published on Saturday on Medium that Inrupt had “the goal of creating energy in business and ecosystems that help protect the honesty and quality of the new web based on Solid.”

Bernard Vann: Priest and holder of the Victorian Cross of the First World War honored
The only English priest to be honored with the Victorian Cross in World War I, a soldier has been honored in his hometown 100 years later.
On September 29, 1918, Bernard Vann, who served in the army, was given the crucifixion in the assault on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, a sniper killed him four days later and he never learned that he had received the highest honor of the British Army.
Two of his grandchildren uncovered monuments to him at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "wonderfully symbolic" that the memorial was uncovered exactly 100 years from his grandfather's honor.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Vann led his army across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through extremely thick fog and under a harsh fire from cannons and machine guns."
Later, he ran to the line of fire and with "a lot of courage" he led the line ahead before attacking one of his team's cannons and overpowering three soldiers.
He was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s heroic actions were “something I could never do, but something that makes you humble.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also placed a crown of flowers after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was “a great honor to participate in the parade” and added that “the deeds of a true hero are shown with the support that so many show.”
MMA fans woke up all night to watch Bellator 206, instead got to see Gurru pigs
Just imagine, having woken up all night to see the crowded Bellator 206, just to be denied to see the main event.
The program included 13 battles from San Jose, six of which were on the main chart and were broadcast live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., precisely as Gegard Mousasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to fight, British viewers received an unexpected incident when the broadcast turned into a Gurru pig.
Some were dissatisfied after waking up all night to watch the battle.
One Twitter fan described the switch to children’s content as “some kind of sick joke.”
“According to official rules, the content was not eligible for viewers at six o’clock in the morning so they had to switch to children’s content,” said Dave Schwartz, vice president of marketing and communications for Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
"Gurry pigs, yes."
Scott Coker, CEO of Bellator, said they would review their schedules and take audiences in the UK into account in the future.
“I think when I think about the re-release, we could probably get out of this,” Coker said.
“But it’s six o’clock in the morning on Sunday there and we can’t resolve this until Sunday at our time, which is Monday with them.
But we are working on this.
Believe me, when the broadcast was switched, a lot of text messages were sent back and forth, and they weren’t all friendly.
We were trying to fix this, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn’t, it was an official problem.
I can promise that it won’t happen next time.
We limit the night to five battles instead of six, as usual, but we tried too much and went ahead.
This is an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'disability' because of sexual orientation
Olympic diver Tom Daley said he had felt a weakness towards other people in his upbringing because of his sexuality, but that encouraged him to succeed.
The 24-year-old Daley said he hadn’t realized that “he was different” until he went to high school.
On the radio show Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, with Lauren Laverne, Daley said he spoke about the rights of homosexuals to give others “hope.”
He also said that his parenting role had diminished his interest in winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the regular director, has taken a few months off due to illness.
Daley appeared in the first episode of Laverne, saying that he felt he was "a lesser man" than everyone else when he was a child because "it was not accepted in society to be fond of both boys and girls."
He said: “To this day, these feelings of being inferior and different have given me the power and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something,” he said, so that he would not disappoint anyone when he finally came up with his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze medalist has earned a lot as a supporter of LGBT and used his participation in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more nations to legalize homosexuality.
He said he wanted to be heard because he felt lucky to be able to live publicly without punishment and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said it had "surprised him" to fall in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he first met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but said the age difference had never been a problem.
“When you go through so much at a young age” – but he took part in his first Olympic Games at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later – he said it was hard to find a peer who had experienced similar success and difficulty.
The couple adopted a child in June, a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that "all his views" had been convicted.
“If you had asked me last year, it was all about winning a gold prize,” he said.
“You know, there are more important things than a gold medal at the Olympics.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal.”
His son is christened in the head of Robert, his father who died in 2011, aged forty, after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father had not accepted his death and one of the last questions he had asked was whether they had received their tickets for London 2012 – because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him he wouldn’t live long enough to sit in the front row,” he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it wasn't until his breath stopped and he was left to admit that he wasn't invincible," he said.
Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“I just knew I had dreamed of this all my life, immersing myself in front of audiences at home at the Olympics. It doesn’t feel any better,” he said.
It was also inspired by the selection of the first song - Proud by Heather Small - which had inspired him for the Olympics and still gave him goose skin.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 a.m. UK local time.
Mickelson in bad shape and dead sitting on class in Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will beat records on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he has to recover his old rhythm so that the record is not surrounded by bad memories.
Mickelson, who plays in the race for the 12th time, which is a record, was left to sit in the class after captain Jim Furyk's decision for the four-ball and four-game races on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of the game, as it has been so many times before for the United States, the day of the five-time champion is divided between being a cheerleader and practicing the plays on the pitch in the hope of correcting what he thinks is wrong.
Mickelson, 48 years old, was never the shooter who targeted the drummers, and is not the best player for the Le Golf National golf course, where long-stack punches are often punished for bad shots.
And not only is the golf course a challenge in itself, but Mickelson has to compete against Frances Molinari, winner of the British Open, in the ninth game on Sunday. Molinari is teamed by newcomer Tommy Fleetwood and together they have won all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, who are four points below, take the first game of 12 singles games, get a good start, Mickelson’s game could be crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, but he could hardly say anything else.
“He perfectly understood the role he had today, patted me on the back and hugged me and said he’d be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of self-confidence.
He is in the famous palace and he has been so much better for the teams earlier and this week.
I didn’t expect him to play two games.
I saw more, but that’s how it ended and we thought we had to go this way.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo in a number of games played in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This could mark the end of the Ryder Cup process that has never reached quite as high as other achievements on his record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 ties, but Furyk said his presence had a certain unclear effect on the team.
“He’s funny, he’s ironic, he’s cheerful, he enjoys making fun of people, and it’s great to have him in the team room,” he explained.
“I think the younger players enjoyed playing with him this week too, and it was fun to see.
He gives so much more than just the game of golf."
Thomas Bjorn, the European leader knows that a lot of advantage can quickly disappear
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows from experience that a good advantage for the last day of the individual race in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an unpleasant experience.
The Dane first played in Valderrama in 1997, where the side under the command of captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but managed to push the victory at the end with the smallest possible difference of points, with 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 wins.
“You always remember that we had a big advantage in Valderrama, we had a big advantage in Brookline where we lost and in Valderrama where we won, but only right now,” said Bjorn, who can be seen here in the picture, after watching the 2018 vintage win 5-3 on both Friday and Saturday.
The story will show me and everyone in the team that this is not over.
We'll all work until tomorrow.
Let's go and do everything right.
This isn’t over until all the points are on the table.
We have our goal and it is trying to win this cup, we focus on it
I’ve always said this, I focus on the 12 players in our team, but we’re very aware of our opponents in the other team – the best golfers in the world.”
Bjorn was delighted with the way his players had stood on a difficult field and added: “I’m never going to get ahead of myself in this.
Tomorrow will be different.
Tomorrow, it’s the performance of the individual that matters, and that’s another thing.
It’s great to play with a partner when everything is going well, but when one plays one, all one’s abilities as a golfer are tried.
It’s the message that needs to be sent to the players, to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he also needs to play his best game himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, will strive to make his players stand out in individual matches rather than with peers, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Furyk himself has experienced both sides of this big change on the last day, but he was victorious with his team at Brookline but ended up losing when Europe performed the “miracle in Medinah.”
“I remember every fucking word,” he replied, asking how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, had encouraged his players to continue for the last day.
“We need to play 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to start fast, as happened in Brookline and Medinah.
As the sliding approaches building up, it causes a lot of pressure on the games that are in the middle.
We ordered our players accordingly and let them play the way we think tomorrow will be the best.”
Thomas has been tasked with trying to lead the defense and play against Rory McIlroy in the first game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other European players in the first half of the games.
“I chose these players in this series because I think they’ll cover all the way through,” Bjorn said about his choice of players in the individual race.
Germany's new warship is still suspended
The German Navy’s newest warship should have been built in 2014 to replace old warships from the Cold War period, but it will not be ready until next year due to broken systems and ever-increasing costs, according to news in the area.
The construction of the “Rheinland-Pfalz”, the leading ship of the brand new warships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to a military spokesman who spoke to the newspaper Die Zeit.
The ship was supposed to be in service with the Navy in 2014, but serious problems after the ship's delivery made the project difficult.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered by the Navy in 2007 are to replace the Bremen class ships, which have come to their age.
They should be equipped with a more powerful cannon, many anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and hiding technologies such as reduced radar, infrared, and sound signals.
Other important features are longer service life - it should be possible to use the latest ships for up to two years away from their home ports.
However, constant delays mean that this latest type of warship - which is said to enable Germany to show its strength at sea - will be obsolete when they are finally put into service, Die Zeit says.
The F125 came to the news last year when the German army officially refused to accept the emulsion and returned it to the Blohm & Voss drop in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy has returned a ship to the manufacturer after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the separation, but German media spoke of a number of women's serious "defects in software and hardware" that rendered the military ship useless if it was sent to war.
Software deficiencies were particularly important because the warships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be operated by 120 crew members, which is half the size of the warships of the Bremen class.
It was also found that the ship was far too heavy, which diminishes its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to make improvements to it in the future.
The 7,000-ton ship Rhineland-Palatinate is estimated to be twice the weight of ships of a similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to hardware defects, the cost of the entire project - including the training of the crew - is beginning to cause problems.
It is said to have reached <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), but was originally expected to be <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
Problems that plague the latest ships are particularly important in light of the warnings that the Germans’ preponderance on the sea is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German parliament’s defence committee, admitted that the Navy was actually going to be “suppressed by operational ships.”
The officer said that the problem had resolved over time, because older ships were decommissioned but no ships came in their place.
He regretted that none of the orders of the Baden-Wuerttemberg group could be adopted by the Navy.
The National Trust Nature Conservation Organization spies on the secret life of blackheads
A new study, conducted in the Scottish Highlands, aims to find out how leopards use the landscape when hunting for food.
It is hoped that the results will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide conservation actions in the future.
The study, led by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland, will monitor different types of leather blossoms in the Inverewe gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be installed at key locations around the area to monitor the behavior of the blackheads over the period.
NHS staff and volunteers will also go on surveillance tours with handheld sensors.
Experts will audio-analyze all recordings to get to the frequency of the calls, which the leather balloons emit, and what kinds do what.
A map of the habitat and a report will then be published to create a detailed picture of their behaviour on a geographical scale.
Rob Dewar, an NTS nightlife advisor, hopes that the findings will reveal what habitats are most important for the leather leaflets and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management, e.g. by creating meadows and how best to maintain forestry for lizards and other related species.
In the last century, there has been a significant decline in leather blotches in Scotland and across the UK.
They are at risk because of construction and development projects that affect their nests and reduce their habitat.
Windmills and light can also pose risks, including fly paper and certain chemical treatments on building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
In fact, squirrels aren’t blind.
However, their ears are much more useful than their eyes when it comes to hunting prey, because they are used to hunting at night.
They use state-of-the-art radiographing technology to locate insects and objects on their flight paths.
NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes leatherboard very seriously.
Ten specialists are employed at the associations, who perform regular check-ups, nesting examinations and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization has even established Scotland’s first and only leather-bellied country at the Threave farm in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight out of ten Scottish leather-bellied species have their homes.
David Thompson, the farm manager, says he is the perfect place for them.
“The area here at Threave is great for leather balloons,” he said.
“We have old buildings, plenty of trees and lots of good habitats.
But there’s still a lot of unknowing about leather balls, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to thrive.”
He stressed the importance of checking with leather blubber before maintenance is carried out on dwellings, as the possible accidental destruction of a single nest can kill up to 400 female blubber and young and destroy all leather blubber in the area.
Leaders are protected and it is forbidden to kill them, harass or disturb, or destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish representative at the Bat Conservation Trust, has urged the public to help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about leather flakes and we don’t know how well many of them are going.”
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape as lawyers prepare lawsuit against German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called allegations of rape "fake news" and said people wanted to "call attention" by using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
Portugal and Juventus have been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is said to have paid her $375,000 for silencing the incident, according to Der Spiegel on Friday.
A few hours after the accusations were published, Ronaldo, 33, said in an Instagram Live video to his 142 million followers that they were “fake news.”
“No, no, no, no.
“This is fake news,” the world champion said to the camera.
“These people want to draw attention to themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
It wants to be famous by using my name, but that’s part of the job.
I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel for the allegations, which they have called “an unacceptable disclosure of privacy suspicions,” according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said Ronaldo would demand compensation for "a human injury of the same amount as the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident reportedly occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went back to the player’s room, where he allegedly raped her in the rectum, according to documents filed for Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga said Ronaldo fell to his knees after a disregarded incident and told her he was a "99 percent good man" who fell in temptation because of "1 percent."
The documents state that Ronaldo agreed that the couple had sex, but that it was with the consent of both.
Mayorga claimed that she had gone to the police and had pictures taken of her injuries in the hospital, but finally agreed to apologize outside the courtroom because she was "deadly afraid of revenge" and worried about being "humiliated publicly."
She now says she wants to quit because she is still in shock after a suspected incident.
Ronaldo was close to going to Real Madrid from Manchester United when the rape was supposed to have occurred, and this summer he switched to Italian giant Juve with a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: Britain would “regret forever” losing car manufacturers
The UK would “regret forever” if it lost its position as an international leader among car manufacturers after Brexit, says Greg Clark, Minister of Commerce.
He added that it was "concerned" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without a contract, the company would temporarily cease production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of delaying the border if Brexit without a contract would be a reality would cost jobs.
The Burnaston factory, which manufactures Toyota Auris and Avensis automobiles, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to other European Union countries.
“My opinion is that if the UK is withdrawn from the EU at the end of March, we will see production facilities in our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota CEO at Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers have expressed concerns about exiting the EU without agreement on how international trade should be conducted, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW says it will close its factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers say is supply chain risk if Brexit without a deal becomes a reality.
Toyota’s production line is based on a “last-minute” reception, where parts are delivered every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars manufactured on order.
If the UK withdraws from the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be disruption to the border, which the industry believes can lead to delays and a lack of components.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than daily stock at its factory in Derbyshire, the company said, and production would stop.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's Chequers programme for future relations with the EU "is specifically aimed at preventing these border-side views."
“We need to have a deal. We want to get the best deal that enables us to enjoy not only success in the present, but as an opportunity that we can take advantage of,” he said on BBC Radio 4.
“The evidence, not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers, shows that we need to be able to continue with very effective sources of supply.
Toyota could not say how long their production would be stopped, but warned that in the long run, increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is a trade union secretary at the factory, said that his colleagues were increasingly worried: “My experience is that when these jobs disappear, they will never come back.
The government spokesman said: “We have put forward a detailed and comprehensive plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
A meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House.
The White House said on Sunday that an important meeting between U.S. Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Donald Trump could be postponed “by one week” as the dispute over nominated Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller, a special prosecutor who investigates Russian incursions in elections, links between Trump’s assistants and Russia, and possible obstacles to the progress of justice by the President.
For several weeks, rumors have been circulating in Washington as to whether Trump will fire assistant prosecutors, thereby endangering Mueller’s independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times said Rosenstein had discussed wearing a recorder to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of overturning the president from office using the 25th additional article of the Constitution.
Rosenstein denied these allegations.
But last Monday he visited the White House, among the news that he was going to resign.
A meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, when he was at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he “prefers” not to dismiss Rosenstein, but then postponed the meeting because he was not at the same time as the hearing with the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who has accused him of sexual harassment, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, which postponed the Senate vote further.
Sarah Sander, Trump’s media representative, was on television on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “There has not been a date for him, it could be this week. I think he may be postponed another week because of everything else going on at the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see and it’s always a pleasure to inform the media.”
Some reporters disagree with this statement: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that a small number of meetings were not due to dissatisfaction with television reporters' "visibility," but she said: "I do not disagree with the fact that they have "visibility."
She then gave indications that a direct relationship between Trump and the media would increase.
"The president answers more questions from the media than any other president has before," she said, not referring to sources, "We've gone over these figures."
Sanders said: “If the media has a chance to ask the President of the United States directly, it’s much better than talking to me.
We’re trying to do a lot of it and you’ve seen us do a lot of it over the last few weeks and it’ll replace a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or media meetings with other leaders who visit him.
Media meetings with him alone are rare.
The president may have shown his reason in New York this week, when he showed unrestrained and at times odd behavior in front of a group of reporters.
Health Minister writes to EU health system staff in Scotland about concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health has written to staff from the EU working within the Scottish Health System (NHS Scotland) to express the nation’s gratitude and wish it to continue working after Brexit has passed.
Jeane Freeman sent a letter within six months of the UK leaving the EU.
The Scottish Government has already pledged to meet the costs of applying for a permit for EU citizens working in the public service sector.
Ms Freeman wrote in her letter: “During the summer, talks between the UK and the EU on resignation have continued and a decision is expected to be taken this autumn.
The British government has also been working on preparations if a deal is not possible.
I know this is going to be a lot of uncertainty for all of you.
Therefore, I want to reiterate how much I value the work of all the staff, no matter what their nationality.
Partners from the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and expertise that strengthens and improves the work of healthcare and benefits the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is truly your home and we want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, a liner for the Tennessee State Tigers, had to undergo emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in a 31-27 loss against Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, according to news from Mike Organ, a Tennessee journalist.
Rod Reed, head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the injury had occurred shortly before half-time.
“He came to the sideline and fell down there,” Reed said.
Coaches and ambulances gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before he was put on a bar and carried out for further examination.
Representative from Tennessee State Chris Harris, the WSMV radio station in Nashville, Tennessee, said Abercrombie had undergone surgery at Vanderbilt Hospital.
Harris added that there was "no information on the type or severity of the accident yet" and that Tennessee State was trying to find out when the accident occurred.
Abercrombie, who is in his final year of school, plays his first season with Tennessee State after relocating from Illinois.
He had five bucks in all on Saturday before he left, which raised the total number of bucks with him to 18.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamping fees when buying real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamping fees when buying real estate in the UK. The excess money will be used to help homeless people, according to the new Conservative Party plan
The action will nullify Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters
Increased stamping fees will be imposed on those who do not pay tax in the UK
The government plans to raise <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp fees when buying real estate in the UK. The excess money will be used to help homeless people. Theresa May will announce this today.
The action will be considered an attempt to nullify Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters by promising housing at affordable prices and taxing high-income people further.
Individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK will have to pay higher stamping fees, and the excess money will go into government action to help the homeless.
The increase – which is in addition to the current stamping fees, including the increase imposed two years ago on extra-homes and real estate purchases for rent – could be up to three percent.
The Treasury estimates that the increase will raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of new buildings in London are bought by foreign companies, but this causes price hikes and makes it harder for those who want to buy real estate for the first time to enter the market.
Many of the country's most populous areas - especially the capital - have become "dream towns" due to the number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp fees to help more young people acquire their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping real estate prices high by buying land but not using it, and urged May to cancel quotas on homes at affordable prices to fix Britain's "domestic shame".
Mr. Corbyn has announced a number of reputable improvements to housing, including lease controls and the closure of leased premises without charge.
He also wants to give advice more power to build a new home.
Theresa May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate myself to the restoration of the British dream in my first season – that every new generation should enjoy a better quality of life.
And that includes fixing our unused real estate market.
The doors of the UK will always be open to those who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it may not be true that it is as easy for foreign parties as for companies headquartered abroad to buy homes as it is for skillfully British nationals.
For many, the dream of their own home has become far too distant, and the disgrace that comes with homelessness is still too real.”
Jack Ross: “My main goal is to train Scotland”
Jack Ross, Sunderland's coach, says his "principal goal" is to become Scotland's coach.
This 42-year-old Scotsman now enjoys the challenge of reviving the North-East club, which now sits in third place in the first division, three levels from the top.
He moved to Sunderland this summer after returning St. Mirren to the Scottish Premier League in the last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I was injured on my knee and that was the end of it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
“But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden often with my dad as a child, and it’s always something that has pulled me back.
But that opportunity would only be given if I was able to train the team well.”
Forerunners Ross as coaches Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic coach said he felt no fear of following in the footsteps of such famous names at such a large club, which he had previously rejected coaching positions at Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“As of now, I will measure my success by thinking, ‘Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?’
This club is undoubtedly at home in the Premier League because of his structure and facilities," he said.
“It’s not an easy task to get him there, but I’d probably only consider myself successful here if I got back up there.”
Ross has only three years of experience as a coach, after a period as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and 15 months as part of a coaching team for Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from falling to the third division, and turned St Mirren, who was about to fall by division, into the league champion the next season.
Ross claims to be more confident now, but he was once in his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was probably a real time trial,” he says about the period when he became Alloa’s coach.
“I really believed that the coaching job was suitable for me, even more so than playing.
It sounds odd, because I was doing well, I had a decent income from it and enjoyed meable success.
Change can be difficult.
You have to go through a lot every week.
I’m still going through it in terms of stress and pressure from work, but the coaching job seems just right for me.
I always wanted to train and now I do, I’ve never felt better about myself in all my adult years.”

The best time for beer is at 5:30 p.m. on Saturdays, according to a survey.
The summer heatwave has proved profitable for British bars, but increased pressure on restaurant chains.
Sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7 per cent in July, while sales at restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent, according to figures.
Peter Martin, of CGA, which compiled the figures, said: “The continued sunshine and unexpected success of England in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern as the month of June, when bar sales increased by 2.8 percent, except for restaurants that sold even less.
Sales fell by 1.8 percent in restaurants in June and deteriorated again in July.
Pubs and bars, which were mainly aimed at drinking sales, stood out by far with more boom while restaurants went downhill.
Poppies who sold food also had a hard time in the sun, but not as much as restaurants.
People just wanted to go out to drink.
Drink sales in pubs and bars increased by 6.6 per cent for the month, while food sales decreased by three per cent.
Paul Newman, of RSM, said: “These results are a continuation of the swing we’ve seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of important social events or sporting events are still the biggest factors when it comes to selling to non-domestic markets.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups are still struggling, although a 4.8 per cent inter-month sales reduction is particularly painful in addition to continued pressure from costs.
This long and hot summer could hardly come at a worse time for dining venues and only time will reveal whether the tempered temperatures, as we have had in August, will improve the situation.”
Total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including newly opened locations, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting how the openings have progressed.

One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
One in five children, as young as 11 years old, have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers, according to the survey results.
A survey of 20,000 students showed an increase in "synthetic Insta" pages
News has raised concerns that sexual content is being posted
Twenty percent of students say they have a “principal” account that they show to parents
One in five children, all the way down to the age of 11, create secret accounts on social media that they keep secret from adults.
A survey that reached 20,000 students showed a large increase in “false Insta” accounts – which is a reference to the Instagram website.
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual material.
Twenty percent of students said they had a mere “principal” account to show to parents, as well as secret accounts.
One mother who fell on her 13-year-old daughter’s secret website found a teenager who urged others to “rape me.”
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Senate of Private School Directors (HMC), showed that 40 percent of children aged 11-18 years had two accounts and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
Mike Buchanan, chairman of HMC, said: “It’s a concern that so many teenagers are tempted to create an area online where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the Scottish Athletics Sports Committee
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as head of the non-executive board at its annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland’s most successful free athlete and Ian Beattie, chairman of the committee, said the nomination was a great opportunity for those who led the sport to benefit from her extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Eagerness enjoys great respect within the sporting communities in Scotland, the UK and internationally, and we are sure that sport in Scotland would make a lot of money to get her on the committee,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I am very interested in speaking on behalf of athletes and I hope I can do my part to help keep the sport going in Scotland.”
The American, who won between the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, but holds a total of four Olympic gold medals, and is now a regular visitor to the BBC, was paralyzed after suffering a transient ischaemic attack.
He tweeted: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell if I recovered and then to what extent.
This has been a tough job but I fully recovered, learned to walk again and do sports exercises today!
Thank you for your encouragement!”
Breast pump advertising, which compares mothers to cows, causes online disputes
A company that produces breast pumps is now referred to online because of advertisements that carry lactating mothers to cows that are milked.
The company Elvie published a whistleblower ad to mark the promotion of what is said to be “the world’s first silent breast pump that can be carried on the outside”. The ad is inspired by music videos and is intended to show the freedom that the new pump provides to mothers who are breastfeeding.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay and we sing songs with lyrics such as, “Yes, I milk myself, but you don’t see a tail on me” and “If you didn’t notice, these aren’t jugs but my breasts.”
The supplement continues: “Pump, pump, I feed the children, pump, pump, I pump milk from the yul.”
However, the advertisement, which appeared on the company's Facebook page, has caused reviews online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received different reactions from viewers, who say it gantted with the “horror” that accompanies the dairy industry.
“Really a bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Just like us, they need to become calves and carry to produce milk, except what the calves are taken from them just a few days after they are born," said one comment.

Another spectator wrote: “It’s very difficult for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise breast pumps for mothers who are allowed to hold their children?"
Another added: “This advertisement is completely out of time.”
Others defended the announcement, and one woman admitted that the song was “immediately funny.”
“I think that’s a great idea.
I would have done this if I had a baby.
I felt like a cow when I was pumping my milk.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it as it is.
“It’s a great story,” one of the audience wrote.
Another said: “This is a fun advertisement that is aimed at mothers who pump milk (often in the workplace or in the bathroom) and feels like ‘comb’.”
This is not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry.”
At the end of the ad, the women’s group shows that they were all dancing with their breast pumps tucked in their chests.
The idea behind the advertising campaign is based on the fact that many women say that they feel like cows when they pump out milk.
The Elvie pumpkin, on the other hand, is completely quiet, has no wires or wires and fits comfortably into a bra, which gives women the freedom to move, hold their baby and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, co-owner and head of Mother, said: “Elvie’s pump is such a revolutionary product that she deserved a prominent presentation that would raise publicity.
By imitating women with cows, we wanted to direct the beacon to breast pumping and all its challenges, and even show in a fun and familiar way how much freedom the new pump would provide.
This is not the first time Elvie Pump has been on the news.
At the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children performed at a fashion show for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children moved quietly to camps on the Texas border
The number of immigrant children in detention has suddenly increased even though the number of people crossing the border monthly has remained roughly the same. Part of the reason is that harsh discourse and policies put forward by the Trump administration have made it harder to get the children into temporary foster care.
Most of the time, the foster parents have been unregistered immigrants themselves, and have feared putting their chances of staying in the country at risk by offering themselves to raise a child.
The risk increased in June, when public authorities announced that potential foster parents and other adults in the home would have to provide fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with the Immigration Authority.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a head of the Immigration and Customs Authority, testified before the Senate, saying his institution had arrested a number of people who applied to nursing single children.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested were not in a criminal record.
“Almost 80 percent of those who are either foster parents or in a home that raises children are in the country illegally, and a large proportion of them are illegal immigrants on criminal record.
“We will continue to look for those individuals,” Mr. Albence said.
In an attempt to work out the children’s cases more quickly, representatives reported new rules requiring some of the children to appear in court within a month of being detained, rather than after 60 days, which was the first criterion, according to employees working in the centres.
Many of them will attend video meetings, rather than in person, to justify their legal position before a judge in immigration matters.
The children who have been convicted of being unfit to enter the country are expelled from the country as soon as possible.
The longer children are in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent tendencies or attempts to flee, according to employees of the shelters and reports published by the system in recent months.
Proponents said that these problems were even more likely in a larger institution like Tornillo, where no one is likely to notice that a child is not difficult, because of how many they are.
They added that transporting the children to the camp city without giving enough time to prepare them spiritually or to say goodbye to friends could exacerbate the shock that many of them are already experiencing.
Syria says U.S., France, and Turkey “retire” immediately
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also said in his speech at the UN General Assembly that Syrian refugees should return home, even if the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also plays the role of Deputy Prime Minister, said the foreign forces were illegal in Syria, under the false pretext that they were fighting terrorism, and that “they will be treated accordingly.”
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the Senate.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terrorism was almost over” in Syria, where over 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have had to flee their homes.
He said Damascus would continue “to wage this sacred struggle until we cleanse all Syrian territories” of both terrorist groups and “all illegal foreign parties.”
The United States has around 2,000 troops in Syria, most of whom train and advise both Kurdish troops and Syrian Arabs fighting President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops in this war-torn country.
As far as refugees are concerned, Moualem said the situation was good enough for them to return and he taught “some Western countries” to “spread out unfounded fears” that encouraged refugees to stay away.
“We have called on an international community and humanitarian organization to facilitate their return,” he said.
“They make politics out of something that should be humanitarian.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide any funding for reconstruction in Syria unless there is a political agreement between Assad and the Resistance to end the war.
The UN said a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral territory at the last major stronghold of the Resistance created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The treaty between Russia and Turkey prevented a large-scale attack by Syrian armed forces in the region where three million people live.
Moualem, on the other hand, stressed that the treaty had a "clear deadline" and expressed hope that military action would be directed at the Jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front, which is associated with al-Qaeda, and that they would be "exterminated."
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to be able to attend the first meetings with a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition, to draft a constitution for Syria after the war and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set out the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that its work should be limited to "examining the current government's provisions," and warned of any interference.
Reasons Why Trump Will Win Another Election
According to that reasoning, Mr. Trump would win the 2020 re-election unless charges and scandals end his presidential career, as many liberal audiences probably hope.
In what would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic end of a presidential career ever!”
At the same time, the audience does not feel tired.
Since 2014, best-time viewing has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN, and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at its best time, up from 1.7 million viewers four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's episode, "The Rachel Maddow Show" has topped viewers with up to 3.5 million viewers on important news evenings.
“It’s a fire that people are attracted to because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, director of the ABC drama Designated Survivor, about a government employee who will be president after the Senate is completely destroyed in an attack.

Money outside flows in the shortest elections of the mid-term
It is not surprising that the 17th electoral district of Pennsylvania sees the money flowing to it, thanks to a restructuring of the polls that led to two delegates competing for the same seat.
The newly reorganized Pittsburg area sends forward Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his seat in a second poll in the special elections last summer.
Lamb offers himself against other representatives, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is now the representative of the old 12th electoral district in Pennsylvania, which overlaps widely with the new 17th electoral district.
The maps of the polling stations were reorganized after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old polling stations were organized in favor of the Republicans and that it violated the constitution.
The race in the new 17th Electoral Area has been the start of a competition for the financing of election campaigns between the main funding bodies of both parties, the Democratic Electoral Committee (DCCC) and the Republican Electoral Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after a short victory in a special election in March for the 18th district of Pennsylvania, which many followed.
The Republicans had previously warmed it seats for more than a decade and Donald Trump, the president won the ballot box with 20 points difference.
Political experts have given democrats a little advantage.
The U.S. was considering punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but then quit.
Government officials noticed that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already acknowledged Beijing, with small objections from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Juan Carlos Varela, President of Panama in June 2017, and stayed in a hotel in Panama until the co-ownership of the Trump administration team drove off the group.
Foreign Ministry officials decided to recall the U.S. Ambassador to El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for "a recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the ministry's spokeswoman in a statement earlier this month.
However, sanctions were only envisaged for El Salvador, which is estimated to have received $140 million from the United States in 2017 for relief, including for drug surveillance, development, and economic support.
The penalties, which included a reduction in financial support and restrictions on the issuance of residence permits, would have been painful for the Central American country, where unemployment is high and murder rates are high.
As internal meetings continued, U.S. and Central American representatives postponed the Security and Economic Success Conference and were to follow a similar meeting held last year and considered to be a step forward in measures to prevent people from moving to the United States.
But in mid-September, top officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, ending all questions about punishment for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence will now address the conference, scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of how important it is in the eyes of the government, the report said.
The three U.S. ambassadors also quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, with no new harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton refused to discuss in detail the talks described by the three U.S. representatives, including two memorialists, who agreed to discuss the internal arguments against being allowed to remain anonymous.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an outside analyst who works closely with the board and also talked about the issue of anonymity.
Learn the story
The next scandal could be Mr. Mueller’s report, a special prosecutor, on Mr. Trump’s possible actions to impede justice, but for that accusation there is numerous public evidence.
It is also said that Mr. Mueller is also turning his investigation into whether Mr. Trump’s campaign has worked with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the Senate is governed by another party, Trump may have to bear responsibility for it, at the time he prepares to meet his constituents again, and perhaps a jury of his appointed peers.
However, these are extremely uncertain and I do not want to insist that Trump’s fall is unambiguous, nor is it the case with his colleagues in Europe.
We all have to choose, on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how long the fight will be.
In 1938, German advisers were ready to rob Hitler of power, only if Western countries had given him resistance and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the disasters that followed.
The story revolves around such important points and accelerates or delays the unstoppable progress of democracy.
Americans are facing a number of such important points now.
What do we do if Mr. Trump runs Rod Rosenstein, the man who runs the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a bad position since this paper said that last year he had proposed to make secret recordings of the president and discussed whether he was unfit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the news from the Times is not right.
“How will we react if the newly requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not thorough or fair, or if he is confirmed in the seat of a Supreme Court judge despite credible allegations of sexual harassment and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote for a senate in the mid-term that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fall on these tests, democracy will have to endure a long winter.
But I don’t think we will fall, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia and was sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi government as before in my ambassadorial residence.
She survived, moved to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me to light Sabbath candles on the table with the crosshair.
With such a legacy, how can I not look positively at our future?”

Graham Dorrans, Rangers teammate, optimistic for the game against Rapid Vienna
Rangers face Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a victory against the Austrians will put them in a strong position to emerge from the European League G-Team. Rangers made an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month.
Injuries to the knee prevented Graham Dorran from playing his first game of the season before the match against Villareal which ended with a 2-2 draw, but he believes the Rangers can use them as a springboard for better results.
“It was nice to get this point for us, because Villarreal is a strong team,” said Dorrans, 31.
“We started the game in the belief that we could achieve something and ended up taking one point.
Maybe we could have won at the end, but overall, the tie was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we got stronger in the second half and played better.
On Thursday, another important night for the European League.
Hopefully we can reach three levels, but it will be a difficult game because they went well in their last game. But with audiences supporting us, I’m sure we can endure this and get a positive result.
Last year was difficult, both because of my injuries and the changes that took place in the club itself, but now there is a good feeling on the ground.
The team is good and the boys are enjoying themselves, the training is good.
Hopefully we can go further now, put the last season behind us and succeed.”
Women lose sleep due to fear of losing retirement savings
Although the survey respondents had a clear idea of how they would like to be cared for, few spoke to their family members about it.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide survey said they talked to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked about it with their children.
“People want a family member to take care of it, but it doesn’t take the right steps to have those conversations,” said Holly Snyder, deputy head of Nationwide Life Insurance.
Here's how to start.
Speak to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care if you do not make your wishes clear to them in good time.
Talk to your counselor and your family about where and when you receive care, because these options can change a lot in terms of cost.
Get your financial advisor involved: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for these costs.
Among the options you have to pay for long-term care are traditional life insurance with long-term care, mixed life insurance that pays out in cash, to help pay expenses, or self-insurance with your own money - as long as you own it.
Prepare all legal documents: Avoid legal disputes in advance.
Get a health care practitioner so that you can appoint someone you trust to take care of your health care and ensure that healthcare professionals will respond to your wishes if you cannot express them directly yourself.
Also consider getting procrastinators for your finances.
You would choose someone you trust to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure your accounts are paid if you can’t do it yourself.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine that your elderly father or mother is in an emergency and is on his way to a hospital.
Could you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Provide this information in a written plan so that you are ready.
“It’s not just about the finances, it’s about who the doctors are,” Martin said.
“Who are the medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
“Be prepared for that plan.”
Man shot several times with an airstrike in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times by an airstrike while on his way home on foot after having fun.
The victim is a man in his fifties and was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Representatives describe the shooting, which took place at around 2:30 a.m. local time, as a "random attack."
The victim did not see his attacker.
The man was not fatally wounded and police have called for witnesses.
Earthquakes and floods in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and flood in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the number of dead is expected to rise.
Since all communications are down, aid workers have not been able to provide any information from Donggala County, which is an area north of Palu and is closer to the center of the earthquake, which was 7.5 on Richter.
More than 16,000 people have been forced to leave their homes in Palu after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province and is located at the bottom of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi. The estimated population was 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and flood waves struck.
Donggala is a county that covers more than 380 km of coastline in the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
The county, which is the administrative area of the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main industries in the Central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the region, but they are mostly in Morawali, which is on the beach in front of Sulawesi.
Floods have flooded Palu and Donggala several times in the past century, according to Indonesian disaster agency.
In 1938, more than 200 people died when a flood struck and hundreds of houses in Donggala were destroyed.
In 1996, a flood struck the western part of Donggala, killing nine people.
Indonesia sits on the active ring of fire of the Pacific Ocean and there are regular earthquakes.
Here are the major earthquakes and floods of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Aceh province, north of Sumatra, hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people across the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes crossed the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds are dying on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6.8 on the Richter River overlooks the southernmost island of Indonesia, causing a tidal wave on the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake hit the city of Padang, the capital of the province of Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-square earthquake on Richter drove across one of the Mentawai islands, near Sumatra, causing up to 10-metre-high floods that destroyed a number of villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: The foundation earthquake raged over Pidie Jaya County in Aceh and caused destruction and overshoot as people remembered the devastation caused by the deadly earthquakes and floods in 2004.
No floods occurred this time, but over 100 lives were lost in the collapse of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mainly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed hundreds of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily trapped on the island.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaskan Prime Minister and presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, a 29-year-old from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, for trying to obstruct the report of domestic violence and stressing against arrest, according to a report by the Alaska State Police published on Saturday.
According to the police report, Palin took the phone off his friend when she tried to call the police to report alleged crime.
Palin is being held at the Mat-Su station where he is awaiting trial, and he is being held against $500 in security, according to a news report from KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, declaring that he was “not guilty, not guilty” when he was asked to declare a fine or innocence, according to the news station.
Palin is charged with three A-class offences, which means he could be sentenced to up to one year in prison and face a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a class B crime, which is punishable by a one-day prison sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged.
In December 2017, he was charged with attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently under investigation for the Alaskan surrender court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, for preventing the reporting of domestic violence and for carrying weapons under the influence of alcohol in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed that he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of surrender soldiers in 2016 after she taught traumatic disorder about her son’s violent behavior, following his military service in Iraq.
Earthquake and flooding in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-year-old Richter earthquake caused a tidal wave and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications systems are down and the number of deceased is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred in the middle of Sulawesi Island, northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Videos that show when the incident happened are now circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tidal wave hit the shore.
Prosecutors Seek Rare Death Penalty for Suspected Terrorist Attacker in New York City
Prosecutors in New York want the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, who is suspected of participating in a terrorist attack in New York City, which killed eight people. This is a rare punishment that has not been used in the state for violations of federal law since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is believed to have taken a Home Depot truck on a lease to attack people on a bike path along the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan. He drove down there pedestrians and cyclists in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "willfully" and caused serious bodily injuries "willfully", according to the declaration of will to apply the death penalty, which was filed in the Southern District Court in New York.
Both of these prosecutors may lead to a possible death penalty, according to the court document.
Many weeks after the attack, the federal court charged Saipov in 22 counts, including eight charges of murder for criminal purposes, which is usually used by prosecutors in charges against organized crime groups. Also, Saipov was charged with violent crimes and for murder.
The attack involved "a considerable planned plan," the prosecutors said, describing Sapiov's actions as "terrible, cruel, and immoral."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov was caused to injuries, damage and loss to families and friends Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been a decade since the southern province of New York last received the death penalty for treatment.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers and was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last executed in a New York court case in 1953 against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, couples who were executed after being convicted of spying for the Soviet Union in the Cold War two years earlier.
The couple were both killed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, showed no signs of repentance in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He told the investigator that he was doing well with what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told authorities that he had the idea of the attack after watching videos from ISIS on his phone, according to the prosecution.
He also asked to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He has declared his innocence in all 22 indictments.
David Patton, one of Saipov's public defenders, said they were "of course disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of adopting a life imprisonment decree without the possibility of a solution will only prolong the shock of this event for all concerned,” Patton said.
Saipov's defendants had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MPs say NIGEL FARAGE should lead negotiations on Brexit.
Nigel Farage pledged to “activate the army of the people” today at the Conservative Conference.
This former UKIP leader said politicians should “feel pressure” from doubters about the EU, at the same time one of MPs Theresa May suggested that he should lead the negotiations with the EU.
During the Birmingham protests, Peter Bone said Britain would be “out” now if Farage was the leader of Brexit.
But the challenge facing May to reconcile deep disagreements between her own team members came to light even better when conservatives, who want to remain in the EU, took part in other anti-Brexit protests in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep his Chequers plan on the right track and sits under criticism from those who are in favour of Brexit, those who are opposed, and the EU.
Allies said it will continue to fight to reach an agreement with Brussels despite opposition – forcing those opposed to Brexit and the Labour Party to choose between its plan and “disturbance.”
Mr. Bone told the Leave Means Leave protest in Solihull that he wanted “to break the Chequers plan.”
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been allowed to participate and assume responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were in the office, we would be out now," he said.
The Wellingborough Senator added: “I will support Brexit but we have to get rid of the Chequers plan.”
He explained his opposition to the EU, saying: “We did not fight in world wars to serve others.
We want to write our own laws in our own country.”
Mr. Bone dismissed the evidence that public opinion had changed since the 2016 election: “The idea that the British public has changed their opinion and wants to stay is totally untrue.”
Andrea Jenkyns, a conservative supporter of Brexit, also said to reporters: “I just want to say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers program is unpopular among the public and the opposition will not vote with it. It enjoys unpopularity among our party members and the actionists who are out on the streets voting for us.
Please stop the Chequers program and start listening.”
In a direct message to May, she added: “Prime Ministers keep their job when they keep their promises.”
Farage said politicians should be allowed to “feel pressure” if they were to fail before the decision taken following the 2016 vote.
"This is about trust between us - the people - and our political party," he said.
“They want to try to betray Brexit and we are here today to say to them, ‘We won’t let you get up with this.’”
He added in his message to the crowd: “I want you to let your political party, which is about to betray Brexit, feel pressure.
We are energizing a public army in this country that gave us a victory in Brexit and we will never rest until we have become an independent, self-governing, proud Great Britain.”
At the same time, EU supporters held a demonstration in Birmingham which ended with a two-hour demonstration in the city centre.
A small group of activists waved the flags of conservatives against Brexit after the group was set up this weekend.
Lord Adonis, of the Labour Party, made fun of conservatives for security issues that came up in the party's phone app when the conference was opened.
“These are the people who tell us that it can have all the computer systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus plus, for border-free, for free trade with Ireland without borders,” he added.
“This is a complete scandal.
“There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he said.
Warren is going to "considere seriously" to present himself to the presidency.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she will "consider a serious bid for the presidency" after the November elections.
A report from the Boston Globe said the Massachusetts Democrat had discussed his future at a civil assembly in the western part of Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who has rarely criticized US President Donald Trump, offers to run for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump’s 2016 election campaign in Massachusetts.
She has been the center of doubt that she could stand up to Trump in 2020.
The meeting in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting in the form of a civic meeting with residents in her constituency, from the time Trump took office.
One attending the meeting asked her if she intends to present herself to the president.
Warren said it was time for “women to go to Washington and put our government in order, and then we need a woman as a leader.”
Captured After Deadly Shooting of Sims from LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that she had arrested one suspect in the case of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims, who was shot dead on Friday.
Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at a news conference at 11 a.m.
She had previously posted a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying the person seen on the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near the Southern University campus early on Friday.
"Wayde Sims received a shot wound in the head and died as a result," Murphy J. Paul, chief of police, told the media on Saturday, according to a news release from 247sports.
Wayde came to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed to being on the scene, with weapons in his pursuit, and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested and placed in custody at the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
Sims was two feet tall and grew up in Baton Rouge, playing in 32 games, of which 10 in the starting team in the last season, playing an average of 17.4 minutes, scoring 5.6 points and achieving 2.9 rebounds in each game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world championship after Sebastian Vettel gives him the victory seat by order of their team.
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas took a seat in front of Lewis Hamilton before the start on Saturday, that orders from Mercedes teams would play a major part in the race.
Bottas got off to a good start and almost left Hamilton behind as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to fight his teammate.
Vettel went first in the pit and had Hamilton drive into the traffic at the end of the group, but it should have been able to decide the outcome.
The Mercedes car went into the ditch a circle later and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton emerged after a short battle where the driver of Ferrari was forced to leave the inner side after being at risk of being left behind, after defense attempts in the third turn.
Max Verstappen started back in the group and was in seventh place at the end of the first round, on his 21st birthday.
He then led the majority of the race when he postponed replacing tires to try to finish quickly and advance from Kimi Raikkonen to fourth place.
He finally went into the pit in the 44th circle but could not increase the speed in the remaining eight circles, and Raikkonen took fourth place.
This is a difficult day because Valtteri stood up all weekend and was a true gentleman to let me go.
The team has done a great job in achieving this," Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body expression.
U.S. President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Dianne Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday, claiming she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, accusing Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
The president spoke at a meeting in West Virginia, but did not directly discuss Ford's testimony before the Senate Judgment Committee. Instead, he said that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "mauvais and cruel and untrue."
"The only thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that has been going on in the Senate for the last few days, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and evil and cruel and untrue," he said.
“When you see the impressions and leaks and then they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t.
I didn’t do that.”
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, are you doing this?
Do you remember her reply... you left the document – “oh, ha, what?
Oh, no.
I didn’t take it.”
Now wait a little slow.
Let's... No, we're not playing that," he said, imitating the Senator.
The letter was sent to Feinstein in July, where Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh were leaked in early September. Feinstein denied that the leak had come from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusations, I didn’t share her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep it confidential and I did as she asked me to.”
But her denial didn’t seem to go well with the president, who said at the meeting on Saturday: “I’ll tell you, this was really a bad bodily expression.
Maybe it didn’t hurt, but it was the worst body expression I’ve ever seen.”
The president continued to defend Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of sexual harassment by three women, and urged Democrats to use the allegations in their favor.
“They are determined to re-electe, no matter what method they need to use.
You see the cruelty, the evil, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to rule over to take power and control,” the president said.
Elite League league: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars improved for their loss on Friday in the Elite League league against the Belfast Giants, by defeating the next game after, 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants got an early two-mark advantage after goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalized for the locals, but Dwyer then came back over the Giants.
Francois Bouchard tied for Dundee and two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen then secured their victory.
This was the third loss in the season for the elite league team Adam Keefe, who had won Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth game between the teams in the season, and the Giants had won the three games before.
Dwyer scored the first goal in the fourth minute at 3:35 p.m., following a back-up from Kendall McFaull. David Rutherford then came with a back-up when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
It was then a lot to be in the first minutes and Sullivan brought the locals back into the game when the clock showed 13.10 and Cownie then settled after a support from Matt Marquardt in the fifteenth minute.
Dwyer made it to the Giants for halftime when he scored his second goal in the game at the end of the first quarter.
The home team came together and Bouchard equalized back after goal when they were one man over in the 27th minute of the second game.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran worked together to help Nielsen bring Dundee over for the first time in the game late in the second quarter, and he secured his team's victory by the fifth goal when half of the last game was over.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will face Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Kills to Ensure Hundreds of Passengers in Aircraft Escape from Earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia has been hailed as a hero after he died ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of passengers could take off safely and safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a wave of flooding.
Major aftershocks continue to plague the area and many are trapped under the ruins of the city of Palu.
21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave, despite the fact that his colleagues had fled the tower, which swinged overwhelmingly at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed to ensure that Batik Air aircraft number 6321, which was on the runway when the earthquake hit, could safely fly.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he thought he was collapsing.
He later died in a hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said his decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Sadly, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We're very sad to hear about this," he added.
Authorities fear that the number of dead could exceed 1,000, as the country's disaster agency says access is limited to the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"It is said that the number of dead is still increasing because many bodies are still under the rubble and cannot be reached," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency's spokesman, said in a statement.
Up to six-metre-high waves have caused massive devastation in Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
The military and passenger aircraft are working to bring aids and supplies.
Giant Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance brings bodies.
There is little to clean water.
“Small markets have been robbed everywhere.”
In an interview with CNN, Indonesian Red Cross commander Jan Gelfand said: “The Indonesian Red Cross is struggling to find survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
Joko Widodo, President of Indonesia, came to Palu on Sunday and said to the country’s army: “I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the exodus-related tasks.
“Are you ready?” she told CNN.
Earlier this year, an earthquake struck Lombok, Indonesia, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini says it is also missing after plane crashed into lake in Micronesia
The airline, which had a plane that crashed into a lake in Micronesia, now says that one person is missing, having previously said that all 47 passengers and crew had been rescued from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that as of Saturday afternoon, it did not know about the disability of a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately answer questions about the passenger’s details, such as his age or nationality.
Boats in the area helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the lake as it attempted to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
Police said on Friday that seven people had been transferred to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday and that their condition was stable.
It is still unclear what caused the accident and what the exact sequence of events was.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said the plane had landed in the lake just before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had crossed too far the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the approach of the plane was very low.
“It was really good,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others could reach the mid-deep water and reach the emergency exits in the sinking plane.
He said that the flight crews had been frightened and screaming and that he had suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said seamen, who were working close to rebuilding the dock, also helped with the rescue by using an inflated boat to ferry people ashore, before the plane sank into about 30 meters deep water.
Data from the Agency shows that 111 people have died in PNG-registered aircraft crashes in the past two decades, but none of them were related to Air Niugini.
An expert describes the timeline of the night a woman was burned alive
Prosecutors closed their case on Saturday in a retrial against a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an expert at the U.S. Department of Justice, was in the courtroom for many hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the court how he used mobile phone records to put together the trips of the defendant, 29-year-old Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said she had received location data from a number of mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, contrary to his previous claims, according to a report from The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chamber at the same time that he said he had been with his friend, Michael Sanford, the police went to Sanford to talk to him.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he had not been in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford’s car that night, Sanford said it was “a lie, because my car was in Nashville.”
Tellis said she had known Chambers for about two weeks before she died.
Mobile data showed that they had only known for a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers’ death, Tellis had deleted text messages, phone calls, and her contact information from her phone.
"He took her out of his life," Hale said.
The defendants are expected to deliver their final speech on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the case to be brought to trial later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
Hipp bounce trio wants to fight against negative opinions about the music genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, argues that hip hop has removed its origin as it contained political messages and addressed social issues.
They want to seek their origins again and consciously make hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent boom in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
New York Feeder Sues Married for Dismissal After ‘Prejudicious’ Text Message
A New York nurse sues a couple for unlawful expulsion after receiving a text message from her mother complaining that she was “another black person.”
The couple refused to be prejudiced and resembled the lawsuit as “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two children, expressed her dissatisfaction when she found out that her new foster Giselle Maurice was black when she came to work for the first time in 2016.
“NEEEEIIIII OTHER ANSWER MAN,” wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent them twice to Miss Maurice.
After discovering her mistake, the "shameful" Plasco-Flaxman expelled Ms. Maurice, saying that their former foster, who was black, had been in bad shape, and that she had expected to have a Filipino woman, according to a news report from the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid for one day of work and then sent home in an Uber car.
Maurice is now suing the couple and wants to get compensation for the expulsion, an amount of $350 a day for the six-month job she had originally been hired for, although no contract has been signed.
“I wanted to show them that you shouldn’t do that,” she told Post on Friday, adding, “I know this is discrimination.”
The couple have objected to the allegations that they are prejudiced and say that it was right to fire Maurice, because they felt they could not trust her after insulting her.
“My wife sent her a message she didn’t want to say.
She's not prejudiced.
We're not prejudiced people," Joel Plasco, a husband, told the Post.
“But who would trust their children for someone after they have done the wrong thing, even if it was a surprise?
Your newborn child?
Come on, let's go."
Plasco compared the lawsuit to "extortion," saying that his wife had been in a "extremely difficult situation" for seven months.
“Are you going to attack someone in this situation?
It’s not very nicely done,” said Plasco, who works in the investment industry.
The case is still in court, but the public has spoken harshly about the couple on social media and shamed them for their behavior and reasoning.
Paddington’s publishers feared that readers would find it difficult to like a talking bear, says a new letter.
Karen Jankel, Bond’s daughter, who was born shortly after the book was approved, said of the letter: “It’s hard to follow someone who reads it for the first time before it’s published.
“It’s very funny now that we know of Paddington’s tremendous success.”
She said her father, who worked as a filmmaker for the BBC before he was inspired to write a children's book about a toy bear, had accepted the rejection of his work with a rounded positivity, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's release was "sweetly painful" after his death last year.
As for Paddington, which she describes as "an important family member," she added that her father had been silently proud of his success in the end.
“He was a very quiet man and not used to bragging,” she said.
“But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child that does something. You’re proud of it even if you didn’t really do anything yourself.
I think he looked at Paddington's success like that.
"Although Paddington was his creativity and imagination, he always gave Paddington the honor."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
When she landed, her daughter had been transferred to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors did everything in their power to save her life, but without success.
“Nad called regularly and told me that the situation was very bad, that she was not expected to survive,” Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then Nad called me and said she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines given to her by doctors to keep her heartbeat up were gradually losing its activity and being excreted from the body.
She had died a short time before and this was her body giving up.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing it was all going to happen.
I couldn’t scream or cry, because I was surrounded by family and other people.
I had to be in control.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning her deceased daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers who knew nothing of the difficulties she was experiencing.
“Nobody knew anything,” she said.
“I drowned my head and my tears fell all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but during the flight I felt a lot of sympathy for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Grieving Women Hang Up Messages to Prevent Suicide on Bridge
Two women who had loved ones committing suicide are now trying to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted messages on a bridge in Wales, with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call and get help.
Tyler, Ms. Davis’ son, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel like I need to feel like I do every day,” she said.
Ms. Davis is 45 years old and lives in Lydney and said her son had been a successful cook with an infectious smile.
He was known for his smile.
Everyone said that his smile could light up any room.”
He stopped working before he died, because he was “socked down to a very dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, at the age of 11, found his brother dead after taking his own life.
Ms. Davis said: “I am constantly worried that it will be relapsed.”
Ms. Davis made the message “to let people know that it is possible to go and talk to others, even friends.
Don’t sit and say nothing – you need to talk to someone.”
Ms. Humphreys, who has been Ms. Davies’ friend for years, lost Mark, his 15-year-old spouse, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he was feeling bad or depressed or anything like that," she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his mood.
He was at his worst on Christmas Day—when the kids opened their gifts, he didn’t look them in the eye or anything.”
She said that his death was a shock to them, but that they had to get out of it: “This is a hole in the family.
This is breaking us apart.
But we have to keep going and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs on blue thread as FBI has its investigation
"I was thinking that if we could get something similar to what he asked for -- a study with limited time and scope -- maybe we could get some peace," Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee was "disintegrating" in the midst of a dispute between the parties, where everything was locked down.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate the case?
It’s because of the timing.
The mid-term elections are only five weeks away, on November 6, and if the Republicans go badly, as is expected, it seriously weakens their efforts to get their husband elected to the highest court of the country.
George W. Bush has been calling Senators to encourage them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and met his wife Ashley through him, who was a privateer of Mr. Bush.
What happens after the FBI publishes its investigation report?
The vote will be held in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit.
It is still uncertain whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes on the floor of the Senate, but that would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break up the tie and confirm him in the office of Supreme Court judge.
The number of people fleeing North Korea under Kim's leadership is "decreasing"
The number of people fleeing North Korea and heading to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a Senator from South Korea.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Unification Council, said that 1,127 people had fled last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that stricter border warnings between North Korea and China and higher fees charged by smugglers with people were key factors.
Pyongyang has made no official statement.
The vast majority of those fleeing North Korea are offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul said more than 30,000 North Koreans had crossed the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most flee to China, which has the longest border with North Korea, and is easier to cross than the well-regarded neutral area between North and South Korea.
China regards the refugees as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forces them to return to their homeland.
Communications between North and South Korea, which are still at war, technically speaking, have improved significantly in the past month.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for a discussion that focused mainly on postponed talks on nuclear disarmament.
This was after a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to work together in the direction of a nuclear-free Korea.
On Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho told U.S. business pleaders that there was a lack of progress since then.
“Without trust in the United States, there is no certainty about the security of our country and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to unilaterally take down our nuclear weapons first,” Ri said in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "mothersick" and says he's unfit to serve as a Supreme Court judge
Nancy Pelosi, the minority leader of the Senate, called Brett Kavanaugh, the nominated Supreme Court judge, “mothersick” and said he was too shy to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but think that if a woman had ever acted this way, she would have been called a mothersick,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judgment Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied the allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was extremely emotional, sometimes screaming and getting a lump in the throat as he talked about his family and school years.
He also publicly condemned Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations at his hands “disgusting and organized genocide” organized by liberals angry at Hillary Clinton’s loss in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, as he showed that he is biased towards democrats.
"I think these claims and how he attacked the Clintons and Democrats show he's unfit for the job," she said.
Pelosi did not answer when asked if she would try to get Kavanaugh fired from his job if he is confirmed and if Democrats get a majority in the Senate.
“If he’s not telling the Senate or the FBI the truth, he’s not only unfit to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court he is now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh now serves as a judge at the Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade Abortion Act, as he is considered a conservative judge.
At the hearing, Kavanaugh shunned questions as to whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is no time for a mother-sick, biased person to go to the Supreme Court and expect us to say, 'It's wonderful.'"
Women need to take advantage of it.
This is fair talk, months and years of anger flowing out of it, and it does not come without weeping.
"We cry when we get angry," said Ms. Steinem to me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s unusual, but you?”
She went on, “I got a lot of help from a woman who was an executive somewhere and said she also cried when she was angry, but she had developed technology so when she was angry and started crying, she said to her interviewer, ‘You might think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just kept crying.
And I thought it was great.”
Tears are allowed to express anger in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories of my previous job in an office with the majority of men, where I started to cry out of anger that I couldn’t express, an older woman came and grabbed my throat. She was a cold boss that I had always feared a bit and she dragged me into the staircase.
"Don't ever let them see you cry," she said.
They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’re happy that you’ve come in.”
Patricia Schroeder had worked with Gary Hart when he was running for president, then a Democrat from Colorado.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was apprehended on a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew his supply, Ms. Schroeder, full of resentment, felt that there was no reason why she could not consider presenting herself to the President.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she said laughing at me, 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates and the last thing they needed was one more.
Someone named it “White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
Since the campaign was long overdue, she was lagging behind in terms of fundraising, so she vowed not to bid unless she was able to raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
“Do they think I’ll get a discount?” she wondered.
When she gave her speech and announced that she would not formally present herself, she was so overwhelmed with emotions - gratitude to the people who had supported her, resentment towards the system, which made it so difficult to raise money and direct her eyes to the voters instead of the representatives, and anger at the gender differences.
“I might think I had a nervous breakdown,” said Ms. Schroeder as she recalled how the media reacted.
“I could think that Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will be written on my tombstone?
“She was crying?”
Reasons why a trade war between the United States and China could be good for Beijing
The first shots in the U.S.-China trade war were appalling, and although the war is far from over, cross-country trade could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by taxing China’s major exports, including solar batteries, steel and aluminum.
The biggest upswing came this week with new tariffs covering products worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), taxing nearly half of all products imported into the United States from China.
Beijing has responded in the same currency each time and recently imposed 5 to 10 percent tariffs on U.S. products worth $60 billion.
China has pledged to respond to the U.S. tariffs and it is unlikely that another of the world’s largest economies will fall short.
In order to get Washington to jump, demands must be yielded, but it would be far too humiliating for Xi Jinping, China’s president, to officially bow before the United States.
However, experts say that if Beijing maintains the right to play, pressure from the trade war with the United States could have a positive long-term effect on China, reducing the need for mutual economics for each other.
“The fact that a swift political decision either in Washington or Beijing could lead to conditions leading to economic collapse in either country is actually far more dangerous than audiences have previously acknowledged,” said Abigail Grace, a researcher who focuses primarily on Asia at the New American Security Center.
Syria 'ready' for refugees to return, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for refugees to return voluntarily to the country and seek help to rebuild the country, which is now in a bad condition after seven years of war.
Foreign Minister Walid al Moualem spoke at the United Nations General Assembly and said the situation in the country was improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer, thanks to the success of the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to bring about normal conditions by building areas that were completely destroyed by terrorists.
Everything is now ready for refugees to return voluntarily to the country they were forced to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic decisions that targeted their daily lives and jobs.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
An additional six million people who still live in the country need help.
Al-Moualem said Syrian authorities would be happy to accept aid to rebuild the country.
However, he stressed that they would not accept aid subject to conditions or assistance from countries that supported the rebellion.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
European teams have won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the U.S. team with a final result of 16.5 vs. 10.5 points on the Le Golf National field outside of Paris in France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on a European basis and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the team, led by Danish leader Thomas Bjorn, reached the 14.5 points it needed to conquer the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had struggled most of the race, kicked his first shot into the water at Par 3 in the 16th hole, losing his game to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shone brightly in all of his games, becoming 1 in 4 players to get the 5-0-0 result, since the race began using its current profile in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 to Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, who was in the bottom of the ranking of the European team.
Dustin Johnson, who ranks top on the list of the world's best golfers, lost 2–1 to England's Ian Poulter, who possibly played in his last race for the Ryder Cup.
Spanish Sergio Garcia, who has played eight times for the Ryder Cup, became the most successful European of the race with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t do anything else.
It has been a difficult year.
I am so thankful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am so happy to get the cup back.
This is all about the team, and it was a pleasure for me to be able to help," said Garcia after the victory in Europe.
He gave his country John Rahm the torch, but he defeated the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a singles game on Sunday.
“I was incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, and I grew up watching him,” said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and is now listed with 13-21-3 in competitions for the Ryder Cup.
This is a strange result for one of the best players in history, who has won 14 major titles and is only second behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had a hard time finding themselves on the pitch all weekend, apart from Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a good game throughout the race.
U.S. leader Jim Furyk, disappointed with his team’s performance, said: “I’m proud of them, they fought.
It was at some point in the morning that we put pressure on Europe.
We lost it down.
I'll take up for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players play very well.
We’ll get back together, I’ll work with the PGA in the United States and the Ryder Cup name, and we’ll keep going.
I love these 12 men and am proud to be their leader.
You have to take it up.
“They played better than us.”
