28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the staircase of a local mall.
The victim's brother said that he can't imagine anyone trying to hurt him, "Finally, he went uphill again."
The body found Wednesday morning in the Westfield Mall was identified as 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, the forensic department in San Francisco said.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was classified as murder and the investigation is underway.
The victim’s brother, Louis Galicia, told ABS broadcaster KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who used to work as a chef in Boston, got his dream job as a chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A spokesperson for the Son & Daughter said they were "shocked and devastated by his death."
“We’re a small team that works like a close family and we’re going to miss him painfully,” the spokesman said.
Our thoughts and condolences are with Frank’s family and friends during this difficult time.
Louis Galicia stated that Frank initially lived in hostels, but that, "things finally went uphill for him."
"He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend," Louis Garcia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said that he could not imagine anyone wanting to harm his younger brother.
He was a friendly person with a big heart.
His way of connecting with his family was to always cook us something, to prepare us dinner," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to participate in any kind of dispute.
He was the brother who swam with the river.
“With everything going wrong in the world, it was that uncut diamond that shone brightly every day,” he said.
Anyone who has information on the case is asked to call the SFPD's reference phone number 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I'm always put in drawers
Jennifer Aniston doesn’t always have to be perfect or successful.
The Hollywood star made this clear in an interview.
"I'm always put in drawers or get labels glued on from outside, which usually have little to do with me and reality."
“I don’t want to be perfect and successful all the time.”
"Honestly, these things are more sniffing to me."
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh at being considered "Miss Perfect", as she explains in the current "Cosmopolitan".
The actress prefers to spend her time at home, in front of the TV with loose dutt and Mexican food, the magazine says.
"We women don't have to be married or have children to be perfect," she said.
In her new film "Mother's Day - Love Is Not a Child's Play", Aniston is portrayed as a single mother of two sons.
The film will run with us from August 25th.
Golfer Langer receives the Sports Pyramid
His experiences on the horse are manageable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and some of his colleagues were looking for a bit of variety with a ride on the beach.
For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.
CHIO: "Golden Sports Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes, the horses remembered their evening off, chasing home to the feeding troughs in a fast gallop.
One mile at that pace, I was scared.
"It was not a good experience," says Langer.
And then the riding career ended again.
On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament victories - was back near horses.
He and his family were guided over the ALRV facility, he did not even swing on a horse for photography purposes.
Langer was the first time in Aachen and thus also at the CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
The German sports aid handed over the Golden Sports Pyramid to the man from Anhausen as part of a small gala.
There is no shortage of awards for the sympathetic athlete.
Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silbernes Laurelblatt, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...
Even the British Queen has already nominated him.
Langer is the 18th winner of the Sports Pyramid.
In Aachen, he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
"This award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because it is awarded not only for sporting success, but also for social engagement."
For decades, Langer has been supporting young people.
And so he also passed on the prize money of 25,000 euros straight away.
With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time US champion was inducted into the "Hall of Fame of German Sports" on Saturday.
The awards include the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the gymnastics player Eberhard Gienger, the fencers Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the rower Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob driver Meinhard Nehmer, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumper Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumously the Handballer.
Many of these sports legends had come to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrious company migrated to the Spring Stadium, where the Lavazza Prize ran.
Bernhard Langer distanced himself from the big animals.
Clintons and Trumps Economic Policy in Comparison: It's All About the Money
Investing in infrastructure and preventing the trade agreement TTP – that’s what both Clinton and Trump want.
However, the two US presidential candidates disagree on tax and energy policy as well as on a fundamental issue.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.
The one about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep the doubts rather small and warns about how the state can harm the economy – with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.
He himself would be completely different, Trump claims.
He will massively reduce regulations, and he is pushing for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates – for private individuals and for businesses.
Clinton, on the other hand, says that the state has certain tasks to perform, it has opportunities to open up to the disadvantaged, and it needs money to do so.
That is why the taxes for the rich would be increased, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close to the issue of infrastructure.
They need to be invested in, Trump and Clinton say almost in the same word.
The Democratic candidate even announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.
State investment programs in infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are strictly rejected by Republicans, for example, by the state-critical tea party wing.
So Trump could still have party-internal discussions.
The differences in energy and climate policy are more pronounced.
Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and relaunch coal production in the US.
Oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas, he wants to cancel the Paris climate agreement.
Clinton, on the other hand, explicitly wants to expand renewable energies with her investment program, calling for “a country to become the superpower of clean energies and create millions of jobs.”
"It will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be."
However, not only in terms of infrastructure, but also in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart.
TPP, the Trans-Pacific Trade Agreement, both do not want to sign.
At the same time, they do not want to isolate the United States from international trade – they just want to protect American jobs better.
They should be better paid, for example, Clinton demands.
The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger wage.
He wants to raise it to $15 per hour.
What Trump wants to do on this issue is not quite clear: once he says the minimum wage must be raised, then he says it should not be changed.
But the big discussion in the coming months is likely to be about the tax policy of the two camps.
On the one hand, there is Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens in order to boost growth.
His critics argue that this would only increase the budget deficit.
On the other hand, there is Clinton, who wants at least the rich to pay more taxes, and whose critics say that more taxes are not the solution either.
Escape: "Every refugee woman has experience with sexual violence"
Sexual violence is almost everyday for women who flee alone.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house offers refuge.
There are four women in a large kitchen.
Everyone has a baby who is at most one year old.
One of them put her little son in her arms.
He looks intrigued into the room with big eyes.
His mother is staring at the table top.
Until she realizes she’s being watched.
She smiles and kisses the little one.
The scene seems normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is the divisional managing director of Condrobes, a provider of social assistance in Bavaria, and deals with the topic of women on the run, among other things.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in one of the few decentralized shelters for refugee women and their children in Bavaria in the north of Munich.
In January, Condrobs opened the facility together with Pro Familia and Munich Women’s Aid.
It was recently officially opened.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men, not even as visitors.
The exception is a guard at the door.
"It is not exaggerated to say that every woman who arrives here has experienced sexual violence on her escape," Bahr said.
"Men are fleeing wars because they are being politically persecuted, because they are threatened with torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as hope-bearers," she says.
In women, other reasons for fleeing prevail: “Many steal away secretly because they see no other way out.”
In their homeland, they have experienced sexual violence, forced marriage, honor killings, slavery or forced prostitution.
That drives her away.
This continues on the run.
“That traffickers, for example, demand a sexual act for a bottle of water is not uncommon,” Bahr says.
And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Anyone who believes that this ends as soon as they arrive in Germany is mistaken, says Bahr.
Here, too, single women in refugee shelters are often regarded as inferior and, at worst, abused.
As a result, about 90 percent of women living in accommodation in the north of Munich are traumatized, she estimates.
"Some of the children certainly did not arise voluntarily".
Many women are so used to it that they say nothing.
"Or they don't dare to speak openly about the experience because the shame is too great".
Since she often didn’t know how to help herself, it needs more accommodation just for her, Bahr demands.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.
When asked if they knew about a similar project as in Munich in their area of responsibility, some answered no.
In the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing in government accommodation.
Even in Swabia, refugee women alone are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, the government's press spokesman.
In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Middle Franconia, there are floors in some community accommodation or own houses only for single women and their children.
The exception is Lower Bavaria, where there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.
The European Parliament's Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality also calls for women to be accommodated separately from men.
In a study published for the committee, it says, "It is very important that men and women be accommodated separately."
"If privacy is missing or men and women are being accommodated together, violence against women can occur -- more persistently."
In particular, the washrooms should be separated and easily accessible to women, says the study.
How much women feel about this need for protection can be seen from the anxieties of the house in Munich.
“Since talking about us, we’ve had a long waiting list,” Bahr says.
You could easily open a second house.
Assistant doctors strike: demands for new labour struggle measures
Deputies of the assistant doctors have called on their union to approve new labour struggle measures in their disputes regarding a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called on its entire council to approve more workplace fighting measures from the beginning of September.
The JDC said it had failed to address ministers' concerns about the treaty.
Assistant doctors and medical students voted in July on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA.
He was rejected by 58% of his members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday evening, JDC chairman Ellen McCourt said the government had remained “persistently calm” on issues, leading to the rejection of the treaty.
She said: “In view of this, the JDC Board has voted to reject the proposed new contract completely and called for official renegotiations to address all your concerns.”
In response to the government’s silence, the JDC Board today submitted a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing program of escalating labor struggle measures that begins in early September.
The disputes led to assistant doctors strike six times this year, the first total failures in the NHS’ history.
The head of the BMA Assistant Doctors Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed contractual terms, which had been recommended by the BMA.
He told BMA members during the meetings, which took place before the vote by 54,000 assistant doctors and medical students, that the contract was beneficial and should be accepted.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said the contract for doctors in England would be enforced.
Russia and Turkey: An Alliance of Outsiders?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and officially announce an end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most.
There was a handshake, yes.
But Putin’s smile seemed narrow-lipped and he barely radiated warmth, even for his restrained conditions.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "dear friend" Putin - five times, according to a report.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old pre-crisis level, but would even improve.
The next day, a newspaper reported that Erdogan behaved as if nothing bad had ever happened.
His enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite.
But a sustained coolness emanating from Putin showed that the head of state of Russia had not forgotten anything.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the firing of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey.
Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.
Putin handed out, accusing Ankara of having fallen Russia in the back.
The crime was even greater, as it was committed by an alleged friend.
Rebuilding trust will be difficult, if not impossible.
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media carried out a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.
Most serious were the allegations by senior officials that Erdogan’s own family had benefited from the illegal oil trade in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He vehemently denied this.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received from President Erdogan the apology he wanted to hear.
Russia has achieved some sort of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are obvious.
Erdogan needs first and foremost all the friends he can get after he was almost removed from office in a failed coup last month.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shocked him.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard – especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has declined by almost 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be facilitated when the flights are resumed.
They are counting on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.
This week, state television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports are allowed back.
A report in Vedemosti put it this way: "Tourists there long, tomatoes here long."
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is furious with the West as it considers its response to the attempted takeover of power to be a weak response.
In addition, there is the ongoing resentment about the snail pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is eager to take advantage of the cool mood and reduce Turkey's relationship with the West.
The Russian head of state certainly won a bonus in Ankara for demanding support for the elected state bodies after the attempted coup.
This is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime change.
The summit in this splendid palace by the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to represent, as an analyst once described to me, an “Alliance of Outsiders”: two countries that feel disfellowshipped and ill-treated by the West and are now joining forces.
Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave itself the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It could be significant that after nearly three hours of initial talks, both presidents said at the press conference that they had not even stripped the topic.
The president of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin chose to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus on where to find a common denominator for Syria.
But after months of open hostilities – and given the potential for a complete disaster when NATO member Turkey shot down the Russian fighter jet – it is certainly better for the two heads of state to at least talk to each other again.
Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available to customers outside of Scotland
According to the CEO of the bank, the RBS brand will only be reduced to a back-office role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside of Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank’s global ambitions.
The bank has since distanced itself when it almost collapsed and had to be rescued eight years ago.
During this time, brand strategists have used “RBS” to protect other end-user financial brands.
She supported international sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to focus more national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentralized headquarters and the stock exchange listing will switch to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for the retail business that will get more meaning – Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt’s Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed by customers and employees in Inverness-shire during a tour.
He told BBC Scotland: “The RSB brand will become our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed as we become more of a bank of brands.”
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I am now saying that we are not pursuing global goals, but local goals.
Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the visibility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship.
“It’s time for us to evolve into the bank of brands, because how do we concentrate inside (we’ve asked) on making this a better bank for customers?” said the CEO.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands.
But with our work, focusing on customer needs and not our own, I think you’ll see a lot of changes.
We can relaunch these brands, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori reaches his 3,000th win at Newmarket on Prediction
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket, which brings him 3,000th profit
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th UK win at Newmarket on Friday.
He bet on Prediction, which is trained by John Gosden, on his local race track with his second win of the night.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the milestone in the flat race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
The three-time winner Dettori, who previously won on Ghayyar, said, "It's something special."
I am very emotional because my family is here too.
I’m very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.
It’s not a big meeting, it’s not Royal Ascot – it’s a banal Friday night with 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very humble.
Dettori picks up the cheer when he wins on Prediction
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race – jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who achieved more than 4,300 wins in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-time Derby winner had 4,493 career wins
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of modernity and it’s no surprise that he has reached this milestone that few before him have reached.
He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for racing, his enthusiasm and charisma have been delighting fans for years for this sport.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he would have already made 6,000 wins if he weren’t just a weekend and big tournament jockey!
Frankie has ridden winners in the UK for almost 30 years, which is great.
He has a lively personality, which is good for a British race, but beyond that, he’s an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades.
It was nerve-wracking.
A whole series of major tournament wins, including his famous "Glorious Seven" in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived an airplane crash and received a drug ban.
Three years ago, he initially struggled when he returned from his six-month lockdown, but he showed an impressive character strength to defy his doubters and return to his best form.
And he's far from finished - Dettori once said that he wants to continue in competitions until at least his 50th birthday.
Russia's Putin fires Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed his chief of staff, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was part of Putin’s closest circle of trust for many years.
The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
In a statement, the Kremlin said Putin had “ordered Ivanov’s release from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration without giving any reasons.”
Anton Vaino, who has been Ivanov’s deputy since 2012, has been appointed as his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
On the Kremlin's website, it is said (in Russian) that he was later the protocol chief and chief of staff of the government staff.
Regarding his appointment, he said to Putin, “Thank you for your trust.”
I think that the most important task of the government is to support your activity as head of state with regard to draft laws and controls to implement your instructions.
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Convince the smiling faces?
This move has made Moscow mysterious.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin’s closest confidants and works like him for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.
As chief of staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the chief of staff resigned at his own request.
But despite the smile for the cameras, few are convinced of this - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the result of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows that at the moment.
But the official assertion - that a man once promoted as a potential president wants to lead Russian environmental policy at once - met with great skepticism.
In his remarks to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said "it is true that in a conversation in early 2012, I asked you to entrust me with this very complicated post - you could almost say - difficult post for four years.
As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov as one of the five people he most trusted.
It was once assumed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin’s second term, as a third term would have violated the Constitution.
But this post was taken by another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson fired after beating producers
Gibson was involved in a physical clash last month on the set of the series in Los Angeles.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, the producers of the series, announced in a joint statement their resignation.
Gibson, who played special agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized publicly on Thursday before announcing his resignation.
On the set, there were artistic differences and a disagreement.
I regret the incident," he said in a statement.
Details of how the character Gibson is written out from the series, which follows a team of FBI agents, are expected to be released at a later date, according to the statement of ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old, who previously starred in the sitcom Dharma & Greg, has been on the show since the first season of the series in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have put all my heart's blood into it for the past 12 years," Gibson said in a statement.
I had hoped to be there to the end, but that will not be possible now.
I would just like to thank the writers, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and most importantly the best fans you can only wish for for a series.
The scheduled broadcast of the twelfth season is scheduled for September 28.
Mysteries about fish landing in garden in Banff
A resident of Banff asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks the 75 fish could be sandals spit out from a fountain.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, posted a video of the spectacle on Periscope in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two-inch long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the north deck of the Queensferry Crossing to the viaduct—meaning the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four closures of the "deck blowers" approaching completion around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete, as well as 46 slanted ropes.
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017.
Economy Secretary Keith Brown visited the site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnessing an engineering skill of a truly epic dimension in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used for this part of the bridge alone.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for fitting.
Overall, almost 79% of the entire bridge deck is in its place, and the last section of the deck gets a concrete cast for the deck today in Rosyth, meaning the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, Project Manager at Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: “The first closure represents a significant milestone in any bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the closure represents forward-looking construction and civil engineering.
After the installation of the last road deck section and its connection to the North Tower deck under construction, we then had to close the remaining gap on the north or land side.
This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.
Massive, since the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at a slope of about 3%.
Sensitive, as the tolerances the team was working towards were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters.
Thankfully, everything went very well.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three Men Have 'Luck to Be Still Alive'
Three men are "lucky to be still alive" after being thrown off Anglesey by their fishing boat.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station struck an alarm Friday at 13:20 BST after a crew watched the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulty swimming in safety as their boat moved on its own.
"We saw the boat turn around near her and imagined the worst," said Vince Jones, head of Moelfre's rescue station.
"Fortunately, the strong winds had already blown the boat out of its reach until we let it to water," he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man was found exhausted at the age of 60 and hanging on a buoy without a life jacket.
They all got on board the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station.
Mr. Jones said, "The three men who were thrown into the water are lucky to be uninjured and still alive.
Although the boat engine had an emergency stop line, it was released from the person controlling the boat when the boat tilted.
Someone watched over these men today.
Seriously injured - man stabs on his ex-girlfriend
A man attacked his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and seriously injured her.
According to police yesterday, the 50-year-old had been given the key to the apartment to retrieve his personal belongings.
Instead, the alcoholic perpetrator cut the clothes of his ex-girlfriend.
When she came into the apartment, he stabbed her twice.
The 44-year-old was injured in the hand and body.
The police were able to arrest the perpetrator.
While the 50-year-old was destroying his ex-girlfriend's clothes, he called his mother.
He then alerted his sister.
Together with her partner, the 45-year-old wanted to reassure her brother.
She couldn’t get him to leave the apartment.
So she went out of the house with her companion.
On the street, they met the man’s ex-girlfriend.
When the two women entered the apartment again, the 50-year-old pushed his sister aside and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
Who builds Braunschweig’s cheap apartments?
The SPD and the Greens believe that investors should be given much more responsibility in the future.
How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1,300 cheap homes in the next few years?
At the next Council meeting, the SPD is proposing an action concept for housing.
Controversy is programmed.
First and foremost, the question is: who should actually build the cheap apartments?
There has been no regulation so far.
SPD Group Chairman Christoph Bratmann says: "We agree with the Greens: If you want to build on urban areas, you will have to identify 20 percent of all apartments as social housing in the future."
However, the cheap apartments can also be created in the inventory.
However, the main point of controversy in the town hall, says Bratmann, is: "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private land?"
“We want investors to build at least 10 percent, but as much as possible 20 percent of the homes on such areas as social housing.”
A new urban housing funding programme, which will cost millions and still needs to be financed, is to provide incentives.
The problem, says Bratmann: "There is no agreement between the factions at the moment."
The CDU wants to make as few regulations as possible for investors.
The Left wants tougher conditions for investors.
In spite of this, according to Bratmann, the situation in the housing market is worsening.
If the action concept is implemented, this will provide for additional tasks in the building administration.
More staff is needed.
It is unclear if we will get the specialists.
But the program is still not complete: because the approximately 1,260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.
But how do you compensate for the loss of around 1,300 more cheap homes, whose promotion will expire in the next few years?
By 2020 alone, there will be 500 homes.
To prevent this, according to planning policy spokeswoman Nicole Palm, expiring bonds should now be purchased from the city.
In addition, it would be necessary to think about bringing homes back into the price fixing.
This is possible in the West.
The problem could be solved at a glance.
Because in the western city deadlines expire at the end of the year.
Around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price binding for cheap apartments.
Only: the owners, the housing companies do not want that.
After all, the number of social housing in the western city is drastically increased again, one distances from the goal of the so-called mixing.
There should no longer be a concentration of social weakness in just a few districts.
The Greens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion.
Group leader Holger Herlitschke says: "For a broad majority, the CDU must join the boat."
It has focused on building more single-family homes.
But that does not mean that a compromise cannot be reached.
Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that is worthwhile
It is fascinating to watch the world change.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their free time staring at screens, has been lamented by many in the last decade.
Pokemon Go is about getting people off the sofa and getting more active.
The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then to video games and most recently to smartphones.
Therefore, it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.
I am referring, of course, to the Pokémon Go madness, an app based on the characters that were initially created for the video games in the 1990s (later created a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).
Like many phenomena of pop culture, interest declined slightly before the game’s release in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that overloaded the servers.
Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, players go outside with their smartphones looking for Pokémon that are tracked with a GPS and, once they are found, can be “photographed” (via a screenshot on the phone) or “captured”.
A generation that played the game when she was even younger joined the madness and jumped for the search from the sofa.
In the U.S., the game led to a significant increase in steps taken by the “average” person every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of launching the game, the number of tracked people exercising for 30 minutes every day rose from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company doesn’t know who is playing Pokémon Go – it only sees the raw data for improving performance.
Many public health education campaigns that want to get people to “take 30 minutes,” “get up from the sofa” and “be active every day” stumbled on deaf ears because many public health messages are boring and come from people who look miserable.
However, the importance of sports cannot be overestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical exercise helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that is too long to list here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it gets people to do something outdoors that they enjoy.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine, as well as fun.
Some people even make new friendships while hunting.
As always, there are grumpy game spoilers who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could run against a door.
What's up, man?
There has been a breakthrough.
Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity in the past, they gave us no reason to do sports like this game does.
The new will lose its appeal and use will fade over time.
However, due to Pokemon’s success, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with becoming active in the real world, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.

Simone Biles makes gold in the women's tournament
Forget the pressure.
Forget about the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all that.
Dynamic on the jumping horse.
Effortlessly on the beam.
Stunning on the floor.
Brilliant on the whole line.
Finally, an Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast climbed to the multi-match title on Thursday and widened the gap between herself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.
Their total score of 62.198 was clearly ahead of silver medal winner and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.
The American Simone Biles is turning on the floating beam during the women's singles multi-match final in artificial gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American to win a multi-match title and the fifth overall as she solidifies her reputation for being the best of her generation or even at all.
She burst into tears as her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment came to an end.
This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:
Biles has dominated her sport for the past three years, winning 15 world champion medals—including 10 gold medals—with such amazing exercises involving a mix of ambition and precision that the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton said of her that she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."
She was expecting a final test in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.
Not returning to the Spring, Texas family with a handful of gold would be considered a disappointment.
Americans Simone Biles, on the left, and Aly Raisman, on the left, embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the women’s singles multi-match final in artificial gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday
Biles won the first medal on Tuesday, while serving as an exclamation mark at the farewell ceremony of retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles insisted on never planning the future during her long journey to the top, this is not really true.
Part of her ground exercises—which include her typical Tumbling Pass—are tuned to Latin American music that would fit in at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman’s mother during a school trip to the gym where Boorman trained, became a force.
She hasn’t lost a multiplayer competition since the summer of 2013, a series of victories that will last as long as Biles wishes.
Even though Mustafina led easily through two turns, the picture was misleading.
Floating beams and floor gymnastics - in which Biles holds the world champion title - were lurking.
She picked up again with 15,433 on the floating beam - and with a 15,933 on the ground put another one on it.
Raisman hugged her gently as they anticipated their final outcome – a pure formality – and tears poured onto Bile’s shiny red, white, and blue eyeliner as the vision she once described in her collector’s book became reality.
Raisman's performance was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a tiebrake.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, who is called "Grandma" by the Americans, had a head start.
After her ground exercise, she threw kissing hands to the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes seemed doubtful.
As for Biles, the rapidly spreading tweet of the 19-year-old from the beginning of this week has a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 Victims Shot in Serial Killer Case While Listening to Music in Car
According to police reports released on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot dead in one of the deadliest attacks in Phoenix’s first serial killer case in a decade while talking in the car and listening to music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot while the car was parked in a driveway on June 12, authorities said.
The perpetrator fired eight shots from a handgun while standing on the front passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle.
Police said the triple murder did not appear to have been the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 that were in the possession of one of the adult victims.
Phoenix police spokesman Sergeant Jonathan Howard said the shooting led investigators to take a closer look at whether it was linked to four previous attacks.
In total, seven people were killed and two others injured in nine attacks within four months in Hispanic residential areas.
"It's happening in a residential area in front of a house," Howard told KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same murderer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized due to her injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and Elli's daughter Maleah died at the scene.
A witness told police that it was not uncommon for her to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
Authorities also published a police report about the shooting aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and is believed to have been the work of the serial killer.
Investigators found cartridge sleeves and secured a bullet from the seat as well as bullet fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It's getting better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and of course his mother.
But like most of his peers, Edmund has microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing about during her pregnancy.
When he came home for the first time, my first thought was, I can’t do this.
I can't do this.
I didn't get into that.
What's not right at all -- of course you got involved," she said.
Her husband Vincent and her were told that Edmund might never be able to recognize her and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far as to suggest that he be institutionalized.
"My first answer to that was, 'I didn't know people were still doing that,'" Picciuto explained.
Edmund can walk with the help of a walking aid.
Edmund was unable to sit or crawl until the age of three, and he still cannot speak.
But he is slowly making progress.
He can walk with support and cycle.
He also loves playing and singing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund invented for "Please sing me something before."
"We're teaching him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not a typical sign language -- she says. Edmund invented some signs alone.
Microcephaly has a variety of causes: genetic as in Edmund, as well as infections with viruses such as measles or the Zika virus during pregnancy.
Symptoms and prognoses can vary greatly.
It is still too early to say how it will affect the lives of those infected with the Zika virus.
Picciuto remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I was constantly asking what would happen?
What will happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I haven’t asked for the prognosis for a long time because I don’t expect anyone to really tell me.
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
It's getting better.
You know it will get better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains and floods give rise to rescues in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rains and flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with more rainfall expected throughout Saturday.
Numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana and the south of the Mississippi flooded their shores, threatening widespread flooding after extreme rainfall, the National Weather Service reported.
The governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards, said state officials were in constant contact with local authorities and that aid was already on the way to the affected communities.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor’s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags were increasing.
Steele said the municipality of Tangipahoa alone had requested ten thousand sandbags.
A flood warning system will be deployed across much of southern Louisiana by Saturday.
The weather service said that an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area.
In southern Alabama, a tidal early warning system was deployed on Friday while it continued to rain in the Mobile area.
The River Comite near Baton Rouge and the River Amite near Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, are likely to reach record levels over the weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a downstream flooding in Ascension Parish poses a danger, as these will flow into Lake Maurepas only slowly over the trapped rivers.
The Tickfaw River, south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached its highest level ever recorded at 9 a.m. on Friday.
Rescue teams were still plucking people out of the floodwaters in the Amite and Wilkinson districts in southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife, and his stepson were among those rescued on Friday near Gloster.
Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet away from his home, rose sharply overnight.
He said that another stepson who lives nearby had warned him.
"We woke up and the water flowed and flowed in," Hansford said.
It reached my waist.
His wife told Hansford that in the 48 years she lived there, she had never seen such a height of the river.
Hansford said he and his family members had all the disabilities and he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said emergency workers rescued all three in a large military truck and took them to the nearest fire station in Gloster, where they were housed until Friday.
Krautmann said the flood had "spread out quickly" as there continued to be heavy rains and that the authorities were considering evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livingstone reported rain from midnight to Friday morning of 13.75 inches.
Krautmann said that the soil has been substantially saturated by the rains since Wednesday.
Authorities said heavy rains and road flooding caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and school failure in five school districts.
The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that an associate in Tangipahoa reported 200 flooded houses.
The residents were evacuated to two churches, both of which were now flooded.
Robby Miller, the head of the municipality, said authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets that were flooded.
Emergency shelters were set up in the cities of Amite and Hammond to accommodate the evacuees.
"As soon as the water starts to go back, they will be able to go back to their homes," he said.
In the town of Hammond in the municipality of Tangipahoa, nearly two dozen streets were closed due to the flood and sandbags were provided for the residents to take with them, who hope to be able to keep the water out of their homes and shops.
"The last major flood we had was in March," Lacy Landrum of the City Council said.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississippi, Harrison County emergency manager Rupert Lacy said it was still raining on the Gulf Coast.
According to him, a handful of homes were reported as flooded on Thursday, but no one was reported so far on Friday.
Keith Townson, Manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," Townson said, "and it's still coming."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "picked by bullets", survives shooting in Philadelphia
Police said the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week, the second time a 6-year-old child has been shot.
The boy's grandparents identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents stated that Brown suffered several gunshot injuries, including in the loin, leg, arm, and abdomen, but that he was conscious while being transported to the hospital.
"He's been through a lot, his little body was pierced by bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez told the station.
I just can't believe it.
The boy's condition was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several surgeries.
The boy’s family told the station that he is expected to recover.
He should have started the first class in a local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two at the age of 29 and a 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The boy was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old, who is in critical condition, the broadcaster reports.
The other two victims were not in the car and the police are currently investigating whether one of the injured men may be among the perpetrators.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that there was apparently a crossfire between several shooters.
Cartridge sleeves for assault rifles, which were traced back to various assault rifles, oversaw the scene of the crime.
It seems that this was clearly an ongoing struggle.
On the street, on both sides of the walkway, there were tubes.
So there seem to have been several armed fighters here who were very actively involved," police chief Anthony Ginaldi told the police in Philadelphia.
Several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area.
No arrests were made and police are currently reviewing the surveillance video.
On Tuesday, another 6-year-old girl was hit by a crossbar on her arm while playing outside her home in the residential area of West Oak Lane.
She is recovering and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That’s what I think of the women’s Olympic team in gymnastics for more than one reason.
Firstly, I’ve been at every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.
And secondly, this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have been inspiring to many young girls of different skin colors.
The structure of this team, which rounds off Aly Raisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the United States.
It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.
In the last four years, the number one female gymnast has been an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
That shows strength.
At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America cheered.
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of triple world champions Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez as they delivered unexpected yet masterful gym routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American to win gold at an individual women’s multiplayer event.
Team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We are experiencing the top of this sport, but that’s not what gymnastics classes across the country look like.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team.
They are the "last five" because the next Olympic team will have only four gymnasts in the team, and this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as coach.
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnastics is primarily in private gymnastics clubs maintained by parents who pay for the training, furnishing, travel, clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the coaches and their gymnastics and families).
The majority of these gymnastics clubs are located in affluent suburbs that can support the business.
In these clubs, the gymnasts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We need to give the communities of countless young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie a more affordable and accessible gymnastics training.
I founded my gymnastics foundation for 20 years.
At my events, we provided free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youth (mainly black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success.
It’s the inspiration of this team that gets thousands of young girls interested in gymnastics and that’s great.
It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.
This is such an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real portrayal of "Girl Power" by getting the Olympic team gold and thank you, grabbing her so many young girls with different backgrounds motivated to start their way to becoming healthy, strong and successful young women.
Assistant Doctors Want to Organize Further Strikes After Rejecting Jeremy Hunt's Proposal
The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistant doctors who voted in an election rejected it.
In July, Hunt had unveiled plans to forcefully introduce the contract, saying the NHS was in a “nobody’s land” and any further delay would be detrimental to employees and patients.
The first assistant doctors are to receive a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend work to improve care at incoming times.
Dr Ellen McCourt, chair of the BMA Assistant Doctors Committee, said in a statement last night, “assistant doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will fuel the current workforce crisis and fail to treat all doctors fairly.”
With only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress needs to be made and time is running out.
Efforts by the BMA to resolve the disputes through talks met with reluctance on the part of the government to participate and sometimes with deafening silence.
It was the promise that Jeremy Hunt made last month that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, lift the enforcement and address the worries of assistant doctors".
If he does not do so, the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further work-fighting measures.
The last strike at the end of April saw a postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments, as nurses and specialists were involved to provide coverage to doctors on the strike post chain.
The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by adopting the reformed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants a better weekly salary for the 54,000 assistant doctors who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, director-general of the NHS staff, urged the doctors to end the strike.
Mortimer said: “Labour struggle measures do not achieve anything of the little, but burden already overburdened teams and service providers, leaving patients, nurses and their families with only worries, distress and disruption.”
Over the past two months, we have spoken to the Committee of Assistant Doctors and responded positively to the Ministry of Health and other ministries regarding concerns regarding guardianship and whistleblowing.
Employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from a professional break, training boxes, mutual recognition of curriculum, continuing education leave and gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious it was with employers, the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health in November regarding compliance with the agreements.
The <0xC2><0xA3>2 Per Day Drug That Can Lower Heart Attack Risk
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a <0xC2><0xA3>2 per day medication after authorities have recommended that more people be given this medication for a longer period of time.
The anticoagulant drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is already given for 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
NICE’s NHS regulator has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
NICE’s NHS regulator has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Around 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year, and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty material in the artery walls that form coatings.
When the lining breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot that blocks the blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack.
When the blood clot dissolves, it can flow through the blood stream and block the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at a higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots less likely.
The NICE instructional draft, released today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg of ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Center, said: “Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have had another heart attack or stroke – often with disastrous consequences.”
Fear of another heart attack can have a significant negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
Experience shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
Through a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
Information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years. The instructional draft does not recommend any treatment beyond that period.
Political Correctness Culture Blossoms Election Fraud in Muslim Areas
Former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year on the basis of a government report for corruption
A culture of political correctness has led to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities being deliberately ignored, as a devastating government report revealed today.
Former Cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles has verbally attacked police, election observers and town halls for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse based on "hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
Former Minister of Integration and Local Government, who is now an anti-corruption king, said that intimidating voters for religious reasons would be so bad that police should be allowed to set up fence bands outside electoral booths to protect intimidated voters.
It recommends that voters should carry an identity card with them to prove their identity in elections.
Currently, a voter only has to give his name and address.
The report suggests applying non-removable ink to a person’s finger when they cast their vote to prevent someone from voting twice.
Whistleblowers should be given more protection, says Sir Eric.
He calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions by non-official committees or working groups.
"This not only serves against electoral fraud, but is also intended to protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that goes with it," he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlets election scandal in east London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that the incumbent mayor Lutfur Rahman should be removed from his office after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had "perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community in a cynical way" and that he had silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobia accusations.
Rahman is said to have led "his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to elect him."
Up to 300 votes were either dubious or the result of an imitation in which one person chooses as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.
He was particularly alarmed by the fraudulent postal election, in which senior members of the Muslim community pressured people to elect a candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system, including carrying ID cards to prove identity
The report said: “It was appropriate to demonstrate that pressure was exerted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, to vote in accordance with the will of the elderly, especially communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi backgrounds.
"There were concerns that... government institutions would have deliberately ignored such behavior due to 'politically correct' hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including prohibiting political activists from editing letter-voting documents to stop “voters.”
The report, which is being considered by Theresa May, also calls for tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral directory from being used for immigration and social fraud purposes.
Consider options to ask voters for your ID before voting.
Use non-removable ink on a person’s finger once she has cast her vote to prevent someone from voting twice.
Perform systematic verifications of a person’s nationality to ensure that they are eligible to vote.
A three-year limit on applications for automatic mail selection.
Prohibition for political activists to process full postal elections and envelopes of postal elections.
Authorize the police to set up fences around polling stations.
A law amendment that facilitates a charge of intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Prohibition of photography in polling stations.
Requirement that only English be used in the polling stations (except Wales).
Intensification of training to ensure that employees enforce the rule that voters go to the voting booth alone.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "astonishing" that no criminal charges have been filed after the Tower Hamlets case.
"The Electoral Court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy inappropriate for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.
He was convicted for a number of reasons of sufficiently - according to the high requirements of the criminal proceedings.
He also criticizes the ineffective "abhak controls" of the election registration departments of the town halls.
Sir Eric said: “The court ruling in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.
Our country, as the mother of parliaments, has a proud legacy, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial by some authorities threatens this good reputation.
Crazy about Kate's cyclist doppelgänger and other famous doppelgängers of Olympic athletes in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio have been blown away this week by the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has proven to be an impressive doppelganger of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympian is far from the only gold-fighting athlete this summer who has his own famous doppelganger – at least not if you can believe social media.
In honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that are currently flickering on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympians that have more than just a certain resemblance to Hollywood celebrities.
The Hunter and the Wolf: Team member of the U.S. team in archery Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since his childhood
Apart from Kate’s doppelganger on the bike track, many people on the internet pointed out how a certain archer might be the twin of A-famous Leonardo DiCaprio.
The U.S. team member in the archery Brady Ellison has caused an onslaught on Twitter after images appearing on which he looks uncannyly similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star.
In fact, the archer got the madness on social media and admitted that since he was a child, he gets to hear that he looks like Leo.
"I myself don't see much resemblance, except for facial hair," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess I'll take that as a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be even more central this year: the striking resemblance between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina with her big, expressive eyes is said to be able to go through as a double for Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the swimming pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared for years with the Glee star Matthew Morrison.
This user believes that Nathan is the "athletic version" of the Inception actor
Another ongoing comparison was made between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similarly heavy eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medal swimmer Yulia Efimova has more than just sun-brown skin and blonde hair like actress Annalynne McCord, while American Nathan Adrian has been attested by fans to resemble an "athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt."
Strong women: Soccer star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar face shape and eyes
Not the only one: A Twitter user was very happy that others noticed the similarities as well
Theory put into the room: According to this user, there may be a reason for the resemblance of the couple
A Twitter user explained her satisfaction that "the rest of the internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical."
In fact, U.S. football star Hope Solo and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as the gold medalist in gymnastics Gabby Douglas, who has her own beautiful wide smile similar to that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympic commentator apologizes for his statement that Chinese swimmer "died like a pig"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth place at dr 4x200m freestyle swimming squad outraged viewers of the CBC live broadcast of the Olmypians on Wednesday
Canadian broadcaster CBC had to apologize after one of its commentators said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer “did off like Mief” and died as a pig during the race.
Commentator Byron MacDonalds thought his microphone was turned off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m freestyle swimming squad.
MacDonald, who had been brought on board the CBS commentator team to give more "colour," could be heard saying, "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost touch, baby."
Too excited, went off like Mief, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second stage of the swimming squad 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada’s Taylor Ruck, allowing Canadians to open the gap to China.
Viewers across Canada responded quickly online after being shocked by the sound and language
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC commentator just say that the 14-year-old swimmer from China "died like a pig"????
The idiot didn't realize they were still on the show."
Ai Yanhan from China was described in the final 4 x 200m freestyle swimming squad for women as follows: "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby."
Criticism of Byron MacDonald on Twitter came quickly and harshly, with many questioning him.
Twitter users did not hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all look like racists. #disgusted.
Shortly afterwards, Scott Russel, who hosted the CBC broadcast, apologized live for MacDonald's comment, saying, "We apologize for the comment being broadcast over a swim performance."
It was an unfortunately chosen phrase, we're sorry it happened."
CBC apologized more than 90 times to people who responded to it via Twitter.
Scott Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald.
CBC copied and added his apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald’s comments.
The network also apologized quickly and issued a message.
We sincerely regret that these statements have been made and that they have been made possible to be broadcast.
Last night we quickly apologized to our viewers on broadcast and our followers on social media.
To clarify one thing, Byron’s comments related to the swimmer’s performance and not her as a person.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and an unfortunately chosen formulation. Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on the show and tried to justify his remark by stating that it was not his intention that it be interpreted as a personal attack.
"I'd like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the women's swimming squad in the CBC Olympics," he said.
"I was referring to the performance of the swimmer and not her as a person."
Of course, no disregard was intended and I am very sorry."
Buyer in Primark outraged by woman who tries shameless underwear in the middle of the shop
The buyers didn’t know where to look when a woman took off her clothes in the middle of a Primark to try on underpants.
To aggravate the situation, she sampled what she looked like inside, took her out and put her back on the shelf.
She continued browsing and tried four pairs of underpants at a shop at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone.
The Primark store at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone, where the woman tried on the underpants before putting them back on the shelf
A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman tried on the underwear, "she got dressed again and left the store without buying anything."
She said, "People could not believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the sales floor, she took a pair of underpants from the showcase, took off her own tights and pants and tried them on.
“She wasn’t even trying to find a more discreet place to do it – she was just standing there, naughty like Oskar.”
"Everyone stared as she took off her underpants again, which she apparently did not like since she put them back on the shelf."
She repeated the same thing with three more underpants before finally deciding that she didn’t like anything, dressing up and going out.
“She didn’t seem to bother watching someone—or thinking about the person who might be buying the underpants she’d tried on.”
Ms. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said, "How disgusting to think that someone would take home underpants that another person was wearing and that weren't washed."
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added, "As I noticed, the employees tried to pull the garments out of sale after she left - which is just as good."
"I would hate to go home with a new pair of underpants and find out that another woman was wearing them and taking them off again and they weren't washed."
A spokesperson for Primark said: “Primark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday, August 9, at our Folkstone branch.”
All eligible products have been withdrawn from the sale.
How to Protect Yourself from Weapon Attacks with Krav Maga
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you.
We spoke with Rhon Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Regardless of whether you are approached from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the spear for your predator.
If you are approached from behind, you should turn around first so that you can see your attacker and "get out of the line of fire," Mizrachi says.
Then grab the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder before you punch it in the face with your free elbow.
Then hit him with his knee in the groin and twist the gun out of his hands as the attacker bends down in pain. Hit him with the barrel in the face and move backwards as they point the gun at him.
In attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the line of fire, grab the weapon and twist it so that the attacker cannot shoot.
At the same time, shift the weight onto the weapon and hit the attacker on the chest, then twist the weapon out of his handle before moving backwards and pointing the weapon at him.
Sounds difficult?
Watch the video to see exactly how it looks like Mizrachi.
But remember that in the case of a robbery, it is safest to hand over your money – unless you are a Krav Maga Grand Master.
Traveler Ian Wright scrapes his tongue at the dirtiest places in Europe for a guide
A British traveler underwent a serious test of his immune system and choking reflex – licking some of Europe’s most filthy and disgusting places.
Moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk scraped his trains on a euro bill, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a flush knob of a train toilet, and a public phone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.
Before licking any object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he is going to get into.
But the experiment, filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results to light.
The idea of licking the flush button of a pull toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but in fact, there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.
During his journey through Europe, Mr Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked left more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.
Mr. Wright became known for testing the resilience of his gut by traveling the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
From public railings at train stations to flushing knobs of toilets, the task definitely put his immune system under test.
“Already as a child, I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water.”
In the film, he certainly met his reputation.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
His sample swab showed a luminometer number of over 4,000 units.
In comparison, the luminometer number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet he refused to lick after its luminometer number was over 4,000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60
Mr. Wright and the Finnish dairy producer Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom.
In the movie, he says, "That's close to the worst thing I've ever smelled in a toilet."
There's nothing dirtier than that!
I'm not going to lick anything here because it's disgusting in here.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.
The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.
Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, Juices and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.
We did crazy brainstormings that ended up saying, "Let's call Ian."
They claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a wider context – the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: “Let me say this – I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the things I’ve instructed him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film.”
Of course, there were things that made it easier for Ian to lick them and others that made it quite difficult.
I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty treats on film."
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of all respondents associated lactic acid bacteria in particular with the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58 percent said they use products that contain attached lactic acid bacteria at least occasionally.
A Social Family Destroys Social Apartment in Saltash, Cornwall
An anti-social family left their social housing after being delogized with <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 in damages for terrorizing their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown from their property in Saltash, Cornwall after a long list of complaints.
After they were forcibly removed from their property, shocked cooperative employees found the property in an irreparable condition.
The walls had gaping holes, wooden boards were torn open, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was smeared on the walls.
The family was relocated and it is believed that she now lives in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for the property management at Cornwall Housing, said she fears the apartment could no longer be repaired.
She said, “It was an absolute nightmare for people here and I don’t think people have to live this way.
There are many things to consider as this property will probably be considered as not so nice part of Cornwall.
The family is notorious and so is their reputation.
The couple had three sons living in the apartment in the meantime, and police said the terror the family had inflicted included street fighting with baseball bats, intimidating locals, drug abuse, drug trafficking, and excessive screaming, arguing, and cursing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received an order for anti-social behavior in June.
In some rooms of the house, which may be demolished, old garbage was found
In the estate where drugs were traded in the past, the wooden boards were torn open.
Neighbors said they saw them fighting on the street and had to be called the police regularly
Cornwall Housing forcibly delogted her and her partner from the property this week after giving them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to move out voluntarily.
The delogement was cheered by relieved neighbors who said their lives were turned into hell.
One said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad.
The countless times we tell the police here are incredible.
“We couldn’t sleep this morning.”
We got up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to that!
Now that they're finally gone, it's gonna be nice.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Cornwall Housing’s Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager, said the family failed to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years.
On the overgrown side of the town hall, trash and old toys were thrown down
He added: “It is a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and that of their family, since deloging is always the last step that Cornwall Housing is considering.
This was a very difficult case, as the behavior was extreme and their actions had to be terrible for their neighbors to see.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and provided us with the information.
I hope this development will bring comfort to some neighbours and convey the message that anti-social behavior is not tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.
A dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after delogizing
Homeworkers will now have to clear the garbage mountains that surround the house
In 2014, police ran a raid on the house and found over 70g of cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash amounting to <0xC2><0xA3>1,700.
Skeldon received a fine after confessing to possession of a class B drug in commercial intent.
She claimed that the money was for a gravestone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being without shelter, it is assumed that Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many of the house's walls were graffiti-smelling.
Police say they'll deloge tenants who don't follow the house rules
Angela Crow of the police of Devon and Cornwall said the delogement was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not comply with the house rules.
"This goes to those who think they can behave without self-recrimination as well as to those who have been harmed by such behavior," she said.
The police of Devon and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal panicked after a low-flying military jet flew over beach
Sun worshippers in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A Portuguese P-3C Orion Air Force plane set off an incredible crash flight
The air forces stated that it was on a training flight, but insisted that there was no safety risk
This was the moment when frightened tourists start to panic after a low-flying jet crashes over a full beach.
Dramatic video footage showed the military plane flying almost in tangible proximity over the sun worshippers on the beach section in Aveiro in northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers jumped up as they understandably began to worry about the noise of the jet engines without first seeing what was coming through the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many vacationers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly-By on social media, said: "It really flew twice very deep and there was a moment when it looked like it was crashing."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was just surfing and it felt like the plane was falling on me."
Tourists on Aveiro beach panicked when the plane came out of darkness and flew incredibly deep
The Portuguese Air Force today stated that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to fly so deep that this was the only way to detect them.
The spokesman said that the jet flew slightly deeper than usual due to poor visibility due to nearby surface fires, but the air forces insisted that safety was not at any time endangered.
Fires have destroyed parts of mainland Portugal this summer, killing four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force today stated that the pilot had to fly so deep because of the conditions – strong fog and fire smoke – which restricted his sight.
The plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Supercup: Barca with worries against Sevilla
Sevilla - FC Barcelona will fight on Sunday for the first step towards winning the first title in the new football season.
The Catalans will play away against FC Sevilla in the Spanish Super Cup duel, and the replay will take place three days later at Camp Nou.
The double winner must renounce Neymar, who competes with Brazil in the Olympic football tournament, in the match against the defeating Cup finalist and reigning Europa League champion, among others.
Goalie Marc-Andre ter Stegen is also missing.
The German suffered a ligament drift in the knee during training, thus clarifying the one question at Barca at least for the time being in favor of Claudio Bravo.
The Chilean International and Ter Stegen have been competing for number one status in Barcelona for two years.
Coach Luis Enrique has so far renounced a clear decision in this regard and left Bravo in the league, but Ter Stegen in most other competitions the lead.
Before the first mandatory game of the new season, Spanish champions have doubts about the fitness status of the team, which was humiliated on Saturday in a test game by Liverpool with 0:4.
Lionel Messi and Co. did not really convince in the 3:2 test race against Sampdoria on Wednesday.
Sevilla in turn has to digest the 2-3 defeat after extension in the European Super Cup against Real Madrid and aims for the second triumph in the "Supercopa de Espana".
With 11 successes so far, Barcelona is the record winner in this competition.
Ma Long in a separate league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion.
The 27-year-old defeated his compatriot and "title defender" Zhang Jike 4:0 (12,5,4,4) in a one-sided final on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro.
With this, the world ranking first won the "Golden Grand Slam" with successes at the World Cup, World Cup, World Tour final tournament and Olympia.
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
The two Chinese made it to the final as expected and made it to the title with each other.
This made it clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would win the singles title under the sign of the Five Rings.
The last non-Chinese on the top Olympic stage was former SVS N<0xC3><0x96> legionary Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left alone on the record, between sets and time-outs they had no coaches with them.
They had retreated to the stands and let their protectors go on their own in fair competition.
"The matches so far, I've played for my country.
"In the final, I play for myself," Zhang had consistently said.
After the game, gold and silver medal winners posed with the China flag.
The match itself was unexpectedly one-sided.
Ma had only really struggled with his 28-year-old opponent in the first set.
After that, he determined the tempo on the record and left Zhang only 13 points in total.
Due to Ma’s superiority, the expected sweeping match did not develop.
Nevertheless, enough breathtaking ball changes were to be seen.
Mizutani won the bronze match against 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4:1.
The Belarusian had suffered a rib injury in his quarter-final against German European champion Dimitry Ovtcharov, was then in medical treatment, had to "finally" content himself with sheet metal.
By the way, the Swedes Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008) had become Olympians in a similarly high table tennis age.
Donald Trump admits "violent problems" in election campaign
The leadership of the U.S. Republicans is plagued by massive concerns about losing its majority even in traditionally conservative states.
Presidential candidate Donald Trump now admitted weaknesses in his election campaign in the former republican stronghold of Utah.
A rare moment when the usually arrogant and self-confident multimillionaire expressed something like concern, as correspondents reported.
After throwing 16 rivals within his own Republican camp out of the race, doubts about his success in the battle for the White House are growing.
“We have tremendous problems in Utah,” Trump told evangelical Christians, asking for support in key states like Ohio, Florida, or Virginia.
Blame for false reports of his candidacy, he resumed his well-known media shouts.
Republican strongholds shake
Utah is usually a safe bank for Republicans.
According to a June survey by SurveyUSA, Trump and his rival from the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, were on par.
Other institutions see Trump ahead, but not with the distance that is common for Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also at risk.
In an interview with CNBC, Trump responded to the question of how he wanted to stop Clinton’s advance again: “Just as I have done so far.”
And pushed after: This will either be successful, or I will have a very very nice, long vacation."
He does nothing but “tell the truth.”
If it is not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that is okay, Trump continued.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, the party is said to have threatened to remove funds in support of his election campaign if he should not be able to present better poll scores.
Instead, they want to take the Republican candidates for Congress more under their arms.
Olympia: Thirst fraud in doping test
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary committee on the case.
Kenya’s athletes are threatened with disaster after the second doping incident at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.
After an attempted fraud at a doping check in the Olympic Village, Kenya sent a coach home.
The International Olympic Committee announced that it would immediately set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case.
A Kenyan official had announced that former sprinter and today's coach, John Anzrah, had handed out a urine sample in the Olympic Village under the name of 800-metre runner Ferguson Rotich.
This has been reported to the team management of Kenya by the doping inspectors.
The IAAF has asked the IOC for information on the case in order to initiate its own investigation, an IAAF spokesperson said.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent actions of the IOC, the IAAF will carry out an evaluation," the IAAF said in a statement.
"He (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and pretended to be Ferguson Rotich, handed over the sample and signed it," said Stephan Arap Soi, Kenya's chief of mission.
He was in possession of the athlete's accreditation, which was on the list for training controls of the World Anti-Doping Agency.
Ferguson Rotich finished fourth in over 800 metres in Beijing in 2015.
Four days earlier, Kenyan athletics delegation chief Michael Rotich had been withdrawn from the Rio Games.
He is said to have informed athletes of his country about upcoming doping tests against money payments.
According to media reports, he was arrested on his return to Nairobi airport.
Kenya has been under special observation at the IOC for a long time after numerous doping offences.
When the IOC announced more than 2,000 doping target controls before the Rio Games, it was unusually previously pointed out that athletes from Kenya and Russia in particular were targeted.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country before the Summer Games in Brazil to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.
The law was passed a few weeks before the start of the Olympics.
As a result, WADA removed Kenya from the list of countries whose anti-doping policies are compliant with WADA rules.
Kenya is considered a great runner nation.
The country's athletes won the most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.
A number of ARD television reports have repeatedly accused Kenya of having doping resources readily available and a significant mentality of sports fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had done in Russian athletics.
It could be demonstrated that in this sport, doping was extensive and systematic.
Russia's athletes were then excluded from the Summer Olympics.
Salzburger "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In the Shakespeare year, the Salzburg Festival presents the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic love couple, similar to Romeo and Juliet.
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story", Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.
The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled a youth dream with the role of Mary.
In the orchestral trench, the Simón Bolívar Orchestra under the direction of Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm," he enthuses.
We always say that she is very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody.
It is a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I would say that we really have Bernstein’s music in our blood!
In this production, Bartoli plays an elderly Maria.
She remembers with sadness her love for Tony while the younger Mary plays and dances.
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
First, because it is musically extraordinary!
And then there's Mary's personality.
She says it in her song, "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright."
So she is clever, of course also naive, and very passionate.
"She is very similar to me, to my Italian character that I have as a Roman woman," Bartoli laughs.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It is such an honor for us to work with her.
She is an enormously generous person.
And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"
Leading is a necessity for him.
You see it in each of his movements, in his eyes, it is his life!
It’s such a great opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a cheerful approach to life, which is very important at all!
For American director Philip Wm. McKinley, the "West Side Story" is highly topical: "This piece is about prejudice and fanaticism."
Today we have the refugees, then the Puerto Ricans went to New York, and the New Yorkers didn’t want them.
These are the same issues, and they are as meaningful today as they were then.
59 years later, the piece is still relevant.
London schoolgirl who joined ISIS was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, reportedly died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said her family learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.
It was suspected that she was killed by a Russian airstrike in Raqqa, the group’s bulwark in the country, ITV News reported on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died shortly after she planned to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
"One can only hope that the only good thing is - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going to a war zone - preventing people from ever making that decision," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London boarded a plane to Turkey and then boarded a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana’s family was informed that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria – and became a widow within a few months.
Reid says Clinton will remain as a candidate for Supreme Court in the event of election victory at Garland
Harry Reid, leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that the Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland’s confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.
The majority leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the late judge of the Supreme Court, Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on Thursday during a conference call that he expected Clinton to select Garland "with some degree of certainty."
A spokeswoman for Reid later said he had not yet spoken to Clinton about whether she would nominate Garland and he was speculating.
He praised Garland, saying Clinton’s team would not cause unrest with a new candidate.
Garland is the Supreme Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Raid said Republicans blocked the Garlands nomination, being laymen and supporters of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also noted that Donald Trump was unfit for the presidency.
Treats wants nude calendar for "women and for men"
Treats Magazine is working with photographer David Bellemere to bring out a 1970s Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their NOW Muses Calendar for 2017.
Treats’ editor-in-chief Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude magazine was different from old-school playboys because “playboy is for men.”
I do this for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar does too.
"We need to return to the portrayal of timeless and classic nudity where both women and men feel comfortable and inspired by these images of a female body," Shaw said in a press release.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit their pictures online or in person at open casting call in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish community expects mass flight
"Whoever does not adapt and praises Erdogan is sitting on packed suitcases," said Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gülen-Near Foundation for Dialogue and the World.
The Kurdish community of Germany expects tens of thousands of refugees fleeing Turkey to Germany in the short term.
In the medium term, it could even be "a few hundred thousand", the association chairman Ali Toprak believes.
Due to the harsh actions of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany.
"In the short term, I expect tens of thousands, in the medium term, several hundred thousand refugees from Turkey in Germany, if the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," said Ali Toprak, the chairman of the association.
Because the government has already overcrowded Kurdish strongholds with punitive actions months ago, 500,000 Kurds within Turkey are on the run.
After the thwarted coup, secular and oppositional ethnic Turks were added.
Many will want to start anew in Europe if they continue to be oppressed in Turkey.
"It cannot be that a state that itself accepts refugees produces refugees in its own country," Toprak said.
The head of the association lamented the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish cities, but also in Alevi towns.
Erdogan wants to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kurds.
"They are the last large minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have been exterminated or expelled in the last hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a CDU member.
The head of the association called for the German government to "position itself as sharply as Austria against Erdogan and his supporters."
A "witch hunt" against Erdogan critics is also taking place in Germany.
For the first time in the last few months, I am no longer safe in Germany.
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the fleeing of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and oppositionists.
The branding as Gülen supporters destroys teachers and other academics’ professional existence.
"Whoever does not adapt and praises Erdogan is sitting on packed suitcases, including the Kemalists and seculars," said Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gülen-near Dialogue and Education Foundation, the "World".
As the newspaper reports, citing figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Turks represented the largest group of asylum seekers recognised for political persecution in Germany even before the coup.
As of 30 June, this number was 11,386 people, almost 29 percent of all asylum-entitled persons (39,625).
This survey does not include those fleeing war, poverty or hopelessness.
Asylum entitlements under the Basic Law are exclusively political, i.e. from the state side, individually persecuted.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "Go where it hurts"
Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: The locals get nothing from the summer election campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to vote for the Landtag.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.
In 2021, the parliamentary elections will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided earlier this year.
Because it's not as stupid as it has been so far: summer holidays, heat and election campaign - that bites itself.
The locals, who are supposed to be convinced by the campaigners, are on vacation.
The vast majority of tourists who are in the country, traveling on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so are not allowed to vote for the Landtag.
In addition, there are practical problems: during the holidays, helpers who hang up posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and count votes in the end are hard to find.
Until September 4, 2016, the election day and last holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern must once again let election campaign just past the people.
The hot phase, if you can say that, has just begun.
And it’s also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD/CDU coalition, has to fear for his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls.
It is exciting how much newcomer AfD is doing and what remains in the end for a coalition.
Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, is making an almost inconspicuous election campaign, one disregards his big posters.
He travels through the country, distributes roses and chats with the people, just as his legendary predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.
Otherwise, Seelering has got cold feet and blames Chancellor Merkel for the bloom of the AfD.
Her refugee policy, her "We can do this" has accelerated the rise of right-wing populists, which will now probably cost him the beautiful office.
The CDU with its top candidate, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what it is like to campaign at the wrong time in the right place.
She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to major rallies; Merkel’s parliamentary constituency is in the northeast.
But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berliners and Saxony than Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.
"There was probably the majority from other federal states," complained Vincent Kokert, general secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR.
But it is also not a shame for anyone from other corners of Germany to ever listen to Angela Merkel.
Otherwise, the North-East CDU largely refrains from the usual campaign booths on marketplaces and in front of shopping malls with umbrellas and balloons.
That, according to Kokert, only plays a "subordinate role".
The Union, too, has noticed that in the countryside, you are bursting away from the base, that it has to make a great effort to find a way back to the people.
It is like the Left, the SPD, the Greens: scarcely present in the far reaches of the country.
However, the advice of the CDU campaigner Kokert to his fellow fighters is also self-revealing: "They must go where it hurts, namely where the people are: village festivals, golden weddings, every birthday party must be used".
Because there is a lot at stake, Sellering has now called on its SPD to a particularly committed election campaign.
In polls, the Social Democrats were last behind partner CDU with 22 percent (25) and only just ahead of the AfD (19).
In the 2011 election, the SPD had clearly won with 35.6 percent ahead of the CDU (22).
The Greens, a small party with seven percent in the polls, are likely to make the jump into the Landtag.
They turn holiday distress into a modern virtue and largely shift their election campaign to the Internet.
"Online election campaign," it calls the country's president Claudia Müller.
Otherwise, green election campaigners go in search of local voters among the holidaymakers.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, is just taking a houseboat to the lakes of Mecklenburg and still finds it beautiful.
Her impression: "Election holiday in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is no punishment".
B27 renovation: restaurants suffer from closure
There is nothing to complain about the speed at which the B 27 is being renovated.
For those responsible for the construction work, which starts at 5.30 a.m. and ends at around 8 p.m., there is praise everywhere.
"They've made everything pretty tacky," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet filling station.
This is a super team.
There is no delay either.
The construction site could be moved to the south at the beginning of the week at half-time as planned, until the end of October.
It is also praised for the hospitality of those responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to setting up emergency driveways.
Since the construction site migrated to the south on Monday and the blockade of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen was lifted and thus the connection to Rottenburg again exists, the traffic situation within the village has relaxed.
The citizens can now drive the B 27 on both sides again from Ofterdingen.
Escape traffic through the place seems to be declining.
"There were some significant complaints," says Florian King, deputy chief of department responsible for the technical management of the refurbishment.
The residents of Bachsatzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to struggle with more traffic noise, because many of them were searching for hidden routes and trusting their navigation rather than signage.
As a result, some trucks crossed into residential areas.
Since the speed limits were not complied with, the municipality increasingly requested the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.
"There have been significant overruns," says King, who informed himself on the spot about the situation.
There have already been two to three flashes per minute.
The fastest was 77 km/h in the Tempo 30 zone.
Since the construction site moved on, however, it has become calmer.
For the businessmen on the B 27, it is only a small consolation that the road is now open again for customers from Rottenburg.
Businessmen do not like to look into the maps.
But that the B 27 renovation has led to sales drops in them lets everyone you ask see through.
However, some are more and some less affected.
Those who have less to do with the "end customer", i.e. produce for other companies, for whom the renovation has little consequences.
At the Maier car dealership, Thomas Sulz also speaks of a "maximum slight decline", but also admits that, of course, "the running customer is missing".
The most crowded are the locals along the road.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the steakhouse, formerly Krone, finds clear words.
This is already existentially threatening.
Not only him, but all the restaurants have "hit it hard".
The customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.
We should be happy about every euro in sales.
Sales losses are “well over 50 percent”.
The road refurbishment has "thrown back its operations by two years."
Half of his employees had to be dismissed.
If I had a company with 4,000 employees and half had been fired, politics would have reacted differently.
Instead, Government President Jörg Schmidt responded to a question from Göhner as to whether there could be a financial compensation, stating that otherwise the restaurant would benefit from the advantages of the situation at B 27.
Göhner knows from other counties where something like this was handled more generously.
With all the complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.
After all, the family business has been located here since 1715, he refers to its long history.
He can understand that other regulars now come by less often because of the complicated traffic management.
If you can't drive here, it's nice somewhere else.
Göhner has no doubt that his main clients will return after the end of the renovation work.
Despite the crises with BSE and avian flu, Göhner considers the impact of the B 27 construction work on his customers to be the biggest crisis his restaurant has experienced in its long history.
Six months of construction work, that's already brutal.
Laws are constantly being scrutinized in the name of the fight against terrorism.
After the recent attacks, Interior Minister de Maizière is now presenting a thick security package.
But what does a tolerance status have to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say about all of this?
Thomas de Maizière gives the Reconciliator.
All of his proposals are "politically reasonable" to the coalition partner, says the Federal Minister of the Interior at the presentation of his new security package.
They don't overwhelm anyone.
Other, further points would be discussed first within the parties.
I also participate in this.
As interior minister, however, he is keen on results and on a "achievable consensus" within the coalition.
After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, De Maizière took some time before presenting his conclusions on security in the republic.
But now they are all the more extensive.
Some things are already known, announced, targeted: That a new security authority should take care of the cracking of encrypted communications is not new.
Neither does the fact that Germany has to implement several EU requirements on passenger data and gun law.
The call for more video surveillance and staff for the security authorities is also not surprising.
In part, de Maizière is launching a second set of proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD: he wants to punish sympathy advertising for terrorist groups and jihadists with double citizenship to button off the German passport.
"These will be difficult points for the SPD," the CDU man admits.
He nevertheless considers this to be reasonable and does not demand anything that the coalition partner has no chance at all.
A few new ideas de Maizière also presents.
They have it partly in themselves: He plans rapid procedures for deportations and more possibilities for detaining people before deportation.
Refugees who are specifically brought to the country should have their smartphones checked and social media accounts disclosed for a security check.
When tolerating rejected asylum seekers, he wants to put some even worse than before - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers in order to cover up their identity.
Some of them are politically and legally sensitive.
There are also some things that seem unexplained and leave questions open.
And on some points - in the case of the unequal treatment of those who are patient, for example - the question arises: what does this have to do with security and terror?
Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between refugees and terror.
But it cannot be denied that the assassins of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people were concerned about security in view of the high number of refugees.
And things that people were deeply concerned with could not be ruled out even during election campaigns.
Internal security has become a huge focus.
First the attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The uncertainty is great.
And yes, there are election campaigns.
The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly putting themselves in position on the issue of internal security.
Over the past few days, things have been going well between the two parties.
First, there is a sharp dispute over the equipment of the federal police, then about a security policy idea collection of some Union interior ministers, in which the heads of department also demand a burqa ban and a departure from dual citizenship.
De Maizière also strives for conciliatory tones here.
He doesn’t think he’s going to get away from the double pass.
We have pacified the discussion in Germany.
Reopening them is not meaningful.
In the case of a burqa ban, he has constitutional concerns.
Whether his own package is constitutional in all corners and whether it is actually "reasonable" for the coalition partner, has yet to be shown.
There's a lot in it that could cause a fight.
But the SPD is also currently trying to make its mark on the issue of internal security.
Party leader Sigmar Gabriel signals a cautious willingness to talk and says: "The SPD is ready to talk about anything that contributes to further increasing security".
Volkswagen is still getting through.
Despite diesel scandals, delivery figures are rising worldwide.
However, not all markets run smoothly.
In the recall process, there is a whirlwind around a term.
Volkswagen starts with more modest deliveries in the second half of the year.
Although Europe’s largest car manufacturer has continued to show an advantage over the past year despite the diesel business thanks to its many brands and some well-running markets.
But in July, the core brand VW weakened, especially in Western Europe, and thus again burdened the total sales, as the company listed in the Dax announced.
The VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles worldwide in July with 449100 cars than in the previous month.
Sales in Western Europe alone, the second most important market after China, were 14 percent lower than in the previous year.
In the home market of Germany, deliveries fell by almost a sixth.
Brand Sales Manager Jürgen Stackmann attributed the weaker figures from July to two fewer sales days in Europe.
In addition, in some core markets there has been a restraint of purchase due to "changed economic conditions".
In addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey, the British vote to leave the EU also weighed heavily, a spokeswoman said.
In the US, where the exhaust business first escalated, there is also a further minus.
The major support for VW is the Chinese market.
Overall, the mainly affected house brand of Lower Saxony continues to glimpse the diesel scandal: After the first seven months, only a delivery minus of 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles is expected.
Group Sales Manager Fred Kappler continued to show a sales increase from January to July.
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles during this period, and 5.904 million worldwide.
Volkswagen had manipulated exhaust tests with a software.
In Germany alone, VW calls around 2.5 million cars for conversion into the workshops.
In the course of the refurbishment, VW reaffirmed that the refurbishment of the cars has no negative effects.
After the re-equipment of the vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance.
The car manufacturer issues a "guarantee-equal" certificate to the customer after the conversion, but does not speak of a "guarantee", as it was said on Friday in corporate circles.
The reason is legal subtleties.
The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen now grants its German customers a guarantee for converted diesel models.
This was confirmed by VW representatives at the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday.
The Ministry of Transport has confirmed that this meeting took place.
"VW has to fully comply with the requirements of my commission of inquiry and the KBA."
"Deviations from this will not be accepted," Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) said in a statement.
VW has assumed the guarantee that fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance will not deteriorate after the conversion and that all vehicle values relevant to type-approval will remain unchanged.
Volkswagen itself uses the term "guarantee" but not as it was called in corporate circles.
With the broad term "guarantee", Volkswagen sees the possibility that, for example, six months after the conversion, customers come to a workshop with an engine damage - and this could be due to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
It is also important in the interest of the customer to avoid that any other damage, which has nothing to do with the exhaust gas scandal, leads to uncertainty with regard to possible warranty regulations.
Therefore, VW does not use the term "guarantee".
Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee is demanding penal interest from rich savers in the future - as the second institute in Germany.
Bank CEO Josef Paul said on Thursday: "It is only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros in cash or daily cash accounts."
The Bundesverband Deutscher Banken (Bundesverband Deutscher Banken) speaks of an individual case and sees no signal in it: ordinary savers should "not be afraid to pay for their savings interest".
If banks deposit money overnight with the European Central Bank (ECB), they must pay their 0.4 percent penalty interest.
From September, Raiffeisenbank Gmund will charge private and corporate customers this fee for deposits over 100,000 euros in cash or daily cash accounts.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
"The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year in the future," Paul said.
He has been guarding 40 million euros for some time now, which could be withdrawn from one day to the next and which he could not use.
"They are in my central bank account and cause 0.4 percent costs," the bank chief said.
"I can't put in $4,000 for every million."
The costs are now passed on according to the polluter principle.
To simply leave the cash in Raiffeisenbank’s vaults would be far too dangerous: “I’ve already experienced four robberies, I don’t want the fifth one!”
Most customers would understand and switched to other forms of investment.
Few people migrated to other banks.
The Bavarian Cooperative Association stated: "The extreme monetary policy of the ECB causes considerable costs for all banks".
To wear it alone is "not possible in the long run in terms of business."
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management, credit cards or bank transfers.
The Thuringian Volks- und Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land had made headlines with its Skatbank branch in 2014 with penal interest rates for deposits from three million euros.
Michael Kemmer, CEO of the Bankenverband, said: "We do not expect private customers to have to pay fees for deposits all over the world, as competition among banks and savings banks is far too strong in Germany".
A banker said that there was "a clientele that is a little more wealthy on Lake Tegernsee".
"This can be a problem for a small bank" if she guards money for free.
Founded in 1911, Cooperative Bank Gmund has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
The region is home to well-known actors, athletes and entrepreneurs.
The Bavarian Cooperative Association "is currently not aware of any other banks that charge a reimbursement for deposits from private customers," said spokesman Ernst.
At the end of June, Uwe Fröhlich, President of the Federal Association of German Volksbanken and Raiffeisenbanken (BVR), had declared: "The threshold to go in negative with regard to the private customer is very, very high".
The competition is fierce, and there is a threat of investors’ departure from the competition.
Customers in Germany will not be pleased with this on a broad scale.
Destination records: who actually buys records?
Lonely middle-aged men love records.
Before you rush to the comment section, in order to sow it under the pseudonym NotAllLoneMenMediumAge with rough insults, this statement derives from current data.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed resurgence of records is not due to a boom in millennials who want to welcome the news of physical items, but to midlife nostalgia.
Those who recently bought a record are likely between the ages of 45 and 54.
In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group.
It’s also not a horde of hobby collectors – it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers are more likely to keep their feelings to themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).
But are the results of YouGov true?
If this blog were a news report on television, the camera would follow me as I walk in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wear a modest gray suit and stole wildly before I stop, hold my hands and say something decisive like, "Well, let's take a closer look at it."
So, let's take a look at it.
Even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm – hotels, restaurants, and offices are now filling the buildings where once independent sellers were based – there are still a handful of fantastic record specialty stores.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (data number: eight middle-aged men, one woman, presumably about 20), is a day away from a meeting in London and walks through the shops to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector, I ask?
"I guess so," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by email, I didn’t follow him home), dress up the walls of his living room.
The reason he owns such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records he couldn’t afford when they appeared and re-buy items he sold when he was young and bankrupt.
"Many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s that came out when I was 11 or 12, things that I was probably a little too young to buy me," he says.
He agrees that those who buy plates are more introverts and like to spend time alone, adding, "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.
This is my truck.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers he meets apply to the YouGov profile.
However, he has also noticed a new wave of people being influenced by the media hop, people who have heard about the comeback and see themselves buying their old records again.
Of the conversations I had, people usually got rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records again," he says.
That would explain the boom in followers of the record revival of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional significance of records?
It only takes a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like-minded people.
According to Wez, some of the older customers were offended by the contactless payment system.
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record cases, from objects that evoke happy youth memories.
"I think sometimes it can be filling a void or possessing material possessions as a kind of comfort," says Wez.
This is the case with me as a collector and I think it is the case with many people.
It’s an easy way to get spiritually involved.
"We are like their social workers!" whispers one employee from a stack of records.
A survey by the ICM in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who bought a record last month haven’t listened to it yet.
The survey also found that 41% have a turntable they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record don’t have a turntable.
At this point in the news report, I would probably look very worried while browsing through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (data: three middle-aged men), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the revival.
"Someone just came in here recently and said, 'I don't own a turntable, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead record so I can put it on the shelf,'" he says.
This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.
More product-loaded, less music-loaded.
We have people who say, "I don't have a turntable."
These are younger people, not older ones, coming in slowly.
Fopp, which has devoted almost an entire floor to the records, has a more colorful audience than I go in.
There are couples around 70, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Even though the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the stores mentioned above – Wild Beast’s latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz roaring from the speakers – it’s good to see such diversity among customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but gnawing mental trauma is difficult to detect when standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around the store for a few minutes and is looking at the variety of records for sale.
She's more of a shopper than a big shopper.
She doesn’t earn much, so collecting records isn’t a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It’s easy to hear music from a computer or in any other way, but the beauty of records is...” she drifts off with a love-filled sigh.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I seem to be patterning the jeans hotpants, I watch a group of young teenage girls group around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter think about buying a Crosley turntable.
To the left is a staircase, a wall full of records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential records for an average collection.
No one looks at them – perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far up that it is impossible to touch them.
It's pure "plate art".
But considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and send some customers to the depths of Soho for more, there’s nothing to complain about.
It’s no surprise that a population that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends the most on luxury items like plates.
Even though my research revealed that YouGov’s findings are true, at least in record stores in Soho, they ignore the large number of female collectors and record lovers that exist in reality, record stores and online forums.
These people probably work hard at school or in offices.
They certainly don’t spend their Thursday morning strolling through Berwick Street record shops and leafing through records, while avoiding the staring gaze of a scary, 30-year-old fake presenter who stands up over his shoulders unconcerned middle-aged men.
Greenland shark is the longest-lived vertebrate - video report
Scientists say that the Greenland shark has the longest lifespan of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies sharks, says the record was in a female who is believed to be between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long
French court rejects offer to demolish shops in jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais to tear down dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.
In a court hearing this week, Calais authorities argued that the state should be empowered to tear down 72 temporary stores in which people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.
Calais prefecture argued that these places should be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which carries a fire and sanitation risk.
Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important because the free meals offered by the state-backed association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They also stated that the temporary shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of people running the 72 provisional businesses, but admitted that the prefecture of Calais's concerns were "absolutely comprehensible."
Judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than simply feeding people who “live in extremely precarious conditions.”
He said the areas offer quiet meeting places between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the demise was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is run for non-profit purposes and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum matters for the hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to protect the Kids’ Café.
A letter to the Guardian said the closure "would be a disaster for these children, the youngest of whom are eight years old."
The two aid organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge of the Migrant estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp had risen to over 9,000 - the highest number so far - after a steep increase in new arrivals over the summer.
Despite Olympic disappointment, Martin remains combative
Despite his disappointing appearance in the Olympic time trial, cyclist Tony Martin does not want to be beaten.
"I keep my eye on the World Cup, remain confident and fight," the 31-year-old wrote on Facebook on Thursday before leaving Rio de Janeiro.
He has no explanation for his miserable twelfth place on the sugar hat.
"I honestly find it hard to comment on yesterday's time trial," Martin said.
He would have to calmly analyze what causes led to the debacle.
At the World Championships in Qatar in October, Martin wanted to compete for the title.
“I’m going to look at everything we’ve changed lately.”
"This also includes my position," wrote the three-time world time trial champion, who had lost more than three minutes on Wednesday to Olympic champion Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland) on the 54.5 km.
Olympia: Tennis pro Siegemund misses semi-finals
Laura Siegemund’s win ended in the quarter-finals of Rio: The world rankings 32nd from Metzingen missed by a 1:6, 1:6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico/WTA No.
34) the semi-finals of the Olympic tennis tournament clearly.
Siegemund, who was plagued by back problems, was only able to pass her boost once and was powerless compared to the previous rounds.
On Thursday, Angelique Kerber (Kiel/No. 2) had the chance to jump into the final round.
The Australian Open winner met the British Johanna Konta (No. 10).
Tommy Haas was the last German tennis professional to win a silver medal in Sydney in 2000.
Two German DTB starters in the quarter-finals of the Summer Games had last happened in 1992.
Never before has a German duo been in an Olympic singles semi-final.
Group increases in live video game broadcasting start-up
Watching other people play video games is a giant trend – and Microsoft wants to benefit from it too.
The technology group buys the start-up Beam, which specializes in this hobby.
How much money is going to be spent on the acquisition, Microsoft said on Thursday.
Beam did not launch its offering until January and already has more than 100,000 users.
You can watch others play, but also intervene yourself.
For example, they can give up missions to players and confront enemies as well as provide equipment.
Activision Blizzard is launching a new HD video service for the booming world of e-sports.
On the way to the global media event, Facebook is supposed to help.
The advertising industry is already listening.
The start-up’s employees, who are currently based in Seattle, Washington, are moving to Microsoft’s headquarters in Redmond, California, Beam co-founder and CEO Matt Salsamendi said in a statement.
For the customers, nothing should change as a result of the acquisition.
According to Microsoft, Beam will be integrated into the video game department around the Xbox console.
The live streaming market for video game activities is currently growing rapidly.
Popular platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was bought by the online retailer Amazon in 2014 for nearly a billion dollars.
YouTube Gaming is part of Google’s mother Alphabet.
Here's the Enforcement Trailer
Germany’s speedometers have to adapt to the next generation of speedometers: in various federal states, including Hesse and Brandenburg, new flash devices are being tested, which are supposed to transfer tempo sinners particularly effectively.
The futuristic Enforcement Trailers of the company Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used, for example, at accident centers where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, at highway construction sites or bridges to be renovated with temporary speed limits, there is often no infrastructure necessary to ensure that the speed limit is complied with there with a stationary flash.
However, a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or expensive.
The Enforcement Trailer is self-sufficient: its battery lasts for five days with continuous measurement operation, the case data are transmitted encrypted via a modem.
Laser measurement technology also allows all vehicles to be detected simultaneously across multiple tracks.
Variable speed limits as well as transit bans by time, lane and vehicle class can also be monitored.
According to the manufacturer, you can move the trailer with any car with a trailer clutch.
So that it is not easily stolen, it is lowered in measurement mode, so that the wheels in the armored and, incidentally, also bulletproof outer shell disappear.
In addition, a built-in alarm system is designed to protect the flasher from vandalism.
According to Vitronic, the trailer has been tested in various federal states since 2015 and is now in use.
Foreign authorities are also blazing with the new technology: France has recently ordered 100 pieces after an order of 150 pieces last year.
UK wins silver in 7th Rugby after Fiji Masterclass wins gold
Britain’s impressive performance in 7-rugby came in the final on Thursday evening to an abrupt stop at the last hurdle in the form of the Fijis, when they were beaten with a score of 43-7 at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji awarded a master class in handling, side-stepping, backing, line running and raw power to win gold – their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat was sweetened by the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament, beating New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The Boks’ clear defeat, 7-5 in the semi-finals on the same day, could fall back on them in the finals.
But regardless of this, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in the best shape.
It could be a consolation for GB - but it probably won't - that at least one Briton will have a gold medal hanging around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's head coach Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.
GB had a difficult path behind it.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens.
Here they lost only one.
This flap will hurt, but the progress is amazing.
Fiji started wonderfully and let GB’s attacks bounce off for fun.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and Co., it felt like you were running in running buses. The World Series winners went up 5-0 when Osea Kolinisau slammed in the corner.
With four more minutes to play, Jerry Tuwai launched another attack from the right corner, which he converted.
12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.
An outstanding tackle by Mitchell stopped the mountain from man Leone Nakarawa to score a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua hit a touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the reboot and there was still over a minute of playing time ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou pushed through further weak tackles from the GB team and stormed to the line to score a goal.
The conversion brought a 29-0 until the break.
It’s like Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning.
That's the way it is.
GB made fundamental changes to the halftime and closed the Fijian gap...for a full four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half until Joshua Tuisova went through after a brilliant interplay from Fiji.
Dan Norton started a try for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game has long been in favor of South Sea Islanders, whose fans sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.
It was not difficult to admire Fiji’s playful approach.
Mata Viliame set the i-dot with another try in the last seconds.
The whistle sounded, the Fijis hugged themselves and GB kicked devastatingly beaten into the lawn.
Earlier that day, Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi-finals by 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa out of the race in a narrow semi-final match - Britain's transformation of the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the boxes forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a goal among the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late tackle by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-aside team, secured the win – and thus the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired to win by fighting with the coach’s cancer
There will be no more emotional gold than in these games and that means something.
From the first helmstroke to the last, 220 hard hooves that go down in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though it was only the two who sat at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. The echo of coach Robin Williams, was ubiquitous when they rowed for the second consecutive Olympic gold in the Two without a taxwoman, the first women in the history of British sport to set such a benchmark.
Her dominance was absolute, after all, her 39th undefeated stake, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athletes sliding across the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not fully reflect the nature of triumph.
Behind every gold in the row is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental advances that make the difference, and there was no one more helpful than the trainer who 30 months ago did not know if he would survive that day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer.
Like he said, he was risky.
I had bladder cancer that is surgical and they did.
If you don’t, it will spread everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes a little the outlook.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were lucky to be able to start his treatment in early 2014, off-season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if that is the right term in such circumstances at all.
I needed money, so I had to get better soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital running around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps would suffice.
That's how it starts.
Rowing is already a challenge in itself, but that makes it even bigger.
In the immediacy of victory, her first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve-racking morning talking a little more than usual, trying to deal with his own fears.
Stanning, who was a captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment in a mission in Afghanistan, said "I was an emotional wreck this week. That may be a bit extreme, but it means so much."
It just repeats how much that means to me, how much Helen and I and Robin have worked.
It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anyone, so a massive thank you goes to him, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn’t have wished for a better coach or a better coach.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.
The pair had a hard rhythm that their opponents could not keep up with.
Even in the last 500 metres, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to unlock, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very caught at the moment.
Helen called out, "Stay in the process, stay in the process."
It is really important not to be carried away.
We had a good start and at the same time we were not looking to do anything great.
We didn’t want any fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, which we did.
The couple will take a year off before making decisions about their future.
Glover must appear at a wedding next week, her own with TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn’t mean to say that this was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London it took about six months to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new to me and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
It feels so much better," she said.
Exemplary clarity for 31 years
Ruppert Göller, Managing Director of the Wasserzweckverband "Veitensteingruppe", retires.
The association is considered to be "a Bavarian-wide exemplary".
A small Franconian drinking water association as a model for the large water producers.
This was stated some time ago in the original tone in a post by the Bavarian Broadcasting Corporation.
Shortly afterwards, the Water Forum of the Lower Franconian Government commended the purpose association.
The work of the Veitenstein Group was considered "all over Bavaria to be exemplary".
Behind all of this is Rupert Göller, who worked for 31 years in the special purpose association, 28 of them as managing director.
He was retired at the age of 65.
The drinking water association of the Veitenstein Group, based in Kottendorf, Breitbrunn municipality, provides about 150,000 cubic meters of water annually and supplies 32 places and hamlets with about 5,500 inhabitants.
Member municipalities are the municipalities of Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.
There are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities.
The current chairman, Breitbrunns Mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was hired as water manager in 1985 and was already appointed managing director of the purpose association in 1988.
"His duties have been very diverse and they ranged from water pipe construction and maintenance work to office and organizational activities, budgeting, calculating fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends," the chairman said.
As outstanding events, she cited the commissioning and inauguration of the new well (1994), land purchases in the area of the new well (1998) and compensation to farmers, the refurbishment of the high-containers (1999), the new acquisition of a central computer control (2004) and the partial renewal of water pipelines.
There was no standstill and innovations were repeated, because water meant life and drinking water was the most important food.
In her laudation, she praised Göllers faithful, reliable and correct service over 31 years.
He has worked hard for his water association with a lot of heart's blood and he has lived the water association as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was able to present the success concept of the Veitenstein Group for nitrate reduction in front of the water forum of the district of Lower Franconia.
He received a lot of recognition and praise.
Rupert Göller, for his part, praised Waterman Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.
He is the best waterman and he was a loyal guy.
Together we were an unbeatable team.
As highlights from his point of view, he described the well construction and the restructuring of the purpose association.
However, the biggest challenge and the most difficult deployment was the pipe break at the high tank near Kirchlauter on January 3.
Here at minus 17 degrees had to work throughout the night so that the towns could be supplied with water.
The supply of Neubrunn could only be maintained once, because the high container from Pettstadt was filled with hoses.
The management of the drinking water association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who will succeed Rupert Göller.
Soprano Anna Netrebko openly deals with the autism of her son Tiago - and turns to other affected parents: "They must have the courage to talk about it."
"Medicine has made great progress," the 44-year-old told the Italian newspaper "Corriere della Sera".
When the disease was diagnosed with her son, she thought she was going to die.
The now eight-year-old Tiago, however, had made good progress and is now learning privately in New York, where there are the best therapists.
"To give an example, when I ask him something two years ago when I was singing at the Milan Scala, he doesn't remember anything," Netrebko said.
He is the happiest person on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebko's connection with the bass baritone Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relationship state in Bargteheide - man shoots at life partner
A 35-year-old man shot his partner in a multi-family house in Bargteheide (Kreis Stormarn) around 10:45 a.m. on Friday and injured her fatally.
"The man himself called us and stated that he had shot his partner," a police spokeswoman said.
The perpetrator is on the run, he is being searched publicly.
Meanwhile, nationwide, because Sven S. could be traveling by car.
The man is about 1.80 meters tall, muscular, brownish and has a baldness.
Police have released a photo of him.
However, it is a few years old.
Meanwhile, the man wears a baldness.
The man should not be addressed directly.
He could still carry the gun with him, the police said.
Anyone who sees Sven S. should call the 110.
The police are talking about a "relationship state."
The victim was born in 1988, the perpetrator in 1981.
The competent police in Lübeck initially did not want to provide any information about the offence or the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim, but they confirmed that a person had been killed.
"It's a homicide."
"We don't say anything else at the moment," a police spokeswoman in Lübeck said.
According to eyewitnesses, a Special Operations Command (SEK) was at the scene of the crime.
Steel - Light vision for the German steel industry
The crisis-packed and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared from additional costs in the millions.
Financial strains that threatened the industry from green electricity promotion are off the table.
The exemption from the renewable energy surcharge on the existing plants for so-called in-house electricity production in the German steel industry remains, Federal Minister of Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) told the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday edition).
"I'm really happy that we were finally able to achieve this after two years of tough negotiations."
The European Commission had initially planned to ask steel producers who use blast furnace gases to generate electricity for their own consumption to checkout.
According to the German industry association, the steel industry faces additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.
Gabriel told WAZ that there is now a principle agreement with the EU Commission after discussions with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators in the steelworks are replaced will an EEG surcharge of 20 percent be applied.
But this is also not applied in the steel industry.
IG Metall welcomed Germany’s agreement with the EU Commission on autonomous power generation.
The status quo of the current system is largely defined.
Gabriel’s successful efforts for the steel industry are of particular importance.
"With regard to our 'Steel is the Future' campaign, this is a first step."
“More have to follow.”
“Climate and employment targets must also be weighed in the reform of emissions trading,” said IG Metall CEO Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
The steel industry in Europe has been suffering from overcapacity and significant price pressure since the 2008 financial crisis.
Last year, the situation worsened further as the world’s largest producer country, China, threw massive steel onto the world market in the face of weakening domestic demand.
European producers accuse Chinese steel companies of price dumping.
During this spring, the situation has been somewhat relaxed.
On the one hand, import duties imposed on import steel have an effect, and on the other hand, the economic outlook in China has improved.
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.
German industry prime Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.
Lastly, prices would have stagnated again.
The industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Thyssenkrupp did not want to exclude the closure of individual works.
At the end of 2015, around 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry.
In July, German steel producers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.
With 3.4 million tonnes, they produced roughly six percent less raw steel than in the previous year, the steel business association announced on Friday.
After a brief increase in May, the amount produced now declined for the second month in a row.
Since the beginning of the year, production has been 2% below the previous year’s value.
Thanks to an improved order situation, the association expects an increase in emissions in the coming months.
Community, Mind, Health: Singing Does Seniors Good
Singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp her whole life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in the apprenticeship study she took the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.
"Singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.
After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and overall more alive, she says.
By the way, she is doing something good to her health and her mind.
Because singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler from the Deutsche Seniorenliga.
Most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like-minded people, Hackler describes.
By being together regularly, seniors can establish and maintain social contacts.
Because social and family structures often dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
Ursel Kipp also made this experience in her choir: "To speak and organize, to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together".
Singing can be stressful in a positive sense, Hackler says.
The elderly exercise deep and controlled breathing.
Those who regularly demand their lungs, even in everyday life, do not get out of breath so quickly.
Even when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby.
Singing often has a very special effect on the elderly, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Working Group of Seniors’ Organizations.
In the older generations, singing together had a much higher importance, it was part of everyday life, both in school and in leisure, she explains.
Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs evokes many memories in older people, often associated with positive feelings of their adolescence.
Through lyrics and especially melodies, even people with dementia recall long-standing events.
When singing, the head is also required to perform a special performance, Lenz explains.
Simultaneously focusing on your own voice and on a predetermined rhythm while adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.
Especially older people, who live alone, so practice to focus not only on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition that you get by singing in the choir, Hackler says.
An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.
Self-esteem also grows by singing in the choir.
To show myself: When I practice for a long time for something, I get better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens.
There are plenty of good reasons to start singing.
Anyone who wants to try out a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent, advises Lenz.
You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears when a sound goes wrong?
In search of the right offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.
If someone from the circle of acquaintances sings in a senior choir, you can simply join.
Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.
If you want to sing in a church choir, you can contact the church or the church leader directly.
Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.
If you do not have access to the Internet, you can ask your family, friends or neighbors for help with Internet research.
If you want to sing, you should definitely join a choir, Hackler advises.
Singing is good for the soul and has something liberating – that applies to every age.
Cats React More Sensitive Than Cats to Cries of Young Animals
Biologists in Hanover have investigated the effect of calling cat babies on adult animals.
To their surprise, the miauing did not leave the males cold - but they always behaved the same as the females.
Female cats can recognize the level of arousal of cat babies at the miauing of the little ones.
They react ten percent faster to sounds of kittens who think they are in great need, as scientists from the Veterinary College and the Medical College of Hannover (MHH) have found.
Cats also respond to the calls of kittens - but always the same.
"Obviously, the acoustic differences between miauing of less and more excited juveniles are either not perceptible or not significant for the males," said biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.
She is the first author of the study, which was published this Friday in the specialist magazine "BMC Evolutionary Biology".
In a previous investigation, the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the kitten screams differs with the urgency of their need for help.
A total of nine adult cats and eight kittens from the animal husbandry of the MHH were observed.
On the one hand, they were playing out calls from little ones who were taken out of the throwing box for three minutes and separated from mother and siblings.
On the other hand, they were confronted with screams of more excited kittens, which were additionally raised.
The researchers consider their findings meaningful despite the small sample.
"All females, even those who had not yet had their own offspring, responded differentiatedly to the screams," Konerding said.
They turned to the loudspeaker faster when this call of the much more aroused kittens was played.
This ability may be congenital or develop with sexual maturity.
"A surprise was that the males reacted at all," the biologist said.
In the past, scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men to baby sounds on several occasions in humans.
Some studies also showed that women were more sensitive to infants, whether they were already mothers or not, reported biologist Marina Scheumann.
Podolski reaches for Supercup with "Gala"
Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey, an arrest warrant has been issued against former football star Hakan Sükür.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
For the first time since the coup attempt, an important football game is taking place in Turkey.
Before the arch-rivals' duel between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolski's Galatasaray Istanbul for the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: "Business as usual" is in vogue.
Even when the state of emergency was imposed after the attempted overthrow in July, the government insisted that everyday life of ordinary citizens should not be affected.
But this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is blamed for the coup attempt.
There is no stopping before football.
The prosecution issued an arrest warrant against former star kicker Hakan Sükür.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
Sukur is said to be a follower of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is blamed by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the coup attempt.
Although the state of emergency initially imposed for 90 days is still valid until October, in fact it has virtually no effect on the lives of most Turks.
The nightly “democracy watches” in public places across the country, Erdogan said on Wednesday.
The sport, like the whole country, is divided into supporters and opponents of Erdogan.
Particularly fans of the Besiktas workers’ club are not traditionally among the president’s friends.
But what the majority of Turks unite in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military coups.
Even the fans agree - whether their heart beats for Galatasaray or Besiktas.
The winner of the "Gala" Cup will be Lukas Podolski again.
The Kölner proved his athletic value in the past season: with 17 goals and nine assists in all competitions, the 31-year-old finished his first season as the top scorer of his club.
In the final against Fenerbahce he scored the 1-0 victory.
The newspaper "Fanatik" cheered him: "He was the best on the square."
He finished the season excellently and secured the trophy for his team.
Thanks to "Poldi", the disappointing season for the record champion found a conciliatory conclusion.
After the preliminary round K.o in the Champions League, the "Lions" also eliminated early in the Europa League.
In the Süper Lig, it only reached rank six.
The season was not good.
The trophy was the only way to win.
“We did it and that’s the most important thing,” Podolski said.
For Master Besiktas, the game year went better.
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who laid the foundation for the 14th title with 26 season goals as Süper-Lig goalkeeper king.
This is also the reason why fans continue to hope for the return of the 31-year-old.
Gomez, who is under contract with AC Florence and was only loaned to Besiktas after the coup attempt, had announced that he would not return due to the political situation in the country after his EM holiday.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say it," said club boss Fikret Orman.
For this, however, the striker would have to be willing to renounce around a third of his annual salary, estimated at 7.5 million euros, Orman clarified: "We can't pay his salary at Florence".
Despite Doping: These Athletes Still Have Medal Opportunities at Olympics in Rio
The 34-year-old Justin Gatlin has been banned twice for doping (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblower Julia Stepanowa is banned from Rio.
Other convicted athletic offenders can only laugh at it - they're fighting for medals in Rio.
The issue of doping continues to make headlines at the Rio Olympics.
Russian swimmer Julia Yefimowa, who had claimed her right to start shortly before the games after a doping ban, was pissed out and exhausted at her start (100 meters chest) mercilessly.
It offered itself a bizarre scenery: with a put on smile she was still proud in the hall and had provoked with her appearance.
When it was determined that she would not get gold, the audience burst into a cheerful storm.
But there are still many other athletes who, despite the doping past, are starting at the Olympic Games in Rio.
Here is an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100 m relay/USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics.
He was banned twice for doping (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his spell, the 2004 Olympic champion and former world champion has run even faster than before, he is the number one in the world in 9.80 seconds and is regarded as Usain Bolt’s biggest challenger.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100 relay/Jamaica): The two-time Olympic champion and seven-time world champion had to sit a six-month lockdown in 2010 after she was shown to be taking the painkiller oxycodone.
She had severe toothache after surgery, the 29-year-old defended herself.
Sandra Perkovic (discuss/Croatia): In 2011, the Olympian of 2012, World Champion of 2013 and European Champion from 2010 to 2016 was tested positive for the banned stimulant methylhexanamine.
Perkovic denied the intentional intake and was suspended for six months.
The four widest litters this year go to the account of the big gold favorite.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400 m relay/USA): The Beijing Olympic champion and two-time world champion over 400 m, had tested positive in 2010 and was suspended for 21 months.
A means of penis enlargement was responsible, Merritt said.
This year, the 30-year-old over 200 and 400 m is the fastest man so far in the world.
Ivan Tichon (Hammer Throw, Belarus): Hardly any athlete was awarded so many medals afterwards.
For example, Tichon lost his 2005 World Cup title nine years later after he was diagnosed with testosterone doping.
The now 40-year-old also had to surrender Olympic silver in 2004 due to steroid doping and the 2006 European Championship title due to testosterone abuse.
He was awarded the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games, which was also disregarded, as a result of a ruling by the International Sports Court.
At 80.04 m, it ranks second in the world rankings.
Liu Hong (20 km walking, China): The world record holder and gold favourite was tested positive only in May, but is still allowed to start in Rio.
The 29-year-old world champion found evidence of taking a banned dietary supplement, the lockdown of the world anti-doping agency WADA fell mildly and expired as early as July 13.
Bombing terror in Thailand - Austrian woman injured - Several dead
The Austrian embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, Foreign Ministry spokesman Thomas Schnöll said on Friday.
She had suffered cuts and had been treated in the hospital, but was already able to leave this again.
She had planned her trip home for the beginning of September.
Whether Austrian citizens are also affected by the further explosions on the tourist island of Phuket as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon is still unclear for now.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities in this regard, according to Schnöll.
Located about 200 kilometers south of the capital Bangkok, Hua Hin, two bombs first exploded on Thursday night in a nightlife district.
According to police, one Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian woman, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
On Friday morning, two explosive devices went up again, killing another person, according to the authorities.
A bomb explosion was also reported from Phuket in the morning.
According to police, a taxi driver was injured in the detonation near the popular beach of Patong.
In Surat Thani on the southeast coast of the country, another bomb then exploded, killing an urban employee.
The bomb exploded in a flowerbed in front of the coastal police station, according to authorities.
Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the southwest coast and in Chumphon on the southeast coast claimed several injuries.
It is believed to be related to the explosions in Hua Hin, it was said.
"The bombings carry the same handwriting," Army General Danai Kritmethavee told reporters Friday morning.
"We assume that this is a coordinated attack."
It’s too early to comment on possible motives – but it’s probably the actions of Muslim rebels.
The Thai media also wanted to identify a pattern typical of the bombings by Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
The Thai police, on the other hand, stated that the attacks were not related to the Islamist insurrection movement or international terrorism.
"This is only local sabotage that is limited to limited areas and provinces," a spokesperson in Bangkok said.
Rather, it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta.
The authorities had received intelligence clues in recent days about impending attacks in the south of the country, but they were not informed of the exact time and locations.
It is unclear which group is behind the attacks.
The police instructed their officials across the country to strengthen security around key government buildings as well as airports, railway stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and amusement districts.
There are small bombings in Thailand, but they don’t usually target tourists.
In Hua Hin is a palace that was used for years by Thailand's king Bhumibol Adulyadej.
After the bomb explosions, the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends on its homepage to strictly follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities.
High security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and surroundings.
After clashes between security forces and Muslim sections of the population, it is advised against unnecessary trips to these provinces.
Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.
This gives the military a great deal of influence in the coming years.
Junta chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to cause chaos as the country moved towards stability, economic improvement and tourism.
The military unit, which took power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, claims to have restored the kingdom to stability and order.
However, the military has also failed to control the rebellion of Muslim rebels in the far south of the country, which has been swelling for years.
More than 6,500 people have already been killed in the conflict.
Almost a year ago, 20 people were killed in an attack on a popular Hindu shrine in Bangkok, most of them foreign tourists.
It was the bloodiest attack in the country’s recent history.
The right-wing "identitarian movement" has fallen into the sights of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection.
After several state offices, the constitutional defenders in the federal government have also placed the group under observation.
"We see in the Identitarian Movement evidence of aspirations against the free democratic basic order," said Hans-Georg Maaßen, Head of Constitutional Protection of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Thus, immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are defamed in an extremist way.
That is why we are now watching the movement.
The "Identitarian Movement" is a group with French roots, which has also been active in Germany since 2012.
It opposes “multicultural madness,” “uncontrolled mass immigration,” and the “loss of one’s own identity through over-alienation.”
Constitutionalists in nine federal states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hesse, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - are already watching the "identitarians".
Maaßen said his authority had coordinated closely with the state offices in the decision.
"Groups like the Identitary Movement are trying to pick up their target group from where they stand," he said.
In general, extremists try to address them with youth-appropriate language, often with pop music.
Islamists do this as well as right-wing extremists.
This is not a reasonable advertisement for your own cause.
Propaganda should appeal to people emotionally.
Young people are particularly vulnerable.
It's dangerous.
Recently, there had been reports from several federal states about contacts of "identitarians" with AfD politicians.
Maaßen said he had no knowledge of this.
For the protection of the Constitution, possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point onwards.
It depends on whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - changes its direction and becomes extremist through certain people who are extremist.
It is therefore decisive whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party.
This is not recognizable.
In view of the significant increase in legally motivated crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shelters, Maassen said he would not yet speak of new right-wing terrorism in this context.
But we have found in recent years that there can be right-wing terrorist structures.
There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freitaler Group.
It may well be that further right-wing terrorist groups or microgroups are forming that plan attacks against asylum seekers, against refugee homes or attacks from other right-wing extremist motives.
However, a Germany-wide or Europe-wide control of legal terrorism is not recognizable.
The previous groups were created at the regional level or in social networks.
Maaßen expressed concern that many attacks were on the account of people who had not previously appeared in the right scene.
That's the worrying thing.
Many of the suspects in attacks on asylum shelters had not previously been known as criminals, politically motivated criminals or supporters of the right-wing scene.
"So many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists, who were perhaps politically indifferent or, for example, voted for the CDU, SPD or Left, but then radicalized through right-wing extremist sentiments."
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte becomes Internet hit
Not always the Olympics or world records determine the headlines at the Olympics.
This is demonstrated by the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro.
At the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia was swimming so slowly that he was temporarily not seen in the TV pictures.
It simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckline was selected.
In the social networks Habte subsequently became a viral Internet hit.
In fact, the 24-year-old finished his lead with a delay of 48 seconds and finished 59th out of 59 starters.
But it was rather his not exactly sporty figure that attracted the attention of the international media.
Why is the 24-year-old still taking part in the Olympics?
The Ethiopian got a special start right from the international swimming association.
This is distributed to make swimming more popular in under-represented countries.
Since most athletes in Ethiopia run, Habte just wanted to do something different.
Preparation is all: Robel Kiros Habte is getting ready for the big race.
The first nicknames quickly made the round.
Some media referred to him as the "Robel of the Whale".
In response to a "prosperity belly", the English tabloid "The Sun" with "Dad Bod" made fun of him.
His time, he only beat with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 metre freestyle, did not matter.
Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" have also been drawn.
At the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, the run of Eric Moussambani attracted media attention.
The appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea was unforgettable when he had to compete alone in a run over 100 metres freestyle.
At that time, Moussambani was fired.
The 22-year-old at the time only learned to swim eight months before the Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.

Geretsried - The owner of a shop at Neuer Platz has been stolen.
According to the police, the 67-year-old Geretsrieder had left her business on Monday at around 5:30 p.m. and had forgotten to close a window on the ground floor.
When she returned the next morning at about 8.15 p.m., about 250 euros had disappeared from the checkout.
No traces of the perpetrator could be found.
There is also no video surveillance.
Trump does not see the impending election defeat as close
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a campaign event in Florida.
If the election to the US president fails, Donald Trump already has an alternative idea.
He's just going on vacation.
If Donald Trump loses the US presidential election in November, he would be relatively indifferent: “Ultimately, it will either work out, or I’ll have a very, very nice, long vacation,” the Republican candidate said in a telephone interview with the US television station CNBC.
If it doesn’t end up being enough for him for reasons of political correctness, that’s okay,” Trump said.
He described US President Barack Obama and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton as the founders of the Islamic State (IS) terrorist militia.
More and more resistance was forming within his party.
Post enters the trade with electric transporters
An electric delivery vehicle from Deutsche Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the vehicle is apparently high.
The Post also plans to sell its electric vehicle StreetScooter.
Soon, the company will start trading with the van.
The Post will also offer its electric transporters on the free car market from next year.
"We want to go into the sale to third parties," a post spokesperson said on Friday.
The company has been testing for months whether to sell its self-developed StreetScooter, which delivers letters and parcels, to other companies as well.
Post-CEO Jürgen Gerdes had said that there are always demands, for example from craftsmen.
According to information from the news magazine "Der Spiegel", the Bonn Group intends to enter mass production of the vehicles shortly.
The company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year per shift.
Gerdes had announced that the Group intends to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and is planning a complete transition to the environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term.
"We will make a very, very robust step towards 2020," he said at the end of July.
I can imagine we're relocating the entire fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on Germany’s roads since 2014.
GfK leadership resigns after disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GfK is exchanging its boss Matthias Hartmann.
The resignations came suddenly - but not entirely surprising.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK made it clear that the chair of CEO Matthias Hartmann becomes all the more uncertain the longer the successes he promised.
Turbulence at the head of the Nuremberg-based market research company GfK: After once again disappointing business figures and the resignation of the company management, the global number five of the industry is facing a new start in personnel.
The CEO of GfK wants to leave the company by the end of the year.
The Chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board, Arno Mahlert, has already resigned from the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September.
The management of the board of directors already took over on 1 September the former member of the board of directors Gerhard Hausruckinger, the company said.
He is supposed to officially assume the function of a "Board Speaker" until a successor for Hartmann is found.
As a reason for the resignations, the company cited "different views" on the long-term business policy orientation.
A company spokesperson did not want to give details on Friday.
Who will lead the market research company in the future is currently unclear.
Investors said on Friday that shareholders were disappointed with the continued lack of success of the restructuring initiated years ago.
Mr. Hartmann has been at the top of the GfK since 2011.
"But the fruits of the restructuring are not yet visible even after 5 years," it said.
Given the recent poor GfK business figures, each shareholder will become uneasy at some point.
"If that were the case with BMW, the Quandts would do the same," he said.
After setbacks in the previous quarters, the company had not been able to stop its loss in the second quarter of 2016.
At EUR 361.2 million, sales were 6.1 percent below the level of the comparable quarter of the previous year.
With respect to the first half of the year, sales decreased by 3.4 percent at EUR 721.2 million.
Profits in the second quarter were particularly impacted by the company’s declining value in view of its difficult economic situation.
The depreciation of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>139 million that has become necessary in the Consumer Experience business unit resulted in a loss of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>148.2 million for the Group.
In the second quarter of 2015, GfK had a consolidated profit of 19.7 million.
Accidents - Bus slips in Krummhörn in Graben: Eight injured
In an accident in a coach with 43 seniors as passengers, eight people were injured on Thursday in Krummhörn (Aurich district).
Two of the inmates suffered serious injuries, police said.
The 66-year-old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisenach, according to her information, had to dodge an oncoming truck, which partly drove on the opposite lane.
The bus came off the road to the right and slipped into a ditch, as a spokeswoman for the police Aurich/Wittmund reported.
"Due to the location of the bus, the people could not leave the bus independently," she said.
The firefighters freed the inmates.
Six ambulances and an emergency car arrived at the scene of the accident on State Road 2.
The uninjured passengers were taken back to the Krummhörner district of Pewsum by a regular bus.
There they should wait for a replacement bus from the travel company.
Investigators asked the truck driver and potential witnesses to report to the police.
As of 1 October 2016, the fees per cubic meter of wastewater will be 3.44 euros for the Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkahl wastewater treatment plant instead of 2.10 euros for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp; 3.36 euros for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp (previously 2.26 euros) and 3.64 euros for Azendorf (previously 2.18 euros).
At the plant in Azendorf, the sewage fee will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures become necessary.
According to a preliminary calculation, the wastewater price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic meter.
As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, during the approval of the budget by the Landratsamt Kulmbach, it was found that there is undercover for these sewage plants.
The market in Kasendorf is obliged to operate the plants in a cost-covering manner on the basis of legal bases.
As of 1 October 2016, the citizens as well as the commercial and industrial enterprises from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to go deeper into the wallet.
The fee increases range from 48 to 67 percent.
As administrative director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the committee, a recalculation of the fees for the sewage systems of the market community was necessary.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or under-coverages from the previous calculation period should also be compensated.
Schmidt justified the substantial increases in fees on the grounds that all three wastewater plants were relatively small facilities with a very low wastewater loss of between 6,800 and 12,000 cubic meters per year.
For example, due to the low base of distribution, costs for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.
In addition, the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly declining.
Furthermore, in the previous calculation period, for all three plants, renovation and repair expenses were incurred to a significant extent, not least due to their age.
The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the plants for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp are almost 20 years old.
Schmidt pointed out that in the Azendorf wastewater plant the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage.
At the Welschenkahl pumping plant, the almost 20-year-old conveying plants had to be overhauled from scratch, and at the Lopp pond sewage treatment plant, the first sewage pond had to be dredged after almost 20 years of operation, the sewage sludge was disposed of and an additional ventilation facility installed in order to be able to comply with the water regulations in the future.
Schmidt: "To these extraordinary expenses were added the continuing care and maintenance costs, which are to be taken into account accordingly in the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity costs, which in the previous calculation in 2011/2012 were still significantly below the current level.
Steinhäuser made it clear that in the case of the low sewage in the three plants, the costs for operation and maintenance are "full".
Schmidt added that the market community had been spared large maintenance costs for the wastewater plants over the past 20 years.
According to Steinhäuser, the situation for the above-mentioned plants will remain precarious in the long term, especially since the supply area of the Friesenbachtal wastewater treatment association cannot be extended to include these plants because they are deficient facilities.
Bulgaria reports inflation for the first time in eight months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% on a monthly basis in July.
This is the highest value (since June 2012) and the first above zero since October last year, when positive 0.2% were recorded.
The annual average inflation for the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8% measured by the CPI.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
In July 2016, there was an increase in the prices of the following consumer goods groups compared to the previous month: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell for clothing and footwear (2.2%); furniture, household appliances and routine maintenance (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained unchanged for alcoholic beverages and tobacco; housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communications; and education.
Snapchat 'Anime' Effect Criticized as Asian Cartoon
Snapchat says this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races.
With its filtering tool, Snapchat enables around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in a way that borders on absurdity.
You can turn into a pineapple, a dog, or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The filters are straightforward, feature-turning tools that produce more than 30 million enhanced selfies per day.
All mistakes come to the public.
Snapchat filters have attracted criticism in the past, accusing them of the app promoting Blackface or promoting white skin as a beauty ideal.
When it suggested to some users this week a filter that gave them slit eyes, false teeth, and pounded cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians – “yellow face.”
They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a bigger problem that the company has with diversity.
The news and outrage became widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced it had disabled the feature.
The company offered an excuse: the filter was intended as a tribute to anime characters and not as a caricature of Asians.
But outsiders who have experienced racism, the filter reminded them of hurtful clichés.
Others strongly rejected the anime comparison.
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet was widely circulated about the photos, wrote that the filter was “injurious and, to say the least, uncomfortable.”
She added that "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgusting Asian caricature and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow face, but that the yellow face has been pulled into the depreciative extreme.
Snapchat isn’t the only company that’s crossing these cultural stumbling blocks.
American culture seems to be engaged in an endless struggle for diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in our hands.
And Snapchat’s large audience of young people—who are more diverse in race than their older counterparts—could be more likely to expect sensitivity.
When one of Snapchat’s filters creates an image that is offensive to a user, “it’s much harder for such things to go unnoticed than it used to be,” 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account, prompting others to do the same.
In an essay for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believes race-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in Snapchat hiring practices.
Zhu criticized the largely white, only male leadership and ended their essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"Either they don't have a diverse representation of people with different skin colors in their workforce so they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with different skin colors who work there but aren't in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say something about it."
Others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has largely left unanswered.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and indicates its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the cultural background of its employees, but according to a spokesperson, the company recently hired a HR manager who focuses on underrepresented populations and on internal integration efforts.
Zhu, for her part, said she will leave her Snapchat account closed, adding, “I wonder if they need more users like us to be able to say that this is not OK.”
Military Leadership Falsifies ISIS Intelligence, Congressional Committee Notes
U.S. Central Command military personnel changed intelligence to paint a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the actual conditions on the ground would have allowed, a Congressional committee of inquiry reported in a report on Thursday.
The preliminary report, prepared by a task force of Republican members of the Armed Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Armed Budget Committee, reports great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.
The Central Command (Cencom) is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Intelligence information typically nodded off by high-ranking Centcom commanders regularly drew a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism than the actual conditions on the ground would have allowed and were consistently more positive than analyses from other intelligence services," a newspaper article quoted the report as saying.
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when poor analysis is presented to our political leaders," said Ken Calvert, a Republican member of the House of Representatives.
The leadership mistakes in Centcom extend to the top of the organization.
The ten-page report shows in detail persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in training the Iraqi armed forces.
While it does not provide any direct indication that government leaders under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts were exposed to the pressure of their subordinates to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat posed by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements, and statements before Congress were significantly more positive than they correspond to the facts," the report noted.
For example, a Centcom family member publicly announced that a military recapture of Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq’s second-largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, so much is clear," Mike Pompeo, a Kansas Republican congressman, said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the heads of the Central Command changed intelligence reports to minimize the danger posed by ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans launched the Task Force after they were told that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.
The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings as the investigation continues.
In addition, further investigations into the Centcom reports by the Ministry of Defence’s Inspector General are underway.
Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which were consistent with some of the Republican Task Force conclusions.
"In 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly restricted process for making intelligence assessments of ISIL and Iraqi security services," the committee's senior Democrat, a member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, said in a statement.
This process, Mr. Schiff said, “delayed the publication of intelligence reports,” damaging morals among analysts, and “leaving excessively little room for dissenting opinions.”
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they had found no evidence of a White House intervention by Centcom analysts regarding a “definite political opinion.”
The preliminary results of the Congressional investigation were published on Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, the New York Times reported on investigations by the Pentagon’s Inspector General that were taken up after complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, a Pentagon press spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on Congressional reports while the Inspector General’s investigation is still underway.
But he also stated that "experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Department of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defense."
The investigation has repercussions beyond the question of a successful US-led air campaign in Iraq and Syria (an allegation now made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).
However, last year’s accusations have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
The criticism of the Islamic State is reminiscent of disagreements more than a decade ago when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a paper on how the then government under George W. Bush, contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, provided only a small occupation force in Iraq and spent little time worrying about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current coverage of the Islamic State.
Last year, the team led by Mr. Hooker, according to government agencies, found that contrary to government statements, air strikes against the Islamic State-held refineries would have no significant impact on the terrorist group’s financial situation, as they would have put provisional refineries into operation to sell oil on the black market.
However, this finding was not published, the Times reported in September.
Centcom's then commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
USA wins fourth match in women's field hockey, a showdown with Great Britain is imminent
One day after scoring three goals during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also scored the first two goals for the women’s American field hockey team in a match on Thursday against India that the American women won 3-0.
Five goals in two games should actually be a memorable feat, but Bam (27) said she can’t remember ever having done that.
“I have no idea,” she said.
I'm not one of those people who keep their gates in mind.
However, she knows this: The Americans are 4-0 in the Olympics and are equal in their group with the British in first place, who remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan.
The United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which of the two within their group of six teams will get first and second place each.
The first-placed will stay out of the way of the strong Dutchwomen, who lead the other group.
Whatever the game may end on Saturday, the American women have sparked a surprising whirl through their success story, four years after finishing in the last of 12 places at the last London Games.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and for the first time at the age of three had a hockey racket in her hands (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), at the age of 16 she became the U.S. national player, the youngest in the team's history.
She missed the 2008 Olympics because she could not qualify for the squad.
Then came the year 2012, when everything went wrong for her and her team.
The following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, became the coach of the national team and with that things began to turn for the better.
“A culture change, a mental change, and a physical change,” Bam said.
We didn't have the workload in London that we have now.
We were able to pull the helm completely.
On Thursday evening, Bam opened the Torreigen in the first half of the game with a backhand strike from close range.
India had gone into the game without a win in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.
She made a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then pulled into the middle and sprinted the ball into the goal to give the American women a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez scored the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.
The shutout was the first of the entire tournament for U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who had previously scored one goal in each of the previous games.
She has a run.
Just like Bam.
"We are in a good position," Parnham said, but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday.
In the midst of the rage of the Olympic Games, the zen of the trampoline
Wherever you are, no matter how late it is, it’s the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel steady and inescapable, a fierce relay race between competition and pursuit.
It’s as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning staff that is passed from the crossbow shooter to the swimmer to the gymnast to the triathlete.
You can’t turn on the TV, read a newspaper, or listen to your neighbor in the queue at the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is at the Olympics for the first time and a women's swarm of dimples, could well have been among those well-known names sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and well-being TV advertising, if he were a swimmer, gymnast, or even fencer.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in the Olympic trampoline tournament.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event equally.
Further from the center, partly in the shade, are the sports that are not generally recognized: air gun shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We will always have breast swimming and may it rule for a long time.
But if I am modestly allowed to make arguments for my particular favorite, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it made its debut in Sydney, it has been so scarcely perceived over the last 16 years that many of those I had interviewed did not know it was an Olympic sport at all.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the U.S. sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in trampoline jumping and until 2012 it had an athlete who made it to the finals.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians the prices for the women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
Trampoline jumping has a certain outsider charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for an unenlightened ear for a clown school than that for the Olympics.
At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but just an earth-bound enthusiast.
It has humorous potential - the cardboard-like tremor of its never-ending impact - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports it essentially combines.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as "jumpboard."
Emerging winners jump on a giant trampoline, shoot up to 30 feet in the air and have to do a series of falling movements (rotating, pike and salto) before landing on their feet.
They are rated according to the official Olympic program by execution, difficulty and "flight time".
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight.
Medal hopers have to go further, faster, up and above, sometimes to the finish line, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playground.
They are not only chasing the finish line or the exit wall, but also another ridiculous goal in television broadcasting: that of the world or the Olympic record.
The purposeful pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatic — and it is enough to stir even a spectator to tears.
But it’s also what I find a bit tiring when watching these games.
Of these, the trampoline offers a breathing break.
The vector of the trampoline jumper is above.
A move forward is not the goal.
He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.
Here, too, there is competition, of course, not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the target, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.
It is as Zen as the competition at the Olympics can only be.
The women’s qualifying and finals will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men’s on Saturday, also at 13.00.
NBC will broadcast the finals as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00.
In the midst of the Olympic mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in general turmoil.
If the raising of awareness can only be achieved through the acknowledgment and objectification of male athletes – as the male US gymnasts recently suggested, according to The Wall Street Journal – then Mr. Dooley is expecting his new fan base, struggling for air.
"One generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the US
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters calling for political change in Ethiopia encountered violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses testify that tens of protesters were killed during the clashes with the police in gunfire.
Is Ethiopia about to collapse?
Over the past decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months, protests against the government have shaken the country and expanded into more and more areas.
Last week, thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political change.
The government’s response was relentless, according to human rights organizations.
Witnesses reported that police shot and killed tens of unarmed protesters.
Videos circulating about the protests, presumably from last or early this year, show security officials beating young people with sticks while forcing them to stand a hand against a wall.
The head of the UN Human Rights Agency is now demanding an in-depth investigation.
"It has always been difficult to hold this country together and it will become even more difficult in the future," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is appreciated by the West.
U.S. military and intelligence agencies are working closely with Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats beyond the region, especially in Somalia. Few countries in Africa, if any, receive so much Western aid.
Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.
Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy – human rights organizations have consistently led the repression by the government – the opposition in the country has been curtailed, effectively silencing dissidents.
Many were sent into exile or prison, killed or driven into the wilderness.
But that could change.
"If you oppress people and they have no other options but to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia.
The whole youth protested.
A generation is protesting.
There are numerous complaints covering everything from land use to stranglehold in terms of power of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies won the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of parliament.
At the same time, tensions are rising along the border with Eritrea; a fight for this jagged, controversial line claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, who have been more or less defeated in recent years, could exploit the turbulence and rearm themselves.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness now explode after years of boiling beneath the surface.
The first seems harmless: smartphones.
It was only in recent years that many Ethiopians were able to communicate via social media, as cheaper smartphones became more common and internet services improved.
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, which it does at regular intervals, especially during protests, many people can still communicate through Internet proxies that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said that they were gathering in protest.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
For eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia’s predominantly Christian highlands, prospered in politics and economics while exploiting the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in flatlands.
But that is also changing.
"We are coordinating under one umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The biggest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, which make up around 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia’s prime minister for 17 years until his death from an unpublished illness in 2012.
He was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.
Analysts say he was particularly versed in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special envoys to work with opponents and make them harmless.
"The current regime lacks this basic skill," said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia’s new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively opaque reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.
Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he does not enjoy the trust of the Tigray-controlled security services.
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such a riot was in 2005, after thousands protested elections that analysts reported were apparently tampered with and subsequently stolen by the government.
During the subsequent raids, many protesters were killed, although fewer than in recent months, and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia’s leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty alleviation.
But obviously this has not prevented the Ethiopian government from intensifying internal resentment.
And it takes on a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters attacked shops run by Tigray in Gondar, an Amharic city, and the hatred of the Tigray is becoming more and more common on social media.
Analysts say the protests put the U.S. and other Western allies in a strange position.
The U.S. government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, although it recently announced that it had closed this base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile area.
"This," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin ridgewalk."
Donald Trump Explains His Claim That Obama Founded ISIS Was "Sarcasm"
On Friday, Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign by stating that his repeated claim that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the “founders” of the Islamic State terrorist group was not serious.
This clarification raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate’s communication skills, whether he was able to communicate clearly and comprehensibly with the American public.
It also puts his fellow fighters, who endeavor to protect him during an eventful phase, in the peculiar position of having to make statements that he could not have meant at all.
After making the suggestion at a campaign event on Wednesday night, Mr. Trump rowed back with regard to the claim on Thursday, insisting in interviews that he really did not intend to imply that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.
The tweet was the opposite of the previous day, when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews that he took the accusation completely seriously.
When conservative radio presenter Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump soften the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate didn’t want to know about it.
The last storm of criticism is bouncing down on Mr. Trump as he has tried to shift the focus of his campaign to the economic situation due to falling poll numbers.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton gave talks on the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this issue.
Reporting via Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton’s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he had found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already argued sarcasm in his defense.
At the end of July, he drew strong criticism when he said the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton’s emails, but he later declared “Of course I meant that sarcastic.”
This method allows Mr. Trump to shift the linguistic boundaries in politics and then row back as needed.
“I think it’s one of his methods of testing how certain messages are received by his fans, how they arrive, and then, if necessary, ‘clearing up’ depending on how the reaction turns out,” said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who watches the language of both candidates.
But I also think he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has adopted an even more corrosive tone as his poll scores have declined further.
A new survey by NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, released on Friday, showed a leadership with a big lead in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado, and a head-to-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries not to apologize for his provocative remarks, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humor.
But while he is increasingly in the focus of attention in the last few months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump’s jokes have put his loyal peers in the uncomfortable situation of having to stand by him, no matter how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump’s most prominent advocates, made great effort to defend the candidate today in a Thursday CNN interview.
“I think what he’s saying are legitimate political comments,” Mr. Giuliani said, so he was asked about the accuracy of Mr. Trump’s statements as to whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
It is true in this sense that before Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them backbenchers, completely wrong and that’s why it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the administration under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to spread by failing to aggressively control the situation in the Middle East.
Before Friday’s campaign events in Pennsylvania, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media, accusing them of riding around on each of his words and being biased against him.
He taunted the "poor, miserable" television experts who are trying to understand him and said, "You can't do it!".
Some of the Democrats mocked Mr. Trump’s apology as just another proof that he was unfit for the presidency.
Once displaced by the price of the market, Café returns to Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shabby cafe in Williamsburg where you could only pay cash, which had no Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, prices were displaced from his Bedford Avenue storefront.
The store Soap Cherie, which replaced the verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
Locals mourned it as the last loss in a gentrificing city.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is changing, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, except the Chelsea Hotel and Verb is now a soap business."
But if New York is change, then it is reinvention.
A revived Verb Cafe opened in Greenpoint last November, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old cafe, who is the owner and managing director of the new cafe.
He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When a customer offered him to provide funds for a new branch office, he was excited to do so, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot.
Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment too.
He introduced new ingredients.
On the menu are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnishes such as capers and sautéed onions.
There are natural rice bowls.
The café no longer serves beer, but there are fresh juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez said he noticed a steady stream of old regulars.
"Many old customers were also displaced by prices from Williamsburg," he said.
Recently on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one such customer.
Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and regularly visited the verb.
Even after moving to Greenpoint, she would take the road.
After the verb closed, she gave up drinking coffee for a while, she said.
"I realized that it was the coffee and culture in the verb that I liked," she said.
Now she’s drinking coffee again, even though that day she ordered a Blended Chai Tea instead of her usual Iced Coffee, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal has been another long-standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003.
He went there before work and inevitably always ordered the same thing.
"I came quarter to seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and they're preparing my everything bag with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu.
Nowadays, Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he alternates his everything bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said he had no grudge about the soap business taking over the old business space.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for verb with the cold-brewed coffee of the café as an ingredient.
"I think we're going to respond to her offer," Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoints have also accepted the café.
A new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said he intends to exhibit it soon so that his new neighbors feel welcome.
The location also has other advantages.
A local juice shop wants to fill the cold brewed coffee in the bottle and sell it.
There is a chance that the café will expand to a neighboring building.
For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a regular customer and said he was devastated when the café closed.
When the new café opened, Whitt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee felt like a homecoming.
"I had to smell it," he said.
The Depressing Eating of the Economic Crisis in “A Plenty of Meal”
In March 1933, shortly after his rise to the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt had a fondness for refined delicacies on Fifth Avenue such as Pâte de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup.
His menu on that day was a bit more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and a plum pudding as dessert.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to Americans about how to eat."
The couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coe’s last book, Chop Suey, was about Chinese cuisine in the United States, while Ziegelman, in her book, 97 Orchard, talks about living in a residential house on the Lower East Side from a food perspective.
Her latest collaboration, “A Decent Meal,” which will be published by Harper Publishing on Tuesday, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at Eisenberg’s Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, snug snack in the Flatiron District that has been in business since the stock market crash of 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive chunks, while Coe, 57, ate turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered roasts, the couple found this appropriate for a discussion about eating in the era of the Great Depression.
"Rich foods were very popular," said Ziegelman.
There was peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread.
They were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner.
Coe grinned.
"It must have settled in the stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table in an American household, especially in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Teams of women cooked for male field workers and freshly baked pastes were served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War. "A Square Meal" records the ways in which the country dealt with being no longer the land of slavery.
"It was a time when food became a central, tense topic for Americans," Coe concluded, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The new budget diet was just as tense: mysterious foods such as breads and casseroles became staple foods, the casserole as a "wonderful way to recycle leftover food," noted Ziegelman, as chefs were able to hide unappealing ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which has been at the heart of American cuisine for years, has become a rarely served luxury.
Strange mixtures were tried because a high-calorie and nutritious satisfaction took precedence over taste or even common sense.
During her research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from this era, baked onions with peanut butter.
“It wasn’t a popular addition to lunch,” Coe says.
Ziegelmann continues: "It was surreal."
Peanut butter and baked onions do not fit together.
It was typical for many of the household recipes.
As never before or since, household economists – including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 – drove the country’s eating habits in this way.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become “household politicians” and to meet the challenge of turning poppy like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.
"A Square Meal" is a celebration of historical treats.
Particularly tasty are the reports of the government’s response to the hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover’s Let Me Go Cake-Eat attitude.
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farmhouse kitchen of his kitchen, he ate like the million-dollar man of the world he became.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.
He ate in an almost gold-plated dining room and wore a tuxedo.
He was wonderfully alien to reality.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not asked him to set an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, hiring a housekeeper with no interest in flavors by Ms. Roosevelt led to the White House producing the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most desolately prepared.
Many of the ways of dealing with food from the Great Depression were discarded as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food, Ziegelman said, as well as on how science has been applied to food.
The couple claimed to have better understood the eating habits of Ziegelman’s mother-in-law when writing the book – for example, how she couldn’t throw away food.
"She had a real fear of wasting food," Coe said.
Ziegelman remembered, "She actually made people sick."
There was the windbag incident.
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg's, they and Coe drew out a dessert they had prepared at home: the plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called Prune Whip," said Ziegelman, adding that it was a common trick to miss a chic name on modest recipes.
There was no beaten cream, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everybody reluctantly dipped a spoon into the tough, brown glibber.
Surprisingly, it didn’t taste bad.
Coe got a rep three times.
Like a can-do budgetier, he told his wife, “A few chopped walnuts would help.”
Killed in bomb attack: He was the hero of Aleppo
He risked his own life to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria.
He risked everything to save the lives of others.
Now the 30-year-old himself has died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the "White Helmets", a civil protection group that, according to Bild-Zeitung, saved almost 60,000 lives so far.
2,900 volunteers risk their own lives to pull people out of bombed homes and provide first aid in the war zone.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: A video of the civilian defender showing him in an 11-hour rescue of a baby from the rubble of a house went around the world in 2014.
It made the Syrian a shining symbolic figure in the horror of the war.
As a hero, however, he never saw himself, saying according to picture: "To me, this is the real jihad."
"When I die saving lives, I think that God sees in me a martyr."
Shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack, he had spoken in a video about the last bombings in Syria.
The helicopters dropped four barrel bombs over the Alzadia district, one filled with chlorine gas.
One woman and two children died, seven people suffered from shortness of breath.
"We are now removing the toxic remains of the bomb so that children don't play with it," the image quotes his last words before he died.
The Assad regime's deadly bomb was supposed to hit terrorists.
Greenland shark: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old
Rare sight.
Greenland sharks usually only come to the surface in winter.
This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship Sanna.
He was born in 1624 and swims at a good 1 km/h through the North Atlantic - to this day.
Greenland sharks only get offspring at 150 years old.
The Greenland shark floats calmly along the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean, reaching an average distance of just 1,220 meters in an hour.
Only when it matters, the five-metre-long animal accelerates to a whopping 2.6 km/h - and is half as fast as a seal at this top speed.
However, this slow-moving lifestyle seems to be a patent recipe for old age.
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" at least about a Greenland shark that could be 392 years old.
"Insanity," commented Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, this lifespan represents a world record for vertebrates.
Although the evolutionary biologist has long suspected that Greenland sharks are becoming stone old.
Only the evidence was lacking.
Greenland sharks are difficult to observe, after all, they live mainly in the ice-sea off the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and the Spitzbergs.
Because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius, they usually only appear on the surface in winter.
Accordingly, researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland sharks.
They measured their slow-motion pace when they equipped six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitsbergen.
These sharks are preying anyway: In one animal’s stomach, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.
They may hunt dormant animals or patrol the bottom of the ice-sea and look for carcasses tumbling down from higher layers of water.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now investigated 28 Greenland sharks that fishermen caught off Greenland or Spitsbergen between 2010 and 2013 as a by-catch from the depths of the North Atlantic.
The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest measured 502 centimeters.
To determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens core of the sharks using the carbon-14 method.
This center of the eye lens occurs even before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein are no longer renewed later.
The two smallest sharks had a striking amount of carbon-14 in the lens core.
Their birth should therefore be after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons trials threw larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
In contrast, in the third smallest animal with 220 centimeters of length, the lens core contained a small excess of carbon 14 from the nuclear weapons trials, so it was likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in its investigation in 2012.
All the larger Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal amounts of carbon 14 in their lens core, which is produced by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon 14 watch for a 493-centimeter-long Greenland shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record-breaking 502-centimeter-old shark is likely to be even 392 years old.
It was known that Greenland shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters.
Now the researchers could assign an age to the length.
Since one of the animals at 392 centimeters was probably on the threshold of sexual maturity and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland sharks can obviously reproduce for at least one and a half centuries.
This is also likely to be a world record for vertebrates at the moment.
The fact that such Methusalems live in icy waters is no coincidence.
The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale, whose bacon had a 120-year-old harpoon tip at his neck, was also caught off Alaska.
Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often also runs on fire.
So they mature later - and age more slowly.
In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often particularly large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses heat.
The heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much greater than that of a gram of elephant.
Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.
"A smaller animal therefore lives more dangerously and should focus on having as many offspring as early as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.
A very large animal, on the other hand, should rather invest its resources in a long life.
Building land in a double pack
In the last meeting, the municipal council focused on topics related to construction.
With ease, the board accepted Mayor Robert Putz's announcement that "finally the marketing of the recently designated residential areas can begin".
After the land, parceling and development issues were clarified and the applications for surveying were made, nothing stands in the way of the sale of the land in the residential areas "Straßlweg" and "Schönau-West" (area Binderstraße - expansion section 1) to interested parties.
The municipal council is convinced that the construction sites in the rural and quiet residential community of Schönau appeal to young families and restful seniors alike.
As it was stated, building willings can now report to the town hall, about the allocation of the parcels the municipal council is expected to discuss in its September session.
In order to be able to respond to requests for the establishment of further commercial enterprises, combined with the creation of jobs, the municipal council decided to amend the new land use plan in sub-areas only in the spring of this year.
For example, in the area of Unterzeitlarn, the already designated commercial area is expanded by two parcels in the direction of Staatsstraße 2112.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
The city of Main has the best chances of attracting jobs and companies relocated from London in competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg.
“It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit the most from the Brexit vote,” says Michael Voigtländer, head of IW’s Financial and Real Estate Markets competence area.
Following the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether money houses can continue to operate financial transactions from London throughout the EU.
For the so-called EU passport, they have so far had enough admission in the UK.
That’s what big US banks are doing.
Several banks have already announced that they will relocate jobs.
The lobby association "Frankfurt Main Finance" expects 10,000 new jobs on the Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, according to IW, the seat of the European Central Bank (ECB), which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the eurozone, as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Supervisory Authority (EIOPA) and the ESRB Risk Board, speaks.
The OECD is headquartered in Paris, but it is less important to the financial sector than the ECB.
"The proximity to the central bank is important for banks, as they can communicate directly with the supervisory authorities," says IW Professor Voigtländer.
Luxembourg is home to a large fund sector, but, like Dublin, has a worse infrastructure performance.
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport.
Furthermore, the city scores with easily available commercial properties.
“It’s not easy to find free high-quality offices in Paris,” says Voigtländer.
On the Seine, rents for first-class commercial properties are also 50 percent higher than on the Main.
In addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than its competitors thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime.
In a ranking by Mercer, the city ranks seventh, Luxembourg 19th, Dublin 33rd and Paris 37th.
Even if quality of life is a matter of preferences: “With its already strong position as a financial location for the European single market, Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors,” the IW concludes.
However, despite the Brexit vote, London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe, economic researchers say.
The balance of forces also speaks for this: according to figures from Landesbank Helaba, around 144,000 people worked in the banking sector in London at the end of 2015, and 62,500 in Frankfurt.
Gilead Receives Legal Costs from Hepatitis C Patent Dispute with Merck
A U.S. Judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbursement of legal costs arising from the Hepatitis C litigation with pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was exempted from $200 million in damages for the violation of two Merck patents related to Gilead’s blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni after a U.S. judge uncovered a pattern of misconduct on the part of Merck, including perjury and other unethical acts.
In filing the lawsuit on Thursday, U.S. Judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead is entitled to remission of costs incurred during the defense of the case.
Merck tries to equate Gilead, which dominates the market for a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed property on laboratories based on sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead’s drugs.
US-backed troops say they have regained full control of Manbij from Islamic State
US-backed troops have regained full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last ISIS fighters in the city left it, a group spokesman said on Friday.
The Democratic Forces of Syria (DKS) are combing through the city after the exodus of the remaining group of fighters buried inside the city.
They have freed over 2,000 civilians held hostage by the fighters, Sharfan Darwish of the DKS-allied Manbij Military Council told Reuters.
"The city is now under complete control, but we are currently conducting clean-up work," he told Reuters.
Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return on Friday, which revealed an income of $10.75 million for the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband, and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charity, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton generated nearly $5.3 million in redemption fees; the former Secretary of State provided a $3 million income from Simon & Schuster publisher for her book on her tenure in the State Department.
Clinton’s candidate for the vice presidency, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, along with his wife Anne Holton, published his tax returns for the past ten years.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency," Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri announced in a statement.
In stark contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and withdrawals regarding his previous promises to publish his tax returns.
It is common for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, although they are not required by law to do so.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have cited a tax review by the tax authorities as the reason for his refusal.
"They're on the move," Clinton's campaign assistant Ian Sams wrote on Twitter, referring to the release of the Democratic presidential candidate.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump’s special adviser, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish anything until the tax audits are completed.
Trump’s critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, have already revealed that his refusal raises questions about wealth, his donations to charities, his business practices, and various other connections, particularly with Russia.
Clinton has already plunged into the issue and posted a video on the Internet on Friday in which top-ranking Republican urge Trump to publish his tax return.
On Thursday, she also addressed the issue during a talk on economics in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax returns," she said.
Politico has reported that Trump paid no or very little taxes for two years during the 1990s, and a New York Times economics journalist quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax consultants on Friday stating that this could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign.
Clinton supports a scheme named after billionaire and investor Warren Buffett that would ensure that people earning more than $1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During a campaign event for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate is based here, called on Trump to meet to exchange their tax returns.
Buffett said he had also been subjected to a tax audit by the IRS and Trump had “fears” of the voters and not of the tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign has published tax returns dating back to 2007.
The Clintons now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average effective federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
The Clintons’ 2015 tax return showed that they only received $100 of their income as wages, unlike most of all Americans.
Their main investment was a cost-effective index fund, from which the Clintons taxed dividends and income of USD 109,000.

Condoms with chili powder, fireworks promote Tanzania’s elephant protection
Conservationists in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to keep elephants from going into human-inhabited settlements - they throw condoms on them filled with chili powder.
The method has proven to be effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had the idea years ago, along with the U.S. Conservation Agency, has intensified its promotion by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a nonviolent four-stage method to protect their homes and crops without harming animals.
Previously, many have used spears to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, dedicated to animal welfare.
"Since we developed the ... toolkit, we have seen a change in attitude within these communities, with them being much more confident that they can keep the elephants off their fields without harming the elephant," Honeyguide's CEO Damian Bell said in a statement.
The first two steps include lighting the elephant with a torch and blowing into a horn.
If it is not deterred, a so-called "chilli cloud" is thrown.
Chili powder mixed with earth is packed together with a fireworks item into a condom, the end of which is turned to the ignition cord.
When it is lit, the condom bursts with a bang and sprays fine dust on chili powder into the air.
Usually, it’s a good idea to get rid of the elephant.
A final possibility is a thrower who shoots a gold rainfire in the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
City Council unanimously decides: No new kiosk building on the banks of the St. Goar Rhine
Normally, the St. Goar investment projects are accepted by businessmen with kisses - after all, retailers in the core city are considered to be clearly expandable.
However, the city council now unanimously rejected the application for the construction of a new sales kiosk on the banks of the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine balcony under construction.
"Basically, we welcome new traders, but at this location in an exposed location on the banks of the Rhine, this kiosk does not fit," explained Michael Hubrath for the CDU faction.
Jewish director destroys Berlin hotel because Israeli code has been removed after "Arab" request - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media uproar after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list an Israeli dialect because it “requested” Arab guests, according to an employee.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah", left his anger out at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel’s country code list.
However, the country was not listed between the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and erased?
Lanzman wrote.
Instead, the Kempinksi Bristol offers a way to dial Israel through its own call center.
Looking for an explanation, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The response he received there “shocked him,” as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employee said the measure was an "intentional decision by the management of Kempinski Hotels."
The reason behind it caused even more anger in the director.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the code be deleted," the employee was quoted by Lanzmann.
The Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a “great disgrace,” reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
We were horrified and shocked by this event.
That's really very shameful.
The fact that this has happened in Germany in precisely this hotel chain is an even greater shame.
This does not require any explanation.
We expect the hotel to "draw the right conclusions," the official said.
The incident sparked quite a resonance on the internet, where people called the whole thing a scandal.
Some suggested that the Kempinski Hotel had "given in" to the alleged requests of Arab guests.
"Shame on you," another post said, pointing out that the hotel, which is located on the noble Kurfürstendamm, is near a synagogue.
The hotel quickly dismissed all accusations and called the incident an "accident" and "apologized" to Lanzmann, reports Der Spiegel.
“There was never a direct instruction not to include Israel in the quick-vote list,” the Süddeutsche Zeitung quoted a Kempinski Hotel spokesman as saying.
It adds that the country code has now been added.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to protest against government reforms for the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
Difficulties began when police officers tried to disperse the students, which led to the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their dismay at the plans.
According to the proposals of the governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, a little less than 100 public schools will be closed, while 300,000 students will be converted to save money.
Some of the protesters were seen spraying graffiti on walls against interim president Michel Temer.
The latest protests occurred a few days after protesters took to the streets in mass support of suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who had been removed from office by a vote by the Senate on her resignation.
Trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71% - RT Business
With the lifting of the sanctions, according to Russian Ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, trade between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9 percent year-on-year.
Since the lifting of international sanctions against Iran, interest on the part of Russian companies in business in the country has increased sharply, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are establishing existing links with Iran, while new companies are ready to gain access to the market.
Of course, further trade expansion is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," said Dzhagaryan.
He noted that trade sales between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
In particular, Russian imports to Iran rose by 91.5 percent, reaching $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The trade boom was achieved through deliveries of machines, land vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan expects a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian mission issued around 35,000 visas, primarily travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
Furthermore, Iran reached the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia.
One could say that last year's record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia are being broken," he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, something the ambassador hopes it will change.
"I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
Witness wanted: Beverage market in Waldbröl attacked
A robbery has been committed on Thursday evening at the beverage market of Rewe XXL on the Waldbröler Gerberstraße.
Under the guise of a firearm, three darkly dressed people who had disguised their faces demanded from the employee of the beverage market the issue of cash and then fled first on foot and then presumably with a silver-colored VW golf.
How much money was stolen is not disclosed by the police.
The perpetrators are said to have been between 1.60 and 1.70 meters tall, relatively small.
The drinks market is directly accessible from the parking deck of the Rewe market and poorly visible.
After the raid, the perpetrators must have run in the direction of Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg and escaped from the gravel parking lot opposite the parking garage entrance with the silver-coloured car, possibly in the direction of B 256 (Schladernring).
Anyone who made observations related to the robbery at the time of the crime (around 7:45 p.m.) should report to the police urgently.
Nagold: Play and Fun in Summertime
The children and young people of the social pedagogical day group / social group work of the child welfare federation Nagold spent eight beautiful and happy days with their caregivers during their summer holidays in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
During the first week of school holidays, the group was housed in the quiet leisure home Hardtwäldle.
Several full-day excursions were on the program.
On the one hand, we went to Bretten with the visit to the petting zoo.
On the other hand, to Maulbronn, where there was a special children's guided tour in the world-famous monastery.
The third trip was to Pforzheim.
At the Celtic Museum in Hochdorf, the group learned a lot about everyday life and the food of the Celts.
On the hot days, the group enjoyed themselves at the deep lake in Maulbronn, which invited for jumping, swimming and paddling.
Children and caregivers were spoiled for culinary pleasure with their self-prepared body foods such as the Sauren Spätzle, the Seebronner Pfännle, the Iselshauser-Bloff, the English Breakfast and Tübingen Bolognese.
In workshops, beautiful jewellery was created from pearls and stones or a Roman mill game was made from wood.
Other highlights of the free time were fishing in a nearby pond, the evenings by the fire and the final "Bunte Abend".
On the day of the journey home, the sun laughed and the children and young people returned home satisfied.
Haigerloch: Pilgrimage to the Gate of Mercy
The ministers from the pastoral care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
Together, four stages were completed.
In order to bridge the time until the next Rome pilgrimage of all ministers in expected two years, the High Ministers' Round of St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.
Various pilgrimage destinations were examined and the decision was finally made for the bishopric of Freiburg, where a special pilgrimage destination was offered this year on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy with the door of Mercy open at Freiburger Münster.
16 minions made of Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and sanctuaries set out on their way.
The night before, in a small celebration in St. Anna, Priest Storost sent out the pilgrims, blessed the pilgrim crosses and gave the pilgrim blessings.
From Horb, trains took us to the starting point Villingen, where there is also a monastery of Our Lady, so the pilgrimage route was started from the monastery.
The individual day tours were each framed in the morning and in the evening by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and scriptures.
But even on the way, the minis repeatedly paused at field crosses, chapels or churches to sing together a song from a specially compiled pilgrim songbook.
For the overnight stays, parishes of the local parishes were available.
At the stages, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty as well as invigorating dinner and breakfast.
On the second day we went via Furtwangen to Gütenbach.
The next day, the stage to St. Peter, which was the most strenuous route, had to be descended in the muggy heat at first about 500 meters of altitude and then climbed again.
The deserved reward was a common barbecue at the bathing pond in the evening.
After the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter, we headed for the final stage to Freiburg.
Visibly relieved and happy, the Minis arrived at Freiburger Münster in the later afternoon and crossed the Gate of Mercy.
With a little impulse, thanks were given to God.
At the evening fair in Münster, the minis arrived at the pilgrimage destination by co-operator Markus Obert were welcomed.
After the service, the pilgrims could visit the sacristy and the high altar.
The next day there was still time for the Breisgaume metropolis.
In the afternoon we took the train back to Horb.
In the end, all participants agreed that the days were marked by spirituality and a strong community experience.
Scotsman Callum Skinner storms home as Briton wins gold for cycling
Scotland’s Callum Skinner raced to fame last night in the men’s team sprint at the Rio Velodrome when the British team defended the title of London 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had taken on. The boyspound made the legend proud when he stormed home to claim a victory from New Zealand’s favourites.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
They repeated the trick after reaching only a modest sixth place at the London Rail World Championships in March, despite Hoy’s resignation.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of rider Jamie Staff.
They did this in time as Hinds showed up.
Hoy’s retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man they stayed with when they saw potential in the Scots that has now unfolded.
Hindes, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won in the first round.
And the British trio won the gold duel.
Hindes was narrowly behind after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.
A change of strategy made up a big part of the transformation, as Hindes drove in a higher gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep the pace.
Hoy watched from his position as a BBC expert and noticed Skinner, Kenny, and Hindes as they climbed the podium.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final round and defeated the world champions.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to win this.
After the 2012 triumph at Kenny's and Hoys' side, Hindes admitted that he deliberately fell onto the track after a weak start.
He later withdrew this statement and there was no objection from England's rivals.
With such an outstanding victory, there was no such problem this time.
Hindes said, "It feels like London with all the GB flags on the stands."
We have come together as a team over the last three months.
We got away so badly with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win the Olympics again.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, that expect us successful five days in the velodrome.
With Kenny's form, it is possible that he repeats Hoy's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.
That would mean for Kenny – who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on 23 March (a seemingly sacred date for British sports; on that day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were also born) – a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.
It would be the same as Hoy’s.
Kenny is next in the sprint, which starts today and will go over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I'm just enjoying this for the moment."
The team event is always the best.
You can win it with your colleagues.
It feels a bit lonely to win alone.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be knighted."
It was the only medal competition of the day, but there was more good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometre race.
They reached the goal in 3:51,942.
The world record, which won gold in London in 2012, was 3:51,659.
The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will certainly be the focus.
He had been arguing with commissioners before qualifying yesterday when officials called him to measure his height.
In the corresponding women's competition, which will continue and end tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in world record time in 4:13,260.
The GB team relies on its strong track cycling team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to win a bunch of medals.
After a truly extraordinary display of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio were cut.
Dramas took place in the background, such as the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid sexism and bullying allegations, as well as the retirement of majors such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, when you look at the first evening of the competition in the velodrome, it looks like the now legendary reputation of GB, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated.
The future of Portland’s smelting plant is questionable due to the termination of the energy contract
The future of Portland’s aluminium melt in Victoria – as well as hundreds of workers’ jobs – is at stake as the plant operator will terminate the energy supply contract and thus cancel all supply contracts, the supplying energy company said.
This step followed the decision of the government in Victoria earlier this year not to grant any further subsidies to the operation of the plant.
A 20-year subsidy will expire in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs at Alcoa’s Portland plant are at stake.
No less than 2000 jobs, both direct and indirect, could be at risk in the event of closure.
In addition, domino effects could occur as the smelter consumes around 10 percent of Victoria’s total electricity generation.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry Melting Company, which led to the closure of the Anglesea Power Plant last year.
The Alcoa smelter in Portland is losing money and risking closure.
This move follows years of speculation about the future of the facility, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently due to the electricity price for the facility.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminum smelter with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it expects three more owners to terminate their contracts.
The plant is majority owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which Chinese company CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.
“AGL expects the plant in Portland to continue operating, which means another physical demand for electricity from the smelter,” the company said in a statement.
AGL further stated that the contracts were so-called "security transactions", which should have come into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will end in 2017.
"AGL therefore assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenues in fiscal year 17," said the electricity supplier.
All potential impact on AGL revenues from GJ 18 onwards is currently limited by the forecasts of strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL announced that it had already written off the value of the contracts in the amount of $187 million in "expectation of termination" in its annual closings.
Alcoa said that the decision to de-book the contracts, the "ability of Alcoa... to operate the smelter or to ensure the power supply to the smelter" did not interfere.
The U.S. company said it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which should have come into effect from November this year, even if it still owes an explanation as to why it resigned from the contract.
Analysts are warning of the possible closure of the Portland Melting Plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the industry’s poor economic conditions.
Speaking to analysts earlier this week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said Portland consumes around 600 megawatts and Tomago around 900 megawatts of electricity annually.
Should both investments disappear from the market, this would significantly reduce demand in the [electricity market].
And that would not be good for us as a generator," he said.
More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of manager and mother of Kardashian-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of US Vogue.
Kendall, the brand ambassador for Estee Lauder and running at Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"In a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The unveiling of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians similar?), scripted reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (with the exception of the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the most popular showbiz uncles and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as they have all planned the cover of their sister's party.
This is the clichéd plot of almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest brought the phrase, "You thought we forgot you?" with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit on a radio station at 8 a.m.), but Kris had to somehow let her other girls participate in that publicity.
With regards to the September issue of Vogue, a new era of Kardashians has certainly begun.
Kendall’s big sister Kim may have beaten her in terms of the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were there in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league in its own right.
The September issue is the most sold issue of the year for Vogue.
With a volume that resembles a picture book rather than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (according to Fashionista, of the 832 pages of the rollercoaster, 615 pages were advertising).
The unveiling of his cover star is so eagerly anticipated that in the last two years, images of the magazine have leaked through before the official announcement.
Women who have already been on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have clearly been more "celebrities who model" than "models who are celebrities" on the cover.
Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honor.
But even with the small chance that Ms. Jenner - described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the previous category, she is in good company.
These celebrities aren’t related to celebrities or reality stars or teenagers of today who know how to shoot a good Snapchat video (even if it’s all about Jenner).
They are truly talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, Jenner’s success does not please everyone.
With her reality TV story, Jenner’s position in the fashion world has always been somewhat tense.
In June, former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "the bitches of the moment."
These feelings boiled again when the news of Jenner’s appearance on the Vogue cover came out.
But riding around on the displeasure seems to pass the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
She is, in the truest sense of the word, a supermodel.
She runs for Marc Jacobs.
It promotes your Estee Lauder foundation.
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective Paywall apps.
She sold pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to the magazine LOVE.
And in her spare time, she's on reality TV, probably just to see her sister Kourtney and their kids.
Community law centers dismiss 160,000 people annually
More than 160,000 of the country’s most needy people are rejected by the community law centers each year, while the industry is keen to see the impact of further cuts in funding on already overloaded transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five people – mostly elderly people, immigrants, workers in need, victims of violence, and those who do not have funds for unjust delogements and the like – are denied free legal advice and legal counsel in their requests.
Municipal legal services, which are already overloaded, are preparing for further cuts.
From June next year, it is planned that these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds.
Queesland’s director of community rights centers, James Farrell, said the latest survey by the National Association of Community Law Centers revealed that thousands of people are already being rejected each year.
Farrell said the situation would only get worse without a repeal of the federal government's decision.
“Queensland’s community law centers are chronically underfunded, which means thousands of people are being rejected from important services you need,” he said.
People leaving violent relationships, people with insurmountable and overwhelming debts, families going through separations, workers unjustly fired – all these people have legal problems and this survey shows that they can’t get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017, which means that thousands of people in need of help from Queensland will be forced to deal with their legal problems without any help.
We call on the Attorney General and Federal Minister of Justice and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately lift these cuts so that the people who need them can get the help they need in case of legal problems.
Last year, the state government met its commitment to raise funding for legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of the community law centers and their customer communities, and that the government of Palaszczuk is investing in this important work.
Donald Trump campaign charged after employee allegedly pulled gun
New York: Donald Trump’s campaign has been charged with alleged inaction after she was informed that her campaign leader for North Carolina had fired a gun on an employee in February while they were traveling in a jeep in February.
The incident is described in an indictment filed Wednesday in Charlotte state court by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in that state.
Bordini said he had waited months for the matter to be settled internally before realizing that "this wouldn't happen."
The campaign leader, Earl Philip, "dragged a gun, put his right index finger on the trigger, and rammed the barrel into Vincent's knee," Bordini said in his indictment.
After complaining to the local and regional campaign leadership, Bordini noted that at least four more people had already had the same experience with Phillip, he stated in the indictment.
"Weapons don't have to be fired to do damage," Bordini said.
The indictment comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate sparked a riot when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the “Second Amendment People”—gun owners and gun friends—should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton were to be elected and appoint judges.
Trump’s campaign made it clear that the media had taken his words out of context and that he would not incite violence.
Bordini’s complaint demands compensation from the campaign for breach of due diligence and from Philip for bodily harm and lasting psychological damage.
Trump’s press secretary, Hope Hicks, was unable to reach a statement.
Attempts to contact Philip failed as well.
WCCB, a local news station in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer an employee of the campaign.
Calls to his consulting company, Innovative Consulting Services, were not responded.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has led a controversial campaign so far.
Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin/Schwerin: Poll before country elections: SPD and CDU lose
The upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania (4 September) and Berlin (18 September) show significant losses for the ruling parties SPD and CDU.
This was revealed by representative surveys of the opinion research institute INSA for the "Bild"-Zeitung (Friday).
While the red-black government coalition could continue to rule in the north, this is not possible according to the poll figures in Berlin.
In both federal states, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and thus would have good chances to continue to be the head of government.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD fell from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
According to the poll, the party was just ahead of the CDU, which could come back to 23 percent.
Third place is disputed between the Left and the AfD.
The left would come to 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented in the Landtag for the first time with 19 percent.
Despite slight losses, the Greens are returning to the Schweriner Landtag with 6 percent (previously 8.7 percent).
The NPD and the FDP would not be represented in the Landtag with 3% each.
According to the poll, the SPD would only reach 23 percent in the Berlin parliamentary elections (election 2011: 28.3 percent).
The CDU only reached 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
It was still behind the Greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but ahead of the Left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).
The AfD would be represented in the House of Representatives for the first time with 14%.
With 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, but the pirates would miss the move in contrast to 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: the first smartphone
E-mail and Internet in slow motion: The Nokia Communicator was launched 20 years ago.
The successors dominate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, so it was not well in the hand either.
On the contrary, it was pretty clumsy.
The built-in memory was initially eight megabytes, which today would be enough for about two high-resolution selfies.
An iPhone is now shipped with at least 16 gigabytes.
The Nokia 9000 Communicator arrived in stores exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996 - and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet, but they somehow date back to the stone age of the Internet age.
Twenty years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair Cebit in Hanover as "office in vest pocket format".
In fact, the new mobile phone could be a lot for then standards: SMS and emails could be sent and received, even by fax the communicator was reachable.
Even access to websites was possible via an HTML browser, albeit painstakingly slow.
A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the phone could be unfolded similar to a laptop.
Then a small keyboard and a black and white screen were found.
Pretty proud was the price: 2700 D-Mark, so about 1400 Euro.
The average sales price of a smartphone in Germany in 2015 was 392 euros.
No one could have imagined in August 1996 that the communicator would be the beginning of the smartphone era.
Since then, everything has been different.
The smart phones are a success story, albeit not for Nokia.
The Finns’ mobile phone business experienced an unprecedented disaster, and was eventually sold to Microsoft.
Today, the market is dominated by vendors, all of whom came much later than Nokia.
Being online anytime and anywhere is everyday for a lot of people today.
In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.
Some 1.4 billion units were sold, of which 555 million were sold by Samsung and Apple alone.
Worldwide sales of the devices amount to around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 billion.
In addition, the well-executed business of the countless app providers and the telecommunications companies.
Nowadays, a whole industry has emerged around the smartphone.
The decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only in early 2007, when Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced at the Mac World the launch of the iPhone.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an internet communicator, all via touch screen easy to operate.
Apple’s triumph began, and even today, the iPhone is the company’s most important product.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who dominated the market, were overlooked.
They finally disappeared, Blackberry is struggling.
Apple and Asian suppliers such as Samsung are now in charge.
The smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention.
On average, every German now looks at their mobile phone 88 times a day.
"We all have to learn to put away the smartphone once in a while," said Janina Kugel, head of the Siemens Human Resources Board.
Permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and a blessing at the same time.
England Must Lead the Olympic Spirit and Expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country.
For me, this was Heathrow’s biggest attraction, just like we did in London in 2012, when we made a huge effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympics brought great advantages to Stratford and the East End.
And this will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for locals and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.
Just as they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of Heathrow expansion is too big.
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will embarrass ourselves on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question asked.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many and not for individuals.
Expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, <0xC2><0xA3>211 billion in scientific growth, and leave a legacy of skills and employment around both the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team in Heathrow that has implemented a <0xC2><0xA3>11 billion infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from the T5 – voted the world’s best airport terminal for five years in a row – to the T2 built in the midst of the world’s two most frequented catwalks.
Now they are ready to deliver a third runway, backed by <0xC2><0xA3>16 billion in private investment.
The 2012 London Games were a big success for GB and I am confident that the extension of Heathrow will be one as well.
It’s time to steer this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, securing our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Heathrow Board and Former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in the "Cat and Mouse Game" regarding ad blocking
For companies that make money from online advertising, attempts to bypass ad blocking are a "cat and mouse game", according to one of the software manufacturers.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block ad blocking on its desktop page, Adblock Plus published a blog post stating that users could update their filters in the program to re-block ads on the social network.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the encoding regarding its ads to make it harder for ad blockers to detect what part of the page is advertising.
But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes.
In a blog post, Adblock’s spokesman Ben Williams wrote that “this kind of back-and-forth battle between the ad-blocking open source community and the rover has been going on since the invention of ad-blockers,” and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has embarked on the battle is a strong indication of how worrying ad blockers have become for the industry.
According to a study by Pagefair and Adobe last year, around 200 million people worldwide use ad blockers, almost four times as much in 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook through their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of Facebook’s advertising revenue.
The company is aiming for ad blockers on desktop PCs because mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook’s social networking and Instagram mobile app, a spokesperson said.
Advertising on desktop PCs accounts for a sufficiently large share of revenue, so Facebook seems to be worth investing in such a step.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would update its “ad preferences tool” to give people more control over ads targeted at them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock’s new filters would be worrying because they would also block content on the page that is not advertising.
"This is not a positive experience for users, so we plan to address the issue," a Facebook spokesperson said in an email.
Ad blockers are a dull tool, which is why we have instead focused on developer tools like Ad Preferences to put more control into people’s hands.
Suspected Suicide Woman Killed on Swiss Highway
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are calling witnesses after a woman was hit by a suspected suicide by several vehicles on a highway in the early hours of Thursday.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.
A woman lay down on the street in the dark "in an act of despair" and was hit by several cars, police in Vaud said.
It is obvious that at the age of 49, a Swiss woman who was hit by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill herself.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been interrogated, but some have still not been identified, police said, asking them and every witness to report the incident.
An investigation was opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed.
Was a collision preventable?
That is something that the prosecutor has to decide," Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers are not held accountable.
In each of the two cases - where a person was walking in the dark on the highway - it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian is walking on the highway in the middle of the night, as the newspaper said.
Last year, a policewoman was acquitted of negligent killing after she hit and killed a man who was lying on the A1 near Payerne in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and became unconscious on the street, the court heard.
The court found that the policewoman — who had responded to an emergency call — was driving in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a “completely extraordinary and unpredictable situation,” the judge said.
Anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably once habitable.
Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to discover Venus’ past using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere, could have once exhibited Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus may have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and yet slowly continued to rotate.
The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.
The planet probably had more arid areas than Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to house life and protect from rapid evaporation.
The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.
"In the GISS model simulation, Venus' slow rotation exposes its day side of the Sun for almost two months," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio said in a press release.
This heats the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the sun’s heat.
The result is average temperatures that are a few degrees cooler than Earth’s today.
The model produced a history of Venus similar to the evolution previously suspected by planetary scientists.
Although it was once probably habitable, Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light over the course of billions of years.
Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light.
When their hydrogen escaped, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect remained -- the Venus as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as coach of the Avalanche
Patrick Roy resigned Thursday as coach and vice president of hockey operations of the Colorado Avalanche and led a lack of co-determination in the team’s decision-making process.
Alternative President/General Manager of Colorado's Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the club will immediately look for a new coach.
"Over the past three years, I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations at the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," Roy said in a statement.
I’ve been thinking long and hard over the summer about how I could improve this team to give it more depth, what it needs, and take it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey operations must be perfectly aligned with that of the organization.
He must also have a right of co-determination in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who had hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me about this decision today," Sakic said.
We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him all the best for the future.
Roy was named the best coach of the league during his debut season at the 2013-14 Avalanches as a winner of the Jack Adams Award.
He led the club to 112 points and placed first in the Central Vision, but Colorado was defeated in the first round of Minnesota's playoffs and missed the off-season in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches recorded a 39-39-4 mark in the 2015-16 season and fell behind the wild for a second wildcard spot in the Western Conference by five points.
As a Hall of Fame goalkeeper, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two plays with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume talks, suspend strike
Work struggles over the pay for North Sea oil workers will be suspended as all parties to the dispute sit at the table for a new round of talks, negotiators said.
Strikes against oilfield service provider Wood Group have been sporadic on North Sea platforms operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the settlement process of the current dispute," a joint statement said.
We will hold some full-day meetings over the next few weeks, which will start at the beginning of next year to re-tackle the problems.
The unions said their last strike, which is the first in over 25 years, was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
This year, Wood Group has cut the rates on its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure.
The company’s rate cut follows a 10 percent decline for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said that additional cuts will give the company the space needed to get through the market downturn.
Shell, for its part, has fired thousands of people and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its operations as a result of its megamerger with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices, an economic situation that had been exacerbated by the British decision in June to leave the European Union.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with workers’ leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes that has taken place in the North Sea for a generation.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for many and not just for few," he said in a statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected, compared to an average of around $7 billion in the last five years.
Kepler Measures Rotation Rate of Stars in Pleiades Cluster
The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers gather the most complete catalog of rotation rates among the stars of the Pleiades star cluster.
The new data will help astronomers understand why stars in the cluster rotate at different rates and the relationship between rotational periods and planet formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other clusters of stars, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age, and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena.
The Pleiades are located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many stars in this cluster, formed around 125 million years ago, are now reaching adulthood.
They are now turning fastest.
At peak rotation rates, these ripening stars emit large amounts of stellar winds.
As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a slowing effect on the stars.
As a star ages, its rate of rotation begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by detecting the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sunspots.
The latest catalog of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars are rotating more slowly than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars to dancers, with larger stars spinning slower than smaller ones.
“In the Pleiades’ ‘ballet’, we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars,” Rebull said.
Because the Pleiades star cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates.
"The Pleiades star cluster provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
There is still a lot ahead of us that we would like to learn more about, how, when and why stars slow their rotation rates and hang their "dance shoes", so to speak.
Rebull and her colleagues have reported extensively in three newspaper reports on their latest analysis of Pleiades rotation rates, which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.
A controversial baseball star resigns
Alex Rodriguez’s tears went faster than the US baseball star in the best days from base to base.
After his emotional resignation announcement, the 41-year-old professional will wear the jersey of his New York Yankees for the last time against the Tampa Bay Rays on August 12.
“I love this game and this team.
"I say goodbye to both," said Major League Baseball (MLB) 14-time all-star game participant.
Three times Rodriguez was voted the most valuable player in the league, and in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees.
His signature under a ten-year contract earned him $27 million annually since 2007.
Until the end of the contract on December 31, 2017, he will act as a consultant and youth coach - at full salary.
As a player, Rodriguez paid it back with performance for a long time.
With 696 homeruns, 3114 hits, and 2021 points for his teams ("Runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004), and since 2005, the Yankees have achieved several milestones.
With Hall of Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two other baseball players have similar values in the main stats.
However, the 41-year-old should not be admitted to the baseball hall of fame.
Because as successful as Rodriguez - nicknamed "A-Rod" - was on the field, so controversial is his appearance outside the pitch.
Already in 2009, the superstar at ESPN admitted to taking banned steroids between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, he was suspended for 211 games due to involvement in the so-called biogenesis scandal until the end of 2014.
Rodriguez is considered the main suspect to have been receiving performance-enhancing drugs for years through an anti-aging clinic in South Florida.
After a legal dispute, the ban was reduced to 162 matches.
“The league might even have done me a favor for 2014 because I played for 20 years without a break,” Rodriguez said.
Even his farewell days do not go silent.
While many baseball legends were once again given the big stage in their last games, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bench.
"My job doesn't involve a farewell tour."
"My job involves trying to win every game," said Yankees coach Joe Girardi.
After all, Rodriguez, who was married to actress Cameron Diaz and is reported to have relationships with pop star Madonna and actress Kate Hudson, received sympathy expressions from fans from Yankee arch-rival Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod," the supporters sang in the 4-9 defeat against the Rodriguez team.
Olympics 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekova and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases
Caught: Due to a positive doping test, weightlifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland is not allowed to start in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.
A caught athlete would have almost won a medal.
Before the seventh day of the competition, the first official doping cases of the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro became known.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3,000-metre obstacle runner Silwia Danekova from Bulgaria and Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were tested positive and excluded in Brazil - just before the start of the already critically watched athletics competitions, these news come untimely.
In Chen's case, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide had already been detected last Sunday, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.
The International Sports Court CAS confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon local time.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old had taken fourth place in the 100 m butterfly final, only by 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.
On Friday, Chen should have participated in the 50 m freestyle runs.
Chen has asked the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to open the B sample and hold a hearing.
The national association takes the matter "very seriously and demands Chen's full cooperation in the investigations," Xinhua said in a statement: "We will cooperate with the CAS International Sports Court and will accept the verdict."
For the first time in history, the IOC is no longer responsible for sanctioning athletes with positive cases.
Also on the night of Rio the news of the positive rehearsal at Danekova leaked, the 33-year-old went into the offensive himself.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," she told BNT.
She is innocent, "the only explanation could be dietary supplements," the athlete explained.
According to the report, the banned substance is the blood doping agent EPO.
Danekova was provisionally suspended, according to BNT, the B-sample is already positive.
Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov immediately responded with criticism of the athlete.
"I don't understand why the athletes don't draw the right conclusions," he said, "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."
For example, all weightlifters from the chronically doping-laden nation are not allowed to participate in Rio.
On Friday, the case of "Adrian Zielinski" became known, the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested positive for the anabolic steroid nandrolone like his brother Tomasz three days earlier.
Both deny the intake, but both are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg.
Before the start of the athletes, the case of Danekova in particular is another serious blow to the reputation of the entire sport.
The world association IAAF had banned the entire Russian team from launching, with the exception of systematic doping, the runner nation Kenya also produces numerous bad news in Rio.
In addition, the previous offences in China had caused fierce disputes between the athletes.
Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang.
"Sun Yang peeing purple."
"When I see the podium over 200 m freestyle, I want to surrender," Lacourt said on French radio.
Sun was also at the center of a confrontation with Australian Mack Horton.
"I have no time and no respect for doping fraudsters," he said.
Sun had tested positive for the stimulant trimetazidine at the Chinese championships in 2014, but only had to sit down for three months.
Data Robbery: How Perfidious Hackers Extort Their Ransom
Programmers of extortion malware are currently targeting companies in a targeted manner - and are successful in doing so.
According to a recent survey of malware defense specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, the UK and Germany, 40 percent of the companies surveyed have been victims of at least one, sometimes multiple, ransomware attacks in the past 12 months.
In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies have been targeted by ransomware extortion.
40 percent of victims willingly paid the ransom money demanded by the perpetrators to reuse the attacked systems and data.
The perpetrators are specializing their extortion software, according to the observations of Malwarebytes, increasingly on attacks in corporate networks.
If they succeed there, the ransom potentially to be extorted is significantly higher than for private users.
"We are currently observing a frighteningly rapid evolution of malware," said Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski.
In 2008, most malware programs were designed to send advertising.
Then the perpetrators discovered extortion software for themselves.
At first, private users were the target, but the shift to corporate attacks has been frighteningly fast in recent months.
Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: Once active on a victim’s computer, it searches specifically for recently modified files such as Word, Excel or database files, as well as archives of images and videos.
These files encrypt the ransomware and permanently delete the originals.
The software then presents the demands of the blackmailers.
In order to get the final encryption code to the files, the victims must transfer money - usually in the form of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
However, where the personal photo database is at stake for private users, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production stops.
Consequently, the damage is higher when a ransomware strikes.
22 percent of the affected German companies reported revenue losses due to ransomware, 13 percent even had to interrupt their business completely, in one case, people were in danger of their lives.
In Germany, hospitals have already been victims of attacks on several occasions, whose patients may be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.
"We always tell the victims: don't pay, you're just promoting the problem," Kleczynski explains.
But 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay get their data back.
For managers, it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators in the face of a standstill in the operation.
The hackers, in turn, know this and try everything to build a good reputation.
In a recent study, F-Secure security researchers have examined the user interfaces and contact with the extortioners and come to the conclusion that the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to raise more money.
They explain to their victims via chat how to pay via Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support sites or decrypt sample files for free.
And if private individuals are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros, companies sometimes have to negotiate harshly and pay five-digit sums to get their data back unencrypted.
Given the potentially high and relatively risk-free profits from ransomware blackmail, hackers are becoming more and more professional and sharing the work, security expert Chester Wisniewski of antivirus provider Sophos explains: “A single person can write a ransomware within about a week.”
However, it is more likely that they are three or four people.
The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software builder to the actual blackmailers.
The previous malware kits were created by purchasing the malware itself, consulting and additional tools for a one-time, fixed price between $1000 and $10,000.
"A customization tool is included, so smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.
The blackmailers then look for more hackers to distribute the newly purchased software among the victims.
We live in a service industry.
So you log into one of the forums in the underground, buy the set from a criminal and commission another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
Payment is made per infected computer.
"Usually, the criminals then commission spammers to spread," Wisniewski explains.
The risk of ransomware is now well known to many companies who are better at securing their data.
More than 50 percent of the company’s IT executives in the Malwarebytes survey trust to be able to fight off ransomware through file backups and scanner software.
Consequently, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.
“When data encryption alone is no longer a sufficient threat to successful capture, the perpetrators threaten to release sensitive data, such as customer lists or price calculations,” said Marcin Kleczynski, CEO of Malwarebytes.
Depending on the type of data, the potential for damage is much higher than before.
In the future, the perpetrators could also take on completely new goals in the Internet of Things.
At the Defcon hacker conference, security researchers demonstrated how to get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.
In the middle of winter, unlocking such a blocked heating could be worth a ransom for some victims.
If the perpetrators then block an entire production line in a factory in the future instead of heating, ransomware could also become an issue in Industry 4.0.
One for all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
In the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivan.
Sounds pretty crowded, but the HR-V, which was designed on the same new platform as the new Jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.
Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V seems rather small, the passengers have plenty of space in the first row as well as in the rear, it does not seem narrow at all.
The materials of the interior are well processed and look pleasant, only the cockpit top falls off a bit.
The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in terms of storage space.
There is not only a boot of 453 l with upright and 1026 l with folded backrests available, but there are the "Magic Seats".
This is less magical than it sounds: the seats of the rear seat can be folded up like a cinema chair and thus offer storage space that is 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceiling.
The trunk can be loaded well, but the loading height is slightly higher with 650 mm than the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1.6-l diesel with 88 kW/120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.
He may be doing his job a little less.
The daily consumption of 4.7 l/100 km is pleasing.
There is another engine: a 1.5-litre petrol engine with 96 kW/130 hp.
A four-wheel drive is not offered.
The driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamism and comfort.
The steering should be a bit more direct.
The equipment leaves nothing to be desired in the tested top variant "Executive".
The safety systems include the City Emergency Brake Assist (works up to pace 32), the Collision Warning System and the Lane Keeping Assist.
The collision warning sometimes annoys because it ranks many obstacles as "approaching objects" when maneuvering.
The high beam assistant works very reliably.
And the intelligent speed controller responds to traffic signal recognition and reduces the speed if necessary.
But full connectivity is only available for the top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, Navi, app integration and more.
Two USB and one HDMI jacks are located under the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome to reach.
The around 29000 euros for the well-equipped top-diesel is fine.
If you don’t want to invest as much, you will get the gasoline from 20,000 euros, the diesel from 23,000 euros.
The engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
Airline not liable: crash on passenger bridge
An airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge.
Because liability is only conceivable for hazards typical of air traffic, the Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf argued (Az.: 18 U 124/14).
The plaintiff had broken a kneecap during the fall.
However, the accident could have happened anywhere - it is a general life risk, the court said.
The airline did not have to pay the man any damages.
Case of illness: when the organizer pays
Sick holidaymakers only get money back after their trip if the cause of the disease can be found in the hotel without any doubt.
However, this is only the case if more than ten percent of guests are proven to have the same symptoms.
In the case under negotiation, on the second day of their Turkey holiday, a family was severely affected by diarrhea and vomiting.
She spent almost all of her vacation in the room.
Their illness led the holidaymakers back to a defective sewage treatment plant that allegedly contaminated the seawater.
The family felt that the trip was inadequate - and complained against the organizer.
In court, the plaintiffs were unsuccessful.
The sewage treatment plant was indeed defective.
But the organizer only learned about it shortly before the plaintiffs left.
Until then, he had to assume that the sea water was okay.
He did not violate his information obligations, according to the ruling.
Especially since no impurities were found in the samples of the water.
The illness of several hotel guests - possibly due to infection among themselves - belongs to the general life risk.
Of the 691 guests, only 38 were ill.
De Maizière said that after the violence perpetrated by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people were concerned about further attacks.
At the same time, the state must respond with caution and determination to terrorist threats.
It is certain that our country will not respond to the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division.
We will not grant this triumph to the terrorists.
If criminals had to leave the country faster, however, this would increase security and also strengthen the popular approval for refugee policy.
De Maizière wants to achieve implementation of the proposals until the 2017 federal elections.
He also announced further personnel reinforcement of the security forces, "in a medium four-digit order over several years."
Advertising of sympathy for terrorism must be punished again.
Video surveillance is to be improved, the law on weapons is to be revised in such a way that the purchase of weapons on the Internet is made more difficult.
According to de Maizières, the recently much discussed duty of secrecy for doctors should be maintained.
However, he wants to look for solutions in dialogue with the medical profession to reduce the risk to citizens, he said with regard to mental abnormalities.
In order to counteract the radicalisation of refugees, the Minister considers that better social care is necessary.
Teachers should be better prepared to deal with traumatized people.
In order to prosecute criminals in specific areas of the Internet (Darknet), de Maizière plans to use covert investigators.
SPD chief Gabriel said: "The SPD is ready to talk about anything that helps to further increase security".
It is important that the Minister of the Interior has clearly spoken out against actionism.
"This was a blow to the sharpeners in the CDU/CSU," Gabriel told the newspapers of the Funke Mediengruppe (Friday).
De Maizière had previously rejected calls from the Union for a burqa ban and the abolition of dual citizenship.
He believes that a general ban on full veiling is constitutionally problematic.
You cannot ban everything you reject, and I reject wearing the burqa.
You can talk about rules, for example in road traffic or for witnesses in court.
Green chief Simone Peter accused the minister of wanting to simulate power and ability to act with ever new anti-terror packages.
Left Party leader Bernd Riexinger said: "Floating sayings and a tightening of the right of residence do not bring more security to the people in this country".
Better traffic flow on the motorway feeder
There are regular stakes on the bypass road - here is a picture from November.
But that should change: the right turning lane should be extended.
This is good news for all car drivers who are stuck in traffic on the surrounding road every night when they drive over the highway (A 43).
On Tuesday and Wednesday (16/17 August) in the area between Hammer Straße and the Weseler Straße exit, the national road construction company will extend the right-hand lane by 700 meters.
Drivers can then turn right directly from Hammer Straße.
The big advantage: the traffic splits up more early, which improves the overall flow on the busy section of the Bundesstraße 51.
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU group in the district representation Münster-West.
The narrowing of the roadway on the feeder annoys the drivers especially between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m.
On weekdays, the backstay reaches to the bridge over the Albersloher Weg and sometimes beyond.
The reason is the needle eye on the B 51 just before the exit Weseler Straße.
From here, traffic is steered only one-lane via the highway bridge.
The second track had to be rebuilt well over three-and-a-half years ago.
The reason: Static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary load capacity to accommodate heavy-duty traffic in two lanes in particular.
How long this bottleneck and the associated workday congestion will last, the responsible national company cannot say.
However, years can be expected: because the bridge has an official residual service life until 2034.
For the extension of the right-hand turning lane, the national company deliberately chose the lower traffic time during the school holidays, because disabilities were to be expected.
Traffic will pass the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday in one lane.
Intercultural travel: cultural offerings for schools
The international class of the forest school attended the play "The Invisible House".
The association Nima's and the Junge Theater are now planning a music project.
The association Nima's enables young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Klasse International" of the Waldschule Kinderhaus has visited a presentation of the award-winning play "Das unsichtbare Haus" of the Young Theater Münster.
In the context of the "Intercultural Journey" initiated by the association Nima's, 19 students between the ages of 11 and 15 attended the staging in the Small House.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which has set itself the goal of cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background, offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project.
Most of the class’ youth came to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016, among others, from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria, and spoke little German.
Thanks to the choreographies, the scenic pictures and video animations, they were able to follow the course of the story, according to the press release of the Junges Theater Münster.
The association Nima's, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprakel, and the Junge Theater will work together in the coming season as part of a musical theatre project.
From October to December, young people with or without a refugee and migrant background between the ages of 14 and 20 will have the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing, dance, acting and music.
Offers for children and families in the field of theatrical play and theatrical language teaching are in the planning.
The project "Intercultural Travel" continues.
Given the increased number of refugees, the association expects many classes to participate.
Rain instead of stargazing: hope for better weather
The weather has made the stargazers in the southwest of Germany a stroke through the bill in the night of Friday - but there is still hope.
The night was badly suited for observing the sky because of clouds and rain, said the chairman of the Welzheim Observatory, Hans-Ulrich Keller, on Friday morning.
Our hope lies in the night to Saturday.
The weather is supposed to be good, then we'll probably see a lot of star-sniffing in the sky.
The star sheds are Perseids, which are among the fastest swarms at 216000 kilometers per hour.
They have their name because they seem to come from the constellation of Perseus, which rises in the northeast.
Restful Night: Tips for Sleep Disorders
In the evening you roll around forever, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning you can no longer think of sleep long before the alarm clock rings.
This is anything but relaxing.
After all, one is in good company with such problems: According to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not restorative.
How do sleep problems or sleep disorders manifest themselves?
There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be a variety of causes underlying them, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weess, board member of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
What is commonly understood to be insomnia, i.e. a sleep disorder.
It is precisely the sleep that many people find unsatisfactory or insufficient, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board of the German Association of General Practitioners with practice in Varel, Lower Saxony.
What Is Behind Sleep Disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
Behind this can be organic, psychological or behavioral factors, but also medications.
Not infrequently, sleep disorder is the expression of another disease.
"Very early waking up is common, especially with depression," says Weess.
And it may be that different factors depend on each other.
For example, if you have a herniated disc, you can lie down badly, wake up every two to three hours and maybe start to ponder about everyday problems and worries, Weeß gives an example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
When should you go to the doctor with sleep disorders?
Anyone who does not sleep well for at least three nights a week and is impaired during the day should go to the doctor, Weess advises.
The impairment can look quite different: you are tired, tired, sleepless, have difficulty with attention and concentration, are easily irritable, have mood swings or physical discomfort such as stomach or headaches.
To alleviate the sleep disorder, it is important to find out its causes.
Treatment options include behavioral changes, cognitive behavioral therapy or medications - classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and for a maximum of two weeks.
There are hardly any sleep physicians in Germany, stresses Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary Sleep Medicine Center of the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.
Therefore, in case of sleep problems, one should first contact the general practitioner, advises Weess.
He can clarify with examinations whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should go to the sleep lab, and what happens there?
For examinations in the sleep lab, physicians advise, for example, snoring with breath-retardants, morbid daytime fatigue, sleepwalkers or if the cause of a sleep disorder is not found, Fietze explains.
There is no need to prepare for the examination.
You should spend the day normally.
"Please don't sleep at noon," Fietze says.
After wiring, you go to bed at your normal time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body, you wear a nose glasses, a chest strap and a sensor on your finger.
In addition, a camera on the ceiling records the sleeping person.
How can people cope with the problems?
There are quite a few adjustment screws that you can put on for a better sleep.
Weess counts: Regular times to sleep and get up, do not lie in bed for too long, do not sleep during the day, do not watch TV to fall asleep, avoid alcohol and do not look at the clock at night - then you immediately start to reckon, and that is not at all beneficial.
What the jungle camp has to do with missing medals in swimming
Former German swimmer Markus Deibler spoke via Facebook about the disappointing performance of the DSV team at Olympis.
In December 2014, he won gold for the first time at the Doha World Short Course Championships, setting his first world record.
Former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has now put himself in a protective position from his criticized ex-teammates via Facebook.
"In a country where an Olympic champion gets <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20,000 and a jungle king <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150,000, no one should be surprised about missing medals," the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page.
The funding system in swimming is bad, but the doping controls are very good.
This means that we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not look so closely at or even run doping.
"I'm not saying that controls should be stopped here," he said.
If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler would have to be reported to the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA) nine months before his first launch.
It should be the same with countries.
“Whoever cannot be controlled for a certain period of time before the World Cup/OS by independent WADA/FINA inspectors is not allowed to participate,” says Wahl-Hamburger, who now runs an ice cream parlor.
Airport: Band of baggage thieves arrested
Professional thieves at Dusseldorf Airport
Dusseldorf police have arrested two women and two men between the ages of 50 and 61.
The suspects had committed several baggage and baggage thefts as a gang.
At around 9.30 p.m., civilian officials in the area of Düsseldorf Airport recognized a gang known to the police officers from past theft crimes.
The two women and two men had committed several offences since mid-July of this year, and had acted jointly, partly and particularly professionally.
The specialists of the Crime Commission 34 can prove four acts of the thieves who had entered Germany specifically to commit crimes.
In total, they had captured over 15,000 euros.
Old buildings, a few linden trees, in between a rest cobblestone: The Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not look like this at first glance, but the police consider it to be the "dangerous places" of the city.
If you walk along the road from east to west, you can pass playgrounds, a newly painted kindergarten and an organic store.
On the facade of a grey house someone sprayed "ugly!"
Opposite a Lidl, which will soon be demolished, is already being built: By 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments will be built here.
However, articles about this "trendy district", as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, have been depicted with burning cars in recent weeks.
The reason is the house with the number 94: Once it was occupied, now the residents have leases, but on the ground floor are still occupied rooms and are used for events.
Since the beginning of the year, Berlin interior senator Henkel, in particular, has spoken out on several occasions in favour of a harsh action by the police against the project, calling the area a "no-go zone" for police officers and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.
After the rooms on the ground floor, the Cadterschmiede, had been cleared with 300 police officers on June 22, the police patrolled for three weeks with 30 to 40 officials and three crew cars on site, blocking parts of the road and preventing visitors from entering the house with the number 94.
Meanwhile, construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners.
On July 13, a Berlin administrative court ruled that the eviction had been illegal, and a day later, police and construction workers withdrew under the cheers of sympathizers and local residents.
On this summer afternoon, the street looks peaceful: parents go for a walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others chat before late.
In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kindergartens.
Left-wing violence is not the main concern of many local residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in Kiez since 1999, and Jana*, who raises three children here, are especially annoyed by the police presence.
With the residents of the house projects, they share concerns about rising rents and gentrification.
It doesn’t sound like a kiez who wanted a majority of police protection from vandalizing leftists.
The trench that the Berlin interior senator and the police open between house occupiers and their neighbors does not seem to exist.
Friedrichshain in East Berlin was actually a traditional working-class district, which still has a low average income and a high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city today.
In 1990, numerous houses in the former GDR were occupied, including almost the entire Mainz Strasse very close to the Rigaer.
While the Mainz had been cleared under a large police force in a real street battle, many of the projects in Riga were legalized and are still partly inhabited by the people who occupied them 26 years ago.
At the same time, in recent years, the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and election Berliners from all over the world: with them, residents from the GDR era and former house occupiers now share their quiz.
This is also noticeable with the rentals, which have increased by almost 60 percent in new rentals since 2009.
Many of the new buildings in Riga are attacked as symbols of this development: you can recognize them by thrown-in panes or freshly painted facades, which were thrown with paint bags.
No other road has been mentioned so often this year along with the words “left-wing autonomous violence”.
One reason why not all neighbors see this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: according to statistics, crimes such as bodily harm are almost exclusively directed against police officers.
The majority of the offences are material damage, which tends to affect new buildings and newly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a rental house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, there can be no talk of uncertainty.
When it comes to violence, it is reassuring: the people in the 94 are their neighbors, who certainly weren’t.
Even the famous burning cars haven’t been around in Riga for a long time.
For the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "Here you help each other, live together on the street and get more from each other than elsewhere".
Neugebauer deliberately moved to the Rigaer Strasse - and stayed.
That’s why it was so important for the locals to get their street back: from the police, politics and the media, all of which suddenly claimed sovereignty over the district in July.
But in the eyes of residents such as new builders, the road continues to be taken away from them: through faceless new buildings in former building gaps that displace the old residents.
"These are, after all, condominiums that are not interesting to many here - people who are not so well cared for live here," she says.
"I can't approve of violence and destruction at all."
But what should you do if no one ever listens to you?
There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the residents.
Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding of newcomers who are annoyed by color bombs: the house projects and the left-wing scene belonged to the Kiez.
Anyone who moves here should be aware of this - just as someone who moves to a pub district can complain badly about noise there.

Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee officer
Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organizer.
She is also a local social worker.
Since July, Annika Deuschle has been the refugee representative for Urbach.
The social pedagogue supports the management team around Achim Grockenberger.
She sees herself as a contact person for all actors: refugees, refugee aid working group, administration, authorities and anyone else who is involved.
Regine’s client from the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now here, the egg-leaving woolly dairy, which has a problem above all.
For example, some had meant - less mockingly than aimed at the multitude of desirable tasks - when the administration wanted to advertise the position.
An administrative professional with a talent for languages and people, combined with many years of experience in the field of social work, was sought.
But administrative work is not their central area, says Annika Deuschle.
Above all, it is about organization, working with the people on site and also behind the scenes as well as networking.
The 31-year-old has been around for about six weeks.
She has limited a 50 percent position to three years.
"It was high time," says Regine Kunde, that Annika Deuschle supports honorary and full-time players.
There are big and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.
New containers will soon be on the Wasenstraße
It has been a serious problem for some time now to find housing for the follow-up refugees who have been recognised.
The municipalities are responsible for the accommodation.
They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented housing.
The costs of building, renting or renovating these accommodations must be borne by the municipalities themselves.
The responsibility changes from the County Council to the municipality and job centre.
Problem: There are free properties, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been very difficult for some time.
In fact, the administration does not find private dwellings.
It does not work so far, depending on private homes, says Deuschle.
Therefore, community housing needs to be rehabilitated, as it is so beautifully called.
So new containers will soon be installed in the Wasenstraße.
However, it is not done only with homes.
Perspective is the keyword, Regine Kunde and Annika Deuschle agree.
In addition to a permanent residence, there are internships, apprenticeships, school places, one-euro jobs and auxiliary activities for refugees and migrants that need to be found or set up.
"More places would be good," says Regine Kunde.
Many work in the building yard or help caretakers, do non-profit work - and that motivated and very neatly, as Annika Deuschle reports.
She hopes that work for the community will have a positive outward impact.
This is “no occupational therapy.”
Activity does not just mean work.
The day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer.
People need to develop a sense of belonging.
So it needs offers such as sports, contacts with locals and, above all, language courses.
Professional courses are rare.
So here, too, administration and volunteers are jumping in.
It is crucial that the refugees feel that they are welcome and welcome in Germany.
The length of the procedure is a problem.
They must explain to the refugees that it just takes time and that they can bridge the time in a meaningful way, for example with language courses.
Anyone who eventually develops the feeling that he can help no one in Urbach, is not allowed to work and is useless, he will never integrate.
The vast majority are motivated.
However, there are also problem cases, says the customer honestly, "People who can't do anything at all." The work of Deuschle and the customer is therefore always to motivate others.
All of this is a “mammoth task.”
A difficult question: are the two afraid of radicalisation, even in a small community like Urbach, after the recent events?
"No," says Regine Kunde very clearly, "what some might call naive." A residual risk can and does not want to exclude it.
However, the helpers are more aware of it.
These incidents are also a concern for refugees.
They would be afraid that the assassins would bring them into complete disrepute.
"They want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Kunde.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
So primary and volunteers on site and in the region must look for activities.
They always have in the background that a new thrust of refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.
Does Germany need an upper limit?
Politics is afraid to answer this question clearly.
In fact, it is unfair to put them on the ground.
"In Urbach we have not yet arrived where we wanted to go," says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees, that would relax the situation.
Regine Customer also makes it clear that the Urbachers are already busy integrating the previous people in a sensible way.
There are currently about 100 people, mostly young men.
But when people are in need, you have to help them, both women agree.
The political situation in the world is so complicated that there are no easy answers.
Schorndorf: Helicopter burglar wanted
The police helicopter flew off various areas for about an hour - unsuccessfully.
Two unknown men have forcibly entered an apartment in a multi-family house in the Lindenweg on Friday morning at about 8.50 p.m.
The inhabitant surprised the two and smashed the unhappy ones into flight.
The two men were about 1.65 to 1.70 meters tall, well-masked, both wearing blue jeans and black hooded sweaters.
They fled to the city centre.
The police used several patrol crews as well as a police helicopter to search.
The search was unsuccessful.
Possibly the unknowns noticed before the deed near the apartment or during their escape.
Baden-Württemberg: Police investigate after rocker attack on snack
After an attack on an Ulm snack, police are investigating six suspects from the rocker environment for serious land peace violations.
In the case of housing searches, evidence and drugs were secured, police said on Friday.
Around 20 masked men of a rocker-like group had, according to police, thrown bottles and stones against the window of a snack shop in July.
Afterwards, they attacked two guests and injured one slightly.
After that, they fled.
Damage of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10,000 was incurred at the snack bar and adjacent building.
According to the investigators, it is about a dispute in the Ulm rocker environment between a Kurdish and a Turkish gang.
