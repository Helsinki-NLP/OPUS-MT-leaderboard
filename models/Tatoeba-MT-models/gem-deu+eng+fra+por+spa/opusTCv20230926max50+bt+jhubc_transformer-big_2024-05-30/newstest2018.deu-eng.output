Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
A mad institution where young people are supposed to meet today.
A tomb chapel, where the S-Bahn tunnel is now being dug.
Small gardeners cultivate the former land of farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich reveals exciting stories.
It's annoying when maps aren't up-to-date.
Anyone who has had to get upset before knows this because the car navigation instead of a bypass showed a green meadow.
The historical maps of the digital Bavarian Atlas, an offer of the state government's geoportal Bavaria, are anything but current - but for this very reason very insightful.
Especially when you compare them with current online maps.
Then it becomes clear how cities and communities in the spreading area of Munich’s Mercury have changed since the 19th century.
The digital Bayern-Atlas is a patchwork that you do not immediately recognize as such.
More detailed maps, so-called original position sheets, were incorporated into the large overview map for cities and municipalities.
According to the Bavarian Surveying Administration, these originated between 1810 and 1864 and stem from the first survey of Bavaria.
Her client: Napoleon.
The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic reception of Bavaria - for military purposes of course.
Although the French troops finally withdrew with the Treaty of Lunéville of February 9, 1801: it was the present-day neighbors who created the idea of a comprehensive Bavarian map.
Elector Max IV Joseph pushed the project further, founding the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian Surveying Administration.
The original position sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and can be found on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.
The comparison between former and present is most impressive in the case of the state capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was incorporated as a district of Munich 21 years after the map was created, i.e. in 1877.
Today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.
The Untersendlings houses concentrate around 1856 along the present-day Plinganserstraße, which was not named until 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.
Where the Westpark is today, you can see nothing but fields - at first glance: When zooming in, a smaller-sized map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: hand-numbered plots of land from the so-called "url view", from which the property tax was derived.
Small parcels no longer occupy farmers there - but small gardeners of the "Land in the Sun" plant.
A large green area is emerging north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese, the site of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was actually still a meadow in the 19th century - and not a concrete desert.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the Urpositionsblatt you read in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen not only the street name "am Gasteig" or from the hill "Auf den Lüften" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt".
Yes, here on Auerfeldstraße people were once locked up with delusions.
In 1858/59 the Munich County Irrenanstalt "Auf der Auer Lüften" was established.
From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - that psychiatrist, who is related to the death of King Ludwig II.
"He was progressive for his time, for example, ending the chaining of the so-called madmen.
He has also forbidden staff to use force against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who has been working with the institution for an exhibition.
There was initially room for 280 patients, and later it was expanded to 500 seats.
At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haar in 1905.
Since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost has been located there, one of the largest psychiatrists in Germany.
On the site of the former Auer Anstalt, young people now meet in the Salesianum in Munich.
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training facilities.
To the west is the football field of TSV München Ost, to the east are residential buildings from the 1980s.
In 2015 the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built - architecturally based on the original building of the madhouse, which had been destroyed in bomb attacks during the Second World War.
The Marienplatz was listed as "Hauptplatz" around 1856, the Kaufingerstraße was called "Kaufinger Gasse".
The Second World War also brought a decisive change to the heart of Munich.
In December 1944, the Allied bombs tore many holes into the city centre.
A big one remained to this day - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small commercial buildings and a medieval tomb chapel once stood at Marienhof, where these days the preparatory work and on April 5, 2017 the groundbreaking for the second S-Bahn trunk line take place.
With the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill up the hole at Marienhof.
Civil Rights Group Releases Travel Warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Colored People has issued a warning for colored people who travel to Missouri due to the state’s discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which is scheduled to enter into force on August 28, 2017, calls on African-American travelers, visitors, and Missourians to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling through the state, as a number of questionable, race-based incidents are occurring lately throughout the state and are noted here," the group said in a statement.
A recently passed Missouri law that makes it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as state law enforcement agencies targeting minorities disproportionately, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, the NAACP said.
"They have violations of civil rights that people are passing by.
They’re being stopped because of their skin color, they’re being beaten up or killed,” Rod Chapel, president of the Missouri NAACP, told the Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints at such a frequency that we haven't heard yet."
It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a state in the United States.
The group cited incidents such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances earlier this year after he had run out of gasoline during his trip through the state and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
The Council also points to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General’s Office showing that black drivers in the state are arrested 75 percent more often than whites.
“The recommendation is that people be aware and inform their families, friends and co-workers about what might happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
"People need to be ready whether it brings bail or lets relatives know they're traveling through the state."
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI’s hate crime report program, which ranks the state in the country’s 16th rank in terms of the number of such injuries.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states passed immigration laws requiring local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for immigration violations, which the ACLU believes will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently stakeholder groups have deployed the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Meadow fence project is elementary
The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a successful project and will be continued next year.
CDU MPs Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have taken a picture on the spot.
At the right-grave court of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU-Ortsverband met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MPs.
Markus Schwendemann initially provided insights into his farm, where he cultivates 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, caters for 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and hosts holiday guests in five apartments.
The "Black Forest Milk" is for him the unalternative marketing route for the milk of his cows, Schwendemann said.
On the table of the holiday guests comes exclusively regional.
Since he is also BLHV chairman of Fischerbach, he described the grazing fence project as "elementally important".
I cannot profitably operate in such steep areas.
The grassland area requires a lot of work, a lot of work needs to be done with the Motorsense.
"We are struggling with the conditions and the topography here," Schwendemann stressed.
In 2003, he took over the parent farm and manages it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he does not run an organic farm.
Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear: "The municipality has recognized the importance of the grazing fence project and is happy about the Leader funding".
At costs of between 3,000 and 4,000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.
It is hoped that the reforestation of the areas could be extended for quite some time.
"The greatest treasure we have are the people who work in agriculture and are concerned about how they can continue their operations," the mayor said.
Farmers are often criticized for their
A total of 25 parcels of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 via the grazing fence promotion.
The open area is thus 40 hectares, which cannot be reforested until at least 2023.
Of the total costs of 71,500 euros, half was funded by Leader, a quarter was borne by the municipality of Fischerbach.
Thus, the farmers had left 12,610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of grazing fence.
"The big advantage is the longevity of the fences," Schwendemann explained.
Kordula Kovac stressed: "You do a really good job, you can't do it without farmers and rural women."
Peter Weiß also stated: "Best foods are produced here".
The Landscape Care Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the state to support pasture fences.
The goal is to keep the Black Forest open.
A prerequisite is the presence of a conveying backdrop designated by the LPR.
In addition, the area to be fenced must not be able to be handled by a tractor (hanging over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by reforestation.
For the Fischerbacher pasture fence project 2018, the application is currently underway by eight participants with 24 parcels, who want to build just under 16 kilometers of fence.
The open space corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>112,000.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Trump's White House now holds the Statue of Liberty
The safest sign of a regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
The Americans appreciate these as well as any other – hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein in Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the Trump regime’s key ideologists, certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe to the Statue of Liberty in a heated argument with CNN’s Jim Acosta over the president’s proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration.
To be fair, Miller did not attack the statue himself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty imitators would have lynched him if he had done so.
But he attacked their significance, and in particular the significance attributed to it when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus was added to its base in 1903, 17 years after the monument was completed.
When Miller scolded Acosta, "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem to which you refer, which was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller is factually right, but as he put it himself, it’s not really about history.
It is about the contemporary response to the upsetting words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state invites not only some old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tired, your poor, / your oppressed masses longing to breathe freely / the miserable apostasy of your rich coasts."
There has never been a time when the “miserable waste” was better seen on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism – he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump’s USA.
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural controversy: it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America.
Lazarus — and her friends who worked hard to put their words at the base after their deaths — knew very well that they were carrying out a highly political act.
The sculpture was intended to show the connections between French and American republicanism by depicting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical pictorial representation.
Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a completely different name: the mother of the exiles.
The connection between the poem and the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people of the right wing had long wanted to change this back.
The great screamer Rush Limbaugh, a sort of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not inviting anyone, but rather an early neoconservative who brings the American flame to the naked world: “Lady Liberty is moving forward.
It is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch should not light the way to the United States."
Pretty unusually, Limbaugh has come across something here.
The significance of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception.
The great act of imagination of Lazarus was to see it as it was seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.
In the truest sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear.
And that, of course, is not the perspective that Miller and Trump will ever want to acknowledge.
Their torch is not to illuminate the way, but to ignite the hatred, which is their only source of power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two Scots were part of the UK team
UK athletics performance director Neil Black says the 16-member Scottish contingent in the World Championship squad "will make a massive contribution to the team".
A record number of Scottish athletes were selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that “something special develops in Scotland” and the UK athletics needs to learn something from it.
"We welcome it, and we're trying to understand it, and we'll continue to do it until we find out," Black said.
“I’m talking to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they’ve done.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.
British Athletics: It has something to do with what they have done.
And also with the guy on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it’s absolutely brilliant.”
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal-candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle was elected team captain by the team.
"Eilidh is quite modest.
Her captain's speech was incredible," says Black.
"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, walked out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.
The passion and real feeling that Eilidh naturally brought in was great.”
The Commonwealth silver medalist, who will compete at her fifth World Championships at the 400m hurdles, says it’s “incredible” that there are 16 Scots in the British team.
Scotland's best total athletes so far were seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015.
Mid-distance runner Muir leads the way and set five British and two European records last year.
It will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m races.
Chris O’Hare, who runs 1,500 metres, is another Scotsman to watch after a great season that included victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first World Championships when the only other Scotsman on the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says she is "very proud" of the fact that many of her compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases will also be involved in the medals and in the finals.
"The special thing about being a team captain is that she was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and elected me makes it something very special for me," she added.
"Obviously, I am very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team.
It just shows how far we have come.
And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb podiums.
What about my speech as a captain?
Yeah, I think she went well.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a home world championship.
So it’s really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from being back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it’s just going to be such a great atmosphere out there.”
Blocking Critics Through Facebook: Don't Apply for a Public Office If You Can't Accept the Heat Up of Voters
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn’t take long for the newspapers to beat him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
He scolded the critics, of course.
But he did not silence his critics.
In 1783, Washington said, “Freedom of speech can be taken away—and, dumb and dumb, we are led like sheep to slaughter.”
That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.
Hogan’s employees have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for it earlier this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counter-reaction with "Well, and?" .
“It’s just Facebook,” many people said.
But it's important.
And it's especially important if it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is surprisingly popular.
He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.
Hogan is not a reactionary hothead.
He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to principles.
He was also very skilled in using Facebook as a primary means of connecting with his voters and playing to debut his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.
Therefore, blocking people who come to the governor’s side — which is a public forum called official and staff paid with public tax dollars — is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan’s spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor’s actions, arguing that blocking comments was nothing more than moderation.
But it’s too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people swinging the whip online.
The Post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are only real people who talk to their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, not trolls.
They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not profane.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked about hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the comment section of the news broadcast "The Post."
"I don't appreciate this idea either, if a number of people take a position on the same issue, then they are more likely to be disregarded by some as a so-called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."
What the governor’s staff called a “concentrated spam attack,” others would probably call “promoting.”
The Facebook era makes it easy to crop a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the past if you had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or arrest and silence protesters.
This is exactly what is happening digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for slandering Facebook and other social media sites.
President Trump is sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones on this issue fell in Virginia last week.
The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banished a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
At the time of Washington, the time of affordable postage had a similar effect to the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letterwriters responded to his leadership.
And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" all wrote letters to newspapers describing Washington's decisions.
Petitions criticizing his position on Amity’s contract, trade and shipping with the UK overwhelmed his office, according to historical documents collected from the George Washington Project’s online papers.
But he didn't silence her.
Freedom of speech, disagreement and discourse are the foundation of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort at Renaissance Club
Former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for home comfort in the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordire, who led the next-door left at Archerfield last year before losing to Paul Eales, is connected to the new venue and acts as the tournament ambassador on behalf of club founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I've seen the Renaissance club being built, and we're seeing him achieve his fame with this event," Rafferty said.
"The players will see this course from its best side, it is in great condition.
Jerry did a great job when he set up this place.
He is a zealous supporter of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great showcase for this course."
The Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, despite having won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"It feels really special," the Southport-based player said.
"I have not been able to defend the Extremadura Open since it was removed from the program the year after I won it.
Getting back to this part of the world is magical.
It is a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories of last year are coming back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate."
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday earlier this year, is returning to the action at home.
This event will be his first appearance in Scotland since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a bit more when you play at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
“You want to do well, but you also feel that extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf.
I’m happy about how it has gone so far.”
With the trio on the field, former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scotsmen on the field, the others being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.

Less lung cancer deaths from passive smoking
Over the past two decades, fewer and fewer people have died from lung cancer due to passive smoking.
Scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) have come to this conclusion in a study.
"We estimate that 167 lung cancer deaths per year are attributable to passive smoking," said study leader Heiko Becher.
As a comparison, he drew on his own study on this subject from 1994.
At the time, there were still 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking per year in Germany.
The study was published in the International Journal of Public Health.
House connections turn out to be very complex
The construction work in Villinger Straße is in full swing and "is somewhat in time," says the head of the building yard Fred Heinze.
In the area of house connections, the situation is more complicated than expected, since there is much hidden in the underground, which is not noted in the plans.
Traffic, which keeps hampering the construction work, is a major problem for the construction team of the company Stumpp.
"The ignorance of motorists before red traffic lights and barriers is already enormous," Heinze reports.
The road is closed and only the buses are allowed to pass through.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days were quite exhausting.
But fortunately we were supplied with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt,” says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and death in Indonesian Goldland
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
She rarely even uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai regentship in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually puts a sweet potato - locally referred to as "nota" - right into the fireplace.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is removed and swallowed with zealous, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also does her daily work, for example, washing clothes with cloudy water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a roofless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, no fields were assigned to her.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: most villagers are unemployed, and many drink heavily, and there are soldiers here.
"No one dares to walk around the village after 5 p.m.," she says.
It is a rare glimpse into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was taken up in Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum, when only 1,026 elders were to vote by a public hand in front of the occupation forces.
An existing movement that rose up for independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, which maintains control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers from it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea comprising the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as secluded as it is deserted. The trip includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital of Jayapura to Nabire and then a morning 5-hour car rental.
There is no public transport.
The town of about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and corrugated roofs converted by rust into various yellow-brown tones.
Very few Indonesians have made their trip here, let alone journalists and virtually no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes as well.
"We weren't used to wearing these clothes," says Degei, pointing to her lively hand-woven turban, her dark shirt, and her light skirt.
"In the past, we only had leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia’s poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia’s gold country.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is located just 60 miles from Paniai, a New Jersey-sized highland province with 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has timber resources worth an estimated $78 billion.
However, these riches are a source of misery for Papua, ensuring that Indonesia’s powerful military maintains a suffocating presence.
A 2005 investigation in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten this golden goose and are treated mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua tribal highlands in the 1970s became genocide, according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters last year.
“We will lose everything,” says a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, which includes reports of last year’s atrocities, such as unlawful executions and torture – rape and electric strikes are particularly popular, according to another report – and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations.
“It’s hard to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week,” said Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have increased as Papua’s resources bring in an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but demographics are changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese Warung canteens sell fried chicken and Gado-Gado, a mixed vegetable served with peanut sauce.
Local people are struggling to keep up here.
"Migrants have started selling chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than local Papua," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to the provincial capital, Jayapura, to work.
"It has cost the native Papua - the mom-mama [the women] of Papua - their market."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, promised to tackle inequalities and violations of rights in Papua during his 2014 election campaign.
The former carpenter secured 27 of the total 29 districts of Papua - including Paniai - on the way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta.
But in Papua little has changed, and today the locals feel cheated.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014, with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored," You said.
In fact, only two months after Jokowi's inauguration in October, Paniai suffered a low.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were singing Christmas songs in front of a campfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle.
The frightened children told them to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took offense at her sound and later came back with four soldiers, according to local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had drunk hunted and beat the group with their rifle pistons, victims and witnesses said.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
A child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was hit so hard that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
Approximately 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered at a football field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting bows and performed the Waita dance - running in circles and imitating a bird singing - of Papua's Mee Pago tribe.
Some protesters began throwing stones at police and military posts.
When the mood was heated, the soldiers were sent an order via an internal radio: "If the masses resist more than three times, they shoot them to death," says an official document from TIME that was not released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto district of Enarotali, saw the impending danger and called for calm and urged the crowd to return home.
No one was in the mood to listen.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist," he told TIME on the porch of his colourfully painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but says the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was crowded, many shots were fired," he adds.
The local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shootings.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was," said John, who, like many Indonesians, bears only one name, TIME in a gloomy mood.
"I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him."
Papua Police Chief Inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers were only “securing” her station because it was being attacked.
"We must defend ourselves if people threaten to kill us," Papua police spokesman Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
"It's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more injured.
The news of the killings did not come to Jakarta 'filtered' until the following day.
For three weeks, Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura, expressing sympathy for the families of the victims and vowing to address the historical abuses in Papua.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately so it won't happen in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was setting up an out-of-court mechanism to settle historical human rights violations.
But the excuses started almost immediately.
“Most of the injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to addressing these violations, but there are processes that need to go through," he said.
Then Wiranto made a withdrawal when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on June 5, saying he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "everything is regulated by law," he said.
Wiranto, accused by the UN of “crimes against humanity” that claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor’s bloody independence vote of 1999, said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been settled, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims accepted such allegations with grim disbelief.
"I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there's been no progress," says Jon.
“I am tired.”
He says that years later he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, I'm afraid of being shot."
His brother Yacobus reiterated the view that the people of Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After I buried the bodies, the military searched for me," he says.
The shootings have not stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniai’s neighborhood of Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to take an unconscious man to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who had drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
Excited villagers protested in front of the company’s location office.
Police said the villagers threw stones at officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) started shooting at the crowd and killed one.
"We were so panicked, we're afraid there will be revenge," says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly brought in here, according to TIME.
“I hid in my house for two days.”
The Deiyai parliament has called for the officers involved to be held accountable and withdraw the police's mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai has always been a source of unrest for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development reinforces the dissatisfaction of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes living in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the “Free Papua Movement” (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend Papua’s rights by launching sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders are from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in Paniai in recent years on the pretext of “securing national sovereignty.”
Some never show up again.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty increases dissatisfaction.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is also out of reach.
The people here grow everything they eat: especially notes and fruits and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the job of women, who can work four or five fields of sweet potatoes each.
They keep most of the harvest for the family, while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of note cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between the native Papuas and the new migrants who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new flight routes to Nabire Airport.
The few jobs available in the region usually go to the better-educated and wealthier migrants.
Papua rarely have the capital or skills to run their own businesses competitively.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council of Paniai.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, restrictions on international media coverage remain tense.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basile Longchamp were deported from Papua for lack of coordination with related institutions, although they were given the rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowi’s campaign to lift the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development have not been realized.
“There are new dangers to foreign journalists trying to report on Indonesia’s troubled easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa refusal and a blacklist,” he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread violations" in Papua including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir dismissed the group's allegations, saying to journalists in Jakarta: "Indonesia still has a democratic system, and there are free media, so it is difficult to cover up the evidence of human rights cases."
The people on the ground want more foreign governments to take note of this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, locals broke their silence and pressed him "We want freedom," according to a source who also attended the meeting but wants to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papua say they will probably not vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shootings," said Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military, are in poor education and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papuas, view their vote for Jokowi as a “debt” that he must repay.
“They don’t need money, they just want justice,” he says.
Despite the threats and intimidations, families of the Paniai shooting victims performed one last symbolic act of defiance: the body of a victim was buried on a site just opposite the police and military station.
They know that they may never get justice, but at least they do not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," says Yacobus with his head lowered.
"What else can we do?"
Fires Capture Dubai's 'Torch' Skyscraper for the Second Time
A fire took place in one of the world’s tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to flee from the 337-metre-high, 79-story building.
It is the second fire that sweeps through the high-rise building in just two years, which happens to be called the Torch Tower.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and there was no direct word on the cause of the flame.
"We slept and we got up at the fire alarm and screaming people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor,” a resident named George told Reuters.
Dubai’s civil protection authorities said firefighting units extinguished the fire around 4:00 a.m. local time (0:00 a.m. GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said it was working to provide shelter for those affected.
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation by the management of the torch building after its fire in 2015 found that most of the damage came from the cladding, the exterior cladding for decoration or insulation.
In the UK, police said they believe that the insulation and disguise system at London’s Grenfell Tower in June may have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire that killed about 80 people.
No Davis Cup Reform: Next Best-of-Five
The president of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) has failed with his major Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly.
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport to only play Davis Cup singles on two winning sets was not supported by the required two-thirds majority.
The often very long, but also very much appreciated five-set classics thus remain the traditional competition.
63.54 percent of the member states voted in favour of the reform, and the goal of ITF President David Haggerty was therefore narrowly missed.
"We respect this decision, but are disappointed that our member nations have not adopted the entire Davis Cup and Fed Cup reform package.
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historic competitions," Haggerty said.
We will continue to work to improve the applications.
After many objections, the proposal to hold the final in a neutral place had not even been put to the vote.
New from 2018 are only comparatively smaller details: For example, the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will in the following year have the host right in the first round.
In order to reduce the costs for the organizers, the requirements in terms of training pitches, etc. will be eased and players will have to complete less official media appointments before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 in 5 U.S. travelers put prohibited items on the plane, finds a survey
A survey of air passengers found that more than 20 percent smuggled consciously or unconsciously banned items past U.S. Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, including at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft while accidentally carrying banned knives or other items with blades.
Less than 1 percent said they had discovered late that they had travelled by mistake with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people – conducted by a jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc. – also found that younger travelers are more likely to disregard the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted to knowingly trying to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent were millennials, compared to less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X.
The most common items that were deliberately slid past TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 percent admitted to knowingly carrying objects with blades through security, while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents also confirmed that they had intentionally brought banned drugs into the plane.
The company said it surveyed travelers across the country to find out how many people accidentally brought smuggling goods through airport security and how many did it intentionally.
It’s no surprise that the people who are most likely to carry smuggling goods – knowingly or unknowingly – through security were the ones who fly the most often.
However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure of what liquids they are allowed to take with them or how much of them.
So it’s no surprise that the largest amount of items seized by the TSA are liquids forbidden.
For a while, people thought the TSA might see books as smuggling.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk: Tens of Thousands of Tesla Customers Cancel Order
Elon Musk is pleased to announce the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".
So far, he has concealed the fact that a part of the customers has already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the ever-triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk revealed for the first time in the announcement of the latest quarterly balance sheet a different, less glamorous figure: that of the cancellations on the new mass market model 3.
In recent months, Musk has often advertised with the more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery is just beginning.
Now Musk admits: out of a total of 518,000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are merely non-binding reservations.
In the event of a cancellation, Tesla will reimburse the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,000 (US$1,000 in the US and <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 in the UK) “reservation deposit” in full.
There are currently 455,000 such non-binding reservations, Musk admitted in a conference call with analysts.
However, the Tesla CEO does not believe that the cancellation of around 12% of all orders so far could become a problem.
His argument: The challenge of the ambitious growth targets lies not in demand, but on the production side.
Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018, it is expected to be 500,000 – all models combined – and one million in 2020.
The demand for this is obviously there.
According to Musk, there are currently 1800 reservations per day.
Those who order a "Model 3" today can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new, never tested in practice production lines without major interruptions with maximum utilization.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
However, if there are major delays, then the non-binding nature of the reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from running away in crowds.
EPA Chief Pruitt Withdraws Due to Delaying Obama-era Emissions Reduction Rules
One day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, withdrew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of Obama-era rules to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental agencies than previous administrations.
He did not mention the lawsuit brought against his previous position in a federal court of appeal.
It is about a deadline that expired on October 1 for states to comply with the 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by one year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "interfering in local decisions or hindering economic growth."
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma’s prosecutor before he was appointed by President Donald Trump, has long been a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that the chemical and fossil fuel industries oppose.
Wednesday’s sudden reversal is the latest legal setback for Pruitt’s regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator had exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of an Obama administration rule that required oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that his reversal of ozone standards simply reinforces the EPO’s willingness to cooperate with states through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards.
"Under previous administrations, the EPA often failed to meet deadlines for execution and then waited to be charged by activist groups and others, and in an agreement set the deadline for execution," Pruitt said, who sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.
"We don't believe in regulation through court proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and the authority that it gives us seriously."
However, the EPO’s statement said Pruitt will eventually use his “authority to delay and all other legally available powers” to ensure that the regulations “are based on sound policies and the best available information.”
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader revision of the ozone rules.
A bill approved last month aims to delay implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who headed the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group intends to maintain legal pressure.
“The reversal of the EPA — according to our complaints — is an important benefit to the health and safety of those 6.7 million New Yorkers and the over 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog flowing into their communities,” Schneiderman said.
New York joined in this case California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Soil ozone is created when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The emerging smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people, and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health officials and environmentalists cheered on Pruitt’s surprising change of course.
"It's worrying how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step from the air protection officer we're inhaling," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight the ideological crusade of the Trump administration to offer itself to polluters and their special interests."
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 years of St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche, a serenade will be held at the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16, at 4.30 p.m.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the sixth charity serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The rescuing and preservation of the oldest building in the town have made Tumlingen’s friends and supporters their concern.
Walter Martini emphasizes: "It is a unique village jewel".
In 1267, the St. Hilarius Chapel was mentioned for the first time in the Württemberg document book: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church in Tumlingen and the Vogtei" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 marks of silver.
According to the document, on Tumlinger Berg, in addition to the former parish church, there was also a stately court, to which the church or the right of patronage belonged and not vice versa.
There were also people living there.
As can be seen from the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt from 1858, next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which can be seen today in the townscape of Tumlingen, the "mountain" was the third, the noble settlement core of the village.
Old maps from around the year 1600 underpin these historical facts.
Patronate law originated from early medieval ecclesiastical law.
A gentleman who built a church, equipped it and occupied it with a pastor continued to own it and could inherit it.
This included the right to appoint a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The larger of the two burst on Christmas 1673.
The newly purchased bell sounded for the first time in 1692, but had to be delivered later in World War II in 1942.
During the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648), the windows were broken and the bell ropes stolen.
The roof was leaking.
In 1796, French troops camped near the church.
They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.
Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823 the cemetery was enlarged and the church of Hilarius was demolished.
Only the church tower was left standing.
On New Year's Eve 1834, a storm split the church tower and half of it collapsed.
To prevent an accident, the tower was demolished.
Only the tower dwarf, which still exists today, was preserved as a witness to the 750-year-old history of the church.
Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem of the "Schaffigen Rentnern" (Slave Pensioners) are the successors of Dieter Dockhorn and maintain the Hilarius plant.
As organizers, the friends and supporters of Tumlingen invite you to the sixth serenade on the old cemetery of St. Hilarius Chapel on Sunday, 16 July.
It is designed by the combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with words by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Local manager Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.
The program starts at 4.30 p.m.
Admission is from 3:30 p.m.
At the end of the serenade, a drink takes place in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows to the forest," the organizers highlight the fantastic views.
The serenade takes place only in dry weather.
The organizers hope for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hilarius facility, which is important for Tumlingen and Hörschweiler.
Tumlingen’s friends and supporters feel particularly committed to home care, as Serenade organizer Walter Martini reaffirms.
Association wants to have approval of wind turbines examined
"Boisheim defends itself" does not see a legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the Landrat.
The association "Boisheim resists" has asked Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.
It was unlawful.
The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016, no wind turbines could have been approved at Boisheimer Nette, since at the time in Viersen only a wind power concentration zone existed at the city border to Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes an exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the urban area.
These zones are intended to prevent the "sparge" of the landscape.
Although the city of Viersen had decided a few days earlier on a change to the land use plan, a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette - but this had not been approved by the district government of Düsseldorf, due to a form error.
"Due to the lack of planning requirements, the granted permit is still illegal and therefore can be withdrawn," said Christoph Erkens, chairman of Boisheim.
Current state of affairs: The city council has once again decided on the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette before the summer break; approval by the district government is still pending.
Erkens: "At this point, the granting of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is excluded under planning law".
The circle confirms the receipt of the call.
"The corresponding letters have been received by the district of Viersen since last week," a spokesperson said.
The circle takes them as an occasion to re-examine the matter.
However, they are not likely to result in the procedure being stopped.
With regard to ongoing proceedings before the administrative court, the district did not want to comment on the content of the argument of the association "Boisheim wehrt sich" on Thursday.
NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, is planning the construction of four wind turbines each 200 meters high on an area at Boisheimer Nette.
Already last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved, had leased contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land.
With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity needs of around 11,400 households will be covered - which corresponds to around a fifth of the electricity needs of all four-story households.
The NEW Re plans to invest around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 million.
Last summer, Viersen’s city council gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich wind farm near Aachen as well as a participation in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in the Heinsberg district.
Car and Tractor Crack Together: Woman Dies in Horrible Accident
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at about 10 a.m. on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Kreis).
A woman was fatally injured.
Two other people were slightly injured.
The road was closed for hours.
According to police reports, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich took her car with her 53-year-old mother as an accompanying person on the L 333 in the direction of Bogel.
City and merchants plan "home shopping" weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are expected to rediscover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September.
The trade association and the city administration want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 to attract residents to shopping in the city center.
As the chairman of the trade association, Christian König, announced, the "home shopping" weekend is intended to raise the awareness of customers about what offers their own city offers, apart from the usual supermarket goods.
Accordingly, a market with regional suppliers is planned, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, local companies should present themselves with their training places.
In addition, the shops of the city centre are supposed to invite you to "midnight shopping".
The action is aimed not only at residents of the city and the surrounding region.
In preparation are commercials on the radio, an internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend, according to Christian König.
The city administration and trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
Thus, the trade association and the city go into another stage of the project "Attractive downtown".
These include new offers such as the first "active day" for the fountain festival with a Sunday open for sale, discussions with all traders and hosts to encourage them to participate actively.
Attractive offers on Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on this day are also part of the concept.
In addition, customer potential should be re-exploited or re-exploited.
This includes spa guests and tourists.
But also many locals would have lost sight of the city center while shopping.
In the end, everyone would have to contribute to revitalizing the city center - to landlords, the businesses of the whole city, and clubs.
It was necessary to use a network to overcome the lethargy that had spread in part, King had said in the spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK-Center in Mühlhausen, announced that five Thuringian cities were participating for the first time in the third nationwide "home shopping" day.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day should "promote the appreciation of local trade and highlight its importance for the common good of our cities," said Streich.
The action led by the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that each citizen can influence his or her own direct environment with his or her buying behaviour.
Two dead and several injured after explosion at US school
During construction work, there was a gas explosion in the school building.
New people were injured.
In a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Minneapolis, two people have been killed and nine others injured, some of them severely.
According to the fire department, on Wednesday (local time) one injured person was still in critical condition.
One person died when part of a school building collapsed in the explosion.
A missing person was later also found dead.
The dead were employees of the school.
As the cause of the accident, the authorities suspected working on a gas pipeline.
During the holiday season, only a few people stayed in the Minnehaha Academy building.
Trump put pressure on Mexico after leaked transcripts of phone calls over payment of border wall
Transcripts of phone calls between U.S. President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump called on Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop publicly saying he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The US president insulted him for publicly denounced the wall and reportedly told him, "You can't tell the press."
Trump started his presidential campaign with a promise to build a wall on the southern border of the United States, and vowed to let Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also released, revealing a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the U.S. to take over refugees who immigrated to Australia was “ridiculous”, “mis” and “stupid” and that insistence on the trade mediated by the Obama administration would make him look like a “deep” after he proposed a ban on the relocation of refugees to the U.S.
Mr. Trump ended the call after saying to Mr. Turnbull, “This is the most unpleasant call for the whole day.”
Moore's Ford Massacre: Activists Resume Racist Lynch Act as Call for Justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rumbled toward Moore's Ford Bridge.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns emerged to block his way.
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a needle-stripe suit - took a long train by his cigar and looked through the windshield in a scrutiny.
Inside, the inmates were afraid.
"We want this n ---- r Roger!" shouted the man.
“Get him out of the car!”
Screams tore the silence when a young black man was pulled from the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this horrific scene played on July 22nd is just a remake.
But when a sling is thrown around the neck of "Roger", almost everyone in the audience throws out very real sighs.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have been returning to Moore's Ford Bridge to mimic the night two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with the murders.
"It's really unbelievable that not a single person has been arrested in all these years -- even though we see them in our communities, even though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the remake.
“It’s a dirt spot on a story, but it’s a burden on our souls.”
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgia state congressman and a lifelong civil rights activist.
For him, the remake serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want law enforcement, we want the end, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice," he said.
"We cannot reach healing and reconciliation until we receive justice."
A forensic surgeon puts a sheet over the body of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford Lynn on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files received from NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching process.
But no one was ever charged.
Although the suspects have been on the loose for decades, civil rights activists say the dual motivation for the Lynch actions throughout the city has always been known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a decision of the Supreme Court allowed the black citizens of Georgia to vote for the first time in the summer pre-election campaign.
At about the same time as the election, according to the FBI, black farmer Roger Malcom stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight - allegedly because of a woman.
Brooks said the rumor in the city was that Hester had slept with Malcom's wife Dorothy and that the baby she was carrying was not from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to free Malcom from prison, according to the FBI.
He was accompanied to prison by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But then as they moved away from the prison and approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a lynch mob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders," an FBI report concludes.
"It is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement that was not only involved in the murders, cleared evidence, and concealed the identity of witnesses."
Brooks puts it even more concisely.
"It was a suffrage massacre," he said.
They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: “If you register and if you vote, this will happen to you.”
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene led the annual remake of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders.
Their portrayal is vivid, poignant, and is grounded in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America.
It’s hard to watch, and even harder to look away, but Greene said that’s the point.
"We don't want to talk about lynching because then we will be confronted with its ugliness in all of us," she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or not want to hear what I've been through."
The rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day, nearly 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest blacks - crowded into a room and listened as Greene started a well-recorded overview of the piece.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene’s co-director.
He has played the role of chief clan member for years, but he said the role will never be easier.
“I feel dirty because I’m not that way,” Marbaugh said.
"But I think it's very important to keep this story alive because we don't want to go back to those times."
On the other side of the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines.
The play begins with Malcom screaming at Hester and harassing him, angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n --- he, get out of my property!"
Rascona responds to the fire.
There's a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) bursts into laughter.
Greene laughs the loudest.
"What?!" asked Rascona.
He is alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," said Greene, still laughing.
"I just don't think white people at the time said a --- he."
"Yes," joked one of the other black actors.
"You just have to hit the hard 'R.'."
And that’s where the energy in the room shifts, a sense of camaraderie replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, he says it sharply and emphatically.
Absolutely nobody laughs.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There are screams, shots and then silence.
A woman dressed in a mourning gown stands over the actor's body and performs Billie Holiday's grieving eloquence "Strange Fruit."
Her voice breaks every second word.
About a hundred meters behind, a group of about four dozen spectators wipes sweat and tears from their eyes.
The audience is divided almost evenly between black and white.
A couple has traveled from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many just coming down the street.
They have all experienced Georgia’s oppressive moisture for almost eight hours as Brooks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tombs of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
Up to this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, standing in the same country where the Lynch murders took place, the air feels ghostly.
When the last notes of the song end, Greene invites the crowd to get closer and inspect the body.
Children squat on their heads, register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whisper to each other.
"You're not really dead," murmurs a little boy as if he wanted to remember.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw away the lynching rope and wipe away their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona hugs two of his co-stars and then breaks down in her arms crying, the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through at him.
“It’s okay,” one of the women whispered.
“We know that’s not in your heart.
You did it for a reason.”
Later, the audience sits down with the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta chats excitedly about recreation with a black couple they have just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words that left the performance feeling.
“It’s hard to hear these horrible words and deeds... coming from people who look like you and who do because they look like you,” she said.
“What that really does to me makes me believe that lynching is still going on,” she added, “today it’s just called police shooting.”
In the same room, Tyrone holds Brooks' yard at his table, eating and reminiscent of civil rights.
He said he had already begun planning the performance next year.
"The remake is in a way inspiring, because it describes the horror of what we have endured, but it is also a moment of learning," he said.
“If we don’t learn from it, it can happen again.
Those who do not study their own history, those who do not know their own history, are condemned to repeat it."
"Götterdämmerung" reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
Also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner’s monumental work, director Frank Castorf relies on a colorful and frivolous staging in front of a gigantic, six-storey backdrop.
The rotating stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) shows a shabby street corner with a wall remnant and Dönerbude in Berlin, a "plastic and elaste" logo from the GDR era or the New York Stock Exchange.
In front of it parks an open Mercedes oldtimer, in which the Rhine daughters pose as rocker girls, or alternatively an Isetta.
Stacked oil barrels are reminiscent of Castorf's leitmotiv - money, power and greed - which runs through his "ring" staging.
The three Rhine daughters - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize wonderfully as in the "Rheingold".
Kess seduces them with Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), drags a corpse into the trunk in a Hollywood-style manner and gives the Krawallo clique.
Stephen Milling sings the wonderfully nasty garden that surrounds the aura of a heavyweight boxer.
Brutal the scene when he kills Siegfried.
Later, Gunther (Markus Eiche) must also believe in it.
The audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause.
Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski, who humbles himself and bends his hands to the Merkel robbery, are celebrated stormily.
There is great applause for the festival orchestra, which shows up on stage for the first time - again in casual casual clothes in the face of the great heat.
The performance of Frank Castorf and his directing team was highly anticipated.
Five years later, when he had yet to go through a valid whistle concert in 2013, there was great cheer in which the occasional "buh" shouts went down.
Festival director Katharina Wagner should have been delighted.
"You notice that the audience has grown together with the 'ring' in a way," she had said shortly before the performance of the dpa.
The audience had not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but it had also grown an understanding of his view.
I'm going to draw a positive conclusion.
Max Menge works as a volunteer
They work in several places during their volunteer year.
Where everywhere?
Quantity: Usually in Steinfurt in the furniture exchange, once a week I help out here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
I also worked at the school all day.
What are your experiences with this?
Amount: It is a beautiful, wide spectrum that I see here.
I deal with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
You are now 26 years old, so you are a late volunteer.
Why is that?
Quantity: I graduated from high school.
And then a civil engineering degree, let's say, successfully cancelled.
I realized to myself that it is the wrong thing for me and I want to do something different, work with people.
And then I wondered what you're doing.
Make a social year, there is an insight, there you can see how it really is on the spot, perhaps in the focus.
And was it so?
Amount: I have collected great impressions.
I will start my studies in social care in the winter semester.
I will study dual, probably take a social worker training at the Herne Youth Office and study at the University of Applied Sciences in Hamm.
Isn’t it a bit unusual to have several different locations during voluntary service?
Quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
It always depends on where you make your FSJ.
You can do it from retirement homes to youth work - in all possible facets of social work.
With me it was very varied.
I was also partly in the OGS, so in the afternoon care.
For me, that was exactly what irritated me.
I could see my own strengths and see how it really went.
Unlike in civil engineering studies?
Quantity: Of course, this is not about calculating statics.
You always have other people in your head, each with a completely different story behind them.
Whether a refugee, or a young person who has been taken out of the family - you always have to deal with it individually.
Very interesting.
And you didn't have any fears of touch?
Amount: I'm not the type for that.
It’s an area that gives you a lot.
Lots of love, lots of kindness.
There are negative moments, but that’s how life is.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts dividend to revive business
British education group Pearson said on Friday it will cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 percent as another restructuring program is launched to overcome the pressures the company faces.
The job cuts, which Director General John Fallon announced mainly for the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019, are in addition to his previous restructuring, which already lost 4,000 jobs.
Pearson announced an additional <0xC2><0xA3>300 million (394 million) cost reduction plan in May in a third cost reduction program to revive a business that was hit by the rapid move to digital learning.
The company, which sold its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann last month, said the outlook for the fiscal year remained unchanged after a 1 percent increase to <0xC2><0xA3>2.05 billion in the first half of the year.
Kabul convoy attack: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing a NATO soldier and injuring several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, NATO said in a statement.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians also died in the incident in the Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the last act of violence in Afghanistan this month – on Tuesday, more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
In a statement, NATO said the explosion occurred on Thursday evening when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "person-carried improvised explosive device".
The statement says that all the injured are in stable condition and are being treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram airfield.
Correspondents say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major concern for NATO troops in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which about 20% in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they carried out this attack.
On May 31, a massive bombing in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the country's deadliest militant attack since US-led troops ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as U.S. President Donald Trump weighs in on increasing the number of U.S. troops supporting the military and police in the country.
Correspondents say that the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reverses decision to delay smog rule after lawsuits
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has repealed a decision to delay a regulation by the Obama administration requiring states to curb smog-causing emissions a day after 15 states sued the agency for the move.
The EPO announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so-called “2015 ozone regulations” and said it demonstrates the agency’s commitment to cooperate with states.
"We believe in dialogue with and in responding to our state partners," EPA chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt announced in June the EPA’s intention to delay ozone regulations — which will measure pollutant emissions in a part of the country to determine where cuts need to be made to meet stricter air quality standards — by one year until October 2018.
A group of 15 mostly democratic states, along with the district of Colombia, filed a lawsuit on Tuesday, saying the effort was illegal.
The administration of President Donald Trump has attempted to reduce a wide range of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda to boost economic growth, according to Trump.
However, the efforts have triggered the backlash of Democrats and conservation groups who are concerned about the impact of larger emissions on public health.
The EPA website says that inhaling air containing ozone can “reduce lung function and amplify respiratory symptoms” such as asthma.
City Council wants a common room
In the end, the decision was clear: In two votes against, the municipal council of Fluorn-Winzeln decides to set up a common area in the future senior residential complex.
Before the discussion, there is an important information: The purchase contract for the still missing part of the land is signed, Mayor Bernhard Tjaden reports.
Although it will still take time for the area previously owned by the church community to become municipally owned, there is no longer a planning obstacle for the project to be funded by a private investor.
There is a discussion about a common area.
One of the two investors who are still on the boat has offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor, it would provide a living space - around 55 square meters - and an adjoining terrace with 70 square meters of space for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipal council plan to provide such a common space not just as a meeting place for the residents of the elderly housing, but openly into the community.
As an example, the word "knit café" made the round.
The decision, which was pre-determined by the provision of funds for the current budget as early as last autumn, will be sweetened by funding opportunities.
The building is in the refurbishment area.
The creation of a community area would be eligible, according to Tjaden, with 60 per cent of 30 per cent.
In order to signal the investor that they do not want to throw a stick between his legs in this respect, the proposal for a decision provides that both saddle - which is based on the surrounding construction - and desk roof - which reduces the tread height and makes the construction more economical - would be possible.
Unnecessary, says not only Wilfried Sohmer, be this addition.
If it helps: He unanimously passes the board.
It’s not that easy in the common room.
Daniela Ruf refers to the many buildings of her own, with which one does not get very well, but now leaning out of the window at the common room, she says: "I'm doing a hard job with it".
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely in favour of the common area - but absolutely against municipal participation.
It sees behind it a covert subsidy to already wealthy or even foreign investors.
This is not the case, for the acquisition of the land does not grant a subsidy, but gets a real counter-value, which can be marketed in case of doubt, is the counter-reference.
Mr Staiger's proposal to split the proposal accordingly is supported by three votes in favour.
With two votes against the original programme, which Stefan Haller summarizes as follows: "If we make the decision in this way, we are taking a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure".
Collision with car: cyclist thrown on road
While crossing the road, an 82-year-old cyclist was caught by a car and seriously injured on Wednesday in Garath.
According to the police, the 82-year-old Langenfelder came from Hilden at 12.20 p.m. with his bicycle on the bike path of the Schwarzer Weg road.
The senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the road Am Buchholzer Busch.
A driver driving in the same direction gave him priority.
When the Langenfelder drove onto the road, however, he apparently did not pay attention to the opposite traffic.
He stumbled upon a car that drove a 66-year-old Hildener.
The man was thrown into the street.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to a hospital in a Rettugnswagen.
FC Bayern Munich face Borussia Dortmund in the Supercup against David Alaba and Thiago
The Supercup takes place without him: David Alaba has to stop the game against Dortmund.
With personal concerns, FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory game of the new season.
Seven professionals are missing from the title defender in the Supercup against the cup winner.
The personal worries of German football record champion Bayern Munich are getting bigger and bigger before the Supercup on Saturday (20.30 a.m. / ZDF and Eurosport) at cup winner Borussia Dortmund.
Coach Carlo Ancelotti also has to give up David Alaba in the duel with the BVB.
This was confirmed by the Italians on Friday.
In addition, the Munichers Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are missing.
For the five defeats in the past six Test matches, Ancelotti has blamed the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team.
"We know we're not in the best physical condition," Ancelotti said, adding, "The most important point is the balance in the team.
It wasn't good at the last minute."
However, the 58-year-old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory game of the season.
"Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team will show these qualities.
The crew is ready.
We want to play intelligently," Ancelotti said, expecting a "difficult, intense game."
The duel of the two German football heavyweights draws the fans into their spell.
The game has sold out with 81,360 spectators, the German Football League (DFL) announced on Friday.
Hiking from star to star in the resin
In the Harz, the first "star path" is to be created nationwide.
This is planned by the association Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg.
There is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "star path" meets the information needs of many resin visitors, it was said.
It combines nature, science, exercise and athletic performance.
The members want to put up boards along the planned route and inform about stars and constellations.
In a first phase until 2018, the association plans "easily accessible installations in five to six locations" in the Upper Harz region.
In question are St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber.
The information on the boards should be supplemented via the Internet.
That is why a good mobile network reception plays a role in the location selection.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later, the star path will be expanded from train to train.
"On the star path, the viewers learn a lot about the physics of the individual stars," the association explained.
They also learned why stars have different colors or why one star shines more brightly than another, even though it is farther away.
It also shows which constellation a selected star is in and when it can best be seen.
The association has been operating the highest observatory in northern Germany since 2014 in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg.
The location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany, according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation.
From there, the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy can often be clearly seen with the naked eye.
At the initiative of the Förderverein Planetarium Göttingen, there has been something similar to the planned Sternwerg - the planetary path - in the university town since 2003.
Starting in front of Gebhard's hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planetary path with its steles leads up to the Hainberg and the observatory - as well as an "extraterrestrial" location in Diemarden (parish of Equals) with the planet Sedna.
The steles with the individual planets - including the degraded Pluto at the end - are positioned exactly at a distance and scale of one to two billion.
The Earth thus shrinks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter, while the exactly 75 meters away sun measures 70 centimeters.
The total distance of the planetary path is about four kilometers.
While the light from the Sun to Pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to reach the stele with Pluto.
So pedestrians are faster than the light in space.
The march to the next fixed star, however, would take another half year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discussing a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing fight in the near future under 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at ESPN offices in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion, went down the hallway to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization’s super featherweight champion.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision over former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both fighters are members of the top five pound-for-pound list.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "How are you, champion?
I wish you good luck."
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ESPN.
As the pair posed for photos, Lomachenko’s manager Egis Klimas noted that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the “perfect order of magnitude.”
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia recalled.
"I've climbed for Broner [to 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to get down to lightweight.
And he has to move on lightweight [135 lbs] and then we fight.
That’s what fans demand.
Let's give them that."
Lomachenko agreed.
“Boxing needs that fight.”
Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy that Lomachenko will have to fight with a 135-pound debut this year to agree a date with Garcia next summer (37-0, 30 knockouts) that also has interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title fight in the forum on September 23.
"This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all the fans have asked for it," Garcia said, later expressing himself openly fighting with the network that offers the best financial package.
We're the best.
No other name can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever you're ready..."
Garcia said he valued Lomachenko as "an enormous fighter," and he may be participating in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko stopped at the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thinks the tri-match champion from Riverside looks "very slow, I'm sorry Mikey ... you wanted the co-off".
Garcia said the focus was on showing punch strength, then boxing.
Both said they could feel the momentum that was building up for their own struggle.
“This is the fight that needs to be fought.
No other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I'm more than happy to work on it," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the top fighters, and that's Mikey.
It will be a great fight.”
Four injuries after tire breaker
In an accident on the A7, four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon.
According to initial information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle at about 4.30 p.m. shortly before the junction point Marktbreit, probably after a tire breaker.
The car threw to the right into the slope, where it slammed over and then lay on the roof in the green strip.
The four inmates - two adults and two children - were partly seriously injured in the accident.
During the first care of the injured by the rescue service, the A7 was blocked towards the north for about an hour, after which the traffic on the left lane could be directed past the accident site.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Three chains work better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes that the optimisation of the defensive formation in Aue will score points after the 2:2 start of the season against Braunschweig.
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first game of the season, and with the result had it not been for the two goals against Braunschweig at 2:2.
"That was two goals too much, and we have to be even more careful in Aue," says Fortuna Düsseldorf defender.
In the Ore Mountains, the triangle chain is also to be further optimized.
And a goal after a free kick, the fortunes don't want to catch themselves anymore.
"For the future, it will be that no one will be on the line alongside Michael (Rensing).
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will cope better with the three-way chain, even after the experience in the preparation, than with the four-way chain.
"I don't know yet how we will act in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his case, "because we have players in the three-way chain on the half positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann who can build well," said Hoffmann.
"The prerequisite is, however, that we harmonize even better and that we don't afford so many playback errors in the build-up."
Of course, Hoffmann also goes to Aue to win the game.
"But if you can talk about a failed start after a draw, I don't know.
The performance could be okay," Hoffmann said.
"But if we can stand with four points on Sunday and focus on the trophy, we will certainly be able to talk about a proper start to the season."
His coach didn’t want to know about it.
"I don't judge the start of the season until after six to eight days of play," said Friedhelm Funkel, who doesn't want to talk about an advantage over Aue, just because the Saxon's game in Heidenheim had to be cancelled prematurely due to a storm.
"Now they can start the season pretty much with a home game," Funkel and Hoffmann said, believing that the players from Aue might even be a little fresher because they don't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a rise favorite in the bones.
"But they don't know 100 percent where they are at the moment," Fortuna's central defender said.
Although the guests from the Rhineland go to the meeting at the finally (almost) finished stadium of Aue on Sunday as an easy favorite.
"That we sweep them away just because we have the claim to get under the first six is nonsense," says Funkel, whose record in just one defeat against Aue out of nine games is quite positive.
"There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that you have to beat from the start," explains Fortuna's head coach.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant."
And so Funkel does not want to experience his players on Sunday.
New Results of Swedish Asylum Age Assessment Tests Published
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, who have undergone a new method of medically assessing their age, show that more than 80 percent of the people tested are over 18 years of age. But not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Forensic Medicine Authority (Rättsmedicinalverket) has started conducting the tests last year.
During the asylum procedure, they should make the assessment of the age more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were underage.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were assessed as 18 or older, while in a further 25 cases, the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "possibly 18 years of age or older."
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person "may be under 18 years of age."
The tests are only performed in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistent over the past few months.
"We don't see a big difference in the statistics of the past few months, the numbers are pretty constant," he told The Local magazine.
The high proportion of cases in which the person has been assessed as over 18 does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied about his age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests, saying that there are 442 cases that “suggest that the person examined is 18 years of age or older.”
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, it found that in 243 of these cases, the person had said openly that she would be 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age assessment, in which X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRIs of knee joints are taken, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticized in some areas.
A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work involves assessing the biological maturity of humans to see if they passed through puberty earlier or later than usual.
"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think the type of measurement should be used.
Judging the biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say it for sure, we shouldn't pretend we can," he told the Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of misjudging a child as an adult is low.
The biggest risk is if the person is just under 18, in this case this is about 10 percent."
Fully in the Plan
Work on the three bridges on Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well.
On Wednesday, a seven-ton concrete section was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"We are very good at the time, it's going great," says Reinhold Leicht, construction manager at the Department of Roads and Transport in the Government Bureau of Freiburg.
In April, work began simultaneously on all three bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
The end of construction is scheduled for October and it is easy to be sure that the schedule will be met.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a vaulted arched bridge of concrete, covered with red coloured sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has come in years.
In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three structures are now being thoroughly renovated.
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They are made of red coloured sandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, or 10.60 meters long.
The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach has now received a 1.30 meter wide and seven tons heavy so-called bridge cap on the north side on Wednesday morning.
This is an edge fastener, which is also used as an operating path.
A 2.20-metre-wide bridge cap will be installed on the southern part of the bridge on Friday.
Then the pedestrian path should run on it.
The special thing about this is that they are prefabricated parts, a patent of the Schramberg company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.
The laying of pipes through the building in Lauterbach required a special sense of touch.
Because there is also a fiber optic cable, to which many companies are connected.
The local residents were informed about the project in advance of the work by handbook.
In addition, fish and crabs had to be fished first.
For the bridges between the building building and the collector's quarters in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is regulated by a single-lane traffic light.
For the construction work at the bridge at the Lauterbach entrance, the road in the area of the bridge at the level of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden" is completely closed.
The cost of the three bridge refurbishments together amounts to 700,000 euros.
The whole thing is funded by the country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Colorful protest at German potato salad
It is not so often that parties pull together, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, which is otherwise difficult to bring under one hat.
The parties represented in the Kreistag Vulkaneifel (CDU, SPD, Greens, FDP, FWG, Left) belong to a broad alliance that on this day peacefully flags, because the AfD in Gerolstein Stadthalle Rondell invites to the "big election campaign start" according to the poster.
And brings well-known names to the start - such as Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland forms the top duo for the Bundestag elections on September 24, and the deputy federal president Beatrix von Storch.
But those who are already on site hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the AfD learners, but to demonstrate.
The motto "The Eifel remains colourful".
Originally the city picnic was planned under the motto "All at one table" on the Brunnenplatz, but now takes place in the parking lot below the roundabout - and thus directly in front of those who come to the AfD event in the Stadthalle.
A colorful picture that offers.
And what Christa Karoli, chair of Forums Ein Welt and one of the leading organizers, really delights: "Great how many people have gathered here".
There is music and plenty of food, including an "original German potato salad that the AfD could easily eat," says the woman who brought him.
The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein, they show presence especially at the station, which is only a few meters from the venues.
How did the AfD come to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes from the AfD Vulkaneifel reports that he tried to organise such an event and was awarded the contract.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had initially asked in Daun, but received a rejection there, because because of the already built Laurentiuskirmes there were not enough parking spaces available.
So now the Rondell, Hompes is delighted that "we can have such a nice event here".
Looking at the event in the front square of the Rondell, he says: "This is the good right of the people, the main thing, it remains peaceful".
At around 8 p.m., a band will provide entertainment on the Rondell foreground, and several speakers in the Stadthalle, including the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD chairman Uwe Junge.
There are about 200 listeners in the hall waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election, Alice Weidel, and the deputy federal president Beatrix von Storch to give their speeches.
The police presence is unchanged, but so far the officers had a quiet evening.
The AfD event lasts a little more than an hour, the guests in the forecourt have a longer breath, but there is also a need to clean up shortly after 9 p.m.
The police can move off - no special incidents.
Trumpet Meets Trumpet
A rehearsal with the Wolfacher trombonist Frederic Belli will be held in the Haslacher Klosterkonzerte series tomorrow, Sunday, at 8 p.m. in the Klosterkirche.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpet player Miroslav Petkov, he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets the Black Forest", or "Balkan folklore" meets a classical German education with roots in wind music.
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and hold solo positions in top European orchestras.
Petkov is solo trumpeter at the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is solo soprano of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both combine the desire not only to cross the boundaries of their instruments, but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres.
Thus Johann Sebastian Bach sounds in the two like in a new robe, Daniel Schnyder's "World Music" combines with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" by jazz echo award winner Nils Wogram, classical music, jazz and free play mix into a fascinating overall work of art.
This core piece of the programme was first premiered in Freiburg this spring with huge success.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it specifically for the two musicians and more: The Haslacher Klosterkirche with its special acoustics is consciously included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
“Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives.
But I want to try everything," Kristen Stewart said openly about her bisexuality.
"When I bite in grilled cheese, I think, 'Oh, that was cool, what's next?'"
Probably the most well-known relationship of the Hollywood star was with her "Twilight" colleague Robert Pattinson, who eventually broke up bitterly.
Despite all this, the brunette actress assures the Harper's Bazaar magazine: "I was seriously in love with everyone I dated.
Or do you think I played it?”
After her separation, Kristen admitted that she was bisexual: "I have always lived and seriously believed in dualism.
It has never confused or hindered me.
I just never liked not being taken seriously.”
According to "Bang Showbiz", she suffered particularly from this, but during school time, when she preferred to dress like a boy: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me a lot.
When I was eleven, the kids told me I was going to look like a boy.
I felt really attacked, frightened and ashamed.
Now I look back and think to myself, ‘Girl, be proud of you!’”
She said, “People expect you to behave in a certain way and that annoys me.
And maybe some call me ungrateful, but I don't like having to justify myself in front of the public."
West Virginia Governor Announces He Will Change Party
The Democratic Governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Trump that he will change party.
“Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have moved away from me,” Justice said.
"Today I will tell you with many prayers and much thought ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia, I can no longer help you if I am a Democratic governor."
The rally broke out in cheer.
"Tomorrow I will change my registration with the Republicans," Justice added.
"As a coach, I'd say it's time to play another game."
Mr. Trump promised a big announcement at the West Virginia Rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not approve of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, and inherited a coal business from his father.
It is worth about $1.59 billion.
In the meantime, the Republican National Committee issued a statement on Thursday evening stating, “Governor Justice’s turn of the party is another blow to a Democratic party that would hinder us rather than work to make our country great again.”
"With only 15 governments and the control of the fewest legislative bodies in history, the announcement of Governor Justice is only the final rejection of a party that is top-to-bottom without leadership and unable to find a positive, unifying message," RNC chairman Ronna McDaniel told CBS News in a statement.
Coe praises "honest" Russian apology for doping scandal
The global athletics chief, Sebastian Coe, praised Thursday what he described as an obvious apology from Russia for a doping scandal, but he reiterated that it is not the time for the country to be reinstated in the sport.
Russia’s athletics chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that his country’s expulsion from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he felt sorry for "all athletes whose gold and silver medals were snatched away at competitions."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to uphold the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open response today, a very honest presentation," IAAF President Coe told reporters.
"The entire Council and Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has recognized in itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is redesigned."
Coe said he was also “delighted” that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think progress has been made, but Congress supports the Task Force's recommendations that this is not the time to re-establish Russia," Coe said.
"We will have to do everything in the next few months to normalize this situation.
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupted system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral players at the World Athletics Championships starting on Friday in London, according to the strict IAAF criteria.
The head of the IAAF Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still has to meet some of the criteria for re-employment.
Drug tests are still insufficient and banned trainers are still free to work, he told reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council.
Funeral Act for Soldiers Crashed in Mali
At a funeral ceremony in Fritzlar, North Hesse, about 1,000 people thought of the two soldiers killed in a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security precautions.
Minister of Defence Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) said nothing about the unexplained cause of the crash.
However, she described the two dead pilots as "experts in their field".
"We bow to this highest sacrifice they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she said.
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old Chief of Staff from North Hesse had died on Wednesday a week ago in West African Mali.
Their coffins were transferred to Germany and brought on Thursday accompanied by a vigil of the Bundeswehr to the Fritzlar Cathedral Sankt Peter.
At noon, only the members of the church said goodbye.
Afterwards, the funeral ceremony began in the circle of family, close friends, representatives of the Bundeswehr and politics.
Among them were Hessen Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the Inspector General of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker.
The mourning guests laid down roses, the relatives stood arm in arm at the coffins.
In front of the church, Fritzlarers and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas.
Defence Minister von der Leyen described the dead soldiers as "highly decorated" and experienced in the field.
The chief of staff had helped set up the flight operations of the Tiger fighter helicopter in Fritzlar and had been one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his regiment.
Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regiment to which the soldiers belonged, also declared: "If this crew could not avert the crash, then no one would have been able to do so".
Minister von der Leyen did not show any doubts about the UN mission in Mali: the deployment was dangerous.
But it is also of great importance “for a country from which we are only separated by two states,” she said.
After the funeral, the coffins were taken out of the cathedral.
When and where they are buried, the Bundeswehr did not provide any information.
Prince Henry doesn’t want a grave next to his wife.
The husband of Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
This was announced by the royal family on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple is buried in the cathedral church of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn N<0xC3><0xB8>rgaard already made a sarcophagus for the two.
The Queen agreed with her husband’s decision, the statement said.
Where Prince Henry will be buried remains unclear.
However, he does not intend to be buried in his French homeland.
Prince Henrik had never made a mistake of not being happy with his title.
After his wife Margrethe ascended to the throne in 1972, he would have liked to become king.
In 2016, he retired and also took the title "Princess husband".
Since Henrik did not get the title and function he wanted in Denmark, he did not consider himself to be equal to his wife - even after his death, Lene Balleby, the chief spokeswoman of the Danish royal house, explained.
Where the last resting place of the 83-year-old will ultimately be remains unclear.
However, he does not intend to be buried in his French homeland, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he has worked for for the last 50 years.
Born Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French noble family, Margrethe had met in London in 1965.
He worked in the French embassy on the Thames.
During his later wife, the expressions of sympathy of the people always flew to him, Prince Henrik had a difficult standing with the Danes in his almost 50-year reign.
In an autobiography, Henrik commented on the first years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was fluctuating, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk stockings instead of knitting socks, Citro<0xC3><0xAB>n instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who in this country had a reputation for being the brand of socially critical intellectuals, I could not hope for forbearance.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not embarrassed.
That was two mistakes!”
The Prime Minister wants a swift re-election
CDU and FDP ahead of possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony’s Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is in favour of a quick re-election of the Landtag after losing the red-green government majority, but he does not want to resign.
Because on Friday spoke out in favour of the dissolution of Parliament.
Previously, the surprising departure of a Green MP from her parliamentary group in Lower Saxony had plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the official date of the parliamentary elections, the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one-vote majority in parliament to the opposition from the CDU and the FDP.
Former Green MP Elke Twesten justified her move with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she explained on Friday in Hanover.
CDU Group Leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend to his group to accept them.
Together, the CDU and the FDP have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Landtag, the SPD and the Greens have 68 seats.
So far, the relationship has been the reverse.
The new state parliament will be elected regularly on 14 January next year.
Thümler said the red-green state government must now decide whether it can continue to rule without a majority in this situation.
However, Stephan Weil believes it is essential that the Landtag decides its self-dissolution as quickly as possible.
The CDU Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday.
The state constitution also provides for the possibility that the Landtag withdraws the Prime Minister’s trust and elects a successor.
"Our Constitution offers several options.
These possibilities need to be examined legally cleanly," said Thümler.
"You will discuss in peace all questions if they are legally reasonably examined."
Thümler called Twesten's step "but something curious".
The politician himself stressed: "I am not a traitor.
I feel very good."
She described herself as a supporter of Black-Green.
The Greens called on the renegade MPs to return their parliamentary mandate.
"We of course assume that it will return its state parliamentary mandate, which it has received via the green list, with immediate effect," state presidents Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner said in a statement.
Greens leader Anja Piel said: "We deeply regret Elke Twesten's decision".
She has deliberately decided not to hold a debate in the Group.
"Even with the background that there were no substantive differences, we cannot understand this step."
SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condemns the transfer of the Lower Saxony Green MP Elke Twesten to the CDU as a betrayal.
"The behaviour of the former Green MPs in Lower Saxony is not only a betrayal of the electorate, but also a betrayal of the Red-Greens," he wrote on Facebook.
He supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to have the Landtag quickly re-elected.
The Twestens exit costs Red-Green in Lower Saxony the majority.
The politician "in her injured vanity and in her frustration put her personal interests before the welfare of the country," criticized SPD Secretary General Hubertus Heil.
"It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony is taking part in this dirty game of intrigue and trying to make political capital out of it".
Lower Saxony's CDU group leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend to his MPs to include Elke Twesten in the CDU.
The SPD group leader in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, accused Twesten of using personal career thinking to distort the result of the 2013 state parliamentary elections.
The CDU was the strongest force before the SPD at the time, but the SPD and the Greens had a very thin majority of one vote in the Landtag.
Minister of Agriculture in interview - How do we protect ourselves from poison eggs, Mr. Schmidt?
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) is in an interview with the Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland (RND) speech and answer.
Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamping.
On the consumer protection portal www.Lebensmittelwarnung.de, the federal states provide the latest information about the affected egg batches.
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, according to all we currently know, a health hazard is practically excluded.
Is Aldi now taking over the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the Enlightener is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture?
Food control is the responsibility of the federal states.
Nevertheless, my house has opened up immediately and has been in close exchange with the authorities of the countries since becoming aware of the concern of Germany.
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers.
The trade, like the manufacturers, must ensure that the products sold are transportable and harmless to health.
In the case of eggs, if the maximum residue level of 0.005 mg/kg has been exceeded, they are not commercially viable.
However, unladen eggs can be sold and consumed.
This time it is not the fault of the companies.
Are manufacturers and consumers in the same boat?
According to current knowledge, the production companies are not directly to blame.
Rather, they face economic damage due to alleged illegal practices of service providers.
As always, there are not enough inspectors.
Is it just a lack of staff or a lack of coherent competence?
It was precisely the official controls that uncovered the process.
The truth, however, is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent ruled out.
It is precisely for this reason that it is vital that such incidents be consistently clarified and that they be handed over to the public prosecutor’s office in cases where there may be criminal offences.
I have already made it clear several times that I expect complete clarification from the responsible authorities.
Is regular alarmism in food scandals really necessary?
Consumers have the right to obtain only safe and transportable food.
When an unauthorized insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged.
Due to the tattered means, manufacturers, dealers and consumers have been placed in a situation that is absolutely not necessary.
In principle, it must be clear: the unlawful use of the insecticide fipronil in the keeping of food-providing animals is unacceptable and must be terminated immediately.
This needs to be worked on consistently and with high pressure at all levels.
I expect all the competent authorities to clarify the matter swiftly and fully.
How Football’s Financial Rules Will Affect Neymar’s Move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered spending by European football clubs will not interfere with Neymar’s world record transfer from Barcelona, Spain, to Paris-Saint Germain, France.
Any consequences will still come for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, because the leading organization that has monitored the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair-play rules introduced by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will have to prove at some point that the transfer of Neymar was funded without major losses.
Barcelona has paid <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>222 million ($262 million) to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar’s move to France.
PSG can certainly make the money loose for Neymar to sign and take him to a galaxy of other stars, given the team’s funding by the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on acquiring players, but need to counteract with legitimate sources of income that allow them to break-even point in their football-related business.
FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA President in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that had taken on enormous debts in their pursuit of success effectively cheated and risked ruining themselves if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on clubs’ debts to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 – buying a club with potential and then investing heavily to improve the team and build a global brand – would become a tougher matter.
During the current three-year FFP assessment period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million.
And despite Platini’s disapproval of the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to work to deter excessive spending.
“Certainly, FFP is not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future,” Andrea Traverso, who is in charge of FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG has paid Neymar’s buy-out clause in a lump sum, it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the replacement sum for the next five years of 44.4 million euros can be shown in the annual financial statements.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has hit PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the heaviest sanctions.
PSG received a fine of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 million (then $82 million), which was later reduced to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 million - and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014/15 Champions League season remain limited to 21 players instead of the normal 25 players.
UEFA is looking for clubs that might try to outsmart their financial oversight by inflating their revenues through companies associated with the owners of a club.
While a Qatari company could sponsor PSG if the value of the sponsorship exceeded the standard market rates, UEFA would not consider this a legitimate income.
That’s exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of PSA’s sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come from payments made by the organizing committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar in 2022 have denied that Neymar will be an ambassador for the World Cup, and such a maneuver could be easy for UEFA regulators to figure out.
The current sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA did not have any preparatory talks with PSG about Neymar's transfer, said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.
They spoke with The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG 2015/16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with sales of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>542.4 million.
The accounts for the last financial year have yet to be published.
PSG expects Neymar’s arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
The association expects that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after the signing.
The Spanish league was clearly annoyed to see one of the best footballers go, and they tried to prevent Neymar’s departure by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.
"It's a clear case of 'financial doping' with the club and the state," La Liga president Javier Tebas told the Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar's eventual ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finances a club.
"It's the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
“As soon as a country has a club, anything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect financial fairplay because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a big player to represent a country."
Swiss is looking for a new Schoggi supplier
In recent years, Chocolat Frey has produced board chocolate for Swiss.
Now the sweet cooperation is about to end: the airline re-signs the order.
Swiss spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott confirmed at the request of the news agency sda a corresponding report of the newspaper "Northwest Switzerland" on Friday.
According to current plans, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be reviewed every two to three years and subjected to quality control.
"We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey," said the spokeswoman.
Approximately 17 million small red-and-white-white-white-packed boards of 14 grams distribute each year to passengers by flight attendants before landing.
The Swiss did not want to give any information about the costs.
Industry insiders estimate the order volume according to "Northwest Switzerland" at 1.5 to 2 million francs - the Migros subsidiary generates an annual turnover of around one billion francs.
But more importantly, the advertising effect: For a Schoggi manufacturer, it is a prestigious order.
Swiss does not want to reveal how many applicants there are in the new tender.
Only Swiss manufacturers are eligible.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey wants to endeavour to renew the contract beyond the spring of 2018.
For the SDA, the largest Swiss chocolate producer was not available for a comment.
Swiss has been distributing chocolate boards on board its flights since 2006.
Before Swiss signed a contract with Migros’ subsidiary, Barry Callebaut, in collaboration with Hug, had supplied the chocolate tablets.
The possibility to place the logo was introduced by Swiss two and a half years ago with the start of the collaboration with Chocolat Frey.
The airline cooperates with various Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-haul flights, First Class customers will be spoiled with treats from Confiserie Sprüngli, Business Class passengers from Lindt Schoggi and Economy Class Schoggi from Chocolat Frey.
Swiss Schoggi by Chocolat Frey is also distributed on the short route, both in business and in economy class.
Athletics - Discus Olympian Robert Harting reaches World Cup finals
The three-time world champion will compete for a medal in the final on Saturday.
His brother Christoph, Olympic champion of 2016, had failed in the national World Cup elimination and could only watch the discus competition from the stands.
Also with the first attempt, Polish title defender Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 metres wide, qualified for the final match.
Nostalgia in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
This repetition of the story is at the same time nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80s, for the 90s grunge era (when pioneers David Wain and Michael Showalter shot the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars went to Rudd things, like Elizabeth Po Banks, Amhl's.
As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is running out.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurd humor (it contained an original story for a talking can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By stiffening themselves to the core of the gag - middle-aged actors playing horny kids who grow up - they still managed the impossibility of winning back the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later", with its adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and its parody goes more to the pouring pot principle, including a reef to the stalker movies of the 90s such as "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The Hand That Swings the Cradle").
At one point, a character browses through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates, and "a number of other things from 1991."
Many of the central stories are the same.
The lovable Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, still hasn't forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has not yet lost his virginity.
And there’s another crazy-evil plot that involves Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a successful impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, the excursions are the best part of the franchise.
It’s especially fun to see the ever-young Mr. Rudd showing Matt Dillon’s lower lip beard from “Singles,” whose former big-man-on-camp Andy now feels like an old cracker.
It’s the moments of random insanity that could spark this franchise like a kind of repetitive “Seven Up!” series until it reaches what I take as its logical conclusion: “Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later,” whose final scene will show the gang how they’re going to visit the film premiere of “Wet Hot American Summer.”
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon is now reminiscent of another kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War by "The Americans", the movie "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its east-to-west wrestling iconography.
Created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, the comedy with Rhys Thomas as the director claims to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles – a hard-boiled Gregor and an idealistic Iosef – are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues are synchronized in English by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some nice gags to watch (the police spend the time watching chess on TV, as Americans might do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chlo<0xC3><0xAB> Sevigny - makes for a decent game of 'Find out the voice'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the veracity of a desperate propaganda drama — a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is involved — that it often plays like one.
There are six long episodes, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.
Comrade Detective, edited to a smaller length, could better deliver his Agitprop satire, as Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two fat men who devour a bunch of hamburgers.
The message for the imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can make anything the feed for a mockery.
The fictitious Romanian creators were not wrong: we even do it with our own recent history and with their own.
Attack on drug mafia in the country
The police have successfully beaten the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar-Kreis, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, the public prosecutor’s office Konstanz announced on Friday.
Fifteen defendants between the ages of 25 and 77 were arrested and warrants were issued against them.
In addition, the officials secured larger amounts of marijuana and cocaine, firearms, and several hundred thousand euros.
Two people were arrested in simultaneous raids in Italy.
German arrest warrants were issued against the two Italian suspects.
The two are likely to be shipped to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.
In total, more than 300 police officers were deployed.
The members of the mafia are accused of organized drug crime, serious acts of violence, attempted murder, and robbery and blackmail.
Since the summer of 2016, the prosecutor’s office in Konstanz has been investigating organised drug trafficking in southern Germany.
There was a lively exchange between the prosecutors in Constance and Palermo and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
That’s why the major operation on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo.
The target of the investigation was mainly Italian nationals with close links to the Italian mafia.
An incident on May 27 in Hüfingen, where several shots were fired into a restaurant early in the morning, is also likely to go to the account of the gang.
Wise complains of major gaps in the foreigner register
"Data from citizens who should not appear": According to a report, the foreigners' register in Germany has significant shortcomings.
This sometimes leads to serious misdecisions in asylum procedures.
According to a media report, the Federal Government’s Refugee Management Commissioner, Frank-Jürgen Weise, has drawn attention to major gaps in the Aliens Central Register.
Deficiencies in the data recorded there could lead to "in some cases serious misdecisions" in asylum procedures and deportations, warns the Süddeutsche Zeitung in an analysis.
Ten million people with a foreign nationality are included in the register, including about 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
Accordingly, the data is managed by about 600 foreigners’ authorities in Germany.
Because the data had not been sufficiently maintained, the data quality in parts had not been good so far.
In individual cases, data from 1921 was found, "of people who have long since ceased to be alive, or of citizens who have become German citizens and should not actually appear in the register anymore."
"Incorrect data input can significantly slow return processes," the report said.
The statistics on persons subject to exit also cover EU citizens who do not have to leave at all.
Such incorrect assignments, however, "caused a distorted debate about how to deal with expatriates," according to the analysis.
Meanwhile, the federal government has apparently begun to send refugee families with under 16-year-old children back to Italy once they have entered from there.
This is according to an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung".
According to the paper, the BAMF has been conducting such procedures "in respect of families with children - with the exception of infants and toddlers - back to Italy since 1 June 2017".
Since the end of 2014, this has been virtually impossible, according to the newspaper, referring to the difficult situation on the ground.
According to the Dublin Agreement, the EU member state is responsible for the refugees they reach first.
If a migrant moves to another EU country, that country can send him back to the country of entry.
As a justification, the office now writes: "In the meantime, the capacity for families with underage children in Italy has significantly increased."
Italy has provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) considers these commitments sufficient.
Other EU countries would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement.
Ulla Jelpke, spokeswoman for the left in the German Bundestag, criticized the decision: "Families with children threaten to violate human rights and endanger the welfare of children due to deficiencies in the Italian asylum system".
Second best result achieved
A total of 220 liters of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach was already provided by the blood donation service for other people.
At least of the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday.
Above all, Jürgen Greule, who with his 100 donations now shared 50 liters of blood.
Traditionally, in the meeting of the municipal council, the community recognizes the multiple willingness to donate blood.
“It’s amazing how our bodies are designed for this, and we pay respect to donors who donate their blood to strangers, even unselfishly,” Mayor Karlheinz Kistner said in a statement.
"A single blood donation helps several people," explained Holger Maisenbacher, the Circle Readiness Director of the German Red Cross (DRK), because the cans are decomposed into their constituents.
Three people could benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the actions being carried out in the spring in Oberreichenbach.
"This year we achieved the second best result with 114 donors," said the DRC Circle Readiness Leader.
Apparently, the change to the theatre house a few years ago led to a higher number of participants.
Prior to this, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded for 50 blood donations each.
Half as many as Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter gave out 500 milliliters of their life juice ten times each.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and weakening inflation have dampened speculation about an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain “sluggish” as it maintains family income interest rates in the midst of increasing pressure.
The Bank’s Monetary Committee (MPC) policy makers voted 6 to 2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%, with fewer members striving for an increase this month as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6%, warning that pressure on household income would continue, with inflation expected to rise to just under 3% in autumn.
But she signaled that interest rate hikes would become necessary in the coming years to curb inflation fueled by Brexit and said that loan costs might need to rise in financial markets more than expected.
Members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth stimulus package issued a year after Brexit.
It will demand time for the funding plan to provide cheaper funding to banks from next February, although it has been said that now it is expected to provide <0xC2><0xA3>15 billion more under this system – with <0xC2><0xA3>115 billion.
Minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the bank said: "In the MPC's central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term as pressure on household real income continues to strain consumption."
Regarding interest rates, she reiterated that “a certain tightening of monetary policy” would be needed to cool inflation and a “slightly greater” extent than markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and a further one in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that increases would be "gradual" and "limited".
The Bank’s downward-adjusted growth forecasts for this year and next year are 1.9% and 1.7% respectively, as forecast in May.
It has maintained its growth forecast at 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell after this news against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to $1.31 and fell by 0.4% to $1.11.
The decision is unchanged after recent disappointing growth figures dampened rising expectations for interest rate hikes and GDP rose from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3% in the second quarter.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will recover slightly after the bank at the end of the year.
The latest inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and slight salary increases, as the exacerbation will first get worse before it will then improve.
She added that monetary policy cannot “prevent” income decline in the next few years, but added that wages will “significantly” recover at the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also being strengthened by the rising demand for British goods, which is due to the weak pound, which will compensate for some of the lower consumer spending.
The decision comes one year after the cut of interest rates to 0.25% last August, following the shocking EU vote that caused the drop in the pound.
The bank estimates that it will probably take four years for this to fully reach prices and the economy.
Prior to the bank’s last ruling on interest rates, the call for a rate hike had risen as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers calling for a 0.5% increase in July.
Inflation dropped from 2.9% in June to 2.6% last month, although the bank said it was expected to do so and will pull it back in the coming months.
The bank said the excess in relation to its 2% target was "wholely" attributed to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “Given the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again as lenders are looking for deals loudly and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those where the existing deals expire and the new mortgages are closing, and many with toll-free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular."
NHS (National Health Service) to prescribe controversial HIV drugs to 10,000 people
Patients will be given access to a “transformative” HIV prevention treatment from September following a fight before the High Court against funding the drug at the NHS.
NHS England announced that a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) taken before intercourse, which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now being delivered by the health service via a first three-year study for an estimated 10,000 people.
He agreed to finance the trial after the appeals court confirmed a Supreme Court ruling last year that the NHS had the authority to pay for the PrEP despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it.
The move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England chief Simon Stevens as an “important new intervention,” while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) called it a “decisive moment.”
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to enable people to register, and more clinics will follow in October before being launched across the UK in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a sequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in those at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before intercourse means that just enough medications are present in a person’s body to prevent HIV infection.
Such medications can be taken every day or two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals, and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
Clinics identify suitable participants who agree to the study, including men, women, transgender people and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered with a general practitioner can also apply for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.
The program will be <0xC2><0xA3>10 million and NHS England signed a contract to deliver the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement.
The study aims to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on how it is targeted, recorded and implemented on a large scale.
Stevens said: “This major new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in addressing one of humanity’s greatest health challenges.”
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: “This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, when targeted at needy and vulnerable people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September, people at high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded trial in England to develop a new tool that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.
We very much welcome this announcement."
Ian Green, Chairman of the Board of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: “The priority now has to be that the study be conducted quickly across the country and that no one at risk for HIV is left behind.
Now that PrEP testing medicine has been procured, we are on track to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people.”
Sharon Hodgson, Shadow Health Minister, said: "The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and hesitation in implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can stop the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This experiment brings us one step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now, it is important that this study is being conducted across the country as quickly as possible to protect people who are HIV-infected, and that it will help us get one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society.”
Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this tiny Earls Court apartment into a generous home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, shrunk from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It’s located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace – and it’s proof of the new design that Joanne didn’t pack and sell her bags.
“Before that, I lived in a much larger room with my ex in Knightsbridge,” says Joanne.
"I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer that day.”
Since the first visit, the 1,000-square-foot apartment has been completely overhauled.
Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to walk through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
That was my requirement," she says.
For this purpose, she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5-foot ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine where one could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the problem.
"The steel mill is quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend down.
It wasn’t just about building a simple platform, it was about putting the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function up or down.”
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms at full height on top of each other - with a lot of extra drama.
For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius overlooks the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window into another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units accommodate all Joanne cutlery and glasses.
By perceiving a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when not in use.
Collapsible kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.
"A bit of engineering went into it," explains Erfan from the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door.
"It's counterweighted, so when you push the door up, it slides very easily."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage, Joanne was able to gain an additional 16 m2, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
“At the end of the day, you’ll be selling the floor space—or how your property is valued,” Erfan says.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the floor size."
Here they have managed to enlarge the floor area while at the same time using high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.
“The materials are the things you touch and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home,” says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the electrical sockets in the walls.
These are important, but they don’t play with your heart.”
It shows that by good design and increased square footage, an apartment can turn from something standard into something quite amazing.
In fact, like Joanne, you might decide not to leave this one.
Brothers fight over $500 million real estate empire
Four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, two brothers are in a fight over one of Victoria’s largest real estate empires worth over $500 million.
Former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets should be shared.
Paul had wanted to retire from the family business since 2014, but a sharp dispute over the separation is taking place in the Supreme Court.
Together with their mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the family bought a shop on Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There, the Westco Jeans family founded and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold for $85 million in 1999.
This money has been invested in real estate, and De Lutis’ portfolio now includes downtown offices, Brunswick and Sorrento development areas, Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartments, and suburban shopping malls.
According to an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - described by Paul as "the main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul owns about one-third.
A court file states that this means that Colin owns $316 million worth of property and Paul owns $176 million worth of property.
The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
"The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought was the best objects," he wrote in an initial affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed mediations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business – which Colin, as Paul claims, has ruled out.
Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul of incompetently managing some possessions.
In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
"My Italian heritage dictates that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.
Costs rise in the case, with hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails, and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held by both sides.
Ms. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran dairy bars and delicacies from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood property, where Colin opened the family's first jeans shop.
Colin says that he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school, when Paul was still a small child (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property amicably to their sons.
"Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, with Colin claiming that Mark was paid $10 million and Luke $26 million when he left the company.
Both Lukas and Mark were bitter about the terms of their financial separation.
Colin has been very reluctant even though he was a former AFL board member and, according to a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire, the TV star’s best friend.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin responded by texting to say "I really can't say much" because the case was before the courts.
"It's very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and pull our family name through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he had tried to fulfill his brother’s demands.
"Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current dispute," he said, adding that he "still hopes for a solution."
On Friday, that hope seemed to be over.
"Our case will be resolved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit the president's media abstinence.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump — including news media reports — in the hopes of keeping the chief on a more even course.
Here's a piece from reporter Josh Dawsey:
“When John F. Kelly, the new White House chief of staff, met with senior executives on his first day of work, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump’s White House that he wants to fix: bad information that gets into the hands of the president.
Kelly told employees that information about him should flow—whether on paper or in briefings—because the president would make better decisions if he received good information.”
Kelly’s diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump’s relationship with television dates back decades – and now that he’s in the White House, his television commercials are still strong.
“If candidate Trump was upset about unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he was getting a fair coverage of positions that were convincing,” former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politico's Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise."
- Okay. - Okay.
But the idea that Trump’s Twitter habit was ever “under control” is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don’t know others—that Trump’s tweets would have contained even more fuel without their interventions.
We’ll probably never learn anything about the tweets that Trump didn’t send.
If his employees managed to keep him away from anger several times, then their efforts have been worthwhile.
But no one has consistently been able to prevent Trump from provoking controversy.
Part of the problem is that in a White House made up of competing parties, people keep trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that potentially promotes their views of the world.
Politico - wholly concerned with this story - reported in May on the advisors' preference to provide the president with dubious information for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
“Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press cutouts, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he’s hardened to find out where they come from.
That’s exactly what happened at the end of February when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of internet provocator Charles C. Johnson, who accused deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being “the source behind a bunch of leaks” in the White House.
Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for harassment or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he made false accusations in the past and revoked them.
Trump read the article and began questioning employees about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary-General Rob Porter “have tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork Trump receives.”
How did it work out?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers are still striving for influence.
These immutable factors make Kelly’s mission very difficult.
Criminals receive mail from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the help of the population is requested and hoped.
Police across Europe this summer are sending (virtual) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run.
Since the addresses of the sought-after criminals are naturally not known, information from the population is hoped for and requested.
Europol reported on Friday about the action that follows the “EU Most Wanted” Advent calendar from winter.
Experience has shown that many refugees are hiding in holiday destinations, Europol said.
21 postcards for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries have been compiled.
Since 2016, the website www.eumostwanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times.
36 of the online searchers have so far been arrested, at least eleven of them due to indications posted on the website.
Travelers Negotiate a Trench and Return to the Millionaire Series
Some of the wealthiest homeowners in the West Midlands are back at war with some determined travelers who have negotiated a ditch drawn by the community to reclaim a field in front of their mansions.
Travelers have parked their 20 caravans in a field outside a wealthy street of Solihull called the “Millionaire Series.”
They brought horses, babies and an army of transporters after they were ejected only in May, but were not deterred by a trench excavated by the council to prevent their incursions.
The tactful group found a gap in the defenses and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unobstructed to find a way.
Angry residents have harassed Solihull's council, who said it "is useless to deal with the problem."
An anonymous resident said: "They moved there on Monday evening after being sent on by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at the passersby.
The Council must be forced into action by shame because it was useless in dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, were moved on and are now back.
More arrived last night, probably more today."
She added: “The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long lessons to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I'm not happy to continue paying my community tax if the council can't even stop that."
A local resident who did not want to be mentioned said, "It's ridiculous, we just saw the last round of these travelers just to be looted by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you’ve even seen a horse in the parking area.”
A Solihull Council spokeswoman said: "We are aware of an unauthorized camp in the countryside beyond Streetsbrook Road and are working with Solihull's police, and we are taking the necessary legal steps to ensure that they move on as soon as possible.
To support our evidence collection, it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behavior to the police by calling 101.
This helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case."
From Birkenhof to Waldhotel Luise
The former Hotel Birkenhof becomes the Waldhotel Luise.
The house at the gates of Freudenstadt is currently undergoing renovation and is scheduled to reopen on 1 March next year.
This is good news for the city.
Because with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on April 13, 2014, around 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost at the time and also revenues from the tourist tax.
In the autumn of 2014, in view of the dramatic increase in the number of refugees who came to the county, the hotel building was offered to the county council office as a collective accommodation, which caused controversial discussions.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by drawing up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not undisputed at the time.
But above all Freudenstadt’s Mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and spoke about serious prospects at the house.
He should be right.
The Luisenhotels Group with Managing Director Birgit Scherer based in Bad Bergzabern has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a house of the three-star plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the object Freudenstadt.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
At the former Hotel Birkenhof, construction debris containers have been standing in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear how extensive renovation work is undertaken.
The floors were torn out, ceilings partly removed, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single construction site.
There is still a lot to do by March.
"It's actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in a conversation with our newspaper.
Everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed.
Everything should later become "beautiful citizenship", as Thomas Scherer puts it.
"We want to make a piece of jewelry out of it."
It features a swimming pool, a spa area and a meeting room.
You do not want to position yourself at the high level of hotels in Lauterbad, but already at an upscale downtown level, emphasizes Scherer.
The Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to be wide, explains Scherer.
Both individual holidaymakers, groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel.
He had already held talks with OB Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause, according to Scherer.
The concepts of the city are similar to those of the hotel group.
“We are on the same line.”
Asked about the amount of investments, Thomas Scherer does not want to make a precise decision.
Just under a million dollars, he said.
The outdoor facilities are also being brought to the forefront, which is already clearly visible.
In a courtyard, a large terrace will be created, which will be accessible from the restaurant, which is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market".
U.S. Special Investigator Deploys Grand Jury
In the Russia affair around US President Donald Trump, Special Investigator Robert Mueller is said to have appointed a so-called Grand Jury, according to a report.
The committee has started work in recent weeks, the Wall Street Journal wrote, citing people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper regarded the move as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigation.
CNN reported that there are already first subpoenas by the panel in connection with a meeting between Trump’s eldest son and a Russian lawyer.
U.S. intelligence agencies have long accused the Kremlin of deliberately interfering in the 2016 presidential election campaign.
Mueller is investigating whether there were agreements between Trump’s campaign team and Moscow.
The investigation will focus on several men who acted as Republican advisers in the election campaign.
According to reports, Mueller was also examining Trump’s private and business environment more and more.
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that the special investigator personally moved Trump to the center and investigated the allegation, whether the president may have obstructed the justice system in the course of the affair.
The main task of the Grand Jurys is to examine the evidence available in possible crime cases and decide whether to bring charges.
Grand Jurys are also called prosecution chambers.
Usually they are turned on when they are larger and controversial cases.
The process always takes place behind closed doors.
The board can also be called in by the public prosecutor’s office to summon persons for interrogation under oath.
According to CNN, subpoenas have already been issued about the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
Persons involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement, the report said.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump’s adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner as well as his then campaign leader Paul Manafort were also in the conversation.
Law experts said Thursday evening on U.S. television that the inauguration shows that Mueller is not intimidated in his work and that if necessary, he wants to act quickly.
However, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be called in at the end to decide whether to raise an indictment.
Nevertheless, the establishment of the panel is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause for concern for President Trump.
In the midst of the new revelations, the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday night to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.
“Russia’s history is a total invention,” Trump said.
The issue gives Democrats a way to “feel good because they have nothing else to talk about.”
His special adviser, Ty Cobb, said in a statement that he knew nothing about the establishment of a Grand Jury.
But it also usually works secretly, he stressed.
The White House is in favour of any measures that would "fairly" accelerate the work of the Special Counsel.
Former FBI chief James Comey has said three times that he will not be investigated.
There is no reason to believe that something has changed, the statement said.
Mueller was only fired after Trump fired Comey.
Because of this eviction, accusations against Trump had become loud that he wanted to obstruct the justice system.
Comey told a Senate committee in June that Trump had asked him to stop the investigation into then national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.
According to U.S. media reports, the White House collected material against the Special Investigator and his employees.
This caused speculation as to whether Trump would like to fire Mueller.
Unlike an independent congressional special investigator, such as in the Watergate affair surrounding later resigned President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the Justice Department at the President’s urging.
Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a move.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators presented on Thursday bills that would make it impossible for the special investigator to be fired so easily.
Antarctica: Giant iceberg floats in Antarctica
In western Antarctica, a giant iceberg almost seven times the size of Berlin has detached itself from the ice shelf.
This was announced by the Bremerhaven Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.
The colossus, weighing more than a trillion tons and 5,800 square kilometers, is now moving north and will probably take two or three years to melt.
It is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have detected in the past three decades, with a length of 175 kilometers and a width of up to 50 kilometers.
There is no danger to people from him.
The extent to which climate change has played a role in the demolition of the iceberg is unclear, according to researchers.
Overall, however, there has been a series of unusual collapses of ice shelves in the region for about 30 years, the US Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) writes in a factual background.
In the opinion of many researchers, this may be related to global warming.
The now abolished colossus has so far been part of the Larsen-C ice sheet.
Shell ice floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
It thus continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly.
The Larsen-C ice sheet is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic peninsula.
North of this shelf ice, the balance of growth and abortion was disturbed a few years ago.
A complete shell ice has decayed there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is a lot of evidence that the Larsen-C ice sheet is also in danger, because the front edge has never retreated as far as currently.
In addition, the ice sheet is under tension and can disintegrate if a piece breaks off at a key point.
Melting shell ice and iceberg does not raise sea level, as they swim on the water and ice displaces as much water as it yields after melting itself.
However, the loss of shelf ice means that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and drain much faster than before.
This could possibly raise sea levels, but only to a small extent, writes the British Antarctic Observation Research Project (Midas).
According to AWI data, the Larsen-C ice sheet is the fourth-largest ice sheet in Antarctica, with nearly 50,000 square kilometers.
At the crossing from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.
There it breaks down regularly.
"While it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice sheet is now in a more vulnerable position," said Martin O'Leary of Swansea University.
"This is the longest withdrawal since the beginning of the recordings," he also confirmed.
Among scientists, there is controversy as to whether the Larsen-C ice sheet will now grow again or decline in the long term and possibly collapse, said his colleague Adrian Luckman, adding: "Our models say it will be less stable."
But this development will take decades.
Although these researchers do not attribute the demolition of this giant iceberg to climate change, many ice shelves of the Antarctic Peninsula have been disintegrated in recent decades.
This long tip of Antarctica extends towards South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey, since the 1950s, the Antarctic Peninsula’s ice area has declined by 28,000 square kilometres.
The increase in temperature contributed to the decline.
The Antarctic peninsula has warmed by about three degrees over the past 50 years, making it one of the areas where temperatures are rising the fastest.
CDU wants home tariffs on staff
Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill vacancies, the CDU is demanding to leave the employers’ association in order to become more attractive.
Just before the summer break, the county council announced 41 new positions in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now 17 trainees have their first day of work behind them.
Apparently, the apprenticeships at the circle are very sought after.
Approximately 620 applications were registered for the places to be awarded this year.
Nevertheless, the circle still lacks personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks.
Currently, there are still 50 unoccupied positions in the Mettmann district.
Among other things, doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration are sought.
The CDU now wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and counter the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.
At the request of the parties, the administration is to "develop a concept for staff recruitment and staff development".
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs for skilled workers, but to counteract the shortage of applicants in a future-oriented manner.
The overall concept should be internally and externally oriented, show concrete measures for cross-border entrants and include a training offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with personal problems that you did not know before.
Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
We are talking about a real "competition of public employers".
In addition, there is a high number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age.
It is high time to act so that more jobs are not left unoccupied.
But Klaus-Dieter Völker, leader of the CDU, goes beyond the joint motion with his party.
He recently caused a big surprise in the county council when he publicly questioned the staff cost ceiling and astonished the other parties.
Peoples want all the possibilities to be reviewed that make it possible to leave the municipal employers’ association.
"If we do not reach a satisfactory solution here in the short term, the district administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the district-member cities - should aim for a house tariff," Völker said.
In doing so, the CDU is trying to pay employees and officials better than the public service tariffs actually provide.
Salaries are currently exactly prescribed, increases or more money are only available if you change to a higher level, which is based on professional years.
But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up, in which employees took care of the provisions of the new prostitute protection law.
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and District Director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff.
Italy tightens tone on NGO migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs that use lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they may not continue to do so if they do not abide by new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minnitis’ warning came one day after the Italian authorities seized a boat belonging to the German aid organization Youth Saves, because their crew had effectively cooperated with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organization, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to comment on detailed allegations by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, saving human life is and remains our top priority, so we are very sorry that we are not able to operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," the organization said in a statement on social media.
"We can only assess all accusations currently being made after we have gathered all the information and are able to assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat of 'Jugend Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.
It is suspected that his crew takes onboard hose-boat migrants delivered directly to them by human traffickers, and that the smugglers can depart so that the ships can be used again.
At least one such meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor’s file, whose content was published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of overlooking the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other reasons.
Under the Code of Conduct, boats like the Iuventa must primarily have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable as they would not entail “substantial changes or disabilities” to their rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti said that the number of migrants arriving in Italy after the rescue efforts has declined sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen Libyan coast guards and cooperate with local mayors have been fruitful.
"In the last few days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Rise and Trials
Nine Weilermer bikers, the "Berlin outpost" and two guest riders met in Wachenheim in the North Palatinate to enjoy trials and sightseeing for four days.
There were three friendly guides available.
The accommodation in the Wachenheim Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led to the Michaelkapelle above Deidesheim in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards.
Viewpoints followed, partly on towers, from which one could look far over the Palatinate Forest and the upstream plains.
In between, there were always longer climbs, for which long trials rewarded.
On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and to the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.
Again, the viewpoint lined up with the viewpoint, coupled with "flowing" trials and moderate climbs.
In the last two days, many altitude meters were announced again.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and shelters brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers breathed healing brine in the outdoor inhalatorium.
Neustadt was also attacked.
After 173 kilometers and almost 4,500 meters of altitude, the group had got to know the Palatinate Forest from its best - sporting and cultural -.
Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga prepares for e-sports
In the future, will the sports stars sit in front of computer consoles instead of fighting their way through the stadium lawn sweaty in the wind and weather?
The fact is, eSports has long since become a serious industry, a lucrative business – including big stars, millions of fans and huge high-end tournaments.
This has also been recognised by the first Bundesliga clubs, which are increasingly engaged in this area.
VfL Wolfsburg started in 2015, later followed by FC Schalke 04 and most recently VfB Stuttgart, which founded an e-sports division in mid-July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17.
"We hope to inspire brand new young target groups for the VfB," says Managing Director Jochen Röttgermann.
He is sure that "there are still a lot of clubs on this train."
Next weekend, FIFA will host the first Interactive Club World Cup in London, where players from different clubs will compete against each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain and PSV Eindhoven have qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports.
The former coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now advising an agency for virtual football players.
"Real football has to deal with the 14- to 30-year-olds in particular, that the young people will still go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: The clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets, especially the Asian ones.
With prominent e-sportlers under contract, you could be online more often in these markets than sending the Bundesliga team to Asia only once a year.
What exactly is it about?
In e-sports, computer games such as "League Of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counterstrike" or the FIFA football simulation are fought at the competitive level.
For a long time, as in normal sports, leagues have been established in which the professionals compete against each other.
And at the 2022 Asian Games, e-sports is already part of the official program.
Is this really a real sport?
For many, the idea is certainly in need of getting used to.
Ingo Froböse has also dealt with the question for a long time.
For the professor at the Deutsche Sporthochschule in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sports - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
It also requires cognitive skills, technical and tactical understanding, and rapid responsiveness.
Professional gamers should not only exercise at the console, but also their bodies and pay attention to the diet.
"The fit player is a good player."
But Froböse also sees problems: "Doping is becoming more and more an issue".
Controls were difficult to implement in online games, and in the scene the structures of classical sports were lacking.
Positively, the scientist highlights the high integrative effect of e-sports.
Players are traveling internationally, that’s like a big global family, there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by the consulting firm Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in e-sports.
In 2016, 50 million euros were generated in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and major tournaments.
In three years, sales are expected to be 130 million.
Compared to the nearly 2.4 billion euros of the Bundesliga football, this is little.
However, the e-sports are "no longer far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," the Deloitte consultants write.
Many countries are already further internationally.
Major markets are Asia and the US, where former basketball player Shaquille O'Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez join US Team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSports betting provider Unikrn.
There is also a lot going on in Europe.
In a Norwegian school, e-sport was introduced as a subject of instruction, says Froböse.
In the Netherlands and France, the football first league clubs are now obliged to set up an e-sports department, according to Dutt.
"In a European comparison, Germany is lagging behind," explains VfB board member Röttgermann.
To fall into nostalgia and to transfigure the old days is no longer enough.
It is about preserving the tradition of the association, but at the same time aligning the company with the modern market.
“We live in a digitalized world,” Dutt said.
"You can't hold on to the fact that only in football everything will remain the way it always has been."
Gift Egg ade - The egg alternatives for cooking and baking
Nowadays, almost all federal states are affected by the scandal of poison-laden eggs.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have reacted and taken all eggs from the sale across Germany.
Only eggs that are proven to contain no fipronil should be taken into the shelves.
Michelle Carter Convicted of Texting Conrad Roy to Suicide
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide by texting and calling.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months behind bars and five years on probation.
Carter was convicted in June of negligent killing by Conrad Roy, who took his own life on July 13, 2014.
Roy’s father said at the hearing on Thursday: “My family is inconsolable.
My son was my best friend.”
Carter was allowed to remain free until the appeal.
She had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr. Roy suffered from a mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and a cream-coloured blouse, Carter stood there with tears in her eyes, with her hands folded and her eyes downwards when she was convicted.
"Their actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended her life to make her own better.
She took no responsibility," she said.
"She has shown no remorse".
But Carter’s attorney said it was a “terrible circumstance that she completely regrets.”
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he had not found that her "age or degree of maturity, or even her mental illness, have a significant influence on her actions."
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy’s mother, Lynn Roy, stating that “there is no day I don’t mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything, and I try to be there for his sisters despite all the pain that we will carry for eternity.”
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said she was "persecuted" by the realization that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt to his children.
“Not having the only person I’ve been with every day since I was born is a pain I’ll always keep with me for the rest of my life,” she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to urge another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case attracted national attention after Carter's text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hang up, jump off a building, stab yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention by Roy’s death and ordered that she benefit from the case through any press.
The case shared the legal opinion.
Among the few defending Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 before being acquitted two years ago.
Ms. Knox, 30, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not jail."
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from the new mini-lame of FC Bayern
The fact that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to captain the Audi Cup is no coincidence.
FC Bayern entrusts the Confed Cup winner a big season - extra motivation doesn't hurt.
Something was different in his place in the cabin, which Joshua Kimmich saw immediately, even though the extra garment was very, very small.
But since on the second day of the Audi Cup, of course, no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer could be seen, he made the tie allocated to him on his arm.
"The coach did not announce it," said the Confed Cup winner after his first deployment as Bayern captain.
Well, the score could have been better than in the 2-0 against the SSC Naples.
But the sign from the coach could interpret Kimmich as well.
Not eight-year-old Arturo Vidal had been chosen as the game leader in the C-Elf, which consisted of youth players, debutants and professionals who had just left the club.
After all, sugar is best distributed to those you trust a lot, which you want to keep in the mood.
So if you have been chosen to take on the legacy of lameness, you can only use a little extra motivation.
Kimmich said: “This is what you want as a player: taking responsibility.”
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old flew over the field as a mini-lame.
Right back, this is his position, the white tie on her arm did the rest.
And overall, Kimmich acted in this starting formation like the one who can take the rudder in the best hand.
He gave instructions, tried to steer the unplayed force.
He looked at the whole, while many others were busy with themselves.
Vidal by overplaying his lack of fitness (didn't work); Renato Sanches by relying on the achievements of the Asia trip (didn't work at all); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle by not striking negatively in their first appearance in the Bayern jersey.
After all, it worked out quite well.
Süle ran up next to Kimmich, Rudy in front of the defense, both acting sovereignly.
The well-known Napoli storm was often difficult, and Süle also tried to succeed a few times in the game structure.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result “was not as we hoped.”
But he also showed a decent performance at the debut.
Game shift, pace change: "I was picked for this style."
How unusual this Bayern world is for the new entrants, was seen after the game.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two in the catacombs, but certainly gave six or seven interviews.
Kimmich said goodbye after a few crisp statements on the back of his new co-stars.
There he heard an interesting phrase from Süle: "What's going on here, I've already noticed.
At Bayern, you just have to win every game.”
After all, he no longer has to teach the new.
Alaba motivates <0xC3><0x96>FB ladies
David Alaba believes in the success of our <0xC3><0x96>FB ladies
Austria’s best-known footballer reported on Twitter shortly before the match and wished the <0xC3><0x96>FB ladies all the best.
The Bayern legionnaire is almost a clubmate of <0xC3><0x96>FB captain Schnaderbeck and is fiebering with our ladies.
The tweet of the Austrian footballer of the year and Champions League winner should be a special inspiration.
Our ladies might well need the famous Bayern-Dusel as well.
Company satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate minister: Economics praises Wissing’s pace
The relationship between the country and the regional economy often became irreconcilable when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Minister of Economics of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This is evident after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economic Affairs Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region speak at T V's request of a change in economic policy - and at the same time blame the old minister.
Frank Natus, chairman of the association Trierer Unternehmen (VTU), says: "Wissing takes up the wishes of the economy, which Lemke has all blocked".
Natus sees the biggest turnaround in infrastructure policy: The gap between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country’s priority list.
Even this year, the Ministry is hoping for a plan determination procedure, until 2021 the construction law is to stand.
A role in the country's plans is also played by the westward circumvention of Trier, which is in urgent need of the Federal Roads Plan.
The goal is to put the route into operation in December 2020, says ministry spokeswoman Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees this as a signpost to support regional but internationally competing companies.
The Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IHK) Trier, as suggested by Wissing, aims to create a Rhineland-Palatinate label for wine in order to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of German wine exports, which have been declining for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company, praises the IHK.
The Chamber of Crafts Trier sees the new master bonus as an additional incentive for young apprentices, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
A premium of 1000 euros is provided for the passing master's exam and 2500 euros if graduates become self-employed within ten years of the master's training.
However, the homework list for the country remains long.
With the planned road construction, facts can be quickly created, at the same time the country lacks the necessary staff, says Jan Glockauer, Managing Director of the IHK Trier.
Of the 56 new engineers that Wissing wants to hire at the state-owned mobility company, only 29 have been filled so far.
The IHK calls for more contracts to be awarded to external offices.
CDU Group Vice-President Christian Baldauf refers to calculations by the Court of Auditors that the country is investing more than 20 million euros less in 2017 and 2018 in the preservation of state roads than proposed.
Frank Natus also expects a concept of the country, how it wants to address the skilled workers shortage in the region.
The current broadband expansion in the country is also sobering.
In 2016, regional companies had rated the grid supply in an IHK survey only with a grade of 3.4.
They complained about stagnating internet connections and breakdowns.
Ex-Economic Minister Eveline Lemke, on the other hand, is currently out of politics and is still on the Supervisory Board of the wind turbine company Pro Wind.
The Greens left Lemke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where she already cleared the field after four months due to disagreements.
Audi to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter-reaction
A day before Audi’s announcement, BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company believes "there are smarter options than driving restrictions," referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the undertakings as a recall.
European automotive manufacturers have strongly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions rules.
But the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost for automotive manufacturers to install systems to neutralize the exhaust emissions emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of tampering with the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which uses so-called shut-off devices that could regulate emissions to comply with regulations when a car has been tested, but drives back under normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several Volkswagen employees have been charged, others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics in Audi’s engine development was arrested in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected against extradition and could be tried in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe, and a request focused on the United States was expanded.
Audi’s involvement in the investigation could put a heavy strain on Volkswagen: The luxury car manufacturer is contributing disproportionately to Volkswagen’s profit.
This message was sent to the raft on Saturday on the Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
So that the Isar visitors can join in, tomorrow Saturday a raft will pass through Munich, which has a special message.
Whoever moves to the Isar on Saturday will see a large raft between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke.
And this is not an ordinary raft, with Isar tourists.
But the construction department wants to clarify.
On the raft you can see a large infotransparent.
It shows a mountain of rubbish.
The start of a publicity campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors.
With the motto "True love is ..." the aim is to sharpen the understanding of the Isar as a protected wild river.
Already last summer the raft crossed the Isar and this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a considerate and environmentally conscious behavior.
Mordillo's Nostrils and Laughter Against Suffering
Mordillo was at times one of the most published cartoon cartoonists, the tuber noses of his characters being his trademark.
At 85, the Argentinian is still drawing and working on a film.
His message: laugh, "because there is too much suffering in the world."
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4, 1932, the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
In his early years as an artist, he succeeded in drawing greeting cards, which frustrated him.
“The happiest day in my professional life was the day I lost my job,” he said.
After stopping in Lima, New York and Paris, he made the breakthrough at the end of the 1960s: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then in "Star" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
Again and again, the artist was inspired by cities.
Large, rounded Mordillo figures tumble in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning, according to his own information, he still sits at the drawing table today, working almost ten hours a day.
Through calendars, puzzles, books for young and old, t-shirts, plush toys and watches, his magical figures continue to be widely distributed worldwide.
For six years he has also been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters.
The main character in the movie "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillo's most popular animal in his drawings - who has a thousand-footer as an opponent.
His characters speak for the first time in the 3D film, which is scheduled to appear on the cinema screen in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they're going to say, it's weird for me," Mordillo says.
The script is not written by him.
That is why he prefers the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced wordlessly.
Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender is declining due to drought-reminiscent conditions and disease-transmitting insects, causing great headaches to scientists and farmers trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: “The lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the fall.
This has an impact on the lifespan of lavender.
There is also a small cicada, a microbacteria that transmits dwarf cicadas, and in very dry weather there are very many of them."
And there's a lot at stake.
Lavender oil attracts not only holidaymakers, it is also in great demand for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: “Rather than having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil."
The solutions that are considered include better water distribution and slowing down evaporation from the soil, but also spraying the plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and developing varieties that are more resistant to drought.
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön celebrates its 1200th anniversary this year.
The highlight of the festival is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.
Warehouses, guilds, merchants, vagabonds or a Landsknecht camp are said to be on display in the city centre on these days.
The murder of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico
Workers of the weekly Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa through organized crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.
But that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about safety.
They were told that it was important to change their routines.
Two high-ranking journalists are discussing what feels safer: they should take their children to the office, who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room: enemies, neutrals, allies.
They ask the reporters to suggest names for each column - no evidence is needed, perceptions and gut feelings suffice.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being on the government payroll or cartels, a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no rest from violence, and as the bodies are accumulating throughout the country, more and more journalists are present: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats and so far this year there have been at least seven deaths in seven states.
Among the latter is their editor and their inspiration of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on drug-related violence.
His absence is deeply felt, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word "Justice" hangs on the façade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts that typically show his smiling face with his glasses or Panama huts.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor’s office was set up in 2010 to handle the cases of journalists, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, only two criminal proceedings have been initiated.
As with most of the thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organized crime every year, the killers are rarely brought to justice by journalists.
At Riodoce, they still insist on dealing with the violence of Sinaloa, even though they are inconsolable and even though the terrain is now even more treacherous.
Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little benefit, says Ibarra.
"It's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
“As long as we don’t know why, we distrust everyone.”
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men, he was forced out of his car and 12 times shot at him, presumably because of the newspaper's name - which translates as "Twelfth River".
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a wife and two adult children.
Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.
But on the subject of Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence.
Since Guzman’s arrest last year and his extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa had become one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country, as rival factions here are fighting to fill the vacuum.
It doesn’t matter that in Sinaloa someone or more people are shot on the street every day or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-story mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of “quietness” when only one cartel has control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States.
Nevertheless, and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, broke with the blame for not being able to protect his friend.
He believes two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.
First, in February, there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions at war with Guzman’s sons.
This publication may have upset the sons, suspected gang members bought up every copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he teamed up with five colleagues to found Riodoce and sold $50 worth of investments.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without encountering the drug problem," Bojorquez said.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for its courageous and honest coverage, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved to be able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria Moors-Cabot Award" for her coverage in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee on the Protection of Journalists for his courage in persecuting Mexican drug history wherever it led.
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
“You have to take on the job that falls to you as a journalist – either that or you play the fool.
I don't want to be asked, "What have you done in the face of so many dead ... why didn't you say what was going on?"
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the joker who could curse like a dockworker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted in his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love of routine his ruin?
His death has also forced her to question her own assumptions about how best to do her job and stay alive.
"They don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways" to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed," Bojorquez said.
The result is, even in the best of times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trust your own instincts.
If it smells bad, stay away from it.
The trouble is, Riodoce Andres Villarreal's editor said, that "odor a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened to Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa – just as they do in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where there is a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce employees met for security training, suddenly no cell phones were allowed, and days before it was known that spyware, sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.
They were commissioned by the state government to protect Riodoce’s offices in a four-story building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Half a joke, some of the reporters wondered if these officers were among the 50 percent of police officers the governor himself described as untrustworthy.
It’s been months since the reporters went into the mountains, where the drug gangs are de facto under control.
For the issue this week, Riodoce looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of the former well-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposé on government spending, which focused on the governor’s hometown.
And there was a group that carried out a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the prosecutor’s office.
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was needed when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated almost all political levels for the entire century.
Recently, several PRI governors have been accused of high-profile cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents at this venue, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military raid.
Just a few months earlier, readers had viewed Valdez’s column as the best-informed source on the kidnapping.
"In the past, we would have known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" because of his slender body stature.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
Valdez’s office has been re-dedicated to the storeroom for signs and stickers protesting the murders of journalists because the employees have become something they themselves would never have expected: activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to the prosecutor’s office the next morning to a demonstration over another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacán.
A burned body has been discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests, it's his.
Across the country, journalists have become louder by writing down “SOS Press” on walkways and buildings in organized protests.
On that day, director Bojorquez is away in Washington and is trying to gather international support for the justice system in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez’s assassination, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them for telling the truth.
She has since requested that she be reclassified by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were “surrounded” by organized crime, government officials involved in it, and an indifferent society.
In his latest book, Narco-Journalism, he wrote that reporters are killed not only by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were hiding behind organized crime.
The media watchdog group "Articulo 19" has attributed more than half of the attacks on journalists to police and officials last year.
“In Mexico, you die because they want you to shut up,” Ramirez said.
Obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas Cartel: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones were next to her detached head.
Some branches have chosen to close, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue to do so, as did El Manana of Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of its director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their home countries or even the country.
It's a painful decision.
It is hard to find work in exile, and they still watch the streets and look for danger.
And sometimes they are hunted, as it appears to the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who are left behind and continue to work, it is a daily dance with risky choices.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that the drug trade scares him.
“Mexico is going to hell, and that’s why I became a reporter,” he said.
At midnight last Friday, when the last issue was already finished, Riodoce’s editors were sitting on the sidewalk in front of the office drinking beer when all of a sudden their phones started buzzing.
A series of shootings involving gang rivals and security forces near the seaside resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war escalated further, as promised by a number of cartel embassies in the region.
From the curb, they posted the news on Riodoce’s website via mobile phone.
The front page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens roared nearby - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez glanced at the police guards to see if they were ready.
If they were scared at all, they didn’t show it.
Under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible to the whole of Sinaloa, Riodoce employees followed in his footsteps.
“How can you even think of closing,” Bojorquez said, “if the same day Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to send her out to the street for coverage.”
Dinosaurs used camouflage to evade their enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, albeit a frightening one.
Now, researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible rhinoceros of a Canadian miner have been so well preserved that experts have described it as the “Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs.”
It was so well preserved that they could even find that his scaly skin was reddish brown — and they said she had something of a “troublesome past.”
The report in the journal "Current Biology" described him as "the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world."
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaur that lived in the middle Cretaceous between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
Its incredibly well-preserved condition has astonished researchers who describe it as "really remarkable"
According to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivore is the best-preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he dug in the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He encountered something that seemed out of place from the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years uncovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of Earth’s clumps.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
"If you blink a little with your eyes, you could almost believe it slept," said lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature can be seen.
"It will go down in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs."
Researchers have found that although this herbivore is covered with an armor and resembles a walking tank, it was likely threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as countershadow, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed it to better blend in with its surroundings and evade its enemies, experts say, suggesting it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110-million-year-old creature from the Nodosaurus family first made headlines in May and can now be seen in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Boreopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team who spent more than 7,000 hours carefully uncovering it.
The amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor over his body.
They discovered countershadow, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, meaning that the creature's tip was darker than its underside.
Although the countershadowing is common, the results are surprising, as the size of boreal opelta far exceeds that of the animals living today.
It suggests that the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure by carnivorous dinosaurs, that evolution favored the veiling of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals using the countershadow — think of deer, zebras, or belt animals — are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, signaling that this nodosaur was exposed to a real struggle for survival.
"Strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous must have been," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the dinosaur's skin was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to examine the animal for clues about his life, including his preserved gut content, to find out what it ate as his last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sank on his back to the seabed.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as southern Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today.
"This nodosaur is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original shape of the animal," Brown said.
"The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it did in the early Cretaceous.
You don't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. If you just peel a little with your eyes, you could almost believe he's sleeping."
The Cretaceous era was a time when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs, traversed the earth.
Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Boreopelta, the armored dinosaur was chased by some of its terrifying ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11.5 m) long, six-ton monster.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Boreopelta sank in the sea after death and was mummified in the mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he dug in the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is complete from the snout to the hip.
The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch long lace protruding from his shoulders.
The researchers believe that the armored herbivore was swept through western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur preserved its armor in exquisite detail.
The fossilized remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still cover bumpy armored plates along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as rare as a win in the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it gets.
Petrified remains of the skin still cover the bumpy armor plates that carry the animal's skull.
His right forefoot is on his side, his five fingers are spread upwards.
I can count the scales on his sole."
In the thunderstorm: Mass carambola on the A8: Many injured
On Thursday evening on the A8, nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambola.
There are numerous injured, miles of traffic jams - and gaffers.
On the Stuttgart-Munich (A8) motorway, about 20 people were injured in a mass carambolage on late Thursday afternoon.
According to the police, about 5 p.m. between the junctions Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Aichach-Friedberg district) nearly 30 vehicles, including probably trucks, crashed into each other during a thunderstorm.
No information on the exact number of injuries was initially available.
These were mild to moderate injuries, a police spokesman said.
A large number of rescue vehicles were at the scene of the accident.
The A8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich.
In the direction of Munich, a backstack of about ten kilometers was formed.
As one AZ reporter reports, massive disabilities also occurred on the opposite lane - due to numerous gaffers.
The fire department noted the license plates of the drivers, who now face sensitive penalties.
Shortly after 18:45 there was a second accident on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car transporter and a car.
A rescue helicopter was on its way to the scene of the accident.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tests "comfort check-in"
It’s a moment that almost everyone has experienced before: With no idea you’re sitting on the train and sleeping.
Or you are deeply immersed in your work and have just a brilliant thought.
And then, Puffy.
The trainer comes and wakes you up or pulls the passenger out of the middle of the workflow.
Ticket control.
But the times of interruptions are soon over.
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the jobless ticket control.
You simply confirm by phone that you have taken your place and thus devalues the ticket.
A test operation is currently underway on two routes.
"When the offer arrives, let's expand it.
It is then expected to be available on many other long-distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year," said a rail spokesperson.
"Comfort check-in" the train calls the ticket devaluation without Schaffner.
However, in order to be able to use them, you must meet some requirements: You need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you have to have booked an online ticket - which most passengers already do anyway.
You also have to purchase it via the DB Navigator app, which is the most convenient way to book tickets.
And lastly, you need a seat reservation.
Because the "comfort check-in" works like this: You get on the train, call up your ticket under "My Tickets".
A button for electronic devaluation will then appear for the test customers.
The train attendants receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
If the train attendant arrives at the ticket control in place Y, he knows that there is a passenger sitting with an already devalued online ticket.
So you can continue to sleep, continue to work, keep silent.
The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should benefit the passengers.
"If you want to travel relaxed without ticket control by our train attendants, simply check in in the DB Navigator yourself.
This enables passengers to personalise their travel time on the train,” says Michael Peterson, Marketing Board Member of DB Fernverkehr.
Second plus: "And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs".
Those who often travel by train know that in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket controls are among the biggest annoyances.
Because often you have yourself, but in any case one of the fellow travelers does not have all the documents you need to devalue online tickets.
Either the credit card or identity card is missing or a document that you need to present.
The result is endless discussions between train attendants and passengers, which leads to a bad mood in the compartment or ample space and delays in controlling one’s own ticket and in the end takes the time to take care of other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.
And that only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
Other train numbers on the same route have not yet been unlocked.
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question, "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.
Just a day after arriving in New York City, the St. Louis-born was sitting on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled upon a post from someone in high school.
"Police have just killed an 18-year-old child, and it's still on the street," it said.
Confused as no one else had posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle <0x40>TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on her timeline.
The St. Louis area rapper was about to tweet the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown’s lifeless body stretched out on the street and staying there for four hours.
"That's crazy," Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new for them and their community.
She dropped off her phone to return to tweets about people on the Canfield drive later that night.
There were photos of the police tape and people screaming, and of a man claiming to be Brown’s father, who carried a sign that read, “Ferguson’s police just killed my unarmed son!”
She watched a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another policeman unlocked his gun and shouted, "I'm going to kill you... animals all."
"This is not common," Ferrell recalled her statement.
“That’s not the kind of murder we’ve gotten used to and that we can call typical.”
At that moment I felt frostbite.
I was angry and crying.”
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the following three years is the theme of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?", in cinemas from the 11th century onwards.
It is a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and resilience, which is made up from the perspective of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell went to Ferguson with her daughter, wearing a flower dress and a matching crown, the two discussed a conversation they had had countless times before this morning “about the black experience and the black condition.”
"You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in?" she recalled what she said.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.
I couldn't take her with me," Ferrell said later.
"What happened today is a culmination of ... what happened in the past.
She needs to know it and see it and be raised in it.
It must be well developed, knowing not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of black experience and black constitution and what we must do to become free to liberate ourselves.
Even though I am lucky enough to give her an experience where she personally does not experience blatant racism, she is no different from the next black woman-child.
I feel like I would do her a bad service to keep her away from it."
The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a location opposite the police department that became a camp area as the activists waited for the possible non-prosecution of Officer Darren Wilson.
There, Ferrell and her daughter connected with a local business owner who made lunch.
They prepared bags and helped pass them on to protesters.
Slowly, a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.
"My activism has completely changed after August 9," she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association, focusing on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
“I had no experience in organizing.
It's all come."
Weeks later, during an evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to "document" what happened.
A question came to Ferrell’s mind: “Do you want to document or are you trying to find a story you can take advantage of?”
This skepticism was fuelled by countless cases of people, often whites — in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience.
As Folayan recently explained in an interview, "We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already worked with then-co-director Damon Davis, an artist in the field known for his activism around death row inmates.
His involvement brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals, followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years following Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us, we are talking," Davis said.
"That was the main thing for me how these people are portrayed, because that is how I will be portrayed."
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell’s experience – to show that the movement “is not a messianic leader, but a community coming together,” Folayan said – she proved to be the most open participant in the film.
As a result, documents from "Whose Streets?" surprisingly show personal aspects of Ferrell's life as she falls in love and marries her wife.
"I felt like naked," Ferrell said, laughing when she first saw the finished product.
"But I understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people."
In addition, Ferrell’s story reiterates the role of black gay women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, who shaped the movie "BlacklivesMatter" on social media after the killing of black teen Trayvon Martin in 2012, identify as gay.
"Black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement as a whole," Ferrell said, "and that's why we're constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, gay women have to bear the main burden of everything."
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really upheld by black women and many black women."
However, she insists that "this is not an affirmative type of action", where Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film due to her identity.
"She was the person who stirred up that energy," she said.
“It’s no coincidence, even though she was at the forefront, because a life at these intersections as a black, gay woman is so much at stake.
You can feel their energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial ties between the community and the police continue.
Ferrell is on probation for two and a half years for blocking a highway during a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "A chaos".
Nevertheless, she clings to a song and feels committed to that memory since she took to the streets in Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains.”
From "dream" to "great madness": TV readers discuss bit gallery
The bit gallery moves people even though it is far from being built.
But the idea of a shopping mall at the south end of the pedestrian zone has divided the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
Cold the issue hardly leaves anyone.
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg".
While some say to the bit gallery: "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really great" (Nicole Schausten), from the other side comes: "Don't need a man" (Siggi Betzen) or simply: "Madness!" (Lars Scholz).
While supporters are relying on a gallery to attract more customers to the city, which will benefit the rest of the shops, opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then bleed out.
In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the site where the farmers’ market hall is located, where 13 direct marketers offer their products.
With the start of construction work, this will be over.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building – to the Beda square with the possibility to sit outside.
Simone Zimmer: "We have been buying in the Bauernmarkthalle almost every week for many years.
Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the rural women always very much like.
We also discovered the butchery for ourselves.
We would like to have a chance to maintain this offer even during and above all after the construction of the gallery.
In other cities there is also.
The Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt in particular is interesting."
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of rent.
However, it is not likely to be low in the new project.”
Eva Kilic: "Why shopping palaces in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drug stores or supermarkets: I find this superfluous.
There are enough of them in our city.
You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.
However, since there is not even a proper weekly market here, it is all the more important that at least the market hall is preserved for us.
After all, the goods offered there are fresh, are mostly offered directly by the producer and are also inexpensive.
As you can see, shops in a mall are only rented by larger companies, because the rents there are often not portable for a retailer.
Too bad, there are almost no more specialty stores and what is left of it will probably disappear."
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping mall with a market hall does not fit together for me.
And the gallery does not fit Bitburg.
Above all, where should the farmers’ market hall go during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run, if the bit gallery actually comes at some point.
Or does the ghost Bit-Galerie manage to sell all the shops from Bitburg beforehand?"
George Marquet: “It just won’t work.
And no one needs a shopping center that is empty.
In my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farmers market instead of this gallery.
But thanks to the insanely many - as I find - meaningless construction projects in Bitburg, there is no longer any room for a farmers' market hall.
If the farmer's market hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear again."
A matching resemblance: Artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning’s DNA
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces can be seen - white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptibly similar - hanging on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheek pads and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the excerpts from the Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after she made secret diplomatic reports public through the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Ressemblance.
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined her expertise in technology, computer science, and art, and Manning, a transgender woman and groundbreaking dissident whose condemnation was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in office.
Dewey-Hagborg, through the algorithmic analysis of the DNA extracted from Manning and from which 30 portraits were created of how someone might look with these genomic data, has created a sharp, though somewhat intellectual, commentary not only on the malleability of DNA data — the many ways in which it can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations — but also on identity.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward, but has spoken openly about identifying as a woman since puberty, was convicted in 2013 of 20 charges, including six violations of the Espionage Act, computer fraud and theft.
Her image was suppressed by the prison, so much so that there was only one photo — a granular black and white selfie in which Manning was apparently uncomfortable sitting on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum-blonde wig — with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came just from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette stump and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to create a picture of what these people might look like.
That was when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.
"They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted some kind of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg said in a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn’t visit at that time and she couldn’t be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal letter friends who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, “Suppressed Images,” which foresaw a future in which President Chelsea would transform the verdict and she would be able to see the exhibition in person.
That Obama would actually demand Manning’s release after seven brutal years in a Kansas military prison just days after the book was published was a welcome kind of happy meeting.
There is also something deep and strong now at the opening of the exhibition as Donald Trump wages a war against government camp informants and transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to further inflame the rigid divisions he was supposed to fix.
When asked about the strange timing of all these things, Dewey-Hagborg said that "things happen for a certain reason."
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning, with her oversized signature below (the "i" in her surname is provided with a heart), demanded an end to "automatic fragmentation, the basis of which has been gender, race, sexuality and culture."
On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a millipede of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by including the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the artist’s sophisticated scientific dictionary) how surprisingly similar, at least biologically, we all are.
"What people hopefully will take away from this is that our genome doesn't care who we are and how open genetic data is to interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, is also on display.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so that's 30 of those stories."
The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is a page from the above-mentioned comic novel.
She shows Manning emerge from the United States discipline barracks like King-Kong with a hands-free phone in her hand.
"If they put your speech cold, then they won," it says.
"So never shut your mouth".
"It came straight from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist, who greets from Philadelphia.
"I still get goosebumps when I talk about it."
Manning has not yet personally seen the exhibition – as foreshadowed in the comic book – but if she should do so, then she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, by her own genomic simulator circles, clustering together like hordes of protesters.
This was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5<0xE2><0x80><0xB2><0xE2><0x80><0xB2>2, Manning’s stature), where her genetic haplogroups were written with a pencil.
"In the past, I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind their liberation."
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of the University of Oxford wanted for murder
A nationwide human chase is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University who are being sought as suspects after a man was stabbed in a luxury apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries.
On Monday, arrest warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for murder for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as the files of the Cook County District Court show.
The documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stings.
A joint warning system published by the Chicago Police Department states that the body was discovered on July 27.
Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the scene of the incident, and detectives are investigating the stings as murder while police are actively searching for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president of university relations, said in an email statement that Lathem had now been on leave and was barred from entering the Northwestern University campus.
"This is now a criminal matter being investigated by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior treasury assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesman for the university and Somerville College said in an email statement that “we are in contact with the police in the UK and ready to help the U.S. investigative authorities in any way imaginable.”
The statement added that Warren’s colleagues were shocked and want him to stand up.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he urged the suspects to face the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them are intensifying," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building administrator of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious tip stating that something had happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident also occurred on July 27.
Security cameras confirmed that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
The Grand Plaza management team released a statement to the residents: "Police are currently working on the victim's timeline and background, exploring a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
"We will complete the WADA roadmap in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not take long for the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) to be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has been granted the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this regard,” Mutko said on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of WADA’s roadmap for compliance with the code, which describes the criteria for the re-establishment of RUSADA and was recently published on the organization’s website.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that could cause concern for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything is being implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future,” he added.
However, one of the criteria listed in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the WADA-approved investigation by Canadian attorney Richard McLaren into alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sports.
Regarding the matter, Mutko said: “We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has admitted a flaw.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no government programs, and we will not admit something that doesn’t exist.”
Mutko’s words were consistent with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian anti-doping commission.
Speaking to Russian retailer RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov admitted past problems in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one intends to accept this report unconditionally," Smirnov added.
RUSADA was banned from conducting doping controls in Russia in November 2015 in the wake of the WADA doping scandal.
However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
Following a visit to the organization's headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA is "moving in the right direction" to be re-employed.
Aldi no longer sells eggs
This was reported by the corporate groups.
It was a purely precautionary measure that no further health impairment could be assumed, the communication said.
From now on, only eggs should be delivered to Aldi, which have been tested negative for fipronil-containing anti-lice.
Aldi wants to bring clarity and transparency to its customers.
The Startups That Will Help Your Business Not Become the Next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure your employee’s luck with your ecommerce startup, but the surveys didn’t work.
Answers were often vague, unhelpful or, worse, fraudulent.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers didn’t trust the process.
“There just never was consistency and objectivity,” said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed.
She called for help from outside.
A new breed of human resources start-ups is growing to help companies figure out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to conduct surveys, target special groups and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass the C-Suite executives and contact the Board of Directors directly.
“You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit to track their health, but where is Fitbit for your business?” said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said they gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel over the three years with Glint.
In addition to snap surveys and surveys from specific teams, it provides a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives have low approval results – so you can drill down why.
Companies come to realize that staying at the forefront of workplace culture must not make you the next Uber to get involved in scandals since a former employee posted a blog post describing an environment of harassment punishing those who spoke.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation, and compliance industry could be worth more than $118.7 billion in 2020, according to financial engineering website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increase in interest and activity earlier this year amid the Uber case in discredit.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently signed up as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send customized “pulse” surveys, collect confidential answers in real time, and view the heat maps of your problem areas.
It also provides an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if the CEO is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.
“The court of public opinion has caught up with regulators,” said Patrick Quinlan, Convercent’s founder and managing director.
If a company is found to be mistreating its employees or behaving unethically, it can experience costly consequences due to consumer boycott, employee fluctuation, and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has deployed Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.
In the past, when an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters, file a formal complaint, and hope that he or she was taken seriously.
It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday’s General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track employees’ complaints.
Now that the company is using Convercent, issues previously concealed by executives sitting in offices in cities or states—such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair practices—can be identified and addressed more quickly.
“I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view of employment experience,” said Vitrano, who heads the Ruby Tuesday risk management group.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment litigation."
Companies began to take ethics, values, and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations caused by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took until the “social media came to their right” that companies realized they couldn’t stop their dirty laundry going online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging companies with recurring fees for using their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in funding in February from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.
Glittern secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing its total funding to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising, given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today’s employees expect more from their jobs than before.
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are just stakes.
Employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you are giving your time to a company with a positive mission.
“If people are happy to be in a company, feel that their voices are heard, and that the work you do is worthwhile, then they feel more committed to making that company successful,” said Nina McQueen, vice president of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, who uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well. Companies run well when employees are committed and engaged.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee engagement and dedication, it’s no wonder you’ll find support.
The data on employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture important.
But the data is useless if a company’s managers do not take action.
In fact, if a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on its way.
And if the change doesn’t come fast enough, or not at all, it can breed disappointment and demotivate employees.
“If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you have to be ready to have 4,000 conversations,” said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the business management firm Kotter International, which has seen companies relying too much on data collection.
"Because if you don't follow employees will ask themselves, 'Did you really hear me?
Do you take care of it?
And who you don't care about, why should I?"
Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint, according to Errett.
And after gathering feedback from frustrated employees, due to the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company is constantly gaining new insights about employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this will lead to better employee retention in an industry that is known for high revenues.
“If you’re not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you’re going to lose people,” Vitrano said.
“And if you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you will lose businesses.
The NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins
It’s about 11 p.m. when a lot of UCLA football players are chatting on one side of the team’s new practice fields on campus.
Some have removed their jersey uppers and show their backs full of sweat from the first day of training camp.
For a good part of the team, these idle minutes represent a lunch break.
Players enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Wasserman Football Center the next morning at 6:30 a.m.
"This is a real treadmill for the boys for the next three days," said Bruins coach Jim Mora shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease players’ burden, and it has actually extended its days – at least until the final on Friday.
Therefore, the first three UCLA training sessions should begin at 7:15 p.m. to meet the players’ already packed schedules.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and performed practical exercises for the first time during summer school during Moras’ six seasons in Westwood.
They are scheduled to hold 18 exercises during August, 20 before the formal game preparations for their September start against Texas A&M.
Mora said he supports the NCAA's rule change, even if it adds another point to the busy routes of the players.
"We put this enormous burden on them for three or four days, and it's very challenging," Mora said.
"And they just pushed it through, they're sticking around, they're great people.
I think as soon as we get to Saturday and we have more time, it will be really great."
UCLA will end its practices once the camp is finished, which will not be an easy task given the clear lines of its fields from an adjoining parking lot and the adjoining Luskin Center, a high-class hotel that has already been thrown with soccer balls clearing a protective net behind a goalpost.
Bruins players are scheduled to occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora admitted that there could be a problem once those rooms are free during the season.
"We will use our security," Mora said.
"That's a real problem, and it's not far-fetched to think that people rent a room there and then get ready to record an exercise.
If you have the video tape from an exercise, it’s a pretty good deal.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces in parking lot 8.
We will do the best we can with what we have.
That's why I'm not too worried.
We have a plan."
Facebook wants to intensify fact-checking in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential fake news articles to third-party fact verifiers and then display their results under the original post, the world’s largest online social network said on Thursday. It is one of its efforts to combat so-called fake news.
The company said in a statement on its website that it will start using updated machine learning methods to detect potential fake news and send it to fact reviewers who may show results from the fact review from the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, many of which believe have also influenced the 2016 US presidential election.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with French voters flooded with false stories in the run-up to the May presidential elections, and Germany supporting a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hateful postings as they did before the September elections there.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fact-checking will be launched in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to recognizing what stories are being challenged by third-party fact verifiers, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share,” Sara Su, product manager for Facebook news, said in a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its "related article" feature and is working on other changes to its news feed to reduce false news.
Creating a Comic-Roman: A Castle in the History of England
In its recent past, Little Scotney Castle was featured in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from its cozy Bewl River Valley in Kent, and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophary Yorkshireman with a fondness for historical documents.
"I think it's so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who's been dead for 300 years," he says wretchedly.
"What a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand."
'A Castle in England' spans the period from the Middle Ages to the Ages of Edward, documenting the families who lived in Scotney. Each story was illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It’s not Rhodes’ first book based on an archive: he wrote in 2014 ‘Dead Men’s Teeth and Other Stories’, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library – a project he unexpectedly found emotional.
"I only reacted to the thumbprint on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobins," he says.
"That's his thumbprint!
And letters always smell like smoke, because then a fire was lit because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if he were there too.
I love the archives!”
For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is backed by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest, I've overrated my welcome"), all this seems too beautiful to be true.
Rhodes spent its days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, looking through the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the trench.
He wandered through the site and the ruins of the old castle and spoke to landscapers, gardeners and sometimes even to the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank "whiskey and started writing".
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust did not receive full access until 2006, when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees were just beginning to take care of the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said "Oh, throw it in the attic."
Diary, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps depicting who owned what: "You might think land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch that the two families fought for.
Boys, let everything go its course!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history on a broader basis, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.
"There is a record of a riot that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book titled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex,'" says Rhodes.
"The peasant uprising started in this area and I thought a uprising was a good start.
Maybe they’re both connected?”
Other stories are firmly rooted in the castle’s history – like ‘The Priest’, which tells the story of the Jesuit Father, whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', portraying 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery made years later when his coffin was excavated).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family of Scotney: "The gentlemen seemed to be pretty crooks, always making debts and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men triggered their debt crises by marrying rich old women -- I imagine them as a bunch of good-looking guys, with a talent for advertising inheritances."
After his deployment at the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He has spent a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of an early 20th-century sanatorium that has since been demanded back by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go again," he says.
It was like, "Oh, now I have to deal with this damn life again."
Campaign launched: Over 300-year-old Mary Chapel in Rhöndorf covered
With the concealment of the 301-year-old Chapel of the Virgin Mary in Rhöndorf, the city of Bad Honnef has launched its campaign on Friday to introduce a new umbrella brand (Roundshow of Thursday).
Until Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret.
At the end of August, the highlight of the campaign will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth.
"Too nice for us.
Or?", ask the creators of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorfer Kapelle.
“We don’t (of course!) really think that,” they write on their website unlocked yesterday.
"But we're using this measure to get your attention.
And to make it clear that some things are better than they seem.
Basically, we are firmly convinced that we as citizens of Bad Honnefer know very well about the beauty and attractiveness of our city."
The action is about more than “just” a logo and a slogan, it goes on to say.
"It is important to formulate a stand-alone promise, one that gives the city a distinctive stand-alone feature".
It is in competition with other municipalities.
For an average five-digit amount, the city of Bad Honnef can cost its new umbrella brand and the campaign.
Military Reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's Fear of the Army
Every year at the beginning of August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) in Ankara discusses retirements and promotions in the officer corps.
So too this week.
At first glance, this is a normal process.
But nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt.
The meeting no longer took place in the building of the General Staff, as before, but in the office of the Prime Minister.
The five Vice-Premier Ministers and the Ministers of Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs also took part in the discussions under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister.
The civilians in the YAS were in overnumeration.
The government is pulling the reins in the military.
Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, but Army, Air Force and Navy commanders have been deposed.
Since the failed coup, Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
Over 10,000 soldiers have been removed from the ranks of the army – mostly because of alleged links to the movement of the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, whom Erdogan sees as the pulling wire of the coup attempt.
486 people alleged to have been directly involved in the coup attempt are being negotiated in Ankara since this week.
Already the day after the coup, Erdogan had described the attempted overthrow as a "gift of God" because he gave him the opportunity to "completely cleanse the armed forces".
But does Erdogan really control the army?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article titled "Uncomfort in the military headquarters".
In the general staff, there are concerns about an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which manifests itself in the lifting of the headscarf ban on female soldiers, the newspaper wrote.
In any case, the cleansing of the army and the security forces continues.
In mid-July, Erdogan ordered the firing of 7,395 other officials, including 2,303 police officers and 546 soldiers.
It was as if Erdogan had tamed the military.
The generals used to be considered the real masters of the country.
Three times they cleaned up, citing their role as guardians of the secular state order.
After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed back the power of the military step by step, not least in reference to the European Union’s reform goals.
Former officers say Erdogan is targeting Islamization of the armed forces.
In the magazine "Vocal Europe", an unnamed officer who sought asylum after the coup attempt out of fear of persecution abroad warned that the Turkish army will be "full of extremists and salafists" in a few years.
If this is true, such a development could not leave NATO cold.
However, after the purges, there are doubts in the Alliance about the readiness of the Turkish army to deploy.
Leadership structures and operational capabilities are “weakened,” NATO diplomats say.
Washington Changes the Rules of the Green Card
There will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of the green card, President Donald Trump said, quoted by the media.
It plans to reduce legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter visa requirements for temporary work permits and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the president.
The bill will be discussed in the two chambers of Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do so by changing the way the United States spends green cards on citizens from other countries.”
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy,” Trump said.
Ministry wants to renovate track for Rennsteigshuttle
Over the past few months, there has been a lot of disputes over the future of the race-path shuttle - now it should go very fast.
Even before the end of the year, construction is to be done on the barren route on which the tourist railway runs.
In order to secure the future of the racetrack shuttle in the long term, according to the Ministry of Transport, construction work on the track is to begin this year.
"With the decision to continue ordering and renovating the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country is committed to this connection, which is especially important for tourism," Transport Secretary Klaus Sühl said on Friday in Erfurt.
The cost of repairing the route amounted to about 2.5 million euros.
Of this sum, the country will take over 75 percent.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle will continue to be ordered from the country, is currently being finalized, Sühl explained.
The Ministry and Südthüringen Bahn as operators have already agreed on the technical details.
"The timetable, the vehicles used and the quality standards are thus negotiated," said Sühl.
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of eleven years.
This means that the Rennsteig shuttle will be ordered on a regular basis in December 2017.
The Rennsteig-Shuttle is a popular train connection between the stations of Ilmenau and Rennsteig.
In recent months, it has been tested in the course of a pilot operation, whether the route is used by enough people to order it again regularly in the future.
The route is also very destructive in parts.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry
Just as you thought it couldn’t get any crazy in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots comes out.
Yeah, actually.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must begin to take its rise seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.
“People are making fun of them, but the companies are delivering a lot of it, and we’re going to see them even more often,” Mr. Sharkey said in the release of his new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm – with deliberately human responses achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "customize" his robot according to his beliefs, selecting everything from the color of the robot's eyes to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it gets even more troubling, as many robots possess the “personalities” that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin.
The RealBotix robot, for example, allows its users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah", which conveys the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.
“Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as well adapted to your personality as possible,” the True Companion website says.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has her moods throughout the day - just like real people!
She may be tired, obsessed with conversation, or she may be “in the mood”!
There are many disturbing aspects to this rise of sex robots — not least because they replace real human relationships — but the submissive feminine traits, the allusions to rape, when one takes a step on frigid (called here: reluctant) Farrah, disturb one the most.
On his website, True Companion compared Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men have a Roxxxy?"
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing sophistication indicate something darker and deeper in our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.
Of course, most men will not hold sex robots, and while the FRR notes their increasing popularity, they still remain on the brink of consumer culture for the time being.
But what leaks from the margins can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time we live in.
And many people aren’t weird or insulting until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is some overlap that these sophisticated sex robots are emerging at a time when women’s rights are under threat worldwide, when there is a president in the White House who has boasted of sexually assaulting women.
The most daunting aspect of the TV series 'The Handmaid's Tale' ('The Report of the Maid') is not the graphic images, the entangled bodies and the stabbed eyes, but how realistic this vision seems.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it doesn’t feel like a big leap.
The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as technically possible (although with pornstar proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human, to imitate the movement of a real body.
But, to the point, when it comes to their “personalities,” the robots are not real women.
You can't separate from your companion or just walk away.
They have no mediation or background history, nothing that suggests independence or anything that might disturb the imagination of total submission.
In other words, they are pleasing slaves.
Or, to put it another way, in 2017: maid
Trump's great achievement?
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense
It has become a Trump-era bias that the political divisions that have polarized the U.S. electorate have also split families in small format.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the U.S. with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump’s voting relatives.
We’re all supposedly striving to let our filter bubbles burst.
Less has been noted is Trump’s power to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has been dealing with the Republicans in our family for a long time, visited me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican kin she’s been fighting for decades because of politics, is suddenly on the same side.
This is certainly a good thing around the dining table, but it strikes me in another context that this also involves significant risks.
The left has been strengthened by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we talk about “normalization” and Trump, we’re referring to the scary possibility that someday his fairies won’t repel us anymore.
However, there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump “normalizes” right-wing Republicans who suddenly appear to be the epitome of reasonableness when compared to his standards.
I find myself infested with an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney’s hilarious version of the madman—the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like)—both of which, in fact, appear to be a very mild offense when compared to Trump.
If Trump leaves, the next Republican candidate only needs to be mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in town, we took our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousels in the New York Park Department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city when you don’t need caffeine.
The horses are huge, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all the clowns are growling and the animals twist to look over their own shoulders full of fear - extremely dark and the clumsy music conveys this in a strange way.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings are getting old, the skylines are becoming too familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city does not live up to the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I’m still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss cottage – the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage doesn’t count – but a big roundabout in the north of London.
However, the Central Park Carousel is still a strange magical experience, as here two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in their 40s can walk on it and all have a great time.
If I could have rated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked for it.
On the other hand, this week in a department store, I was forced to rate my “experience” with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could withdraw my credit card.
In the coffee shop at the corner of my street, it’s the same thing, plus the option to match the rating with a 15% tip – this to buy something over the counter.
This not only slows down what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also puts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is required.
The poor woman in the department store stood apologetically grinning while I was tired of the experience of handing her my five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain
Pistorius has left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time.
Last year, he was taken to the hospital for the treatment of incisions on his wrists, which he suffered, according to prison authorities, after a case in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder following an appeal by prosecutors against a first homicide conviction.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine’s Day 2013 by shooting her several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his Pretoria home.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a nighttime intruder hiding in the cabin.
The prosecutors have announced their intention this time to appeal against Pistorius’ six-year prison sentence, which they say is too indulgent.
The National Law Enforcement Authority said it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the appeal could be heard this year.
Pistorius runs the risk of his sentence being increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When Farmer Arnold Finds a Strange Egg
As the last of the Blumberger schools, the fourth graders from Fützen and Epfenhofen were dismissed for the holidays and in the secondary schools.
Three of the discharged students will go to high school in the future, four to secondary school.
On Tuesday evening, school principal Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen.
As a symbol of school dismissal, the 29 students of the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose a young eagle that grew up in the chicken farm, but was then released into freedom.
To this end, the cheerful crowd performed a musical titled "The Eagle in the Chicken Farm".
Farmer Arnold found a strange egg, and had it hatched from his chickens.
Instead of a chicken, a small eagle came out.
But the hope of turning it into a chicken broke, the eagle spread out its wings on a high mountain and disappeared.
Afterwards, classes three and four showed a chicken dance in Yvonne Frank’s study.
The hens danced with the young goggles who carried cylinders to bet.
The eagle stands for integration, said school principal Angelika Sitte.
The young animal is different from the other young animals (chickens), but belongs to them.
He will never be like a chicken.
His destiny is to be free.
She wished every fourth grader that he would feel accepted in his new school.
The following words of thanks were addressed to the colleagues, the former head of the school Michael Müller, who repeatedly intervenes in case of tuition bottlenecks, and the parents’ representatives.
The chick age is now over, explained classroom teacher Sophia Schumacher.
She dismissed her students after two years of teaching because it had been a really great time.
In the end, she was able to rely on the fourth graders.
At the end of the day, all the students sang a song about summer time and holiday time.
There was great joy in the children.
Eight first graders are already registered for the new school year.
Two Bulgarians Arrested for Illegal Camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians have been detained for illegal camping in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.
On the morning of August 1st, a group of illegally camping people, including the two Bulgarians, was arrested in Sithonia by the police.
They were released on the same day, while an investigation is underway.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported to bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened control over the free camping and impose significant fines on anyone found to be staying in a place not intended for this purpose.
Controls will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said the court could impose a fine.
Software Update for Diesel Vehicles: What Affected Persons Need to Know Now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do diesel drivers have to participate in the action?
The most important questions and answers at a glance.
At the Diesel Summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the exhaust behaviour of cars of the emission classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6.
Euro 4 diesel or worse are excluded.
Anja Smetanin from ACE Auto Club Europa gives assessments:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the software updates negotiated are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates previously only apply to vehicles that have cheat software," says Anja Smetanin.
Their retrofitting has been ordered by the Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt (KBA).
How and when will customers be informed about updates?
The manufacturers have announced a swift implementation in the coming months, but have not yet stated an exact date.
Daimler has announced that it will write to all affected persons.
If an inspection is required, it will be done within the framework of the inspection.
How long will the restructuring take in total?
"It's hard to say," says Smetanin.
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers and on political pressure.
"Because we have seen that car manufacturers are not voluntarily acting on the issue of the environment so far."
How long should the update take?
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
It may be more time consuming to get an appointment.
What do drivers who do not drive cars from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group do?
The ACE advises to wait.
Probably foreign manufacturers would follow suit, according to Smetanin.
Is there a massive price drop for Euro 4 cars?
The ACE fears that.
Especially in areas where driving bans are at risk.
In rural areas, there has been no loss of value for older diesel.
The ACE advises to wait for a sale.
LL Cool J Receives Kennedy Center Award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first award ceremony under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the winners does not want to come – out of protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the coveted awards from the prestigious Kennedy Center.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) as well as choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95) are also honored this year.
The awards will be handed over at the beginning of December.
Traditionally, U.S. President Donald Trump will host a reception and join his wife Melania in the ceremony.
The award winner Lear, who became known with progressive TV series, already announced that he would not participate in the gala.
"This presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights -- even to deprive them of the funds -- and that burdens me."
The 59-year-old Estefan stressed that she will use the conversation with Trump to clarify her point of view.
Named after former President John F. Kennedy, the Kennedy Center is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital.
Previous winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city worth living
Roland Wacker, Haslach’s city builder, will retire next year.
The position is already advertised - however, suitable applicants are rare.
Wacker has been a city builder for 31 years.
And he still enjoys the work, as he conveys in the press conference.
He talks about varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that no application has yet fulfilled the requirement profile.
The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.
In this way, while observing the regular notice periods, there should still be enough time for an introduction.
Since Haslach acts as the lower building law authority for the administrative community, the applicant must present corresponding financial statements.
This is what the city definitely wants to keep.
If she could no longer fill them out, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.
But citizenship is important to the city and to himself, says Wacker, who reports on a good business climate and a good mood between the authorities and citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, several important projects have accumulated, to which Wacker looks back with pride.
"We make the city worth living," he is confident about the construction office and its employees.
But also in the future, varied projects are on the agenda: The redesign of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofen parking lot, for example, have been initiated.
The Kinzig Bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed, and the renovation of the stadium is still an issue.
The latter alone will account for around 1.5 million euros, "if we do it right," estimates Wacker.
"All in all, great tasks await my successor.
The work here is fun."
Designally, there is a lot of room for a city builder.
With Haslach’s own building yard and nursery, many things can be reacted flexibly.
"You can move a lot," said Wacker, and the design of the green areas is often praised by citizens and visitors.
Since the old town as an ensemble is protected as a monument, it is important to "have an eye for what fits in" when new buildings are approved, the leaving city builder emphasizes.
In any case, the city builder has a high responsibility.
He's the builder, "in the end, it's all over my desk."
When it comes to supervision and coordination, he can count on many years of employees: Markus Neumaier (high-rise construction) has been involved for ten years, Manfred Schöner (low-rise construction) for 15 years.
Wacker also wants his successor to stay for a long time: "We are looking for someone who really identifies with the job and wants to stay".
Continuity is important not only for a good business climate, but also for the further design of the city.
If you would like to inherit Roland Wacker, you should, according to the information provided by the city of Haslach, be able to have a completed degree as a graduate engineer or bachelor with a specialization in architecture and have good specialist knowledge in the areas of building regulations and building planning law.
The city building office is subject to civil engineering, construction planning, land acquisition matters, administration of the municipal properties, the municipal farm with building yard and city garden, and the lower building law authority, including the protection of monuments.
Bicycle thrown on wires: South Railway line closed
According to police, the hitherto unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway crossing in the area of Leobener Straße (B116) onto the lines.
They were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.
The investigators depart from two male perpetrators and have been searching for them since night hours.
Near the scene of the crime, a pink scooter and a bicycle driver had been observed by witnesses.
"This goes far beyond a Lausbuben prank," <0xC3><0x96>BB spokesman Christoph Posch told the APA.
The perpetrator or perpetrators would have put themselves in great danger and also endangered train traffic.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant, as well as the delayed minutes and the costs of rail replacement, penalties of rail customers could also be applied to the perpetrators.
Overall, a "significant" sum was to be assumed, the spokesman said.
The damage was repaired on Friday afternoon, the rail traffic on the southern railway line could be managed without any obstacles.
Nearly ten passenger trains had failed on Friday morning, two of them related to long-distance transport.
Freight trains did not fail, but they were delayed.
According to <0xC3><0x96>BB spokesman Christoph Posch, about 200 meters of overhead lines had to be replaced.
Insulators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help alleviate IBD (Inflammatory Bowel Disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare to your digestive system.
But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable condition, which affects around 1.3 million in the U.S. and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan from proteins helps develop immune cells that promote a more tolerant gut.
The lead researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells patrol the gut to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food do not penetrate the body.
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance tends too far in the direction of inflammation, this can result in an inflammatory bowel disease.
In experiments, it was found that a type of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a particular bacterium in their intestines.
And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said: “We have established a link between a species of bacteria – Lactobacillus reuteri – which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more they had from these immune cells.”
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promotes more tolerant, less inflammatory intestinal environments when the same system also works in humans.
Postdoctoral fellow Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found out that one group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same strain, but housed separately, did not.
She suspected that the difference had to do with the mice’s gut microbiomes – the community of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The intestines of the mice were DNA sequenced and six bacterial species were found that were present in the mice with the immune cells, but without them were missing in the mice.
Mice were raised in a sterile environment, so they lacked a gut microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells formed.
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers allowed L. reuteri to grow in a liquid, then transferred small amounts of the liquid — without the bacteria — to immature immune cells isolated from the mice.
The immune cells evolved into the tolerance-promoting cells.
When the active component was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indole-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice’s food, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said, “The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.
Potentially, high tryptophan levels in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population."
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United has committed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic
At Manchester United, Nemanja Matic has signed a "genius", believes Jose Mourinho after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
Chelsea’s <0xC2><0xA3>40 million signing began with a 2-1 win in Dublin, the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup starts against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed in the holder role as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira advance at will.
However, Matic had been excluded from the blues' pre-Asia tour and only managed 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
"We will help him be ready sooner rather than later."
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started at Aviva Stadium when Mourinho formed his start-XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more new commitments, but he insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic job" of fulfilling three of his four priority new commitments.
"To get three out of four, I thank the club for that," he added.
"I'll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they've put a lot of effort into it."
Boeing "paints" Dreamliner into the sky
The American aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a dreamliner in the sky.
The pilots flew off from Seattle, Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette, Michigan, and pulled over the United States in the form of a dreamliner, which is several thousand kilometers.
The action lasted 18 hours and a minute.
On the radar screens was to be the shape of a dreamliner.
The whole thing was a stamina test for new engines.
Boeing had already made such advertising before.
Thus the number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted into the sky.
New low for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem
When Sigmar Gabriel was still the head of the SPD, Social Democratic Prime Ministers always looked to Berlin with some concern before elections.
Just no stirring fire from the party headquarters, just no headwind from the federal government – that was the most important wish of the campaigners.
Since Martin Schulz led the party, this has changed fundamentally.
Since then, employees from the Willy-Brandt-Haus have been watching events in the SPD-run state capitals with growing horror.
What Schulz got from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach.
They were lows.
One by one.
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the Federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of the SPD and the Greens.
"This shows once again: Red-Green simply cannot govern reliably," CDU Secretary General Peter Tauber told the editorial network Germany (RND).
The surprising departure of a Green MP has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the parliamentary elections, his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the opposition from the CDU and FDP.
Federal Greens Managing Director Michael Kellner has urged the resigned Lower Saxony Greens MP Elke Twesten to return her mandate.
The transition to the CDU means a clear distortion of the will of the electorate.
Elke Twesten must immediately return her mandate," said the Federal Managing Director and campaign leader of the Greens to the Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
"This must not be true at all," sighs an SPD campaigner when the new Job message reaches the party headquarters on Friday morning.
Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, is there after the transition of the Green MP Elke Twesten to the CDU without its own government majority.
It is the preliminary culmination of a whole series of major and minor crises in SPD country associations.
And no one knows what comes next.
The misery began with the unexpectedly clear defeat at the Saarland elections in March.
A blue eye, nothing more, the comrades calmed down at the time.
After the state elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.
And so it was, and everything got much worse.
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to the brink, the Düsseldorf bankruptcy smoothly overthrew the party.
It was difficult for the comrades to recover in the weeks afterwards.
Then, when they had just taken new courage, came the G-20 summit of Hamburg.
And with him came the next low.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD head of state, lost his nimbus that weekend because he sat in the Elbphilharmonie while his city was burning.
And because he did pretty much everything wrong in crisis communication after that, which one can do wrong.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
And now, Stephan Weil.
Due to the VW exhaust gas affair and his role on the Supervisory Board, the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been criticized for a long time.
My survey scores were added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps precisely for this reason, Weil has been increasingly trying to put accents in the federal government in recent weeks.
The efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin were not hidden from comrades in the vicinity of Martin Schulz.
They allowed it to be granted, since they promised themselves from Weil a stabilization of the party.
Now the exact opposite could happen.
There is basically no blame on Weil for the internal party dispute of the Lower Saxony Greens.
And not Schulz at all.
For the time being, therefore, the comrades strive to keep their own ranks closed.
Her anger is directed at the Greens, and here above all at the apostate MEP Twesten.
"It is intolerable and damaging to democracy how Mrs. Twesten places her own career interests above the interests of everyone else," says Matthias Miersch, head of the party's left in the SPD parliamentary group, the Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
Ms Twesten has not been elected to parliament because of her personality as a direct candidate, but via the country list of the Lower Saxony Greens, according to the Lower Saxony MP.
The logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD Bundestag faction, laments an "undemocratic maneuver".
"The will of the electorate four years ago was clear: The people made Stephan Weil Prime Minister," says Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as the top candidate in the Bundestag election, the RND.
"Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU MP distorts the election result," Oppermann continued.
He asked to clarify the background.
I want to know if there has been more or if there have been further commitments from the CDU Lower Saxony.
Subsidies for town centre III
If you want to renovate your old house, you can soon get support from the country.
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG Urban Development informed about this on Wednesday in Empfingen.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler once again gave a review of what had happened so far.
Since 1991 there have been refurbishment areas in Empfingen.
At that time, in renovation area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg still took over two-thirds of the funding amount.
In Renovation Area II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still 60 percent.
For Schindler, the renovations so far have been a "successful project" - it is also important to promote interior development, and not just to open up new construction areas.
On 4 April, the Karlsruhe Government Bureau received the information that there will be a renovation area III.
The funding amount is 833 333 euros, of which 500,000 euros come from the countryside, the rest from the municipality of Empffingen.
How is a renovation area created?
Schindler continues to investigate where the "really old" houses are.
However, it also plays a role whether there is any interest in the planned area to renovate.
If necessary, the area boundaries could then be shifted again.
The STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening.
Keller presented the contents of the federal-country program "Social City", under which the renovations would then be carried out.
The core of the programme is the revitalisation of inner cities, the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out on an object-based basis, i.e. per plot of land.
The renovation area would then finally be defined as a statute.
The grant period for the grants runs from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.
By September this year, however, the inventory would be carried out, within the framework of which those involved in the renovation area would receive a questionnaire to fill out.
In November or December, as far as possible, the statutory decision should be made, so that the renovations can begin next year.
Pietzschmann then explained that each municipality had to carry out the said preliminary investigations.
It is a matter of assessing the urban deficiencies and deciding when and to what extent they will be rehabilitated.
A renovation note will then also be entered in the land register for the respective property.
Pietzschmann himself would come to Empfingen again and get a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that a key success factor for the project was the involvement of the parties involved.
Therefore, there will be questionnaires that will be sent by post to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled out by the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "Building and Land Arch", which deals with, among other things, the building condition and the renovation intentions.
In the grey questionnaire, the "Household and Housing Sheet", information can be given about the size, distribution and occupants of a living space.
The blue "Operation Sheet" is only to be filled in if business premises are operated in the building.
However, it should be noted that Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not simultaneously an application for funding.
In addition, new construction measures are not eligible.
Schindler also emphasized that the distribution of funding works according to the "windhound principle" - who comes first, grinds first.
You can't "reserve" funding for later.
Finally, photos of the project "Ortkern II" were shown to make a renovation "tasty" for the attendees.
British inventor puts himself a microchip to get into house and car with a gesture of the hand
A British inventor is the first in the country to be equipped with a microchip so that he can open his front door, enter his office, and even start his car with a gesture of his hand.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between his thumb and index finger and now offers the service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq.
He has teamed up with Dr. Geoff Watson, an advisory anesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure is performed to the medical standard.
The technology resembles a cat and dog implanted microchip and lasts only 30 seconds.
Mr. Northam’s company also wants to change the locks on homes and cars to be compatible with the chip, all for an additional fee of <0xC2><0xA3>300 per lock.
The married father of one has now built both at home and in his BMW Z4 technology, which starts when his hand is at the wheel.
White House Advertising Costs Thousands to Taxpayers
The White House’s decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month will cost taxpayers up to $24,000, according to the military’s data handed over to TIME magazine.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was at the heart of the July 17 White House event with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials took a tour of products from all 50 states.
The Connecticut-made helicopter was exhibited alongside a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire truck and a Mississippi forklift.
The White House military office demanded the helicopter's presence in a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," the HMX-1 commander wrote on the eve of the event to his superior, the deputy naval commander for aviation.
The message indicated that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn for the event at 3 p.m. on July 17th at about 7 a.m., and remained until the lawn was cleared between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. that evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House was delayed, a second crew would be needed for the return flight due to the limitation of service hours.
The original flight crew was with the helicopter during the event, while the unit's security personnel stayed with the aircraft during the time on the ground.
It was not clear from the records made available to TIME whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the determination.
"One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you're locked up," replied the deputy commander.
The "Made in America" event was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political overtones.
At the event, the president gave a boost to the reform of health care reform that was underway in the Senate, and he promoted efforts to curb government regulations.
The use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, for politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are required to use them for the trip.
But requesting their use only for a photo surgery is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February when the presidential plane was providing taxi services against the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of reports complaining about its predecessor’s use of the presidential plane.
“The White House is excited about the show ‘Made In America’ — which shows products from all 50 states made by American workers using American materials,” said White House Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews frequently conduct training flights in the Washington area and South Lawn to defeat the U.S. president in the White House with precise inch sets.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 conducted 58 practice landings in the White House.
The flight for the “Made in America” event counted among the flight crew’s training needs for the month, an official said.
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions."
The White House said taxpayers were not taking the burden of any of the other props presented at the event.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in exhibiting the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep any budget records for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to U.S. Department of Defense’s hourly tariffs for the 2017 fiscal year, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
Records of the unit record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico, Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below that rate.
“Determining the cost to taxpayers on the basis of the estimates for reimbursement rates is highly misleading,” Walters said.
“These estimates include personnel, maintenance, and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual appropriations.”
According to a 2015 RAND study, the DoD reimbursement rates do not include personnel costs, but take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance, and contract conclusion.
At that time, former White House press spokesman Sean Spicer defended the helicopter's use for the event.
“The idea is to present things that are made in America this week,” Spicer said.
And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they are contributing to our national security, and I assume hundreds, if not thousands, of people are dependent on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.
It is, of course, appropriate to highlight this."
It was not clear whether Trump was interacting with the helicopter as he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver's seat of a fire truck.
In the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president, "I have three of them."
TC BW Neuss before a tricky task
Leaders of the Second Tennis Bundesliga compete at the third place in the standings of Suchsdorfer SV.
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will start tomorrow at 11 a.m. in Kiel at the third place in the standings of the Suchsdorfer SV.
Despite five games, the leader of the Second Tennis Bundesliga has retained a sense of reality.
In any case, team leader Marius Zay has respect for the opponent.
"This is a compact team that always plays in quite a similar formation.
Especially in the back positions, I think the team is very good."
Imports from the far north ensure class and stability in the Suchsdorfer SV.
"Their Danes and Finns can even refer to stakes in the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in doubles," says Zay with a view to Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
“It’s going to be hard for us as always.
You need a good portion of happiness.”
The Neuss team for the trip in the high north is practical.
His blue-and-white debut could be made by Maxime Janvier.
Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic), who is currently active in the Challenger Tournament in Biella, Italy, will not be able to make it to the Bundesliga, but will play for the first time this season at the tournament in Liberec.
The previously undefeated Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was on the ball yesterday with the Belarusian Andrei Vasilevski at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel.
He was supposed to be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two wins last Sunday against the club at the Alster, Máté Valkusz could join the team again.
If it is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungarian, who was still the number one in the junior world rankings in January 2016, someone from the coaching staff around Marius Zay fills up the squad.
How America Can Damage the OMV
Donald Trump didn’t seem really happy when he signed his law on Wednesday night to tighten sanctions against Russia.
"In his rush to pass the law," Congress had packaged a few "unconstitutional regulations," he etched.
The response from Moscow was as sharp as expected, and even Brussels foamed against the US push.
After all, the draft provides for penalising European companies that help the Russians build gas pipelines into the EU.
Accordingly, investors of the domestic OMV, which co-finances the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea pipeline Nord Stream 2 together with other European companies, have been concerned since then.
The threat scenery is huge.
Still, it is too early for an assessment of the consequences, according to the official statement of the oil company.
In fact, Donald Trump himself would still have to bring the sanctions to life by executive order.
Twelve weapons are available to him.
"The press" has looked at which the corporation could repel and which could really hurt it.
Narco's Season 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel is in the center of Netflix's hit series
Despite the second season of Narcos unveiling Pablo Escobar’s Killer, Netflix’s series is far from over.
Seasons three and four have already been confirmed by the streaming service, the first received its first trailer and showed the show’s latest villains.
With the third season, the DEA has turned its attention to the world’s richest drug trafficking organization: the Cali cartel.
Led by four powerful godparents, they operate “like a Fortune 500 company” only with more government bribes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican compound, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the guy who invites American and Colombian law enforcement agencies to support the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will begin on September 1.
Role backwards: The city employs 46 kitchen utensils
The city organizes the daycare lunch table itself again.
With permanent contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team.
In the urban day care centers, the clock is turned back.
On 1 September, the city of Krefeld will take over the food supply in the municipal day care facilities (Kitas) on its own.
For Sonja Pommeranz, Deputy Head of the Department of Youth Aid, this is good news: "We were all very pleased".
Cooking continues outside the house: a caterer takes over this task and delivers freshly cooked chilled.
The city operates 46 day care centers in the Krefeld area, in 44 the children get a warm meal at lunchtime.
In the past daycare year, 2,800 children each sat at the tables, and the demand is growing steadily.
"In the meantime, not only children who are cared for 45 hours a week eat lunch in the daycare center," Pommeranz explains.
"The offer also applies to 35-hour care if children stay until 2 p.m."
46 part-time workers have kitchen service from 1 September: they heat the food supplied, supplement it with salad, raw food and fruit, portion the meal individually, spend the food, clean up, rinse and clean the kitchen.
"The employees are fixedly assigned to a nursery," says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two-group as well as seven-group facilities - decides on the amount of hours.
"The kitchen helpers now belong firmly to the nursery team," says Pommeranz satisfied.
"So they are much more involved and it is easier for the kindergarten management to implement educational concepts".
This is what it is all about: healthy eating and cooking lessons.
"Children should help prepare the food".
The direct connection of the kitchen staff to the team makes sense.
Also for the children.
"They have a well-known power in the nursery, a person who is familiar to them, and not constantly changing people".
This continuity is important for the children.
The cleaning of the nursery rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen workers - will be done by special cleaning staff in the future.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has, in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen performance, also the charm that it has proven to be the most economical in the cost comparison between self-regulation and external assignment for the city, according to the press office.
And this, although 46 part-time workers are newly hired.
“But these hours don’t fall so much in the weight of around 750 people in the educational field,” says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women, says UN
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, acting head of the United Nations Mission, said that hundreds of women will run in the provincial council elections. Three women are running for the role of vice president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said in a statement Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are involved in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections will take place on April 5.
The Taliban have issued threats against an election process that coincide with the transition from international combat to an advisory role.

Men try to rob 13-year-old girl
Two young men aged 19 and 23 attempted to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to police information, the men spoke to the 13-year-old, who was staying with friends at Kolpingstraße, about 2:55 p.m., because they wanted to make a phone call with the girl’s cell phone.
The 13-year-old refused the request and went on with her friends.
Then one of the perpetrators tried to grab the girl’s cell phone and necklace, but it failed.
Without prey, the duo fled.
The two young men were later arrested by the police.
Investigations are underway.
GMB Concerns About Investment in McVitie Factory in Glasgow
A union wants to make sure managers of McVitie’s biscuit maker have a long-term commitment to production at their Glasgow plant.
GMB Scotland said the company had been silent about the future of investment at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work in the factory, which manufactures Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits, among other products.
McVity owner Pladis said he has invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in recent years.
He added that employees and union representatives would “be the first to know” if their activities changed.
In a letter to the company’s branch manager, GMB Scotland urged McVitie’s to “express concerns that funding for the modernization of production lines will not be driven forward.”
GMB senior organizer Drew Duffy said: “The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the general site manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross deeply affects our members.
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is heavily focused on the local community and the Greater Glasgow area, an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage.
Therefore, under the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising cost of living and chronic decline in production, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a flourishing production presence at McVitie.”
A spokeswoman for Pladis said: “The branch manager at Tollcross only received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday, and the company will respond directly as we appreciate the continued commitment of employees and union representatives.
We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago, during which some issues were discussed openly.
We discussed with employees that, like all companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our business – and this applies to all of our business areas and locations – to stay competitive.
She added: “In recent years, we have invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in our Tollcross location, particularly in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognize the heritage of Tollcross as a production site and should our operations change at the site, the employees and their union representatives will be the first to know."
Did PSG warn Neymar three years ago?
The La Liga side may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not slow down in her pursuit of Neymar after she made an offer of <0xC2><0xA3>189 million to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago about the world record robbery?
The sensational approach fueled the transfer window this summer, as the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United last season for <0xC2><0xA3>89 million.
After finishing, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world. PSG offers wages of more than <0xC2><0xA3>500,000 per week.
Barcelona is angry at the way Neymar has forced his way out, although a source close to the Catalan board insists that the club has always done its best to take care of him since arriving from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned about this prospect three years ago by the PSG president?
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a severe warning for any club that wanted one of PSG’s best players to sign.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will stand in opposition to them, we will contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to get one of our players to sign with them, it will have consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed that line, with the Spanish club expressing interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the international to leave Italy under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers to Neymar.
Roller overturned and damaged
On the night of Friday to Saturday, an unknown perpetrator deliberately overturned a scooter parked in Königsfelder Straße in front of the property number 30 and thus inflicted property damage of over 200 euros on the disguise of the vehicle.
The Schramberg police, phone 07422/ 27 01-0, asks for clues.
The police are looking for witnesses to an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese.
Because a car approached him on his lane, the driver of a VW Touran had to dodge and touched the guardrail.
On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum was on his way to Leese with his VW at 19.55 on the B 215 from Stolzenau.
In the area around Stolzenau, a car came to meet him on his lane, so he had to turn to the right.
The Touran driver touched the guardrail.
Property damage occurred on the car.
The driver of the oncoming passenger car, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a truck and continued his journey without worrying about the traffic accident.
According to the accident victim, it may well be that the Mercedes driver had not noticed the accident at all.
The police now asks witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the polluter vehicle to contact the commissariat in Stolzenau on tel. 05761 / 92060.
Interview: "Domspatzen report relieves Pope-Brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburg Domspatzen report on the abuse cases relieves Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger.
This is the opinion of author and historian Michael Hesemann.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Domspatzen continues to provide for discussions.
Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "We are the Church", said after publication to the German Press Agency, he expects an apology from former Regensburg bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and from Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of emeritus Pope Benedict XVI.
It would be very useful for the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret for their own omissions or their then erroneous assessment of the events.
The Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano", on the other hand, criticized the fact that when reporting on violence in the cathedral sparrows is measured by "two measures".
Regarding the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that they are "disgraceful and shameful acts" that should be punished and prevented in the future; but the "degree of media manipulation" is striking, says author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian bioethics committee.
"The habit of calling the Catholic Church the source of all evils is already part of the everyday experience and prepares public opinion to consider it normal," Scaraffia wrote.
Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis also said in an interview with the Bavarian Radio: "You like to go to the church and this is a found food".
In addition, she pointed out that in her youth, “beating was a normal pedagogical remedy to cope with naughty children like me.”
It would be unfair to apply today’s standards to previous decades, because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports of the abuse cases, Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger also often appeared.
The author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the memorial volume "Mein Bruder der Papst" (translated into 12 languages), is completely wrong.
"I have to protect Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report.
What exactly does the 440-page report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber, commissioned by the diocese of Regensburg with the Enlightenment, say?
A total of 547 Regensburg Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the early 1990s, 67 Domspatzen were sexually abused.
The final report says of Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "In summary, it can be stated that in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence were used by Domkapellmeister R..
Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more severe.
Nevertheless, unlike many other accused, it is striking that many victims valued R.’s general humanity and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence, even associate positive memories with him.”
In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger in his opinion relieves the burden.
Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of violence against protected persons at the Regensburg Domspatzen" gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.
On the one hand, many students emphasize his "humanity".
On the other hand, he also appears as a cholerist and perfectionist, who often became tangible when a Domspatz did not achieve top performance musically.
How do you, as his biographer, evaluate this final report?
Michael Hesemann: If you take the trouble and read the entire 440-page report from front to back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger appears in it at all.
Only eight pages are dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicit or co-accusedness in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
The excesses of violence at preschool also occurred outside its sphere of influence.
One can at best accuse him of learning too late or of not taking the first indications seriously enough.
The Domspatzengymnasium, where he worked, was perceived by virtually all respondents as - so literally - "redemption", "heaven" and "better world".
Thus, the vast majority of his students, Georg Ratzinger, also exhibits a very excellent testimony, describing him as "warm-hearted", "popular", "sincere", "competent" and "understanding", as an extremely good-natured teacher, who regularly provided the boys with cakes, cookies and sweets and was "always surrounded by grapes from children".
Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which also led to outbursts of anger.
He himself admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for the fact that he not only banged chairs and threw the keychain on the floor, but also distributed slaps in the ears and drew too naughty boys on their hair or ears.
To his credit, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the period in question, the 1960s and 1970s, among parents as well as teachers.
Do you know such methods of punishment?
Of course, I think every one of us who was born before 1968.
I have also experienced this in a secular school, a state high school.
Compared to what this report is really about, namely the horrific sexual abuse and the excesses of violence in preschool, these are, of course, trivialities.
One wonders if it has not more to do with his fame and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just rushed at him.
After all, many who have never understood the Bavarian pope are still eagerly working with him.
But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every way!
In connection with the report, much has been reported in the media on the issue of abuse at the Regensburg Domspatzen.
Is Georg Ratzinger also accused of any involvement or co-knowledge with regard to sexual abuse in the final report?
Michael Hesemann: Definitely no.
None of the 67 victims of sexual assault claimed to have entrusted themselves to the cathedral chaplain.
Not even the parents were admitted.
"I never dared to talk to my father or my mother about it," said one of the victims, representing the others, "I was very embarrassed."
The real problem in educating sexual abuse was, and still is, that most victims are silent out of shame.
If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir leader, who would have been, in a way, a colleague of the perpetrators.
How, then, do the Domspatzen-Schüler Ratzinger’s role with regard to the abuse cases assess?
Michael Hesemann: A student surveyed put it this way: "Concerning sexual abuse ... I do not see ... any case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely insights and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.
I think it ... also really absurd to assume that it is precisely him ... boys have opened up more intrusive or clearer or even more than to their parents, heads of boarding school, trust teachers etc.
That you talk to him about sex ... - unthinkable."
Thus, the report arrives at the very clear result: "The fact that pre-affected students and/or their environment were entrusted to him could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation".
As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is therefore to be acquitted of any cognizance.
Thus, he cannot be accused of not having been prevented or brought to trial.
Therefore, there is no reason to associate his good name with these abominable crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases.
A lot of "violence" was read in the media at the Regensburg Domspatzen.
The former cathedral chaplain Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report "Wegschauen".
Does he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: That’s the big problem, after all, that in the reporting everything was mixed and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and excesses of violence and somewhere, in the middle, Georg Ratzinger.
This, in turn, is an abuse of the report.
There is a clear separation: between the preschool and the high school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and excesses of violence and, say, other accusations.
In addition, the report covers incidents from the period since 1945, i.e. also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir director of the Domspatzen.
All the terrible beatings, the cases in which boys were bullied and maltreated by sadistic teachers and suffered horribly, all happened at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions must have prevailed.
But this was not the case with Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, because he did not see the boys until they were already in the Domspatzengymnasium.
On it, as the vast majority of witnesses emphasize, the theme of "preschool" was taboo.
One was just happy to have escaped her and enjoyed so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" states.
What was different at the high school?
Michael Hesemann: Discipline already existed, but not sadistic violence.
And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that "many victims valued the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases, despite violence, even associate positive memories with him".
At the very least, there is the accusation of looking away.
However, despite all the efforts, the report could only define two periods during which it was reported about the conditions in preschool.
The first time in 1970/71, when he was just beginning to establish himself and of the events at a school where he just did not work and was responsible, (so the Witness) did not want to hear anything, and then again around 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently shut his ears from the conditions?
Michael Hesemann: No, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
In it, he points out that "in preschool, the beating is still practised."
Even in view of the risk of negative press releases, he recommended urgent action.
This was of course at a time when legal clarity existed, when beatings were also banned in Bavaria.
Before that, they happened in a legal gray zone, as we all know.
It was also difficult for him to estimate where the victims might have been exaggerated or dramatized and where the permissible limit had really been exceeded.
But you can’t say he always looked away.
That's just not true.
Only in 1980 was the beating penalty at schools officially abolished in Bavaria.
Yes, Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today’s pedagogical standards to the time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians are talking about the "trick of anachronism", i.e. the danger of evaluating the past according to today's moral standards.
The princess is right.
But of course this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abominable at all times, nor to what was violated in preschool by atrocities and violence against innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond what was then usual.
It’s all terrible and I’m glad it’s finally being worked up.
But at the same time, I have to protect Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.
His means of discipline and punishment, i.e. slaping and pulling on the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was then banned, he also strictly adhered to it.
What picture of his Regensburg time did Georg Ratzinger give in his conversations with you for the book "My Brother the Pope"?
Did the issue of beatings also come up?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his point of view that the cathedral sparrows played only a minor role.
Nevertheless, I do not deny that he led a strict regiment there.
But it must be said once again: without this perfectionism, without the demand of absolute discipline, he would have hardly been able to form a world-class institution out of the previously rather nationally known Regensburg Cathedral Sparrows, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With biscuits and candy alone, one does not turn rebellious boys into great singers and stand before every success, no matter what the field, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.
What kind of person did you see in Georg Ratzinger’s conversations about her book?
Michael Hesemann: By working on the book and beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and experienced it over and over again as wonderful, humorous, kind, deeply believing and heartfelt people, of whom you can’t imagine that he could hurt even a fly.
I regularly get to know how many former cathedral sparrows still today, 23 years after his retirement, keep in regular contact with him, visit him, read to him - he's almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family.
Those who do not forgive him to this day that he was once strict with them are thus clearly in the minority.
Most of the cathedrals today are grateful to him for enriching their lives and bringing them the world of music.
And that he was always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a loving person of respect, to whom they still look up today and whom they almost revere.
And please, once again very clearly: all that is accused of him are educational methods that were on the agenda at the time.
We can be glad that we have overcome this time long ago.
But it is highly unfair to turn a man into a media scapegoat just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother.
The evil intent behind it is all too obvious.
Because the report that has just been published relieves him.
Now the decency would command a 93-year-old man, who has earned great merit and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps even Germany probably no one would know the Regensburg Domspatzen, to finally leave in peace.
