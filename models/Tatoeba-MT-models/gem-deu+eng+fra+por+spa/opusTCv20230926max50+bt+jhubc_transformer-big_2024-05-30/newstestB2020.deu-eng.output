Extinguished fire in French chemical plant
The fire in a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen has been extinguished. The prefecture of Normandy said on Friday. The fire had erupted in the night of Thursday. No one was injured in the incident. The fire brigade was deployed with around 200 extinguishing vehicles.
The fire could be stopped.
Neighbours were called upon not to leave their homes. Buildings within a radius of 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens remained closed on Thursday. The chemical plant on the banks of the Seine is producing additives for lubricants. The factory belongs to the company Lubrizol of US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called Seveso directive, which imposes particularly strict safety requirements.
The plant employs around 400 people. The chemical factory has already made headlines in the past - for example, when a leak in 2013 caused the gas methane thiol to escape and the surrounding area to smell of rotten eggs. In 2015, after an operating accident, around 2,000 liters of mineral oil flowed into the city's sewage system.
Woman quits her job to search for her missing bitch for 57 days
For two months, a woman from Washington searched for her missing dog - and specifically quit her job for it. The seven-year-old Border Collie had escaped from the hotel room during a short break in Montana. 57 days lacked any trace of the dog - but Carole King did not give up.
"It was terrible. I was sick," said Carole King to the Daily Inter Lake. She and her husband had left Katie in the hotel room while they were going to dinner. When they returned to the hotel, Katie had disappeared. They were looking for the animal, but without success.
Thunder had put dog in panic
In the hope that Katie could still be in the hotel somewhere, Carole King went to the reception. "The employee says, 'She left about four, four and a half hours ago,'" Carole King recalls to Daily Inter Lake. When the automatic entrance door opened, Katie immediately ran out. Presumably a loud thunder had panicked the dog.
With flyers and calls in Facebook groups, the Kings searched for their beloved dog. But days turned into weeks. "I never gave up. I never lost hope," Carole King told the "Daily Inter Lake," who quit her job as a postman to continue her search for Katie.
"The tears flowed"
57 days after Katie's disappearance, Carole King received a call: A man called and said that Katie believed he was in his yard. But when King arrived, Katie had already disappeared. She searched the neighborhood and suddenly found her dog standing under a tree. "I just hugged her. I didn't want to let her go," King recalled that the people were holding around "Daily Lake Interssen".
Losses in the Bundeswehr: Machine guns disappear without a trace
Friday, September 27, 2019
Six MG3 machine guns have disappeared.
In recent years, the Bundeswehr has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of shots of ammunition. Among them are three machine guns. The whereabouts are in most cases unclear. The opposition speaks of a "frightening" extent.
Weapons and ammunition continue to disappear from the Bundeswehr - many of them so far without a trace. Since the beginning of 2014, the force has recorded the loss of 39 weapons, 39 weapons parts and almost 20,000 shots of ammunition. This is shown by a list of the Federal Ministry of Defence classified as a cover-up, which the editorial network Germany reports.
According to the paper from the office of Defense Secretary Peter Tauber of the CDU, two weapons, one weapon part and 3,474 shots of ammunition have so far resurfaced. The weapons and weapons parts still missing include six machine guns of the type MG3, eleven guns of the type G3, four guns of the type G36, six guns of the type P, and two guns of the type P.
The extent of the arms and ammunition losses at the Bundeswehr is "frightening", said the left-wing Bundestag MP Martina Renner. This was all the more true, since in the course of the investigation Francojen hardly anything was found. The left-wing politician spoke of a "poor balance sheet". Renner criticized that because of the listing, the munition could not be detected.
Oil tanker "Stena Impero" left Iranian port
More than two months after its arrest by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of the city of Bandar Abbas on Friday. As Refinitiv's ship observation data showed, the tanker set off and left the Iranian port. Port Rashid was indicated as the destination port in the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker had actually been released by the Iranian government on Monday, but it initially remained in Iranian waters. The shipping company said that they wanted to wait for an official notification from Tehran.
The "Stena Impero" had been charged on July 19 by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in the Strait of Hormuz with violating security regulations, but it was suspected that Iran was reacting to the controversial, temporary detention of an Iranian oil tanker in front of Gibraltar, which belongs to the United Kingdom.
The Strait of Ormuz is one of the most important sea routes in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the global oil exports are shipped through the strait. Tensions in the region had intensified immensely in recent months. The merchant shipping was pulled into the conflict between the US and Iran. Several incidents occurred with tankers and drones.
Merkel pays tribute to people’s courage in the Peaceful Revolution
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has acknowledged the commitment of the people in the GDR who took to the streets 30 years ago during the Peaceful Revolution. In the autumn of 1989, courageous citizens had shaken the then GDR regime, Merkel said at a ceremony of the Thuringian CDU group on the upcoming day of German unity in Erfurt.
Musk sets record for extradition
Tesla’s quarter may hold a record record, but despite the boom in deliveries, there have recently been losses at the electric car company.
New York.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost with the prospect of new record numbers on the stock market. "We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek".
Demand is strong, so Tesla could post 110,000 orders, Musk's newsletter continued. The challenge was to bring the cars to the customer quickly, with Tesla having to raise as many resources as possible by the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla’s shares went out of trade with an increase of over six percent. The price hasn’t increased so strongly in almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla delivered well over 95000 cars, reaching its best value so far.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360000 to 400,000 cars. This requires six-digit figures in the current and coming quarters. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are small. Despite the boom, there were losses last year.
Mystery solved: That's why we can't tickle ourselves
A kind of brake in the cerebellum prevents people from tingling themselves. Scientists at Humboldt University in Berlin found this with the help of experiments on rats, as they communicated on Thursday evening. Progress has also been made on the question of why children are so fiercely resisting tingling, only to demand more.
Finally, it was also shown why the approach of a tingling hand alone triggers laughter even before the touch. This is due to a deep layer in the cerebellum, which triggers laughter even while waiting for the tingling.
Previous research has shown that rats react with "laughter" in the ultrasound range when they are tickled by humans, which is mediated by the part of the cerebral cortex that serves as the central processing of haptic perception.
Laughter is suppressed during self-touch
So far, it has been assumed that the brain can distinguish between self-touch and touch by others - that is why people cannot tickle themselves. However, the Berlin researchers now found in the experiments on the rats that the laughter as well as the activity of the relevant area of the cerebral cortex are suppressed during a self-touch. But this was also the case if the living creatures were more active in the brain.
But if you pass the self-touch and the touch of others at the same time, laughter is also suppressed. This suggests that the rat’s brain cannot distinguish between the self-touch and the touch of others. The new findings suggested that people cannot tickle themselves because the self-touch activates a brake in the brain.
The rats had also been trained to tickle themselves. Accordingly, they sometimes stopped this initiation in the experiment prematurely, showed escape behavior or fear stiffness. This ambivalence is similar to the behavior of the children. The ambivalence of tickle is a behavioral reaction that is the same in rats and humans.
Catastrophe averted: Big fire in French chemical plant extinguished
The fire in a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen has been extinguished. The prefecture of Normandy told the news agency AFP on Friday. The fire had erupted in the night to Thursday.
According to authorities, no hazardous substances have been released. The samples taken do not give cause for concern, as Prefect Pierre-André Durand said at a press conference on Friday morning. No one was injured in the incident. The fire brigade was deployed with around 200 extinguishing vehicles.
Schools and kindergartens closed
Residents were called upon not to leave their homes, buildings within a 500-metre radius were evacuated, schools and kindergartens remained closed on Thursday.

Brexit: Johnson criticized by his own sister
The Prime Minister's sister commented on Boris Johnson's speech at the first session in Parliament after the suspension of the forced break on Wednesday evening. The Prime Minister threatens to lead the country on October 31 without an agreement from the EU if Brussels does not respond to his calls for changes to the Brexit agreement. However, how he wants to achieve this is unclear.
Regarding Cox, who had campaigned for Britain’s stay in the European Union, the prime minister said: “The best way to honor Jo Cox’s memory and reunite this country would be to complete the EU’s exit.” Cox had been murdered by a right-wing extremist during the 2016 referendum campaign.
A memorial to the attacks on Oslo and Utoya is unveiled
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 deaths, a memorial to the victims is unveiled on Saturday in Norway. The monument "Iron Roses" (German: the Iron Roses) consists of about 1,000 iron rose replicas. They recall the roses that had been laid down by thousands of people in the days and weeks after the attacks in Oslo.
The project of the artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud is now to be unveiled at the same place. The roses were forged by people from all over the world, including survivors and relatives of the victims. Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit, among others, are expected to open.
The right-wing terrorist Anders Behring Breivik had first detonated a car bomb in the government district of Oslo on 22 July 2011 and subsequently shot dozens of participants in a holiday camp of the youth organization of the Social Democratic Workers Party on the island of Utoya.
Iran releases British tankers
The UN General Debate did not bring a solution to the Iran conflict. But now there is one less problem. The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" detained in Iran was able to get back into the sea. It could be a puzzle piece in Iranian President Rohani’s peace plan.
The British oil tanker Stena Impero, detained in the Strait of Hormus in Iran since mid-July, is back in international waters. After the release by Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, the shipping company Stena Bulk said.
The "Stena Impero" had left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew is now sailing to Dubai for medical examinations, among other things, said Reedreichef Erik H<0xC3><0xA5>nell. By noon the ship had left the Iranian waters. "It's nice that it's over," he told Swedish television channel SVT.
"This is part of a pattern of attempts to interfere with the freedom of the seas, and we are working with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law," the statement said.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had arrested the tanker on 19 July under the accusation of having disregarded the regulations of maritime law in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released at the beginning of September. The remaining 16 crew members are doing well according to the circumstances, H<0xC3><0xA5>nell said. They had to work together again in the difficult and annoying situation in the past ten weeks.
The British government suspected a reaction to a similar incident in British Gibraltar, where a supertanker with oil from Iran, supposedly destined for Syria, had been chained at the beginning of July. The delivery, according to the authorities, violated EU sanctions against the war country of Syria. The British had received the indication of the ship from the US.
Iran spoke of "piracy" and threatened with consequences. In mid-August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released. Assumptions that it was an exchange to get the "Stena Impero", London vehemently rejected.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important sea routes in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the world’s oil exports are shipped through the strait. Tensions in the region had intensified immensely in recent months. The merchant shipping was pulled into the conflict between the US and Iran. Several incidents occurred with tankers and drones.
The nuclear dispute between Tehran and Washington is behind the tensions between the two countries. The Americans accuse the Iranian leadership of wanting to build nuclear weapons. Iran rejects this. The United States had left the international nuclear agreement in 2018 alone, which should prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb and at the same time end its political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government has expanded the leadership in Tehran to pressurize
Due to the dispute over the "Stena Impero" and other incidents involving tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, the US is working on a coalition for military protection of merchant ships in the region.
Iranian President Hassan Rohani presented at the UN General Assembly in New York a plan for security and peace in the Strait of Hormuz, with the initiative "Coalition of Hope" for the Persian Gulf to ensure the safety of shipping in the Persian Gulf together with the Arab Gulf states and without foreign protective powers.
India is building a better future with its protectionist economic policy.
India would actually be predestined to "war-winning" consumer chain. Given the punitive tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump on global production against Chinese manufacturers, foreign producers in the People's Republic of China seem forced to relocate themselves. Financial directors of Asian companies, considering to relocate their production from China to another country, India has not been able to do much more with a UBS poll calling India as one of the free alternative.
But now India itself has fallen into Trump’s focus. Deprecatingly titled as the “kingdom of customs” by the Haudegen in the White House, America has withdrawn from the emerging world trade concessions for 2,000 products at the beginning of June. The US accuses India of prohibitively high tariffs and demands better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles and more.
On the world map of trade wars, the frictions with India are, of course, only a side-scene. In addition, America considers the world's largest democracy also through the security glasses. Delhi and Washington therefore combines the concern about China's claims to power in the South Indian Ocean. Against this background, a salve of American penal tariffs against India seems unlikely to happen.
However, the problem lies in a different place: the empirically hardened thesis that open markets seem to accelerate economic development has a difficult status in the socialist republic of India. Even under modes. His zeal for reform is primarily aimed at the bureaucratic madness, which in the multi-ethnic state for too long suffocated any entrepreneurial spirit.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. Much has turned for the better in India in the first five modes, but this is not the case in trade policy. Inspired by protecting internationally uncompetitive companies from foreign suppliers, the national conservative government even built new barriers.
In the West, Modi adheres to the nimbus of the energetic reformer, who is renewing his country economically radically. This impression is not least due to the fact that the charismatic prime minister is so well aware of what vocabulary Western managers like. At the core of the "India First" lawyer, however, never moves away from a protectionist economic policy, which prevents companies from being competitive nationally.
Jacques Chirac's funeral in Paris on Monday
Former French President Jacques Chirac is expected to be buried in Paris next week. The former head of state will be buried on Monday at the cemetery Montparnasse in the south of the French capital, the news agency AFP reported citing the Chirac family. The funeral will take place in the close family circle. For Sunday, a public funeral was reported in the Paris incapacitated media dome.
Carried to the finish line: Dabo is the first secret hero of the World Championships in Athletics
The top of the world was already in the finish line, when in the cooled Khalifa International Stadium the warming scenes were played. In the first run of the men over 5000 meters suddenly Jonathan Busby began to swing dangerously. He could hardly keep himself on his feet 300 meters before the finish line, ran in an unhealthy stance, but when Braima Suncar Dabo half-turned the finish line from the West African country.
"I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have been allowed to do the same," said Dabo after the race in Mixed Zone, when he completely unexpectedly attracted the attention of the assembled journalists. shy he first shrugged away, didn't want to talk about his heroic act at all. After all, he wanted to set his personal best time and when he had realized that this would be difficult for me, he just wanted to help a country without suffering.
He did this the evening with emphasis - and much more intensely than he would have imagined. Because this heroic act will be remembered. Especially since Dabo even left his competitor Busby the lead in the finish and voluntarily took the last place - by the way, a good five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this lead. In the end, the whole world had come to nothing.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studies there in Lisbon, had competed to set a personal best time at the World Cup in Doha. According to official data, this was achieved with 18:10.87 minutes, but he himself was nevertheless disappointed: "I wanted to run 17:55 minutes. Under 18 minutes I was before". However, only in training, since best times do not count.
Millions: Egyptians prepare for wild day of protest
In Egypt, security measures have been intensified in the run-up to possible government-critical protests. In the center of Cairo, an increased police presence was observed on Friday. Several subway stations remained closed, roads around the central Tahrir Square were closed.
Already in the past few days, police had intensified their street controls and partially searched pedestrians’ phones for news and photos related to the protests. Hundreds had been arrested, according to two NGOs.
Opponents of Al-Sisi
Last weekend it had been in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura pledged to come to protests with hundreds of participants. They were directed against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the critic has accused Egypt of corruption and mismanagement. There had been such an open protest against the political leadership in Egypt for years.
The number of arrests in connection with the protests increased further, according to two observer groups. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) counted more than 1,570 arrests by Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW) spoke of more than 2,000 arrests. Independently, these figures could not be confirmed at first. The government did not confirm the figures either.
Arbitrary arrests
Many people have also been "arbitraryly arrested" "just because they were 'at the wrong place at the wrong time'," HRW said, citing lawyers. The allegations against the detainees range from "distribution of false information" to membership in a "terrorist passport" in Cairo, Alexandria and other cities.
HRW also criticized the censorship in the North African country, according to which the government is blocking websites and online services in Cairo to stop further protests against Sisi.
Online retailers: retailers should be able to donate returns more easily
For online retailers, many returned parcels are lost goods. Around 20 million returns end up in the garbage. But there is an alternative.
The Treasury Department has shown online retailers such as Amazon and Zalando a way to donate returned products instead of destroying them.
Although it was not possible to exempt the companies from VAT on donations in kind, the ministry explained to a question by the Greens’ parliamentary group, about which the newspapers of the Funke media group reported on Friday. However, the dealers could set the market value of the unsold returns so low that they would have to pay no or only a little VAT.
Scientists at the University of Bamberg had determined that when orders are placed on the Internet, German citizens send back every sixth parcel. Around four percent of the goods - about 20 million products - were subsequently landed in the trash. Donating them would cost the companies additional money according to the current legal situation, because the financial authorities assess donations in kind as a turnover, which is then subject to sales tax.
Green Group leader Katrin Göring-Eckardt called on Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to clarify by a decree that companies can not sell products accordingly and donate free of charge to non-profit organizations. Companies should be able to rely on not being penalized for donating. This applies not only to online fashion, but also to other stores.
Banksy Art to Auction: There's Never Been a Better Time to Sell This Painting
Streetart star Banksy’s work, “Devolved Parliament,” is due to be auctioned.
For Branczik, Banksy's work underlines "the re-establishment of the world's oldest parliamentary democracy into the basic attitude of animals and tribes". The painting is to be exhibited at Sotheby's in the British capital from Saturday until it is to be auctioned on October 3rd. It is estimated at 1.5 to two million euros.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 at the Museum of Bristol in the southwest of the UK, where Banksy lives. This year the artist had re-exhibited the painting - at the same time as the original Brexit date on March 29. On this occasion, the work, formerly called "Question Time", was renamed "Devolved Parliament" ("Delegated Parliament").
The picture could change the owner for a million dollars.
At the first session of the House of Commons on Wednesday, after the Supreme Court lifted a forced break imposed by Johnson, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had delivered a harsh exchange of blows with the opposition. Johnson wants to carry out the already twice postponed Brexit on October 31, even without an agreement with the EU if necessary.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, interferes in the Brexit debate. In Dover in southeast England, he painted a picture depicting a man breaking a star of the European flag with a chisel. The work sees thousands of truck drivers and other visitors entering the UK daily.
Brexit debate is like a “walk in the park”
The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s fierce verbal attacks on Brexit opponents in parliament do not contribute to a climate of hatred, according to his top adviser. Compared to the 2016 Brexit referendum, the current controversy is a “walk in the park,” Dominic Cummings said on Friday at a book presentation. “We’re going to enjoy this and win out of (the EU).
Johnson had harshly attacked Brexit opponents in parliament in recent days, accusing them, among other things, of "treason" to the people. Allegations that he could put MPs at risk because they might become targets of murder threats, he dismissed as "humbug".
Cummings said the only way to bring peace back would be if MEPs finally respected the UK's decision to leave the EU. It is not surprising that people were upset that Britain still hadn't left the EU three years after the referendum.
In view of the inviting mood on Friday, even the bishops of the Anglican Church called for restraint. "We should talk to each other with respect," it said in a statement. "And we should listen too."
Pakistani Prime Minister Khan calls for UN intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan once again called on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict at his first appearance before the UN General Assembly.
Otherwise, a renewed war between the nuclear powers of Pakistan and India is likely, Khan said on Friday at the UN General Debate in New York. "If this goes badly, hope for the best, but be prepared for the worst." The United Nations would have had a responsibility for Kashmir. "You should have prevented that."
India and Pakistan have fought three wars since their independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of them around the divided region of Kashmir. Both nuclear powers control one part of Kashmir, another part belonging to China. At the beginning of August, India had withdrawn its autonomy from the Indian Kashmir region and thus suddenly increased tensions in relation to Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
Protesters in Cairo are calling for the overthrow of Egyptian President al-Sisi.
The government reacts harshly to the current protests in Egypt. It shoots at the population with sharp ammunition, over 2,000 detainees join in the prisons to the 60,000 political prisoners who are already in jail there. Protests in Egypt have never been harmless. But since the takeover of General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in 2013, Arabs have avoided everything to the state.
But one of the triggers for the protests in 2011 was the poor economic situation. Poverty, lack of prospects and the feeling of being suffocated by one’s own government drove millions to the streets. And this is a problem that even the el-Sisi regime can’t control, no matter how hard it is on opponents. The situation has even worsened.
Today, one in three people in Egypt lives below the poverty line. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half of its value, the inflation rate is at ten percent. If you want to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket, you have to decide who it finances: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for oppression, but also the largest economic player. The military is producing streets, football
Tüv-Tests in Terminal: BER-Chef: No more "Showstoppers" for Capital Airport
Two months were spent examining whether the complex system mesh in BER fire protection works together. The operators are satisfied with the progress, but the Tüv is not yet finished at BER.
After large-scale TÜV inspections at the terminal of the future capital airport, the operators confirmed the planned opening in October next year, said Supervisory Board Chairman Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the supervisory board.
Airport manager Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successfully completed test, but also said that there were still defects to be processed in the terminal. "We have many detail topics, but we do not have a real show stopper", he assured that the schedule until commissioning still contained buffers.
However, there are indications that the time reserve should no longer be too large. The construction completion notice is now to be filed with the construction office during the first quarter of 2020. This was planned for this autumn at the beginning of the year.
Hundreds of defects in power cables are still to be corrected; the TÜV wants to check them by February. "In order to create the conditions for the start of flight operations, intensive work must continue to be done on the handling of the defects," said a written statement.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases it is about missing evidence, less about new cables. There is also still no approval for all dowels on which the cableways hang. The airport manager expects this to be available by the end of the year.
In addition, the fire protection at the transition to the station under the terminal still does not work satisfactorily. The problems had already led the project to another crisis three years ago. This time it is about smoke aprons, which shut down like a canvas in the event of a fire, so that the smoke does not spread. They go too far down. Therefore, 36 engines must be replaced. Then there will be new trials with hot gas smoke at the beginning of the year.
Problems with fire protection and other construction deficiencies as well as planning errors have delayed the opening of the airport for years. Originally, it was supposed to go into operation in 2011. Costs increased from the start of construction in 2006 to approximately 6.5 billion euros for the opening next year.
Since the number of passengers in Berlin has increased considerably since then, the authorities are planning to expand the airport, which is why it will be at a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on 18 October, as the chairman Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is now looking for two new managing directors. Finance director Heike Fölster will join Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, personnel manager Manfred Bobke-von Camen will retire next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster, who has put the airport finances on a firm footing.
Chemnitz: Drug vending machines blown up - police arrest man
He needed money for drugs - and for that he shot up several vending machines in the city of Chemnitz! Now the perpetrator is finally in jail!
Over the past two years, the number of blasts of cigarette and parking tickets machines in Chemnitz and the region has increased sharply.
After two explosions at the end of May, the police arrested a 33-year-old German on the Bürgerstraße and on the Further Straße in Chemnitz.
Police spokesman Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of the investigation into the production of explosive explosions in the unit with particularly serious case of theft conducted by the Chemnitz criminal police, not only this suspicion confirmed against the 33-year-old".
Faced with the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer now confessed to a total of eight acts.
The police spokesman: "With the loot, he apparently financed his narcotics addiction" alone, the bomber had four times between 20 August 2018 and 31 May 2019 blew up parking tickets machines on the Bürgerstraße.
The total damage incurred amounts to at least <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> 60,000!
The automaton bomber is now in detention and the police investigation against him continues.
It is conceivable that he was also responsible for further automaton explosions in Chemnitz and adjacent counties.
AUA takes over Eurowings flights from Vienna
In the midst of the price competition with low-cost airlines such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, Lufthansa subsidiary AUA is taking over "commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna," a press spokesman of Austrian Airlines confirmed on Friday to the APA. "AviationNetOnline" had previously reported about this.
The Vienna base of the Lufthansa low-cost airline Eurowings will thus de facto be dissolved. Of the currently seven Eurowings aircraft, four will remain in Vienna. This will be taken over by AUA as of January 2020 in the "Wetlease", i.e. including Eurowings personnel. In the future, three Eurowings jets will be stationed in Salzburg, which will fly from Salzburg and Innsbruck as charter aircraft to holiday destinations from Germany.
According to the spokesman, the Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA hub and network planning. The flight times will be coordinated for connecting flights. The aim is on the one hand to strengthen the hub in Vienna and on the other hand to expand decentralised traffic from the federal states.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings A in Vienna only serves as a "Production Company" for the group sister AUA. For example, Barcelona and Rome would be operated with AUA flight number, but mainly with Eurowings device. The onboard product should be adapted to that of Austrian Airlines, but the pilots and flight attendants will be from Eurowings instead of starting the flight number under AUA.
A price struggle broke out at Vienna Airport after the Niki bankruptcy. The Ryanair subsidiary Laudamotion announced on Thursday that it would increase the fleet in Vienna next summer to 16 aircraft. The Irish low-cost airline sends four Ryanair machines and crews to Vienna, also in the so-called "Wetlease", which the union criticized as a circumvention construct to the collective agreement.
Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said Lauda will overtake AUA in five years, and AUA CEO Andreas Otto said: "We will remain the number one on site in five, six or ten years."
Queen's granddaughter Princess Beatrice is engaged
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: As children, the cousins were the best friends. Now the last of the four gets married. Beatrice is engaged!
Great news from the British Royals: Edoardo Mapelli (34) is said to have stopped Mozzi for the hand of his girlfriend Princess Beatrice (31) in the Italian holidays at the beginning of the month, the palace announced on Thursday.
"We are delighted to announce our engagement, we are both so excited to start this adventure together and can't wait to be married," the couple, who have been together since October 2018, said in a statement.
“We share so many similar interests and values and we know that this will help us a lot in the coming years full of love and happiness.”
Sister Eugenie took the pictures
The official engagement photos have been taken by her sister, Princess Eugenie (29), and also immediately posted on her Instagram account.
A royal feast
The wedding is scheduled to take place in 2020. More information on the date, place and everything else will be announced by the palace in the coming months.
However, it is certain that the marriage of the number nine of the British throne succession and the real estate mogul will be a similarly large celebration as the wedding of Eugenie on October 12, 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
Study on Causes of Heart Disease
Smoking, obesity, unhealthy diet - there are risk factors for cardiovascular disease. But what really triggers a heart failure or an infarction? Hamburg researchers now want to take a close look at the genetics of 9000 healthy and sick people.
Through the analysis of the genetic material of 9,000 people, Hamburger and Swiss scientists want to find out the causes of cardiovascular disease in more detail.
The research project is the largest of its kind in the German-speaking region, the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) announced on Friday. The Kühne Foundation is funding the project with 12.5 million euros. From Switzerland, the Davos High Mountain Clinic, which belongs to the foundation, and the University Hospital Zurich are involved.
Obesity, smoking and unhealthy diets are among the major risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Genetic factors determine the risk. However, the interaction between genes and external influences was insufficiently known, it said. Now the scientists want to compare the complete genetic material of 8,000 healthy people with that of 1,000 former patients at the UK University Heart Center and University Hospital.
Currently, in more than 4,000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes, possible disease-causing changes in DNA - so-called mutations - are known, the clinic said.
According to the initiators, the aim of the five-year project is to develop new options for preventing, detecting and treating heart rhythm disorders, heart failure and heart attacks. The data could also be useful in the research of other common diseases, says Stefan Blankenberg, head of the University Cardiovascular Center. New findings on the interaction between heart and brain, heart and kidney are possible.
The chairman of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also emphasized that there is a strong will to use the data for the research of other diseases. The clinic of the Foundation in Davos treats allergies so far. Now a Center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine should be created on the medical campus there and a professorship for bioinformatics will be created.
The biosamples of the healthy participants come from hamburgers who also participate in the "Hamburg City Health Study". With 45,000 subjects, this is the largest local health study in the world, according to the clinic. The genetic code is strictly protected, the scientists assured. It is about a petabyte (1000 terabytes) of data from the University of Zurich, Holger said.
According to UKE, a person’s genetic material can now be deciphered within 24 hours. The pure material costs for this would be <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> 1300. The first gene sequencing worldwide, whose results were published in 2001, cost several hundred million euros. The study is expected to start on October 1st, with all 9,000 samples being analysed by the end of 2020. First results are expected in the following year.
Nigerian Police Release Hundreds of Abused Boys
In Nigeria, police have freed more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Koran school. According to indications from local residents, security forces searched the school in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered the minor victims, police spokesman Yakubu Sabo said. "The victims were abused. Some of them said he was raped by their teachers," Sabo said.
The boys were detained under the pretext of being taught and "improved" in the Koran. In fact, the defendants were detained by their teachers under "degrading and inhumane conditions," Sabo said. About a hundred students, including children aged nine, were chained in a small room.
The Koran school has existed for about ten years. Local residents had alerted the authorities to repeated irregularities in the facility. The parents had been shocked when they were informed about the conditions at the Koran school, Sabo said. They had no idea of the suffering of their children. The operator and six employees were arrested, according to police.
In the predominantly Muslim north of Nigeria, there are many private Koran schools. They replace the often deficient state facilities. People in the region suffer from frequent attacks by armed gangs. According to the UN Refugee Agency, more than 40,000 people fled over the border to the neighboring state of Niger in the past ten months.
Nigerian police chained and tortured to free 400 children from school
Police officers in a school in northern Nigeria have rescued nearly 400 students from horrific conditions, "many of them were chained and some had visible injuries indicating torture," police spokesman Yakubu Sabo said in the city of Kaduna.
The children were found there on Thursday, according to an indication in an Islamic-influenced school. The conditions there were "unworthy of human dignity" and the officials arrested the headmaster and six teachers after the liberation operation.
The children, all boys, had been held as slaves and chained at their school, some having been sexually abused, and television images showed leaned and injured pupils in a noticeably poor state of health.
World Soccer Election: Further Accusations After Messis and Klopps Kür
Football "Signature not valid"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe awarded
With a gala in Milan, the FIFA World Football Association honors the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year. For Lionel Messi, it is the sixth honour and thus record.
After Nicaragua's captain stated that he never voted in the World Footballer's Election, accusations against Fifa are coming from other countries. Egypt was not rated at all - with a curious justification.
In recent years, Fifa has shown a lot of appreciation: the World Cup awards, the dubious plans of its president Gianni Infantino, the general behavior of various corrupt officials. However, the Fifa World Footballer election has not so far been objectively suspected of running out of order - if one considers that the voters are nationally eligible.
However, after Nicaragua’s captain complained that he did not vote at all, further disagreements now appear: Egypt complains that the voices of national coach Hossam El-Badry and captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account. In fact, they do not appear in the official and publicly visible voting summary.
The Fifa apologizes in the sense that "the signatures on the electoral forms were handed down in capital letters and therefore not valid" and has contacted the Egyptian Federation several times to clarify the situation - without an answer.
Sudan's coach is surprised.
While the situation in the case of Egypt is understandable, the Sudanese federation states that coach Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote as it was ultimately rated: with Lionel Messi in first place, Virgil van Dijk in two and Sadio Mané in three. According to FIFA, however, the vote was officially entered with Steem.
Nicaragua’s captain Juan Barrera also made the allegations: “I did not vote for the #TheBest2019 Awards. All the information about my vote is wrong, thank you,” he wrote. In his case, it was suspected that the Nicaraguan Football Association simply voted on his behalf.
The association now received the message on Friday: True, but of course was not intentional. The completed election documents were "erroneously" provided with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan selection, officially so voted, it was said in a communication from the association. However, had actually chosen the second captain Manuel Rosas as the manager. "We assumed responsibility for the administrative error here
The other cases are now being examined by FIFA in an investigation, but emphasizes that the election process was supervised externally by the consulting firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers. So far Lionel Messi remains the undisputed winner of the World Footballer's Election - and Jürgen Klopp World Coach of the Year.
Ukraine Affair: High-ranking Republicans Vote for Official Investigation
Two high-ranking Republicans have spoken out openly for an official investigation against U.S. President and party friend Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important," said U.S. Republican Governor of Vermont Phil Scott. "Where that leads from here, will be determined by the facts that can be established." He wants to know more about the whistleblower's actions before he's gone to court.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations. These had shown that Trump had repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a phone call to investigate the activities of Democratic presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden in Ukraine. According to Scott, Trump has been watching Biden "for years".
So far, Republicans have held back with criticism of Trump over the whistleblower affair, but few have expressed any discomfort about it. Scott’s remarks are now a first indication of this in Trump’s party, with the moderate governor of Virginia having repeatedly opposed Trump’s policies, such as easing environmental regulations and tightening regulations.
As another senior Republican, Charlie Baker, Governor of Massachusetts, also spoke out for the investigation. "It's a deeply disturbing situation," Baker said. "The right course of action and responsibility for Congress now is to investigate the matter and go to the bottom of it."
Scott and Baker, as governors of U.S. states, have formally not taken part in the trial against Trump, which will be decided in Congress. Their statements are therefore above all symbolic. Nevertheless, first senators of the Republicans have also spoken critically about the situation. Mitt Romney, for example, who represents the state of Utah in the second chamber of parliament, said the case was "extremely disturbing to the U.
The affair could result in the initiation of impeachment proceedings against Trump, the Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation to do so, accusing him of abuse of power for the purpose of foreign influence for his own political benefit.
There is no exact timetable for the impeachment procedure. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could pursue a so-called impeachment. However, the decision on an actual impeachment was taken in the Senate, where Trump’s Republicans have the majority. The prospects of such a procedure being successful are therefore low. So far, no U.S. president has been enforced by an impeachment procedure.
Were Torturers on Board of Racketes "Sea Watch"?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily, alleged to have raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) had been arrested in June after she had unlawfully approached the port of Lampedusa with the rescue ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Libyan refugees on board. After fierce protests and international criticism - also by Austria's Federal President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was lifted by an Italian judge after a few days.
Now, new serious accusations against rockets are being made. For example, three men accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps could have arrived in Italy with the "Sea-Watch 3". The suspects have been arrested in a reception camp in Messina (Sicily) after migrants had not recognized their tormentors in Italy, but "We can't exclude the fact that" Germans said.
Police said in mid-September that the suspects in the North African country had been raped, tortured and even murdered. These were Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematically harassed and exposed to atrocities - by repeated and constant physical violence at the time".
NGOs and aid organizations are now pointing out that they cannot know exactly who is coming on the ships. "We cannot scan who the people are. They come without passports," said Neugebauer. Torture is one of the main reasons people are fleeing Libya. It is therefore quite likely that perpetrators are also on the ships. "It is therefore very important that this is followed".
Italy’s former Interior Minister Matteo Salvini called for an immediate apology from Rackete, who is still being investigated in Italy for aid to illegal immigration.
Musk sets record for delivery at Tesla
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost with the prospect of new record numbers on the stock market.
“We have a chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries,” Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog Electricrek.
Demand is strong, so Tesla could post 110,000 orders, Musk's newsletter continued. The challenge was to bring the cars to the customer quickly, with Tesla having to raise as many resources as possible by the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla’s shares went out of trade with an increase of over six percent. The price hasn’t increased so strongly in almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla delivered well over 95,000 cars, reaching its best value so far.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. This requires six-digit figures in the current and coming quarters. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are small. Despite the boom, there were losses last year.
U.S. Budget Dispute: Again Just a Bridge Financing
The new fiscal year will begin in the US on October 1 without a proper budget. The Senate has followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and has decided on transitional funding until November 21.
Although the U.S. Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August to increase the spending ceilings for fiscal years 2020 and 2021, the United States is once again without spending plans before the new fiscal year begins October 1. The Senate has followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and has decided to put a transitional funding (Continuing Resolution, CR) on Monday. Without such a decision, it would have come to a midnight on November 21.
Shutdown Avoided
For the time being, the federal administration is now being financed at the level and according to the priorities of the spending plans for the financial year 2019 ending on Monday. This is because Congress has not been able to agree on the 12 spending laws in time, which allocate the funds to the various departments and authorities. For the time being, the federal administration cannot benefit from the budgetary framework extended from 1.3 billion to 1.4 billion dollars for the new financial year.
In the House of Representatives, where they have a majority, the Democrats have completed ten of the twelve laws, but the spending laws reflect the priorities of the Democrats, who have little chance in the Republican-dominated Senate. Conversely, the Senate also has ten of the twelve spending plans more or less ready, which are barely majority-capable.
The ghosts differ mainly on the issue of resource allocation for the area of domestic security and border security. In the Senate, the Republicans apparently are trying to force $ 12 billion for the wall construction, one of President Trump's major priorities. The Democrats interfere with the wall construction plans and their funding, which had actually been intended for other military buildings and projects. The dispute over the 2018 Shukal it was already leading to a fall in December.
At the wall, the ghosts separate
Currently, it is unclear how the parties want to approach this issue. More likely than an agreement on all twelve spending laws over the next seven weeks, an extension of the transitional funding beyond November 21 is not excluded.
Against the background of the ongoing inability of Congress to agree on the twelve spending laws in time, and the associated risk of a shutdown, ideas for automating the process gain in popularity. Submission p. 1877 to avoid shutdowns would automatically continue the funding of the federal administration at the previous year's level, halting the travel activities of parliamentarians and backing up their annual wages.
France allows artificial insemination for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial fertilization is also to be open to women and lesbians living alone: The Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority in favour of a bill by the government that allows all women to use in vitro fertilization, thus increasing the demand for anonymous sperm donation significantly.
The proposal still needs the approval of the Senate. In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right camp had warned that numerous "children without a father" could grow up in the future. The French Bishops' Conference is also opposed to the innovation.
The new regulation is the core component of a bioethics law, which Minister of Health Agnès Buzyn defended as an "opportunity" for society. It depicts the modern family in which there are children with only one parent or with gay parents. According to her idea, the costs of artificial fertilization for all women are to be borne by social security.
Fertilization with sperm of dead husband continues to be banned
By a narrow majority, the National Assembly rejected an amendment that should give widows access to the sperm of their dead husband for artificial insemination. In Belgium, Spain and the United Kingdom, artificial insemination is allowed "post-mortem". In Germany, in the past, there have been cases in which women in vain on the release of the sperm of a deceased sothee complained a child in Paris.
Many members of the government party La République en Marche (The Republic in Movement, LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition had opposed artificial insemination with the sperm of the deceased partner, stressing that a widow would be imposed a "double mourning" if the death of her husband also left her with a child.
The initiators of the now unsuccessful amendment consider it unjust that a widow can be fertilized with the sperm of an unknown person in the future, but not with that of her own partner.
So far, artificial insemination in France is only allowed to heterosexual couples who cannot bear children. They must be married or live together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in the summer that surrogacy would continue to be banned.
In Germany, artificial insemination is theoretically open to all women – yet it is often difficult for single or lesbian couples.
Climate Compensation: Calls for Flight Charges for Universities Get Louder
A lot is flown at the universities. That is why the country wants to have a climate levy in the future. The principals say they have no money for it. But now they are also under internal pressure.
The universities should also restrict themselves to flying. Photo: dpa/Julian Stratenschulte
The discussion on a climate levy on flights from universities and universities, which was initially postponed before the summer break, is still coming back to life. After the state rectors' conference had already skeptically responded to a corresponding push from the green-black coalition, the plans are now receiving support from the universities. In a joint statement, the doctoral students of six Baden-Württemberg universities and a pedagogical university are still urgating it.
Russia again arrests North Korean fishermen
According to the FSB, the detainees were said to have fished illegally in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen from North Korea had already been arrested. At that time there was a gunshot exchange between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and one North Korean were injured, the fisherman later succumbed to his serious injuries. This time there were no injuries.
The Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages. The North Korean fishermen were said to have been traveling in Russian territorial waters. There, the coastguard of Russia, according to its own statements, patrols to protect their marine biological resources.
30,000 squids confiscated
30,000 squids were discovered and confiscated on the boats during the re-inspections, and three fishing boats and two motor boats were confiscated and brought to Nachodka and Posjet near Vladivostok.
The Russian Fisheries Authority had not issued any fishing licences to the North Koreans this year, even after complaints from domestic entrepreneurs. Thousands of fishermen from North Korea have already been arrested there this year, according to media.
The head of the association of Russian fishing companies in the far-eastern region of Primorje, Georgi Martynov, recently also complained of high environmental damage by the North Korean fishermen. They fished with narrow mesh synthetic nets banned in Russia. With these, even small creatures would be taken out of the sea. In addition, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea, where they would need to be broken by 200 years.
In the future, only 18,000: U.S. will lower the asylum ceiling
The “biggest nation in history”: Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police officers in the White House.
The richest country in the world is facing protection seekers: As the State Department confirms in Washington, the ceiling for the legal influx of refugees will be further lowered. In the future, especially threatened believers and Iraqis will receive asylum.
The U.S. government wants to lower the already historically low limit for the reception of new refugees once again. In the 2020 fiscal year, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, a maximum of 18,000 people are to be allowed into the country, as the U.S. State Department explained. In the already almost expiring fiscal year, the limit is still at 30,000 people.
In recent years, President Donald Trump’s administration has drastically reduced the readiness of refugees from all over the world, with far higher admission limits in place under Barack Obama’s predecessor.
The targeted ceiling of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the introduction of the U.S. Refugee Program in 1980, but the State Department nevertheless described the U.S. as “the most merciful and generous nation in history,” a phrase strongly reminiscent of the language used by the incumbent U.S. President.
A “responsible approach” to refugees is aimed at allowing refugees to return to their home countries to help with reconstruction, Trump said. For his tough course in migration policy, he gets a lot of support from supporters, but there is also massive criticism.
A major issue is the border with Mexico, which Trump wants to lock down. In order to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed the National Emergency. Whether there is a temporal link between the current measure and current domestic policy developments in the U.S. capital is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure because of the Zelensky affair and a potentially imminent impeachment.
The U.S. government wants to concentrate in the future on the reception of two refugee groups: people who are persecuted for their beliefs - and Iraqis who have helped the U.S. military in the country and are thus in danger, according to the statement of the State Department, while a maximum of 1,500 refugees from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador are to be taken in.
Against this background, the United States has only signed migration agreements with Guatemala and now also with El Salvador and Honduras in order to curb immigration at the U.S. southern border with Mexico.
Court orders release of orangutan from zoo
At the request of the Argentine justice, an orangutan female has been transferred from the former zoo of Buenos Aires to a catchment station for apes in the United States. Born in 1986 in the Rostock Zoo, "Sandra" was granted the rights of a "non-human person", so her release is compulsory. The animal was brought to Dallas on Thursday evening as a direct flight, but not as a passenger.
Since the 53-kilogram human affine is unable to adapt to life in the wild, it is expected to live in the outer enclosure of the Center for Great Apes in Florida. There are already 21 other orangutans and 31 chimpanzees, among them "bubbles", former pet of pop star Michael Jackson. However, before moving into Florida, "Sandra" still has to be around "Sandra"
After her birth in Rostock, "Sandra" spent a few years in the former Ruhr-Zoo in Gelsenkirchen, before moving to Buenos Aires in 1995. The process for "Sandra's" fundamental rights, strained by animal conservationists in 2014, helped to transform the Buenos Aires Zoo into an ecopark. By 2023, a research and education center for the conservation of biodiversity is to be built there.
Swiss extreme mountaineer record: 550 meters in 46 minutes
The extreme mountaineer Dani Arnold has succeeded in a new Husaren ride on the almost 3000 meter high Great Pine in the Italian Alps.
Without a net, double floor or other aids, the Swiss defeated the 550-metre-high north wall of the Great Tin in a new record time.
Clothed with jeans, t-shirt and only supported by absolute freedom from dizziness, Arnold took 46 minutes and 30 seconds to climb, undercutting the old record by almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now the record holder in the Free Solo Speed on four of the six most important European northern walls.
Nike Benefits from New Online Marketing Strategy
Regardless of the trade conflict with China, the US sportswear manufacturer Nike has recorded a significant profit increase. Net profit rose to $1.4 billion (nearly 1.3 billion euros) in the past quarter. This is 25 percent more than in the previous year's period, the company announced on Tuesday. This is mainly due to the new marketing strategy "Nike Direct", with which the Adidas customer directly contacted its online customers.
Sales rose to $10.7 billion in the three-month period up to the end of August, with Nike’s sales growth of 22 percent in China being the strongest, benefitting Beaverton, Oregon, from its approach to targeting consumers directly via the Internet or smartphone apps.
Andy Campion, Chief Financial Officer, announced that Nike will continue to drive the sporting goods manufacturer’s “digital transformation” with strategic investments, thereby expanding its competitive edge. Investors were delighted with the quarterly figures – the sporting goods manufacturer’s shares increased by more than five percent.
Lifetime stadium ban for racism in Italy
Due to racist comments about football pro Juan Jesus of AS Rome since the club from the Italian capital has imposed a lifelong stadium ban against a fan. The defender Jesus from Brazil had been slandered by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then posted the private news and urged his club to take action. "<0x40>officialasroma you are going to be a fan with 28.
The club responded late Thursday, reporting the fan's account on Instagram and the police. In addition, the Roma supporters are never allowed to visit a match of the club again, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. Regularly Italian fans chant racist insults against black players of rival teams. "We can't have racism in society or in sports. In Italy, the situation hasn't improved, and that's very serious. You have to identify the responsible and throw out of the stadiums," said Fifa president Gianni Infantino at the weekend.
But there had also been discussions about the supporters of Juventus Turin recently. The Italian authorities have now banned 38 raiding fans of record champion Juventus Turin. Four of them are not allowed to enter the stadium for a period of ten years, the police said. For the rest, prohibitions apply from four to seven years.
The fans are in connection with ongoing investigations against twelve leaders of ultra fan groups in the Juventus area. The twelve are accused of heavy extortion, money laundering and private violence. The club had launched the investigation with an advert last year.
According to Italian media reports, the Ultra leaders are behind the black trade in tickets, they have "militaryly controlled" the ticket trade for the fan basket and are said to have blackmailed Juventus employees to get cheaper tickets.
Generation Z: Are they really different from Generation Y?
Millennials are narcissistic, Generation Z is political - whole vintages are considered with clever names. If you look more closely, the awards are full of contradictions. So how well do these labels describe the respective lifestyle of young people?
"The crabs are coming!" This call officially launched the crab hunting at Lake Gucheng in Gaochun on September 21, also marking the opening event of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, as announced by the Nanjing-Gaochun District Committee's Department of Public Relations.
Gaochun, which forms the southern foothills of Nanjing in Jiangsu province, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international "slow city" in China and here is also the Chinese headquarters of the international "slow city" movement. The city has ecologically ideal conditions with a mixture of "30 percent mountains, 20 percent water surfaces and 50 percent fields to be rich in natural conditions.
The people of Gaochun started crab farming already in the early 1990s. Over time, the crab industry has developed into a shaping industry that provided high incomes and became an important part of the economic development of Gaochun. In recent years, Gaochun has actively supported a large-scale, ecological and scientific development of crab farming and the agriculture industry has become more efficient.
In recent years, Gaochun has been advancing a reform to "distribute power, optimise administration and government services" and has carefully built up the service network for "permits under one roof, a law enforcement team, a network for services, a platform for lending" so that the city wants to optimize the environment for permits, services and development comprehensively.
Gaochun takes advantage of the locally provided advantages by connecting to the southern Jiangsu and the southern Anhui "Cultural tourism" and "Cultural tourism" and "Cultural tourism" and "Cultural tourism" and "Cultural tourism" and "Cultural tourism" and "Cultural tourism" and "Cultural tourism" and "Cultural tourism" and "Cultural tourism" services.
Iran-US Conflict: Rohani Says End of Sanctions - Trump Disagrees
Iranian President Hassan Rohani, after his return from the UN General Assembly, spoke of an alleged US offer to lift sanctions in return for talks with the Tehran leadership to end all sanctions, Rohani said on his official website.
However, US President Donald Trump disagreed with the Iranian counterpart via Twitter: "Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on him so that there would be a meeting. I said, of course, no".
Ruhani describes the event as follows: Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron had been present in New York and had urged for a meeting to take place. "And America says I lift the sanctions," added Ruhani. The kind of sanctions that should be terminated have been unambiguously lifted, we have said to the debate.
However, the move was not carried out in an acceptable manner, criticised Rohani, who said that no one could predict the outcome of negotiations, given the current penalties and the "poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure".
Earlier this week, Chancellor Angela Merkel had met with Rohani in New York. Background was the hope of Europeans to save the nuclear deal negotiated with Russia and China with Iran. This is intended to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. France's President Emmanuel Macron had expressed the hope, like Merkel, on the margins of the UN General Assembly, that Ruhani will meet with US President Donald Trump.
Severe earthquake near Istanbul - Nearly 200 aftershocks
After the western Turkey was shaken by two earthquakes within a very short time, the fear of a disaster is growing. 34 people were injured in the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the earthquake the previous day, there have been almost 200 aftershocks, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Friday. This increases the concern about a disaster.
14 schools in Istanbul were closed for security reasons. Hundreds of buildings were damaged. The magnitude 5.8 earthquake on Thursday shook the Marmara region in front of Istanbul and caused panic in the million-strong metropolis. Now the government wants to set up a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes, Istanbul’s mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said. In the city itself, the latent danger is repeatedly ignored. Every year, poorly constructed residential buildings collapse – caused, among other things, by the many smaller earthquakes that regularly shake Istanbul.
Urban planners such as the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have warned for years that large open spaces registered in the center as a refuge have long since been built.On the 20th anniversary of the Gölcük earthquake in August, the Civil Engineering Chamber of Istanbul had warned that an estimated one million buildings in Istanbul were not earthquake-proof.
The epicentre of Thursday’s earthquake was located in the Marmara Sea in front of the district of Silivri and at a depth of about seven kilometers, according to the civil protection agency Afad. A minor aftershock a few minutes later caused even greater panic on the streets.
Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said on Twitter that no injuries or injuries had been reported at first. The state broadcaster TRT showed people running from the houses in panic. Students were taken out of the buildings in the district of Silivri for security reasons. Some students were crying, as can be seen in pictures.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly earthquake-prone. Under the Marmara Sea lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian Disruption, which marks the border between the Eurasian and Anatolian plates. Turkey is repeatedly shaken by earthquakes. One of the most deadly was the 1999 earthquake near Istanbul. At that time, more than 17,000 people died.
Researchers fear that an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 to 7.4 could threaten, but it is unclear when the earthquake will occur. The earthquake on Thursday hit the west of the country and Istanbul again.
Companies are designing emergency plans, private individuals have packed so-called go-bags with everything they need to stand next to front doors, and schools are teaching children how to behave when the earth shakes.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after his return from New York, eight people had been injured. Some buildings had suffered slight damage. Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu followed the developments of the Istanbul Disaster Coordination Center (Akom). According to him, two minarets of mosques in the districts of Avcilar and Sariyer fell.
Warning of aftershocks in Istanbul
In the social networks, many users report panic. Buildings were shaken. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone lines were interrupted. It had been more violent than that of Tuesday, writes one user. The head of the Turkish Red Crescent, Kerem Clinic, warned via Twitter of aftershocks. He called on people to stay away from buildings that had suffered visible damage.
The timing of the quake is officially stated at 13.59 a.m. (local time), and just minutes after the first quake, there was a aftershock, reported by CNN Turkey, with a magnitude of 4.0 on the Richter scale.
On Tuesday, a magnitude 4.6 earthquake rocked the Turkish Marmara region - it was felt until Istanbul. Also its epicenter was located in the Marmara Sea west of the million metropolis, the disaster protection agency Afad announced on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that made headlines this Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a severe earthquake.
Researchers believe that sooner or later a catastrophic earthquake could occur in Istanbul — the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high — and scientists believe it will discharge at some point — causing massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy expects that the earthquake is now a warning. It has become more likely, he told CNN Türk. "These could be the signs of a major earthquake," Ersoy told the broadcaster. "Sooner or later, the big earthquake will also come."
Already a few weeks ago there had been an incident - the quake caused great concern also in Istanbul. In addition, there had been a violent earthquake in Albania only a few days ago - there were 68 injured. Also this year the earth had quaked at Lake Constance.
Parliament: New fuel in Ukraine affair
On the way to a possible impeachment procedure, the U.S. Democrats see themselves strengthened: The complaint filed by an anonymous whistleblower about Trump and his controversial phone call with the Ukrainian president "seems to be two important clues for a Glowex."
USA: United Airlines passenger locked in toilet - plane rerouted
Because a passenger was locked in the boarding toilet, a flight by United Airlines has been diverted. The toilet door had been blocked during flight 1554 from Washington to San Francisco, the airline said according to US media.
During an unscheduled stopover on Wednesday evening in Denver (local time), the woman was finally able to be released from the narrow cabin. About an hour after she had been locked in it, U.S. media wrote, citing other passengers. For the onward flight to San Francisco, the passengers had to change the plane.
In a video distributed on the internet, which according to U.S. media is said to have been taken from Flight 1554, several people are trying to free the woman. "We are currently working on opening the door, ma'am. We will get you out soon, okay?" says a man. The airline apologized to all the passengers. At first it was open whether the woman was receiving compensation.
The Cockroach: Inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit novel
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with the whole Brexit chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is unmistakable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka’s famous tale “The Transformation”, British author Ian McEwan (71) has written a book about the Brexit chaos in Britain.
The novel "The Cockroach" (original: "The Cockroach") will be published in German on 27 November, the Diogenes Verlag (Zurich) announced. It is about the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams", who in his earlier life was ignored or hated, but now is at once the most powerful man in Britain. He sees it as a wild thing to let his people do it.
McEwan was quoted as saying, "If the parliament is closed, so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment, if ministers lie shamelessly like the Soviet leaders, if Brexiteers in high positions are just begging for the disaster of a no-deal - then a writer must wonder what he can do. There is only one answer to that: "write" first.
Kafka's first published story in 1915 is about Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and sees himself "transformed into a monstrous pest," being gradually excluded from family and society, and eventually perishing. "Ian McEwan bows to Kafka to describe a world that stands head," the Diogenes publisher said.
EU invests <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>9.5 million in Austria’s railway infrastructure
11,200 wagons in Austria and Hungary will be fitted with whisper brakes to reduce the noise from freight trains, and sections of the railway links between Graz and Györ and Wiener Neustadt and Sopron will be modernised and electrified.
According to the EU authorities, this will make travel more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions. The funds come from the EU infrastructure pot "Connecting Europe Facility".
Thomas Cook cancels all trips until October 31
The German tour operator Thomas Cook has cancelled all trips until 31 October 2019 one day after his insolvency application. Travels could not be started "for reasons of insolvency law," the company announced on Thursday evening.
This also affected bookings of the Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Reisen, <0xC3><0x96>GER TOURS, Bucher Reisen and Air Marin brands that have already been paid for or fully paid for. As for travel starting from 1 November 2019, the company left open. In coordination with the insolvency insurance, the further procedure was examined, it said.
Thomas Cook in Germany had fallen into the trap of the bankruptcy of the British parent company and had filed for insolvency on Wednesday. The company, which includes among others Neckermann Reisen, <0xC3><0x96>ger Tours and Bucher Reisen, employs about 2,000 people in Germany.
Insurer wants to transfer money to hotels again
On the other hand, from this Friday, hotels abroad that currently still host Thomas Cook holidaymakers will receive money from Zurich insurance. The payments to the hotels are, according to Zurich, subject to the condition that holidaymakers are no longer required to make extra payments.
On the basis of the booking information and without submitting separate invoices, the hotels in the resorts are now to receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments, as a Zurich spokesperson for the German Press Agency said. "This applies immediately and on the condition that Thomas Cook travelers from these hotels are not immediately required to pay individually hotel invoices or otherwise forced to do so," said Sprecher Bernien.
The insurance company reacted to reports from hotel guests who, according to their own statements, had been forced to pay for their accommodation on site themselves. Some had to put more than 1,000 euros on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centers had sharply criticized this.
How many hotels are affected will be coordinated on Friday with the insolvent travel provider, said the insurance spokesman. According to Thursday, 70,000 Thomas Cook package holidaymakers were still traveling from Germany. Zurich Germany has secured holiday and return trip of Thomas Cook customers.
Insolvency administrators want to try to continue the three Thomas Cook companies in Germany and find a future solution.
However, the now-announced withdrawals to hotels by Zurich Insurance only help travelers who are still on the road. Thomas Cook customers who are still planning to fly on holiday are looking bad. On late Thursday evening, the company announced that all trips up to and including 31 October would be cancelled. This also applies to bookings that have already been paid.
As for travel starting from 1 November 2019, the company left open. In coordination with the insolvency insurance, the further procedure was examined, it said. In principle, the Zurich insurance is also responsible for these cases. The sale of new travel has been stopped. dpa
The company refers to the insurer Zurich, which can be represented by the company Kaera. Customers can find out about the possibilities of reimbursement of the travel price on the Kaera website and make their claims via a web form.
Prince Harry destroys mine in Angola
For a long time, Prince Harry has continued Lady Diana’s commitment, and in Africa he is now walking in the footsteps of his mother.
Dressed in a blue splinter vest, the British Prince Harry has detonated and destroyed an explosive mine in Angola.
Near a camp of the British Halo Trust near the town of Dirico, he made the ignition circuit on Friday morning in front of running TV cameras. At a safe distance, the explosive device exploded in the savannah landscape without causing any damage. Although the Halo Trust alone has destroyed more than 100,000 relics of the decades-long bloody conflict in the African country.
On the fifth day of his trip to Africa, Harry wanted to walk directly in the footsteps of his mother Diana (1961-1997) in the city of Huambo. With the same explosive master who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to travel the way she walked then. The pictures on which Princess Diana walked through a cleared minefield in 1997 had gone around the world. She had also demonstrated support for the Halo Trust.
Harry, 35, and his wife Meghan, 38, have been on a ten-day African trip since Monday, which began in the South African tourist metropolis of Cape Town.
Stopping Brexit negotiations: the danger of a no-deal remains acute
In fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had clearly stated: With him there will be no bilateral postponement of the Brexit negotiations guaranteed. But what statements are sworn in by the polarizing British already of eternal duration. The latest judgment of the Supreme Court in the UK has been passed 31st time. However, as a Damocles sword floats over the blonde. His suspension of the parliament was obliged to carry out his Brexit course again until the beginning of the week.
Boris Johnson thinks deal is possible
Meanwhile, while visiting a hospital, Johnson suggested that in the event of a disagreement by the end of October, he would support an extension of the negotiations:
You know, we're gonna stick to the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU by 31 October.
I'm cautiously optimistic that this will work.
And time is running out for the Brexit negotiators in Brussels gradually. Around six weeks the EU and the UK negotiators have some time to prevent Britain from leaving the European Union without a deal. But even the recent talks have not yet achieved a breakthrough. A deal by the end of October currently seems rather difficult to conceive. If the British prime minister does not break the law, a renewed postponement of the exit date could not stand.
U.S. officials say more deaths from e-cigarettes
The number of deaths related to the use of e-cigarettes in the U.S. has risen to twelve. In addition, there are now 805 confirmed and likely injuries in this context, the U.S. health agency told CDC. According to a study in the New England Journal of Medicine, there were already more than 900 affected, around 500 of which are still confirmed. The cause of the lung damage is still unknown in Europe.
Fear of New Protests in Egypt Grows
The videos of Mohammed Ali have been shared millions of times in online networks. The builder and actor living in Spain calls for a "people's revolution". For this Friday, he has called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, who critics accuse the country of corruption and mismanagement. Ali hopes to hold mass demonstrations with a million participants centrally.
The security authorities are alarmed. An increased police presence was already observed in the center of Cairo. Several subway stations remained closed, roads around the central Tahrir Square were closed. In recent days, police had already intensified their street controls and searched pedestrians’ phones in part for news and photos related to the protests.
On September 20, the protesters also gathered around Tahrir Square.
Last weekend, protests had taken place in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura with hundreds of participants. Such an open protest had not occurred in Egypt for years. Accordingly, the security forces reacted harshly. According to the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW), nearly 2,000 people have been arrested since last week. Many of them have been wrongly arrested at the arbitrary place of arrest - many of them have been wrongly called on "the place"
The organization also criticized censorship in the North African country. Accordingly, the government in Cairo blocks websites and online services to stop further protests against al-Sisi. The general has been ruling the country since 2013 after he overthrew democratically elected Islamist president Mohammed Mursi. Thousands of Islamists, government opponents, bloggers and activists have been partially convicted and imprisoned in recent years.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fuchs from Greenland expedition back
Arved Fuchs, a polar explorer who returned from his Greenland expedition on Friday, was greeted on his arrival at the port of Hamburg by skipper Boris Herrmann, who had brought climate activist Greta Thunberg across the Atlantic with the racing yacht "Malizia".
With a team of scientists, Fuchs had studied and documented the consequences of global warming in recent months on his sailing ship "Dagmar Aaen" on the coasts of Iceland and Greenland.
The Fridays for Future movement is a blessing, said the polar scientist. He has been waiting for years for the young generation to speak up. You know for decades that the earth is warming. Nevertheless, many acted as if there were a planet B.
"What happens at sea often happens under the exclusion of the public," Fuchs said. He and his team wanted to inform people about the effects of global warming and the littering of the seas. During the expedition, among other things, a drone measured Greenlandic glacier ice and fished for microplastics with nets, it was said.
For his "fight for a sustainable and respectful use of the world's oceans", the polar explorer from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the "Seadevcon Maritime Award" as part of the Hamburger Klimawoche. "For all of us who care about the survival of the oceans, Arved Fuchs is a great role model", said skipper Boris Herrmann at the awards ceremony.
Expensive spaghetti in Rome: tourists paid 430 euros for noodles
430 euros for two plates of spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant near the Engelsburg in Rome: That seemed too much for two Japanese tourists. The invoice with 80 euros tip included was paid by the two women, but they posted the receipt on Facebook, which triggered hot reactions.
"Such cases are damaging to Rome's reputation and we urge the police to investigate the question of whether this is a fraud," a spokesman for Federagit, the association of guides in Rome, according to the Roman daily Il Messaggero (Friday edition).
The restaurant owners reacted promptly. The Japanese women had ordered not only spaghetti, but also fresh fish, the local owner justified. However, this can not be seen from the invoice. Even a tip of up to 20 percent of the invoice is normal, said the host.
U.S. President Donald Trump could actually be facing a impeachment process after the turbulent revelations of the past few days, the Democrats want to check this out with their inquiry in the House as soon as possible - it's weeks before a decision would be made.
At the beginning of the scandal is supposedly the telephone conversation with the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The whistleblower's accusation, which out of concern for national security and for the democracy of the US has brought the conversation to the public with his complaint, is monstrous: The president has abused the power of his office to press the government of another country to take the election.
The essence of this project can also be seen in the now-published caption of the conversation with Zelensky, although it does not reproduce the full text, but the July 25 phone call is only an episode of a much larger story, centered on Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.
The story starts from the viewpoint of the public in May 2019, when the New York Times reports Rudy Giuliani's travel plans to Ukraine could be helpful. He wants to meet in Kiev with the newly elected president Zelenskyy, and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are delicate. "We do not interfere with an election, we interfere with an investigation, but he does say the newspaper is right".
The lawyer and former New York mayor seems to have been infected with right-wing conspiracy fantasies, which are fixed on Trump’s counter-candidate in the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton had conspired with actors in Ukraine, critics said at the time to construct a cause for the Russia investigation in the US, but this accusation was never taken seriously.
This is about exactly the investigations that Trump will talk so prominently about on the phone with Zelensky in July. The version of Giuliani and the president is: Biuliani's former vice president and currently prospective candidate for the Democratic presidential candidacy, Joe Biden, was to stop Biuliani's senior investigator.
In fact, the procedure was a little different. When Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian Attorney General should go, the investigation against the gas company was already closed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected by it. Schokin himself was also profoundly accused of corrupt behavior, the US government was by far not even the only Western partner who explicitly supported the company's dismissal.
Disruptions on Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social media are down
Users worldwide report massive disruptions on Instagram and Facebook. Accordingly, Germany, the United Kingdom and Spain are mainly affected. On the website allestörungen.de, users report that Facebook has not loaded again and again since about 3.30 pm. Also Instagram issues the error message that content could not be loaded. Also Whatsapp seems to be affected by the disruption, although not to the same extent so far.
Instagram and Co. more often affected by disruptions
It’s not the first massive crash this year. Already in March and July, the services had been out for several hours. And as in the previous cases, users are also resorting to Twitter this time around to air their anger.
Polish scientists rescued in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists were rescued by the Chilean Air Force from the ice of Antarctica. They were on a inflatable boat and several miles from their base when their engine failed. They were lucky in the accident - less than an hour the Chilean rescue helicopter took to rescue.
Eduardo Mosquera, Commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade:
"At 9:30 a.m. we got the message, just before ten we started, and well 20 minutes later we were over the inflatable".
Poland has been operating the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station on King George Island since 1977, 19 scientists working there. The frozen researchers have been safely brought back to their research station.
Warning: Smartphone NIE wireless charging
Practical but harmful
Inductive technology via Qi standard is extremely practical, but should nevertheless not be used.
Since several new smartphones have recently come onto the market, which support wireless charging and sell themselves very well - especially the new iPhone 11 models, we would like to recall a study from the beginning of July. The wireless charging of mobile devices is extremely convenient, but not necessarily recommended.
Higher temperature adds battery
Researchers warn against the wireless charging of smartphones. According to the findings of the University of Warwick, this is extremely harmful for the devices. The reason for this is the significantly greater heat development. If you charge a mobile phone normally by cable, the battery heats up to 27 degrees within three hours. When wireless charging, the researchers have even when the smartphone is perfectly aligned, the temperature on the charging pad also rises slightly higher.
Capacity and lifetime
According to the researchers, the temperature is a decisive factor for the durability of batteries. Every single degree plays a role. When charging at higher temperatures, the battery not only loses its capacity, but it also does not last so long. The life of the iPhone is therefore less. The researchers therefore advise to always charge the smartphone by cable. Since a battery replacement in modern smartphones is always associated with a higher cost, this may be a tip for Apple.
Practical
The technology is extremely convenient: simply place the device on a corresponding charging pad - these are now even already installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is charged without annoying cable salad and cumbersome plug fumming. Since Qi (which stands for inductive energy transmission) should be enforced a worldwide standard, with the exception of the exception of even Apple technology.
Everest Stagnation Photographer: 13 Eight Thousands in Six Months
A Nepalese mountaineer said he climbed 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world in just six months and Nirmal Purja (36) reached the top of Manaslu in Nepal, setting a record, his expedition organizer said.
The former soldier wants to climb all 14 eight-thousands in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible". He once made international headlines: From him comes a viral photo in spring of mountaineers standing on Mount Everest queue.
The image of the mass rally sparked a debate about stronger security measures on the 8,848-metre-high mountain and highest peak on Earth. In May, eleven climbers had died in the ascent within a few days.
A problem for Purja could be the ascent of the 14th Eight Thousand: Currently, Chinese authorities are blocking the Xixabangma Mountain in Tibet. The reason for this is cited, among other things, bad weather. Earlier this week, Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal’s government wants to talk to China to allow it to rise.
Four dead elephants discovered in Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals is a pregnant elephant cow, a police spokesman said on Friday. "We suspect that the elephant was poisoned."
The four carcasses were found in a protected area near the famous and visited by many tourists former rock fortress Sigiriya. The animals were believed to be between 15 and 25 years old, according to the police spokesman. An autopsy was ordered to determine the cause of death.
Nearly 200 elephants are killed each year in Sri Lanka. The perpetrators are often farmers whose land the animals had previously kept harmless. At the same time, around 50 people are killed by elephants each year. This is usually done when the animals move through villages built near their habitat.
It is estimated that only about 7,000 elephants are still alive in Sri Lanka, and their killing is theoretically the death penalty.
British oil tanker detained leaves Iran
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" leaves the port city of Bandar Abbas more than two months after its arrest by Iran, according to the maritime office of Bandar Abbas, according to the news agency IRNA. The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had detained the tanker under British flag on 19 July under the charge of having disregarded regulations of maritime law in the Persian Gulf.
Thomas Cook's Management in Criticism
The House of Commons Economics Committee in charge wants to investigate the bankruptcy of travel giant Thomas Cook in detail. It is intended to deal with the salary packages of the board as well as the question of why the British government did not want to financially support the company struggling for survival. "Our interest is the supervision of the company as well as the control by external auditors," said the committee chairman Rachel Regie in a statement.
Experts say genes are overestimated in colorectal cancer risk
The role of genes in familial increased colorectal cancer risk has apparently been overestimated so far. This is the conclusion that researchers from the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) Heidelberg have reached in a recent study. Other risk factors, such as family eating habits, are therefore likely to weigh more heavily than previously assumed. This has consequences for calculations of the individual colorectal cancer risk, the DKFZ-Wissenschaft emphasizes.
Elon Musk raises Tesla shares
Musk wrote this in an e-mail to Tesla employees published on Thursday by the industry blog “Electrek”, demand being strong, allowing Tesla to post 110,000 orders, Musk’s newsletter said.
The challenge is to bring the cars to the customers quickly, and Tesla will have to raise as many resources as possible by the end of the quarter.
Investors liked the information: Tesla’s shares went out of trading with an increase of over six percent. The price hasn’t increased so strongly in almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla delivered more than 95,000 cars, reaching its best value so far.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. This requires six-digit figures in the current and coming quarters. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are small. Despite the boom, there were losses recently.
Will the UK government bypass Brexit law? Johnson reluctantly
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is hiding over whether he is looking for ways to circumvent the recently adopted law against an unregulated Brexit, and on a similar question he merely told journalists on Friday that his government will abide by applicable law.
The law stipulates that the government must apply for a postponement of the withdrawal date if no agreement with the EU is reached by mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a "capitulation law" that makes negotiations with the EU more difficult.
Former British Prime Minister John Major said on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law, and that Johnson could use a procedural trick to postpone the entry into force of the law until after the EU leaves the country.
Johnson said he is seeking a treaty with the European Union: "We are confident that we will leave the EU on October 31, and the best way is with an agreement."
Iran seems to increase uranium enrichment
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has increased the pressure on European contractors in the dispute over the rescuing of the historic nuclear agreement. "Unfortunately, the European states show inability or lack of readiness when it comes to concrete actions," Rouhani said on Thursday at a press conference on the margins of the UN General Assembly in New York. In the event that they fail to meet their promises of the agreement, he put out "further steps" in 2015.
Background is the conflict around the international agreement to prevent an Iranian atomic bomb, which in return included the pledge to Tehran to normalize economic relations. The US left the agreement alone in 2018 in order to force Iran with "maximum pressure" to change course in the Middle East policy deemed aggressive. The government of President Donald Trump has re-established a new deal with Tehran.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic is now using the centrifuges installed at the beginning of September with uranium or at least preparing them for use. According to IAEA reports, Iran is also preparing to build more than 300 more centrifuges.
Perhaps the Europeans are unwilling to carry their share of the deal and therefore left the Iranians alone with the cost and burden of pressing US sanctions, Rouhani alleged, but there will still be further talks that hopefully bring a solution.
Rouhani continues to deny Iran's involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, the situation has changed after an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September: Germany, France and the United Kingdom followed the U.S. assessment on Monday that Tehran was responsible for the attack. Originally, Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen had admitted to the attack, which was regarded by the U.S. as a false confession.
"Those who make such accusations must provide evidence of this," Rouhani said. However, European leaders had not been able to do so in the talks with him during the UN general debate. Instead, they had only relied on the fact that the rebels in Yemen could not carry out an attack like this. Rouhani had met with Prime Minister Emmanuel and Prime Minister Mac Merkel in recent days.
Before any talks with US President Trump would have to be lifted, Rouhani called on the Washington administration to shift to a policy of “dialogue and reason.”
Comet from another star crossed the solar system
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of space. This was previously achieved. The comet allows conclusions to be drawn about other solar systems.
What was initially only a presumption is now confirmed: an interstellar guest crossing our solar system. The comet from the depths of space was named 2I/Borisov after its discoverer and has aroused the interest of astronomers around the world.
The comet was discovered on August 30 by amateur astronomer Gennadi Borissov at the Margo Observatory in Crimea - with a self-built telescope of 65 centimeters in diameter. Follow-up observations from various observatories not only confirmed that it is an unknown comet, but also showed that it is not from our solar system.
2I/Borisov is only the second interstellar object seen during a flight through our solar system after 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017.
2I/Borisov offers astronomers the rare chance to get close-up insights into an alien solar system before it ever disappears. First observations show that the interstellar comet is typically similar to our own system, as reported by the astrophysical institute of the Canary Islands. "The current velocity of the comet is high, about 150,000 kilometers per hour, which is clearly the far distance of the comet.
According to the analysis, the comet is on a so-called hyperbelt orbit, which leads it out of our system - and is clearly of interstellar origin, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU) revealed. It was also responsible for naming and categorizing objects in the sky. In honor of its discoverer, the interstellar star, which was first named the interstellar star under the catalog number C/2019 Q4
The astronomers are fortunate: Unlike 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov has already been spotted in the approach. This leaves many months for the researchers to investigate. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then be visible by mid-April 2020 with medium-sized telescopes," explained Farnocchia. "Then, it will only be observed with larger, professional telescopes."
Several observatories have already targeted the visitor. A team led by Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, who had already conducted the characterization of 1I/'Oumuamua, determined the diameter of the object at 2 to 16 kilometers in an initial study. Images from the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii show a clear tail of the comet.
Researchers at the Institute of Astrophysics of the Canary Islands (IAC) have already acquired a first so-called spectrum of the interstellar tail star, which provides a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object is similar to that of comets of our solar system, and this indicates that their composition must be similar to that of other solar systems," reported IAC scientist Julia de León.
The discovery of just two interstellar visitors within just two years suggests that these objects could open a new path to exploring certain processes in other solar systems. However, the frequency of such visits is still difficult to estimate. One of the next interstellar visitors could possibly intercept a planned satellite mission of the European Space Agency Esa.
The agency intends to station the three-part spacecraft "Comet Interceptor" (comet interceptor) at a waiting position at 1.5 million kilometers from Earth by 2028. According to Esa’s science director Günther Hasinger, it will be lurking either on an unspoiled, fresh comet from our own solar system, or on an interstellar visitor such as 1I'ua'u.
First landing at Beijing's new Daxing Mega Airport
Just in time for the 70th birthday of the People’s Republic of China, the new mega-airport in the south of the Chinese capital has landed a first passenger aircraft of China United Airlines, a special honor for captain and crew.
By 2022, the new airport will handle around 45 million passengers a year, and by 2025 it will already be 72 million. China's President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion-dollar project. China's latest prestige project is also called "Sea Stars" because of its six-arm building structure.
The complex has four runways to be extended to seven and is equipped with the world’s largest automated air traffic management system. A new U-Bahn will transport passengers to downtown Beijing in just 20 minutes.
Even during construction, the Chinese had repeatedly announced that Berlin could learn from Beijing. The opening of the capital airport in Germany, which has been under construction since 2006, and is much smaller, has been postponed again and again. In contrast, a first passenger machine landed in Beijing after four years.
New supersonic plane to fly in 2030 from London to Sydney in four and a half hours
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - of which the British space agency the UK Space Agency dreams. It is intended to make this possible, for the 2030s targeted flight in supersonic speed, a special drive (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), which the company Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire is developing, the U.S. broadcaster CNN said the agency could speak to the 20th.
In order to advance the project, the British space agency wants to cooperate more closely with the Australian NaSchScheduler. A flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolis currently takes about 20 hours. To date, the only supersonic aircraft for passenger transport known as the U.S.A. The Concorde had covered the New York-Paris route from 1976 until its cessation in 2003 and took three to three-and-a-half hours for it. In the year there was an accident at the airport Charles Concorde at launch.
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport," writes Reaction Engines, among other things, on its homepage. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient travel at a speed of Mach 5 - that is, five times as fast as sound. In addition, such aircraft can also be used outside the Earth's atmosphere and thus enabled the "next generation of devices to be truly used".
Washington riot: Trump wants to track down anonymous tip-offs in Ukraine affair
In the Ukraine affair over possible abuse of power by the US president, Donald Trump wants to track down possible leaks in the White House.
"I want to know who gave the whistleblower the information," Trump told staff at the U.S. Embassy in New York on Thursday, saying the person was "almost a spy" and had been "a bit different" in the past than they are today.
This was regarded as an attempt to intimidate tip givers. The event was not actually public. However, several US media broadcast audio clips of the speech on Friday. Democrats reacted indignantly to the president's statement.
The Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives had announced on Tuesday preparations for a impeachment trial against Trump. Their allegations are mainly based on the written complaint of an anonymous intelligence official who is making serious accusations against Trump and his government headquarters. Under heavy public pressure, the whistleblower's descriptions had been made public on Thursday.
As part of his work, the whistleblower will have received information from several government officials stating that the U.S. president is "using the power of his office" to achieve that another country intervenes in his favor in the 2020 U.S. election.
At the center of the allegations is a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his counterparts to investigate, which could harm his political rival Joe Biden. This is about the previous business of Biden's son Hunter in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his offspring from the Ukrainian bipartisan election in 2020.
The whistleblower also accused the White House of concealment: Leading government officials had endeavoured to keep the exact wording of the conversation under the cover. As usual, an electronic text protocol was made. This was only provided after the conversation on instructions of lawyers from the White House but a specially protected database was removed from a White House system.
The New York Times reported that the reporter was a member of the CIA's foreign intelligence service.
Trump again questioned the credibility of the source on Friday. In a series of tweets on the subject, the president wrote, among other things, that the "so-called whistleblower" had disseminated second-hand information that had turned out to be inaccurate. Therefore, there may not be any tipters or spies at all.
However, as Trump commented in New York about those who allegedly gave the whistleblower information, he sparked outrage. U.S. House Chairwoman Nancy Pelosi reacted alarmed and complained that Trump’s statement once again undermines the integrity of the government.
In the House of Representatives, various investigations against Trump and his surroundings have been underway in various committees for months. In light of the Ukraine accusations, the Democrats are now pushing forward investigations with new force in order to launch a possible impeachment proceedings against Trump.
"The whistleblower has given us a roadmap for our investigation," said the head of the intelligence committee in the House of Representatives, Adam Schiff. Trump attacked Schiff sharply, accusing him of misrepresentation, and again demanding the resignation of the committee chairman. Trump regularly insulted Schiff and had already called for his withdrawal months ago.
More than 300 former U.S. government officials from the security and foreign policy sphere, who were mostly working under Democratic but also under Republican presidents, backed the Democratic-led investigation into a possible impeachment procedure in a statement released on Friday. If the allegations were true, it would be "a ruthless abuse of power" by Trump.
There is no exact timetable for the further procedure. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could try a so-called impeachment procedure. However, the decision on an actual impeachment was taken in the Senate, where Trump’s Republicans have the majority. So far, the prospects of success of such a procedure are low. No U.S. president has been impeached by an impeachment.
VW Works Council: Workplaces are being "sneaked down"
The plans of the VW brand to further reduce costs in production could be at the expense of manufacturing in Germany and Europe. This concerns the car manufacturer’s works council. The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs of ten billion euros by two billion euros by 2023. Of this, 500 million euros are to be saved as early as this year.
One key factor is personnel costs. The “future pact” negotiated between companies and works councils in 2016 already foresees the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020. In principle, a job can only be removed at the automaker if it is virtually proved that the related activities are no longer necessary. In addition, employment security applies until 2029.
However, as our newspaper learned from works council circles, jobs in production that are not actually available are "sneakingly" removed by a different route - so past the official course. Thus, vacant regular jobs would often not be re-occupied.
In these cases, the works council has no way of forcing the resettlement. Meanwhile, in many places there is a lack of staff, the labour density is increasing, the worries about a gradual bleeding out of the automotive plants are increasing. This also increases the fear that the vehicle production could gradually be deducted from Germany and Europe, because it is only in other parts of the world it is cheaper to do so.
The VW brand wants to standardize production worldwide even more and control new projects centrally. This also aims to reduce costs and also accelerate decisions - the goal behind this is to increase productivity and thus competitiveness. Production CEO Andreas Tostmann said at a manager conference in Berlin: "Especially in uncertain times from Brexit to the impending trade war between the US and China, we are well on our feet".
This year, for example, for the first time since 2013, production costs per vehicle would be reduced compared to the previous year. Before journalists, Tostmann said that the production time for the Golf 8, which is to be presented in Wolfsburg on October 24, would be shortened by 1.1 hours. Exact figures on the production time do not mention VW, according to our newspaper information, it is round for the Golf 7
Twenty hours.
In our region, the main plant in Wolfsburg is the only VW factory where vehicles are produced. The plants in Braunschweig and Salzgitter produce components. For Wolfsburg, the internal rule of thumb applies that 800,000 cars must be built annually in order for the plant to be satisfactorily profitable. In 2018, however, the utilization in Wolfsburg was only around 700,000 new vehicles and the consumption was reduced due to the decrease in demand.
As production director Tostmann announced last year, however, one million cars should "perspectively" roll off the line in Wolfsburg. This is to make the bundling of the golf production in the main plant possible - because the plant in Zwickau is abandoning the golf production by the conversion to the site for the e-car production.
In addition, the SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are being produced in Wolfsburg. However, the sales figures of Golf and Tiguan have recently declined. Therefore, expectations now rest on the Golf 8. Despite all efforts to build e-mobility, he should remain the Wolfsburger bread and butter car for the time being.
Voodoo forced to prostitute: human traffickers convicted
Young women from Nigeria have been sworn in, swept into the Ruhr area and forced into prostitution. Six suspected traffickers have been sentenced to prison for this.
Six suspected traffickers from Nigeria have been sentenced on Friday in Bochum to probation and imprisonment of up to eight years and three months. The defendants had swept young women from Nigeria into the Ruhr area and forced them to prostitution. To force their obedience, the Nigerians who were willing to leave had a ritual in front of a voodoo-able priest.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old. They were brought with the help of Libyan smugglers in inflatable boats across the Mediterranean. However, the dream of a better future did not come true. Arriving in Germany, they were distributed to various brothels to handle the alleged smuggling costs of an average of 25,000 euros. The wages were therefore completely taken from them.
The defendants - four men and two women - had admitted the intrusion and subsequent distribution of the young Nigerian women into brothels in the trial. "The work made the women physically and mentally difficult to create," said Judge Isabel Hoffmann at the verdict. "Some were rightly disgusted."
The verdicts are on commercial and gang-based infiltration of foreigners, human trafficking, prostitution and heavy forced prostitution.
UFO calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
FIm’s ongoing dispute with the Lufthansa Group has again threatened the flight attendants union UFO with strikes.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the union will "on October 14 inform about the labour struggle measures in the LH group", UFO tariff board Daniel Flohr announced on Friday. Lufthansa and its subsidiary Eurowings have been refusing to conduct collective bargaining with the UFO for months. This also concerns the question of whether the union collective agreements with Lufthansa have been lawfully cancelled.
On this point, UFO now sees itself strengthened after a decision of the Frankfurt Labour Court. Lufthansa wanted to make it clear that the collective agreements were not terminated. The court rejected the applications. The company confirmed the decision and is examining the appeal. "I think that a second court sees the matter completely differently," said UFO CEO Flohr.
In August, Lufthansa also filed an application with the Frankfurt State Labour Court to have the status of UFOs as a trade union verified by court. The company argues that the trade union has not appointed a representative board for months and is therefore unable to fulfil its role as a collective bargaining partner.
A fierce dispute had preceded the leadership of the trade union, in the course of which numerous members of the board and the advisory board resigned, including the longtime union leader Nicoley Baublies. Due to doubts about its leadership, the UFO had suspended an already begun vote on strikes by cabin crew at Eurowings at the end of July.
Easier entry: Saudi Arabia announces new visa system
So far, Saudi Arabia has not been known as an international tourist magnet, but this is now supposed to change. The country on the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa regulations.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia aims to attract more international tourists. By 2030, it aims to increase the number of international and domestic visitors to 100 million per year, the Tourism Commission said.
"The opening of Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment for our country," said Ahmad Al-Chatib, the chairman of the tourism commission.
Saudi Arabia is difficult to access for tourists so far. Visas are usually only granted for short business trips, religious pilgrimages or visitors with relatives in the desert state. With the new rules, the arch-conservative Kingdom hopes to increase revenue from the tourism business. According to its own statement, Riad wants to reduce its dependence on oil trade.
By mid-September, several rockets and drones had hit two of the most important oil plants in eastern Saudi Arabia: the country’s largest oil refinery in Abkaik and the Churais oil field. As a result, national oil production fell drastically, oil prices shot up, and it is expected that it will take several weeks for the kingdom’s oil production to return to its old levels.
Justin and Hailey Bieber are getting ready for a wedding
Singer Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) are preparing for their wedding party. The model posted several party photos in their Instagram Stories on Thursday (local time), showing her in a white wedding look. Reality star Kendall Jenner (23) and others had organized a bachelor party in Los Angeles, according to People magazine.
Justin posted several colorful suits on Instagram, including banana prints, and asked his followers: "Help me choose my tuxedo for the wedding." According to media reports, the celebrity couple plans to marry church next weekend.
The Biebers gave themselves the yes word a year ago in a New York State Registry office.
In an interview with Australian Vogue, Hailey recently explained that the two had found a common level after initial problems: "If you don't want to compromise, you can't have a relationship."
Two dead in plane crash in Czech Republic
Two people were killed in the crash of a small aircraft in the west of the Czech Republic. The wreck was discovered on Friday in a forest area near the city of Mecin (Mechin), police said. The dead were a 38-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man.
The authorities had been searching for the plane since Thursday evening, after the crew had issued an emergency signal via GPS. A military helicopter was also in use during the search. The cause of the accident still needs to be determined. The crash site is located about 30 kilometers south of Pilsen (Pilsen) and 100 kilometers northeast of Regensburg.
Half of European tree species are at risk of extinction
In addition to pests, diseases, foreign species, unsustainable logging and the growth of cities are also the causes of the threat, the World Conservation Union (UICN) reported on Friday in Brussels. It examined the populations of all 454 species of trees known in Europe. 265 of these are not found on any other continent. Of these 265, 58 percent are threatened. 66 are already at the highest level.
The IUCN classifies endangered species into six categories: from "potentially endangered" to "endangered", "highly endangered", "endangered by extinction" and "extinct in nature" to "extinct" and lists more than 28,000 species of animals and plants worldwide as endangered.
Eberesh and wild horse chestnut threatened
According to one of the authors, David Allen, of the German Press Agency, "most of them are threatened because the populations are anyway small or because of the transformation or weakening of their habitats".
It also looks bad for the wild Common Horse Chestnuts Park. They have been considered "endangered" since 2017, level two of the IUCN scale. The biggest threat is the Balkan miner moth besides a mushroom. It has spread from Southeast Europe since the 1980s all over the continent and has hardly any natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild horse chestnuts in 10,000.
Shrub species and mosses also at risk
At the same time, the IUCN scientists created new European Red Lists for molluscs, shrubs and mosses. More than a fifth of molluscs and mosses and almost half of all shrub species are endangered, according to the IUCN. This is mainly due to the destruction of the wild, to introduced species, agricultural practices and climate change.
“This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet,” said Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the Europe Office. “We need to limit human impact on our ecosystems and make the protection of these species a priority.”
Earthquake near Istanbul: 34 injured reported
The latest earthquake in Turkey has left 34 people injured, with no casualties, dozens of people leaving their homes, and 14 schools in Istanbul have been closed for security reasons, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings have been damaged. Since the earthquake the previous day, there have been almost 200 aftershocks. The magnitude 5.8 earthquake on Thursday shook the Marmara region in front of Istanbul and caused panic in the metropolis of millions.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes, Istanbul’s mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said.
Under the Marmara Sea lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian Disruption, which marks the boundary between the Eurasian and Anatolian Plate.
One of the most severe earthquakes was one of the magnitude 7.6 in 1999 near Istanbul. The epicenter was then located in Gölcük, southeast of Istanbul. More than 17,000 people died.
As early as Tuesday, a magnitude 4.6 quake had shaken the region around Istanbul, and authorities called on residents to stay away from damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira perform in halftime show
Latin pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will lead the mid-term show of the next American football final Super Bowl. The singers announced on Twitter. "It's not going to be bigger," Shakira wrote to a photo of herself and Lopez. She is insanely excited to be on the Super Bowl stage so far as February 2nd will be in Miami.
Jennifer Lopez said she had been dreaming of performing at the Super Bowl since 1996, when she saw Diana Ross fly into the sky at the halftime show. "Now it's even more special because the NFL is 100 years old and I'm going to perform with another Latina." She can't wait to show "what we girls can do on the biggest stage in the world".
Shakira said in a statement that she felt honored to be on one of the world’s largest stages alongside another artist, representing Latinos and Latinas from the United States and around the world. “And then on my birthday too!” The main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter that it was the first time the two “queens” were on stage together.
Shakira is from Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents are from Puerto Rico.
Combating declining viewership
The Super Bowl is the pinnacle of the American football season. The game and the half-time show are among the most watched TV broadcasts in the US. Although you have recently dropped viewing numbers: This February, the spectacle in the US attracted the fewest viewers in more than ten years. Nevertheless, it was still almost a hundred million people on average.
There had been a riot in the run-up to the halftime show of the previous Super Bowl: In the dispute over dealings with quarterback Colin Kaepernick, according to media reports last February, top stars such as Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not want to perform. Finally, the pop group Maroon 5 led the halftime show - the reviews were not friendly.
Kaepernick, then quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, had not been on his knees in the 2016/17 season before NFL games for reasons of protest against police violence and racism. With his protest in 2017, Kaepernick triggered a movement, numerous players took the gesture. This caused great excitement, U.S. President Donald Trump's most attacked football club.
Cook bankruptcy: Hotels get money from insurance
Some banks are likely to face the bankruptcy of the travel provider Thomas Cook, according to a press report. There are high depreciation risks on outstanding bonds and loans. This is also affected by Credit Suisse, writes the "Financial Times" in its issue of Friday.
According to the report, banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit or Credit Suisse would probably have to write off their books in total in the amount of up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.8 billion (about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2 billion), according to estimates by the consulting firm AlixPartners.
The creditors of bonds would have to accept write-offs from <0xC2><0xA3>900 million to <0xC2><0xA3>1 billion and the lenders between <0xC2><0xA3>550 million and <0xC2><0xA3>825 million. The amounts actually to be written-off are likely to be at the top of the bandwidths, an expert told the paper.
How big the losses of the creditors will actually be in the end will be revealed after the insolvency proceedings end. A person close to this procedure did not sprout too much hope. For example, the approximately 40 aircraft of Thomas Cook in the UK are "old" and many of the properties are in poor positions. Most money can probably be obtained with the sale of the airport slots and the Thomas Cook brand.
Rackete reportedly brought suspected murderers to Italy
Sea-Watch captain Carola Rackete may have taken men to Italy who were said to have tortured and killed people in Libya. "We cannot rule this out, but we do not have any secure information about it ourselves," Sea-Watch spokesman Ruben Neugebauer told the news agency dpa.
Other migrants had recognized the three men in Italy. They are accused of raping, torturing and killing people in Libya. The alleged perpetrators were arrested in the reception camp in Messina, Italy. New builders stressed that the refugee organizations could not check who they left on their ships. "They come without passports".
Carola Rackete had brought illegal migrants to the port of Lampedusa on June 29, hitting a ship of the Italian financial police. On that day, the three suspects were also reported to have arrived there. The captain is under investigation for aid to illegal immigration.
U.S. government warns against Huawei
The head of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the federal government not to trust the Chinese networking provider Huawei.
We believe the risks are too great," Pai told the "Handelsblatt" with a view to building the new 5G mobile network.
China has a “national security law” that requires every company “under Chinese jurisdiction” to follow the instructions of the security bodies.
The current law also prohibits companies from informing third parties about such requests, which makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
In the meantime, the federal government has agreed to demand a "declaration of confidence" from suppliers.
Berlin wants to first try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, reports the "Handelsblatt", citing its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. 5G technology is not only made up of hardware:
The software in particular is important to keep the devices up to date. This software consists of billions of lines of code that change over time," Pai said.
It would be "very difficult to imagine" that a government agency, "no matter where, would be able to review every single update in real time to track down security risks," the FCC chief continued.
He accuses the Chinese company Huawei of close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
The ownership of the company is opaque, and the employee company, which allegedly owns the company, is not necessarily independent of the government," Pai told the "Handelsblatt".
Pai was recently in Berlin for talks to promote the position of the U.S. government, and he said the US government is working on a new strategy to promote the U.S. position.
Chemistry factory in northern France burns: schools closed
At night, residents hear explosions. A giant firewall illuminates the sky above a northern French chemical factory. The fire is extinguished after hours - but the cleaning work could now take days.
After a fire in a chemical factory in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday, the schools and nurseries in the region remain closed.
Twelve municipalities were prevented from opening on Friday, the responsible prefecture said. The Ministry of the Interior had urged citizens to stay as far as possible in buildings and not to expose themselves to smoke. There were no injured people. Farmers and breeders were called on to bring their animals indoors, protect their feed and stop the harvest for the time being.
The fire was completely extinguished on Thursday evening, the prefecture said. There is still a risk that after the extinguishing odor spread, according to the prefecture on Twitter. According to the prefecture, 240 firefighters and 90 police and gendarmes were deployed at the site.
A giant black smoke column had previously emerged from the chemical factory. French media reported huge flames and explosions in the factory of the company Lubrizol, which produces additives for oils. The production plant is located a few kilometers from the city center.
According to authorities, the factory in Normandy belongs to the so-called Seveso category of hazardous sites, which are specially monitored. In Seveso, Italy, near Milan, there was a devastating chemical accident in 1976.
The prefect of the Normandy region, Pierre-André Durand, told the news station BFMTV that there was initially no "high toxicity" in samples, but a contamination of the nearby Seine could not be ruled out. In the river, dams were built against the pollution, the prefecture said.
Rouen, a regional metropolis located on the Seine River between Paris and the port city of Le Havre, is located between Paris and Le Havre, France.
French Finance Minister: "Germany needs to invest now"
French Economic and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has called on Germany to invest more to boost economic growth in the eurozone.
Germany must invest and now, the sooner the better," Le Maire said on Thursday evening at the presentation of the French budget for the coming year.
The economy in the eurozone is weakening, the minister warned.
We must not wait until the economic situation worsens to make the necessary decisions."
States that have budgetary leeway for more investments should act, Le Maire said, among other things, with regard to Germany.
France does not have this leeway, the minister added, referring to its country's high national debt, which is more than 98 percent of gross domestic product. The French public debt needs to be "stabilized" and "lower", Le Maire said.
In recent years, German politicians have repeatedly appealed to Germany to make more public investments in order to revive the European economy. In return, German politicians have repeatedly urged France to get its budget deficit under control.
The French budget for 2020, which was presented on Thursday, provides for tax breaks of more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>9 billion for households.
The French government is responding to the protests of the yellow vest movement, which is expected to fall to 2.2 percent, according to expected 3.1 percent this year.
Is he still trying to trick?: Johnson evades question about Brexit tactics
British Prime Minister Johnson strongly criticizes Parliament's "Capitulation Act".
Parliament is back, a law requires the British prime minister to avoid a chaos Brexit. However, critics fear that Boris Johnson could still use a loophole. Addressed to this possibility, however, the Tory politician is evading.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is hiding over whether he wants to enforce an unregulated Brexit - despite the law recently passed by Parliament, which is exactly what is supposed to prevent that.
The law stipulates that the government must apply for a postponement of the withdrawal date if no agreement with the EU is reached by mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a "surrender law" that makes negotiations with the EU more difficult.
Former British Prime Minister John Major had expressed the presumption on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law. The Prime Minister could use a procedural trick that postpones the entry into force of the law to the time after EU exit. Johnson said he is seeking a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident of a way to leave the EU on October 31".
Johnson's chief adviser Dominic Cummings, meanwhile, stated that he felt the political disputes over Brexit as a "walk in the park" and expressed confidence that the aimed exit from the EU would still come about: "We are enjoying this, we will win, we will (remember: out of the EU), don't worry," Cummings told a British newspaper.
Cummings, who led the Brexit campaign “Vote Leave” during the 2016 EU referendum campaign, is now acting as chief strategist in the British seat of government Downing Street, behind the uncompromising policies that have led the prime minister to a seemingly hopeless situation.
The Polaroid Diaries by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood in front of the camera of Linda McCartney, who has become one of the great rock photographers. But it doesn't always have to be the great glamour. The photo book "The Polaroid Diaries" (pockets) dives deep into the very private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married to her from 1969 until Linda's death in 1998, was visibly proud and moved when he presented the book "The Polaroid Diaries" at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London in mid-September, including Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretenders frontwoman Chrissie Hynde.
After the launch event, McCartney wrote on Instagram: “#ThePolaroidDiaries is a glimpse into the life of an extraordinary family from the pre-Instagram era, a celebration of LindaMcCartney’s legacy as a committed artist and the instant magic of the Polaroid film.”
With Linda McCartney, who studied art history at the University of Aizona until she found the photography, the camera was always there. Thousands of Polaroids made it, a few hundred of which are now published for the first time in "The Polaroid Diaries".
There are portraits, still lifes, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 70s to the late 90s. "She wanted real moments," writes art critic Ekow Eshun in his foreword. And of course, one is always at the center: her husband Paul - like you may never have seen him before.
Then he dances with his daughter Mary on his shoulders, phones in bathrobe with a bag on his head or wears uneven moonboots. Sure, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but who had always walked beyond the spotlight on their farm in southern England or in Scotland also led a quite normal life. So, Mary McCartney had also told one of her fathers that she had been bedding as a baby.
Like hardly any other medium, the Poloraid camera captures the immediate moment. Linda McCartney’s footage is certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than mere snapshots.
It's about the decisive click: you have to recognize when a great photo happens in front of you. And then you have to snap it at the exact right moment," said Paul McCartney. "If you snap it two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it can be a completely different photo." And Linda would have had the gift of always capturing exactly the right moment. "She just knew she had it," Paul said in the Essay.
The light, the composition, the image detail and the colors are right, which makes "The Polaroid Diaries" not only an entertaining picture book for Beatles fans, but also an anecdotal and a great aesthetic pleasure, where landscapes seem like abstract paintings. The perfect addition to the newly published "Beatles-Albe".
"We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran"
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview released on Friday that Turkey could not stop oil and gas imports from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there," Erdogan said in New York, where he attended the UN General Assembly.
However, Erdogan admitted that Turkey had problems importing Iranian oil, as some companies had withdrawn “due to US threats.”
Nevertheless, Turkey will "particularly continue our relations with Iran on this issue and on many other issues," the Turkish president said, who had repeatedly criticized US sanctions against Iran in the past.
The U.S. has been pursuing a policy of "maximum pressure" against the Islamic Republic since its withdrawal from the international nuclear agreement with Iran. According to the U.S., Iran is secretly pursuing a nuclear program and does not abide by the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to the collapse of Iran’s oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran. In recent months, tensions in the Gulf region have intensified considerably.
U.S. government wants to restrict reception of refugees
The U.S. government wants to drastically restrict the admission of refugees. The U.S. State Department said on Thursday that the annual ceiling of a resettlement program should be lowered from currently 30,000 to 18,000 refugees, a cut of 40 percent.
The U.S. Department of State said it would continue to be committed to supporting refugees, but the most important task was to protect and serve U.S. citizens. Currently, the U.S. immigration system is overloaded.
The U.S. government wants to focus on hosting two groups of refugees: people persecuted for their beliefs – and Iraqis who have helped the U.S. military in the country and have been endangered by it, according to the State Department’s statement, while Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador are to host a maximum of 1,500 refugees.
The programme, launched in 1980, selects refugees from UN camps around the world and relocates them to the United States. The ceiling of 18,000 refugees for the 2020 budget year would be the lowest in the history of the programme. Even the current ceiling of 30,000 is a low. When the predecessor of US President Donald Trump, Barack Obama, the figure was narrowly 8 left the White House.
Aid organizations reacted horrified to the announced lowering of the ceiling. "This is a very sad day for America," said David Miliband, head of the International Rescue Committee, which would further damage its leadership role in protecting the world's most vulnerable people.
Trump is trying to strictly limit immigration to the US – legally and illegally. The US government says it expects 350,000 asylum applications for the coming fiscal year. These figures are separate from the resettlement program.
Donald Trump: “Come close to a spy”
U.S. President Donald Trump has accused whistleblowers of espionage in the whistleblower affair. Whoever has sniffed the whistleblower who accused him of abuse of power, "comes close to a spy," Trump said, according to a recording of a private event on Thursday in New York.
Trump spoke to staff at the U.N. mission. When asked about the person who informed the whistleblower about controversial events in the White House, he replied, "This is close to a spy." Then Trump added, "Do you know what we did in the old days when we were smart? Right. The spies and betrayal we used to do with it until now."
Observers assessed the latter remark as a possible allusion to the death penalty. The Democrats sharply criticized Trump’s remarks and accused him of intimidating witnesses. It was also an attempt to obstruct a Congressional investigation into a possible impeachment procedure against him, wrote the chairmen of the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Supervisory Services.
The whistleblower accuses the president in a now-published complaint of abusing his office in order to request interference from another country in the U.S. election 2020. Specifically, it is about his controversial telephone conversation with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyj in the summer: In the conversation, Trump suggested his best investigations against Joeden Bieber possible.
It is still unclear who the whistleblower is and who his informants are, but the New York Times reports that the whistleblower is said to be a CIA foreign intelligence analyst.
Refugee boat capsized: baby and toddler drowned in Aegean
People are constantly trying to cross the Aegean Sea from Turkey to Greece, where the often too small boats are often skewed. The sinking of a inflatable boat has now killed seven migrants, including five children.
Seven migrants were killed in the sinking of an inflatable boat in the Greek island of Chios, including a baby and four other children, the Greek Coast Guard reported. Four children, three women and five men were rescued from the floods by the crew of a passing ferry.
Among the victims is also a smuggler, reported the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr. The migrants had left Turkey in the morning. They had tried to reach the small archipelago of Inousses in the northeast of the island of Chios. Inousses is located between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
It is not yet known from which countries the migrants come. Hundreds of migrants from Turkey are currently transferring to the Greek islands in the eastern Aegean Sea, mostly in far too small boats. Last year, 174 people died on this route, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR).
The Who cancel concert
A US concert by rock band The Who has come to a sudden end due to an awkwardness of lead singer Roger Daltrey. In the middle of his performance on Wednesday evening (local time) in Houston, his voice failed to serve. At the eighth song, Daltrey told the audience, "I think I should leave it while it's still running".
Lead guitarist Pete Townsend apologized, adding that Daltrey "can't really speak right now". Townsend promised the audience to come at his expense at a reparation concert.
The Who cancelled their scheduled performances for Friday in Dallas and Sunday in Denver. They are scheduled to be picked up at a later date. 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old bandmate Townsend are the only remaining founding members. The British cult band formed 55 years ago.
Rental suddenly ceased: WeWork makes real estate markets tremble
In New York, WeWork has risen to become the largest office tenant.
In just a few years, WeWork is moving from a small startup to a driving force in the world’s most expensive real estate markets. But now the company is in crisis and landlords have to worry about billions of dollars in revenue.
The crisis of the office rental company WeWork threatens to disrupt the balance in the world's largest real estate markets. The company had recently dismissed founder Adam Neumann as chief executive, postponed the planned IPO and started selling subsidiaries and assets such as the private jet for the executives, in order to gain financial leeway for the coming weeks and months. In addition, the UK's new "Financial Times" has reported.
WeWork rents large office space long-term and leases it short-term in part small units to members. This can be individual freelancers, small startups or entire departments of large corporations. So far, WeWork has been burning money with this business at a breathtaking speed. Last year, the company immediately entered a loss of 1.6 billion dollars, with a turnover of 1.8 billion dollars. This year alone, the rental costs are expected to increase immediately.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now signed leases of up to 15 years, resulting in commitments of more than $40 billion, which could be a problem not only for the company itself and its investors, but for entire real estate markets.
According to calculations by economist Dan Alpert of Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork in Manhattan, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, has rented nearly 300,000 square meters of office space in the past 24 months. WeWorks new contracts alone ensured that the demand for offices in New York was greater than the newly launched spaces in New York. Without WeWorks, Ex-
WeWork is the main tenant in an office building in the centre of the financial metropolis that Deka bought last year for almost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million, and it is the largest building in the UK and the largest building in the world.
Many landlords have converted their properties for the requirements of WeWork with high investments. If WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon, the property owners would probably have to write off part of the expected billions of revenues. Despite the long-term lease agreements, they do not have access to the reserves of WeWork Specialpose. Because the lease of the individual locations of WeWork
Russia once again captured many North Korean fishermen
The Russian Coast Guard has once again taken action against North Korean fishermen. In recent days, a total of 262 other poachers who had fished illegally in the waters have been arrested, according to the Russian domestic intelligence service FSB told the agency Interfax on Friday.
Only ten days ago, 161 North Korean fishermen were arrested. Previously, the border guards had been shot and three of them injured. This time there were no injured, it said. Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages.
The North Korean fishermen were accordingly on the way in Russian territorial waters. There, according to their own data, the coastal guard of Russia conducts patrols to protect their marine biological resources. During the re-checks, 30,000 squids were discovered. In addition, according to the data, three fishermen and two motor boats were seized and after Nachodka and Posjet brought more coastal agency in 2018.
The Russian Fisheries Authority had not issued any fishing licences to the North Koreans this year, even after complaints from local entrepreneurs. Thousands of fishermen from North Korea have already been arrested there, according to media in 2019.
The head of the association of Russian fishing companies in the far-eastern region of Primorje, Georgi Martynov, recently also complained of high environmental damage by the North Korean fishermen. They fished with in Russia banned tight mesh synthetic nets. With these, even small creatures would be taken out of the sea. In addition, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea, where they would need to dismantle the technical regulations by 200 years.
According to the FSB, three members of the Russian Coast Guard were injured in the arrests last week. A North Korean, who was also wounded, later died of his injuries. On September 17, Russian border guards arrested first a North Korean boat and then a second after it opened fire.
US bans entry to former President Castro
The U.S. has banned the entry of former Cuban President Raúl Castro and his children. The U.S. State Department justified this in a statement on Thursday with Castro's involvement in "gross human rights violations". As head of the Communist Party of the Caribbean state, he advocates a system in which thousands of Cubans are arbitrarily detained and there are more than 100 political prisoners.
As chairman of the armed forces, the brother of the late revolutionary leader Fidel Castro is also complicit in human rights violations there through the support of the President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. "The disregard for human rights and the use of force by the Cuban regime to support the former Maduro regime, are responsible for the ongoing crises in Cuba and in Venezuela"
President Donald Trump on Wednesday issued a ban on entry, among other things, against members of the Venezuelan government and the military. In Venezuela, a fierce power struggle between the government and the opposition has been raging for months. The US has imposed a whole series of sanctions against Maduro's government to force him to kneel and pledge to the opposition leader and self-appointed interim president Juan Guaidó.
Cuba is regarded as one of Maduro’s closest allies. The socialist Caribbean island receives oil from Venezuela in exchange for the services of posted doctors. According to the estimates of the US and the Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous intelligence agents to Venezuela to help the government with the suppression of government opponents.
New climate protests by Fridays for Future
A week after the biggest international climate protests to date, thousands of people want to take to the streets for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement is once again planning actions and rallies in dozens of countries worldwide. New Zealand and Australia are likely to make the start because of the time shift, before the protests spread across Europe to North America. There, climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to participate in a mass rally in Montreal, Canada. In front of the White House in Washington, too.
It is relatively unclear how big the global appeal will be this Friday after the record participation of the previous week. Thunberg herself was good things. "Last Friday, over four million people went on strike for the climate. This Friday, we will do it again!" she wrote on Twitter. So far, as part of the strike week, there have been 6383 actions in 170 countries, she added.
In particular in Germany, the influx was very large last Friday. A good third of all worldwide demonstrators - around 1.4 million - had participated in the protests in 575 German cities according to estimates by Fridays for Future. This time, according to a list of the movement, rallies are planned in at least 65 cities. Among them in metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities the people want to go to Jüchen in the Westerland.
At the age of 15 at the time, Thunberg had sat before the Swedish parliament in August 2018 to call on the politicians of their country to make a stronger commitment to climate protection. This has resulted in the Fridays-for-Future movement within a short period of time. The climate protests mainly involve students and students, but increasingly also scientists and other adults.
Together, they demand more ambition from policymakers in the fight against global warming and the impending climate catastrophe. In particular, according to the Paris climate agreement, global warming must be contained below 1.5 degrees Celsius compared to the pre-industrial period.
Almost a month ago, after a two-week transatlantic trip, Thunberg had arrived in New York on a high-sea racing yacht. There she had recently participated in climate protests and United Nations summits. On Monday, she gave an emotional speech at the UN, in which she spoke more strongly to the heads of state and government of the earth at her Nobel Prize for climate protection.
Russia bans smoking on balcony
In the future, people in Russia will no longer be allowed to smoke on the balcony. This provides for a change in fire protection. "This also applies to smoking," a spokesman for the emergency ministry in Moscow said on Thursday, according to the agency Tass. The ban is expected to enter into force on 1 October.
Anyone who smokes will face a fine of 3,000 rubles (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>42.46). If the cigarette should ignite a fire, the penalty is higher. According to the Ministry, the ban also includes burning candles. Also grilling meat skewers on the balcony is no longer allowed.
Attack on cybercriminals - Investigators lift servers
In the fight against crime on the Internet, German investigators have for the first time excavated a large server provider for illegal business on the darknet.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspected, as operators of a data center in a former NATO bunker in Traben-Trarbach an der Mosel, to have hosted numerous websites through the internationally operating criminals their machinations.
The prosecutor general in Koblenz said that seven suspects were arrested in a major action on Thursday night. The darknet is a shielded part of the internet.
According to the prosecutor general's office, the attack on 1.25 million telecom routers at the end of November 2016 was also controlled by a server in the cyber bunker.
A web hoster provides the infrastructure for an internet presence, the company said.
During the access operation with the support of special forces such as the GSG9, there were searches in Germany and neighboring foreign countries. It was the result of almost five years of investigations. At noon, the investigators want to inform about further details.

Climate protests <0xC7><0x80> Who are Thunberg’s backers?
A sense of justice and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that warm the climate. All the more surprising that a 16-year-old girl is holding the mirror in front of the power people of this time. But what is behind it? Is it the willingness or smart marketing of a climate activist? Historical mastery or manipulative tactics for his own sake
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg puts the masses in motion and brings young people to rise up for a better climate-friendly world recently. It is historically not the first time in Europe that a young person manages to attract a collection of children and young people for themselves. As early as 1212, a child named Nicholas from Cologne has made it felt like a choice to work for a more just world.
But is there a dark side to this? Why does it take a stock called "We don't have time" to save the world? In addition, Greta Thunberg has rich PR managers by her side. By the way, her mother has published a book, which has sold itself extensively, thanks to the media's daughter in the spotlight. Also, the long-established follower of Greta Thunberg was also a good one.
Here the spirits now differ: Is it morally right to enrich oneself financially in saving the world? Is it still authentic when certain circles of people work together with stockbrokers during the world rescue operation? No matter what position is ultimately taken in this, a critical and reflective viewpoint is increasingly important in a democratically shaped society. Therefore, democracy can make it critically meaningful to have a different opinion.
Comet Discovered: Interstellar Guest Crossing Our Solar System
An alien comet is currently crossing our solar system.
The astronomers' assumptions have been confirmed: an alien comet is currently crossing our solar system - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching/Washington - Scientists have long suspected it, but now they have certainty: a comet from another star is currently crossing our solar system, named after its discoverer 2I/Borisov, and currently employs astronomers around the world.
2I/Borisov: Comet discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea
The body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borissov in Crimea. He looked up to the sky with a self-built telescope and further follow-up observations confirmed his first suspicion. It is actually an unknown comet that is not from our solar system. It is only the second of its kind to be seen during the flight.
The great opportunity for astronomers is now to get close-up insights into an alien solar system. Apparently, the comet resembles those of our own system, as reported by the Canary Islands Institute of Astrophysics. The comet is clearly of interstellar origin, according to the International Astronomical Union (IAC), and is currently moving on a so-called hyperbolic orbit that exits it from our system.
Comet was spotted before approaching - and can be observed for several months
However, before the time comes, astronomers can observe it in depth, because unlike its predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been spotted in its approach, which means that it can be observed from Earth for many months. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then by April 2020 with medium-sized telescopes," explains Davide Farnoc.
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
First Findings About Comet 2I/Borisov Raise Hopes in Science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated to be 2 to 16 kilometers in diameter. At the same time, the celestial body appears to be similar to our comet - because, as IAC researcher Julia de León puts it, the spectrum of the star is similar to ours. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form through similar processes as in ours, added de León Kollege L.
The fact that two such objects have already been discovered within just two years may allow a new way of exploring certain processes in other solar systems.
Recently, a giant asteroid passed by the Earth and came dangerously close to it.
"Absolutely reprehensible": Rachel Johnson horrified by brother
Boris Johnson is getting lonely. First his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister scourges with clear words the warlike language of the prime minister as "good tasteless." It is not the brother she knows.
"Capitulation," "fraud," contract: Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and continues to upgrade - at least verbally. During the House of Commons questioning session on Wednesday, this met with massive outrage from the opposition, and in the meantime, more critics have spoken out: dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author told Sky News that her brother uses words such as surrender, as if the opponents of an EU exit should be "hung, stretched, quadrupled, tarred and feathered", she deems this extremely reprehensible. She does not recognize her brother's version, said Rachel Johnsons, who was at the UK's anti-parliament in the elections.
In particular, she stumbled upon the fact that her brother Jo Cox mentioned "sisterless" for an EU-friendly MEP who had been apparently "stirred up" by a neo-Nazi a few days before the 2016 withdrawal referendum. Her memory could best be honored by running through Brexit, Boris Johnson had said in the House of Commons. "It is very tasteless to behave first to someone who has come from the MEP.
Cox's widower also sharply criticized the prime minister. "It makes me sick when Jo's name is used in this way," he tweeted. The best way to honor her is to stand up passionately and decisively for what you believe - no matter what your opinion is. But never to "demonize the other side". He also lamented that an atmosphere had become more likely to be attacked.
Just a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson’s younger brother Jo had resigned from his post as Secretary of State and his mandate as Tory MP. “I’ve been torn between family loyalty and national interest in recent months – it’s an indissoluble tension,” Jo Johnson explained.
Johnson's language also met with sharp criticism in the Church. As reported by the "Times", all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticize the language that "is not worthy of this country". In a joint statement, they stated: "In recent days, the language has been unacceptable, both in debates and outside parliament". We should speak with respect to each other.
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez perform at the Super Bowl
The NFL is setting a strong signal in the year of its 100th anniversary: In the mid-term show of the upcoming Super Bowl, two women with Latino roots are performing, promising "an explosion of fun and energy."
Latina power at the Super Bowl: Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the halftime show at the upcoming final of the US NFL football league, the organizers announced on Thursday (local time).
"I feel incredibly honored and humbled to represent the Latino community alongside JLo, because it has an incredible strength in the U.S.," Shakira said in a video.
The final of the American Football League, which celebrates its 100th birthday next year, will take place on February 2 in Miami. In the metropolis at the southern tip of Florida, many people live with Latin American roots. Shakira ("Waka Waka") comes from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Floor") is of Puerto Rican origin.
"I love that this time the Super Bowl will put two women on stage - and two Latinas," Lopez said. This sends an important message to all Americans and the world, promising for the show "an explosion of fun and energy."
The 50-year-old was born in New York after her parents emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s, she landed big hits with songs such as "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" and later also released songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as an actress and can be seen in German cinemas from November in the drama "Hustlers".
Shakira became known in Colombia as the star of a telenovela and singer, making her worldwide breakthrough in 2001 with her first bilingual album and single "Whenever, Wherever".
The announcement of the half-time guests is eagerly awaited in the US every time. This year, many consider the choice also a political gesture. After all, the country is deeply divided, not least by President Donald Trump’s immigration policy.
The Super Bowl is the biggest U.S. sporting event and at the same time a gigantic advertising spectacle. Musicians such as Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones caused excitement there. Usually watching well over 100 million television viewers at the NFL final, it is also very popular in Germany nowadays.
Last year there was political controversy in advance. The reason was the quarrel about quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had refused to rise up in protest against police violence against blacks while playing the national anthem.
An actor and YouTuber attacks Egypt’s ruler: For now, Mohamed Ali prefers to stay abroad.
The two men who have influenced Egypt's blood flowing back into the streets, the president's microscopic protesters have both spent the past week in foreign countries. One of the two Islamists hovered back at Cairo airport. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. The ex-general Trump, who in 2013 had deprived the Muslim brother Mohammed Morsi, the first freely elected head of state of New York, pleasantly
Misleading - according to the president, the other man who is currently determining what is happening on the streets is trying to mislead his Youtube". Of course, Mohamed Ali remained abroad, where he eludes the access of the security forces, who would immediately arrest him if he tried to enter Egyptian land.
He addresses the head of state directly and in quite rustic language. While the people are hungry, the president indulges in luxury and lets himself build magnificent new palaces, it is said. The army leadership, on which Sisi rests his rule, blames Ali for corruption and enrichment. Because he in his second profession as a builder shows a lot to talk about, at least for 15 years, he seems to know exactly what exactly he did with these gentlemen.
After last week for the first time since Sisi's grip after the power had been protested by thousands of protesters against his rule and almost 2000 citizens, including prominent figures of civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, had been arrested prosecuting prosecutors. Prosecutors Alejandro Ali first called for a "million march" for this Friday. That really so many people would dare to take to the streets was unlikely. But it came to segregate in prose
From the city of Mansura in the Nile delta, where protesters wanted to break up last week's banners with the president's portrait, Muslims were reported to prevent a massive police presence on Friday. Security forces set up checkpoints in the city and on the roads. In Cairo, several subway stations in the city center were closed due to "maintenance work", blocking out most of the streets around the Tahrir square.
Mohamed Ali made these arrangements to change his tactics: "Our goal doesn't have to be Tahrir Square," said Ali in his video camera in Barcelona. "Let's not clash with police officers," but as a retractor, this should not be understood: "All of Egypt is Tahrir Square."
If the provider promises too much performance
If the internet connection always seems to be much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various testing options.
If you enter into an internet contract, you don’t have to blindly trust the provider’s speed data, and customers can check how much of it is actually achieved in the event of an abnormality.
Finally, the pre-promised transfer rates are a contractual component and should therefore also be achieved, explains the Bavarian Consumer Centre.
If the connection always seems to be much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various testing options. For example, the measuring tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transmission rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract.
"However, the suppliers' tests are carried out according to vendor-specific specifications and are therefore not calculated uniformly and objectively," says the consumer center Bayern on its page.
If the connection is significantly slower than announced, customers can set a reasonable period of 14 days for the provider to perform the promised service, which is best done by the affected person in writing by letter of objection.
If this does not work even after multiple requests, customers can terminate and in some cases also claim damages. But in the absence of success, only the lawsuit will help.
First high-ranking Republican for inquiry
As the first high-ranking Republican, the governor of Vermont has spoken out for an impeachment inquiry against U.S. President Donald Trump. "I think the inquiry is important, yes, and where that leads from here is determined by the facts that are being established," said Phil Scott at a press conference on Thursday. He wants to know more about the whistleblower's inquiry.
Scott said he was not surprised by revelations that Trump repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to investigate interventions by Democratic presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden in Ukraine, because Trump has been watching Biden “for years.”
So far, Republicans have held back with criticism of Trump over the whistleblower affair; few have expressed discomfort about it. Scott’s statements are a first indication of this in Trump’s party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has repeatedly opposed Trump’s policies, such as easing environmental regulations and tightening immigration regulations.
Spider-Man remains in MCU: Another Marvel movie planned
It was a shock for all Spider-Man fans: At the end of August, it was announced that Sony and Marvel would go separate ways in the future. So Tom Holland's Spider-Man would no longer be part of the "Avengers" universe. It was completely unclear how the movies around Tom Holland should proceed.
Now the surprise: After "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home", Spider-Man receives another final third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). This is according to several US media reports. According to this, the movie is already fixed: In the USA, the film should start from 16 July 2021.
In Screenrant magazine, Marvel booze Kevin Feige is quoted as saying: "I'm delighted that Spidey's path will continue in the MCU. I and everyone at the Marvel studios are delighted that we can continue to work on it ... He's the only superhero with the ability to play in different universes as Sony continues to work on his Spidey verse. You never know what will bring the future."
But what about the sudden good news? It is alleged that Sony submitted an offer to Marvel. According to industry magazines, the company Disney, which also includes Marvel, would share with 30 percent of the revenue of upcoming Spider-Man films. However, the message is not confirmed.
Duchess Meghan and Prince Harry appear in the "Suits" final
After nine seasons, the series "Suits" has now reached the big finale in the USA. In the last episode there were many happy ends and just as many cameo appearances. And also the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who participated in the series for many years, was paid tribute in a charming way. Attention, the following episodes contain spoilers.
In the final, Duchess Meghan did not return for a final farewell as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some retrospectives showed once again the most memorable scenes with today’s Duchess. Such as the moments of the failed and successful marriage with Mike or how she greeted him after his sentence.
But even her real husband, Prince Harry, was casually mentioned in the "suits" finale, of course in a wedding scene. When Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) just steps towards the altar to marry his fiancée Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht, 47) makes a very eloquent remark about whether you're going to get married.
Aegean: Baby and four other children drown in boat crash
A refugee boat in the Aegean drowned a baby and four other children. In total, seven people died in the accident, the Greek coastguard said on Friday. The nationalities are still unclear.
The boat sank near the Greek island of Inousses, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men were rescued.
Currently, hundreds of migrants from Turkey are transferring to the Greek islands in the eastern Aegean Sea. Last year, 174 people were killed on this route, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR). Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer has now announced that he will visit both countries.
Together with his French colleague and the EU Commissioner responsible, he wants to "inform himself about the situation of refugees in Turkey," Seehofer said on Friday. He then wants to learn more about the "administrative problems of the Greeks" in Athens, in order to be able to help with the coping.
A spokeswoman for the European Commission confirmed on Friday Seehofer’s planned trip with EU Interior Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and France’s Interior Minister Christophe Castaner.
An unusual number of migrants from Turkey continue to arrive in Greece, with 654 people transferred to the Greek islands on Tuesday alone, the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection said on Wednesday.
Is the Turkey deal still working?
The increased numbers recently raised doubts about the functioning of the EU-Turkey agreement, which was concluded in 2016. This provides that the EU can send back all refugees and migrants who arrive illegally via Turkey to the Greek islands. In return, the EU wanted to take in one Syrian refugee from Turkey for every Syrian deported.
According to the Ministry of Civil Protection, there are almost 29,400 people in Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos. The worst situation is in Lesbos: 5,200 migrants are currently housed in a camp with capacity for 650 people.
Never since the entry into force of the EU-Turkey refugee pact in March 2016, there have been so many, the state broadcaster reported.
Climate change: heat leads to more heart attacks
According to physicians, climate change will put the health system to the test in the future. Climate change is "very certain" one of the biggest challenges for the health system in the next 20 to 50 years, said Andreas Zeiher, president of the German Society for Cardiology. Especially the cardiovascular system caused high temperatures and large temperature jumps to create heart attacks within a short time.
Green politician has to answer for embarrassing photo breakdown
The head of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, in the election campaign - was the cup manipulated for this reason?
The Canadian Green chief holds a reusable cup in her hand on a photo, but now it came out: the cup was manipulated.
Ottawa/Canada - It has gone unnoticed for quite some time - and finally noticed. The reusable coffee mug with metal straw Elizabeth May, the head of the Canadian Greens, never held her hand. On the party's website she was seen on a photo with this mug, in conversation with citizens. However, the photo had already been published and also been distributed to the media by the Canadian Postal Service.
Green leader has to answer for photo breakdown
The National Post then accused May of manipulation and that the party is producing fake news in order to appear more credible on the topic of "environmental protection", in the midst of a campaign for the House of Commons election, in which Trudeau is also facing increasing difficulties due to a bribery scandal.
The photo went viral on social media and sparked the discussion about fake news. A user shares a confrontation of the photos and writes: "The Greens manipulate a photo of their chairmen to hide their disposable cup".
May was shocked and claimed on her blog that she knew nothing about this action. To underline this, she immediately posted the original: she, in conversation with citizens, held a cup in her hand. However, she was right, she was made of bamboo. She always had it with her. A spokeswoman of the party said that it was only a matter of seeing the party logo on the photo.
"I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide," she says to the Guardian, and at the same time asks for something from her over-engaged team: "If you want to edit a picture again, can't you do something with my face so that I look younger?"
Even the German Greens have fallen into shitstorms because of their use of disposable plastic or because of air travel - but their pictures were not photoshopped. Thus, the head of the Bavarian Greens, Katharina Schulze, ate ice cream with plastic spoons on holiday, as merkur.de* reported.
Influencer wants free upgrade: Lifetime flight ban at Cathay
Jaqueline Ng was allegedly promised an upgrade by Cathay Pacific, but when she requested it at check-in, she was not allowed on board - and she should never be allowed to fly with Cathay again.
Spontaneously get an upgrade for the Business Class - many passengers dream of it. Sometimes they are lucky, and the staff at check-in offer a change from Economy Class for free.
However, this case shows how not to do it: A self-declared influencer actively asked the airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade. On Instagram, Jaqueline Ng follows more than 65,000 users. On May 30, she flew back from Taiwan to New York and on June 7.
On the departure flight, employees refused Jaqueline an upgrade, although she showed an email that her Cathay Pacific allegedly offered an upgrade. The letter is said to have been received by the influencer from an airline marketing employee, while the airline accuses Jaqueline of forging the mail.
On the return flight, Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-haul flight. This time, the woman was said to have shown the same mail, but with a different reference number. The employees at JFK airport were skeptical: they hacked at the headquarters. And in fact, the employee from which the mail allegedly came, denied the mail contact with Jaqueline. This also confirmed the mail in the system.
The airline staff at the airport cancelled Jaqueline's ticket and imposed a lifelong flight ban on Cathay Pacific. For $1,400 (about $1,280), she had to buy a new flight ticket to Taiwan.
With her case, the influencer turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company that represents consumer interests, because Cathay had reimbursed her for her original ticket, but Jaqueline also claimed back the cost of the new ticket.
But as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: For Cathay, the influencer has committed fraud, she remains blocked for future flights. The airline’s terms and conditions also state that she does not have to pay for the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to be satisfied with this - and now turns on a lawyer.
Oil prices decline after report of ceasefire in Yemen
Oil prices fell by more than one dollar in the shortest possible time on Friday afternoon. Most recently, a barrel (159 litres) of the North Sea Brent strain cost $61.83 - about 1.4 percent less than the previous day. The price of a barrel of the American West Texas Intermediate (WTI) strain fell by 1.3 percent to $55.77.
A report by the Wall Street Journal on a ceasefire in Yemen, Saudi Arabia, said it had agreed to a ceasefire in four territories.
A drone attack on the oil plants in Saudi Arabia had brought to a halt five percent of global oil production in mid-September. The Houthi rebels, allied with Iran in the Yemeni civil war, had claimed the attacks. Saudi Arabia, like the US government, blames Iran. A ceasefire would defuse political tensions in the region.
If an agreement is reached, you can focus on growth and demand concerns, Ole Hansen, head of the Commodity Strategy department at Saxo Bank, told Bloomberg news agency.
A week ago, a barrel of WTI oil had cost nearly $59, and Brent nearly $65.
Bloomberg, citing insiders, recently reported that after the attack in mid-September, repair work on oil plants in Saudi Arabia progressed faster than expected, according to which the volume of production has again reached a volume of eight million barrels per day and is moving back towards the original amount.
Most recently, there have been several press releases citing insiders who report rapid progress by the state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco in the repair work, but raw material experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently planning an IPO and wants to avoid negative headlines.
At the same time, some relaxation was indicated in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is on its way to leave the port more than two months after the arrest by Iran and the recently granted release. The crew is now preparing the departure while the ship is still at anchor, a message from Reedereichef H<0xC3><0xA5>nell told the Swedish newspaper Rundfunk on Friday.
However, the U.S. has announced that it will move missiles and troops to Saudi Arabia, where the fear of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the U.S. and Britain has at times driven oil prices up significantly in recent weeks.
Accusations against Trump intensify
In the affair about possible abuse of power by U.S. President Donald Trump, cover-up allegations against the White House have become loud. Several leading government officials had tried intensely to prevent Trump's speech after a disputed phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the end of July.
North Korea considers third summit of Trump and Kim questionable
North Korea has raised doubts that there will soon be a third summit of Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump in the nuclear dispute, the meaning and prospects of such a meeting being questionable due to a lack of progress in the implementation of first summit agreements in Singapore, senior diplomat Kim Kye-gwan said on Friday, according to the agency KCNA.
The U.S. has so far done nothing to implement the summit’s decisions last year, the North Korean Foreign Ministry’s adviser said. He also criticized tightened U.S. sanctions and the joint military manoeuvres of the U.S. and South Korea, but he hopes for a “wise” and “brave” decision by Trump to bring it back together.
Trump had said on Monday that he wanted to know what a third summit with Kim would bring before he declared himself ready to do so. Negotiations on disarmament of the North Korean nuclear and missile program have stalled since the failed second summit of Trump and Kim in Hanoi in February. In June, the two countries met again in the demilitarized zone.
Prince Harry: Weapons manufacturers to help mine clearance
Clothed with a blue splinter protection vest, the British Prince Harry has symbolically detonated and destroyed an explosive mine in Angola. Close to a camp of the British Halo Trust near the town of Dirico, he made the ignition circuit. At a safe distance the explosives exploded. With a view to Angola to get mine-free by 2025, he later called for all the weapons in front of the "I-Kam"
Pound under pressure - interest rate cut expected
British Pound Under Pressure
In the face of an early rate cut, the pound is losing value against the euro.
Frankfurt speculates that the Bank of England (BoE) will soon cut interest rates on the pound sterling, which fell by up to 0.4 percent to $1.2269 on Friday.
The sales were triggered by remarks by central banker Michael Saunders, who brought interest rate cuts into the conversation, even if a chaotic Brexit could be avoided, as uncertainty would affect the British economy for the foreseeable future. This statement is surprising, as Saunders was considered to be a proponent of a restrictive monetary policy, said Analyst.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed out the burden on the economy from the Brexit hickhack, without directly signaling a rate cut. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to lead his country out of the EU by 31 October even without a divorce agreement if necessary.
More: The British prime minister has taken a high risk with his provocations, but it could pay off for him, says Handelsblatt editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: Further Russian Manipulations Proven
Material from the Moscow analysis laboratory is being manipulated – this is confirmed by David Howman, former director of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and today’s head of integrity of the World Athletics Association.
At the start of the World Championships in Athletics, new details about the doping scandal in Russia are coming to light - and they destroy the little credibility that Russian sports had gained back at the beginning of the year and only in an early stage. In January 2019, the Moscow doping laboratory finally delivered the required samples from the years 2012 to 2015.
In December 2014, a systematic fraud in Russian sports had been revealed. Then Wada had the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) banned them for three years. During this time, Russian athletes were not completely banned from the world stage. The International Olympic Committee after individual examination at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio, the athletes of the country at around 270 under neutral flag.
Lack of positive findings
The following September, Wada lifted the Rusada ban, but demanded access to the lab and the samples. The data should reveal the extent of the cover-up of doping cases in state doping. They should help to punish athletes afterwards. Three months later, they were finally delivered.
The chairman of the Independent Integrity Commission (AIU) of the World Athletics Association (IAAF) many have been mentioned in the Athletics Association (IAAF), but now has confirmed that the doping data from the Moscow analysis laboratory has been manipulated. "Yes. We received the data nine months ago. We should check whether the task force has received the correct data," said David Howman in an interview with the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung".
World Cup Not Affected
This confirms the attitude of the IAAF: the Athletics Federation is the only organization that holds the spell on Russia. At the World Cup in Doha, 30 Russian athletes start under a neutral flag. They had to prove that they are training outside the Russian system and undergoing tests.
