Obama Receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly.
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and about Tehran’s destabilizing measures in the Middle East.
But the meeting should also be about the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two-state solution.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for years.
Washington criticizes Israel’s ongoing settlement construction and accuses Netanyahu of a lack of will in the peace process.
The Obama-promoted deal on the Iranian nuclear program has further worsened the relationship between the two.
In March, at the invitation of the Republicans, Netanyahu gave a controversial speech before the U.S. Congress, which was partly seen as an affront to Obama.
The speech had not been agreed with Obama, a meeting he had rejected with reference to the upcoming election in Israel at the time.
In an Emergency Call, Professor Admits He Shot His Girlfriend
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told the police in a somewhat trembling voice that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officers had to come to his house.
Lamb said it was important to emphasize that his "cute dog" is still alive and probably excited, and he said the dead woman's family contacts could be found on the cell phone.
Inside the house, officials found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note scribbled on a white block: "I'm so sorry, I wish I could undo it, I loved Amy and she's the only woman who ever loved me." This was according to the authorities in the letter, and he was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds where he shot and killed a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door of his office, according to police reports.
Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford said university staff heard the shooting at 10:18 p.m.
He said that Lamb made the fatal emergency call sometime after.
By the end of the day, there was another death: Lamb took his own life when the police hugged him.
A day after the shooting at the university, which forced students and faculty to hide behind closed doors, authorities are still trying to get a picture of what motivated Lamb.
The details published by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and staff who knew him testified, helped draw a picture of a talented but potentially difficult teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to his lessons.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or a criminal history.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book he wrote, in which he mentioned the "wonderful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, whose faculty includes 17 members, and many students attended courses of both.
At the same time, there were some tendencies to problematic behaviors.
A student, Brandon Beavers, who praised Lamb, said he also seemed a little excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told him he was dealing with stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for a leave of absence for health reasons, saying that he had some health problem.
This year, he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's employment policy meant that the doctorate, for which Lamb had worked so hard, would not be a guarantee for him of an automatic path to employment as an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr. Lamb's imagination."
These are questions that Lamb can no longer answer.
After escaping from campus, police later found Lamb's trail when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38-caliber gun in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parents' home on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County coroner Methel Johnson said.
His car was still running in the driveway.
It wasn’t immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, but Johnson said she believes he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb began his work at the university in 2009, which has 3,500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received his doctorate in pedagogy in the spring.
One of Lamb’s longtime friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her guitar playing for a few years.
At that time, he was the women's swarm.
All the girls melt away when he was there," said Hairston, now 40, living in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously together for some time.
In the emergency call, Lamb said "I killed my wife," but there was no certificate of marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in the brick house that borders a Bayou in Gautier.
The police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they were divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends and had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
"She was totally devastated," O'Steen said about his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail, he heard that Lamb was interested in music and playing blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at a summer fair three years ago.
Later, they played one or the other gig together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked online for various companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a dimly lit bar near Gautier, said he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night on the night of September 5 for the last time after Lamb finished his guitar and harmonica play in front of a sparse audience.
There was no indication that anything was wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were cleaning up and joking together.
I mean, they both had a good sense of joke.
Schmidt, the dead professor, led the first-semester seminar program, specializing in Native Americans and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three young children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his brotherhood and student committee.
At the Delta State Campus in Cleveland on Tuesday evening, about 900 people, including faculty, staff, students, and community members, attended a candlelight commemoration.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the vigil, while the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace".
Classes will resume on Wednesday.
"We're trying to move our students to return," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story was corrected to reflect the fact that the police are now saying that Lamb made the emergency call after shooting Schmidt, and that Lamb in his emergency call referred to Prentiss as his wife, but there is no indication that the two have ever married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for Christmas
Toys R Us says it won’t hire as many Christmas season employees as last year, but the toy and baby products retailer says it will give the employees and seasonal workers currently employed by it a chance to work more hours.
The company said it plans to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers across the country, while 45,000 workers were still employed during the Christmas season in 2014.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said it will start interviews this month and the number of employees will increase from October to December.
While the holidays themselves are months away, the Christmas business is getting closer, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equip stores with employees who sell, ship, and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a great moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the Royals, and I notice that the seat next to me is empty, and it's gradually becoming clear to me that Princess Diana will be sitting next to me," he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary film, Back in Time.
The movie starts, and it comes to my mind that I’m a simulated yawn and a length of arm from being on a date with the Princess of Wales.
"Back in Time", a documentary about "Back to the Future", presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" premiered 30 years ago.
"It's really for me," Spielberg said, "unquestionably the greatest time travel film ever made."
"Back in Time" will be available on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia’s increased military support for Syria is: “There is no military solution” to the nearly five-year conflict, and more weapons will only exacerbate violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN chief once again calls on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said at a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet with the foreign ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - on the margins of the General Assembly ministerial meeting this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and regional powers “make this situation insoluble.”
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity they have shown in reaching a nuclear deal with Iran in dealing with the crisis in Syria.
8 survey scores that show that Donald Trump is to be taken seriously.
Some have tried to brand it as a flop.
Others dismissed him as a joke.
Some are waiting for a breakdown.
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump down from the top ranks in polls, it hasn’t (yet) worked.
Ten of the last eleven national polls showed Donald Trump leading in the double-digit range, and some are starting to seriously wonder what it means for the real estate mogul’s chances of nominating.
Of course, it is still too early in the legislature.
No one claims that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts stress that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry’s leadership was handed over to rising Herman Cain, none of whom won even a single state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election.
But outsider groups like Jeb Bush’s Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth are now recognizing Trump’s stamina and are starting to let their dollars flow to overthrow him.
Here are some recent survey values that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase:
Trump’s popularity figures have turned 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University survey showed that only two out of ten Republicans saw the real estate mogul positively.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now, six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three in ten say they have a negative opinion.
And these figures hold in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as their candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either “enthusiastic” or “satisfied” if Trump were nominated.
Only two in 10 say they would be “angry” if he were the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be “enthusiastic” vs. 40 percent say the same about Trump).
Next in terms of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio is only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be “dissatisfied” or “angered” if Jeb Bush, the establishment’s favorite, became the candidate.
A majority of Republicans do not see Trump’s temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and insulting statements, 52 percent of Republican-tending Irish voters believe the real estate mogul has the right temperament for a president, according to ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same figure applies in the nation’s first primary state, Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality of a commander-in-chief, Quinnipiac said last week.
Still, 44 percent think he doesn’t have the personality to effectively carry out his office, and nearly six out of 10 independents say his temperament doesn’t fit into the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When they put on their scholarly hats, Republican voters think Trump is real.
When asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, according to a CNN/ORC survey last week, four out of ten say Trump is the best bet.
This has been a change since the time when four out of ten people bet their money on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters did not have the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At this point in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought Rick Perry would win the nomination versus only 28% for final candidate Mitt Romney.
Nevertheless, it turns out that a large number of GOP voters view Trump’s campaign as plausible.
Even if the Republicans gathered around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump’s leadership, while anti-Trump support is diffusely distributed to more than a dozen other candidates.
But a survey by Monmouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump reaps majority support.
He has 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina, 14 points ahead of Marco Rubio, 15 points ahead of Walker, 19 points ahead of Jeb Bush and 33 points ahead of Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
It's a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to beat him?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.
A narrow majority of Donald Trump fans say they have formed their opinion.
A new survey by CBS/NYT on Tuesday shows that just over half of voters who support Trump say they have cast their votes firmly.
Of course, a lot can happen to change that, and no one can really say never to change their minds.
46 percent said they left the door open to switch to other candidates.
Nevertheless, Trump’s strongest competition at the moment is the other outsider, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they’ve formed their opinion are twice as likely for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "rapers" in his campaign peace two months ago, immigration has been at the heart of public discourse to 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump’s bombastic expression will keep crucial Hispanic Americans away from the Republican Party and will damage the reorientation efforts.
But according to Monday’s new ABC/Post survey, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, so will Donald Trump.
Frustration about the government is climbing to new peaks.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now account for about half of the support of Republican voters, mainly due to their outsider status.
Six out of 10 Republicans say in the new Monday survey by ABC/Post, they prefer a political outsider than someone with government experience.
They are also angry at Washington.
A poll by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated with the Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent "dissatisfied" and 21 percent "hellishly angered."
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
Here in the Hobookenweg is the most expensive residential complex - overlooking the North Sea watt.
In the street, a square meter of a thatched house costs an average of 73,300 euros.
"On Sylt, the range of objects is naturally limited," says the study - hence the high price.
A new study shows in which special locations a square meter costs the most.
Of course, 18.70 euros per square meter for a student booth in Munich is not really little.
However, unlike Germany’s top places to live, the price is similar to peanuts.
The real estate service provider Engel & Völkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meters prices at dizzying heights.
There are sometimes several tens of thousands of euros nothing - per square meter, of course.
But good for those who can afford it...
By the way: Munich is exceptionally not at the top here.
Champions League: Bayern dream start thanks to Müller and Götze
Double goalkeeper in Piraeus: Bayern star Thomas Müller just has a run.
A lucky hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for FC Bayern to a deserved 3:0 at Olympiakos Piraeus - then it ran.
A sovereign start to the Champions League season.
World champions Thomas Müller and Mario Götze have given FC Bayern a dream start to the "Mission Milan" in the witch boiler of Piraeus.
The team of coach Pep Guardiola won their opening match in the Champions League against the Greek record champion Olympiakos in a hot atmosphere thanks to Müller’s double pack (52/90+2) and Götze’s (89) goal earned with 3:0 (0:0).
The twelfth start-up success in series is to be the first step towards the final on 28 May 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola wants to finally get the handle pot to Munich in the third run.
In his 28th goal in the Champions League, Müller received the friendly help of Olympiakos goalkeeper Roberto, who allowed one thought of as a flank shot of the world champion to pass.
"We will not underestimate them," Bayern captain Philipp Lahm had promised 31,688 hot-blooded fans before the match at Karaiskakis Stadium - and the Munichers kept their word.
They showed a concentrated and committed performance without shine.
Piraeus had won his most recent six home games in the royal class, including against well-known clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin.
In 2011, Borussia Dortmund also stumbled here (1:3).
But Bayern, undefeated in seven European Cup duels with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They bravely proceeded, but often too unintelligent to work in their offensive efforts.
The attacks were too often initiated by a game shift to left-winger Douglas Costa, who rarely came through against the former Brunswickian Omar Elabdellaoui.
Müller was more lucky from the right when his flank struck from the right half field in the left upper Toreck.
In the 67th minute, the world champion gave the possible 2:0.
The best chances in half one was Robert Lewandowski.
Initially, when Olympiakos striker Ideye Brown struck Poland's headball off the line (26th).
Then by direct defeat, the goalkeeper Roberto pared with the knee (35th).
Although the Bavarians raised their usual dominant game, Piraeus was able to put pinpoints.
However, the goalkeeper Manuel Neuer was trusted.
So when he directed a shot of Ideye over the latte (56).
In front of Neuer, Guardiola had a four-chain defense with David Alaba in the center next to Jerome Boateng, who did well.
Mario Götze, after muscular problems back in the squad, sat out at first.
The World Cup hero had only given the green light after the final training, sports director Matthias Sammer said at "Sky": "If you want to make something else out of it, that is already malicious."
Guardiola also decided against him at the first change when he brought Kingsley Coman for the defeated Lewandowski (59th).
Götze arrived late for Arturo Vidal (76th) and made it clear 13 minutes later, Müller put another one on the penalty.
Before the game, there were riots in the stadium.
After a smaller group of sometimes disguised Bayern fans in their spectator block apparently provoked the supporters of host Piraeus with words and gestures, the security forces intervened and proceeded with batons against the Munich supporters.
At least one Bayern fan was transported injured from the stadium.
Anyone who smokes has a higher risk of losing teeth.
Smoking damages not only the lungs, but also the teeth - this is suggested by a long-term Potsdam study.
The good news is that if you give up, the risk drops quickly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is the result of a long-term study by an international research team, including several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research (DIfE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, smokers were at risk of losing their teeth prematurely, 2.5 to 3.6 times higher.
The scientists had observed more than 23,300 participants.
The main causes of tooth failure are caries and inflammation of the gums, the DIfE emphasizes.
Smoking is a risk factor for this periodontitis, the authors emphasize.
The link between smoking and tooth loss is therefore due to more frequent gingivitis in smokers.
It is unclear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of caries.
However, people who quit smoking could reduce their risk within a short period of time, the researchers write in the Journal of Dental Research.
However, it may take more than ten years for the risk to drop back to the level of non-smokers, first author Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham explained.
One must convince people to become non-smokers, said Heiner Boeing, director of the DIfE: “Smoking shortens the lifetime.”
Not to smoke is good for the lungs and vessels and, according to our findings, also leads to good dental health up to old age.
In Germany, more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years are affected by toothlessness, the DIfE said.
Previous research had already suggested that smoking increases the risk of early tooth failure.
The new long-term study supports the findings.
Archaeologists encounter remains from Late Antiquity on the banks of the Rhine in Cologne
For the first time, archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne.
Near the construction site for the new Rhine boulevard, archaeologists of the Roman-Germanic Museum have excavated skeletons and remains of historic buildings, said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of construction work on the Rhine, historians have been searching for so-called soil monuments.
For all construction projects in the city district of Cologne, the museum is always used as a specialist office for archaeological landmark preservation.
In the third phase of the construction of the Rhine boulevard, the archaeologists were now found.
It was already known from text documents that at the site in the 4th century there was a fortress and in the 8th century a church, Trier explained.
In addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with about 350 graves was also discovered, which probably belonged to the church.
Young woman caught by freight train
After a young woman crashed at the station in Geilenkirchen-Lindern, the federal police asks the population for help.
Early Wednesday morning at about 1.40 p.m., the woman crossed the tracks coming from the station building at the end of the platform and was caught by a freight train coming from the direction of Mönchengladbach.
By capturing the train, she suffered the most serious injuries, according to the Federal Police.
She was treated in an emergency room and taken to a hospital by rescuers.
The investigating officers have no information on the reason for the young woman crossing the track at night.
The incident may have been observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic perceptions.
Residents or passers-by from Linderner Bahn, Ziegelbäckerweg, Thomashofstraße and Leiffarther Straße (L364) are eligible.
For information on the cause of the accident, please contact the Federal Police on the 24-hour, free hotline at 0800/6888000 or any other police station.
EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP
To alleviate the dispute over the planned transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP, the EU Commission has proposed a major reform of the current arbitration system.
The controversial private arbitration bodies for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system, which in its functioning corresponds to significantly more traditional courts.
"We want to set up a system that citizens trust," said Commissioner Cecilia Malmström.
Sweden intends to include the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US.
The German government announced support.
TTIP is the world’s largest free trade zone with 800 million people.
The plans to reform the current arbitration procedures specifically require the EU states and the US to jointly select independent judges for a new investment court.
They are supposed to come to equal parts from the EU, the US and third countries.
For the first time, a second instance is also envisaged.
It would allow you to object to judgments.
So far, the parties to the proceedings have agreed on arbitrators among themselves, and there has been no possibility of appeal against their judgments.
In the discussion over the past few months, it became clear that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice, Malmström commented.
In the long term, she intends to work towards an International Investment Court.
There, for example, disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could be resolved.
The investor-state arbitration (ISDS) is one of the main reasons for the great opposition in Europe to TTIP.
Traditional arbitration courts are criticised by opponents as a kind of parallel justice whereby companies can claim damages at the expense of taxpayers, defy national laws or enforce lower consumer and environmental standards.
In initial statements, anti-TTIP organizations such as Campact described the EU Commission’s proposals as insufficient.
In particular, it was criticised that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (CETA).
German Economic Secretary Matthias Machnig (SPD), on the other hand, described the plans as great progress.
The Commission takes into account key points that Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel worked out with other EU Trade Ministers in the spring.
The old system of private arbitration is off the table.
The French government also welcomed Malmström’s plans.
The European business association BusinessEurope warned against limiting the possibilities of lawsuits for the economy due to too many new rules.
Small and medium-sized enterprises in particular could be disadvantaged, it said.
When the talks on the TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) could be concluded remained unclear on Wednesday.
Negotiations have been ongoing since mid-2013.
The issue of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the United States.
Initially, a framework for the agreement should already be in place by the end of this year.
This date is deemed no longer valid.
Delicious Folk by Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Eleven years ago, Sufjan Stevens was on stage at the Cologne Prime Club (today: Luxor).
Next to him is a flip chart on which the shy-looking folk singer has recorded the picturesque US state of Michigan with a felt pencil.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost gripped by Steven’s talk.
He talks about what his meticulous and delicately arranged songs tell us in different places, which he always records on the map.
Where they originated and what it looks like there, in his homeland.
Since then, Stevens has proved to be a wonderfully creative madman.
With the third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State" released in 2003, cleverly composed songs that harmoniously snuggle very close to American folk of the late 1960s, but can drift into the great opulent at any time.
It is rumored that "Michigan" is the first part of a bold series: each of the 50 states should be sung in succession.
But already in 2004 and near the Rhine, "Seven Swans" has already appeared and positively breaks certain expectations.
Reduced Stevens performs here.
Live is enough for him guitar and banjo.
A year later, the New York-based musician returns to the series.
"Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinoise") is a widely celebrated masterpiece released in 2005.
Plenty of ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album enters the US Billboard charts and is not missing in any yearly charts of influential music media.
After extremely productive experiments, Stevens then uses a very extensive range of electronic offsets on "The Age of Adz" (2010).
This sixth decent studio album is still widely orchestrated, but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and hall.
Long ago the smaller clubs emerged, the stage shows here become a colorful spectacle of neon headbands and large fluorescent stage decorations.
Sufjan Stevens is currently touring Germany as part of a five-member band.
In the dark hamburger More!
He mainly presents the "Carrie & Lowell" which has been available since March.
Although almost 2,000 guests are now seated in their chairs, Stevens returns to intimacy and folk.
Without addressing a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians plays themselves through the widely enriched album.
You can hear from the audience that the lecture is "more opulent" and you can thus "throw away the record basically".
Only to an add-on does Stevens modestly thank, plays acoustically few older songs and finally bows down under roaring applause.
Jeremy Corbyn's Debut at Prime Minister's Question Time
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn’s debut at the Prime Minister’s Question Time is eagerly awaited
The new Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will make his debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time and deal with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr. Corbyn will rise to ask the first of his six predetermined questions shortly after noon, with his performance likely being closely reviewed by the media and the Labour MPs.
He called for "less theater and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said he could skip a few sessions to leave them to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary scrutiny for Mr Corbyn’s leadership, as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TUC annual meeting on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour chairman’s decision to remain silent on Tuesday during the singing of the national anthem at a commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has provoked criticism from a number of Tory MPs and is the focus of several cover stories in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has drawn attention
A spokesman for Corbyn said he had "confessed in respectful silence" and acknowledged "the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the air battle for England."
But a member of Mr Corbyn’s shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two Newsnight program that he had advised the Labour chairman to sing the national anthem, “independent” of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve on Mr Corbyn’s top team, citing differences in business, defense and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the Parliamentary Party originally supported him as its leader.
BBC Political Correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences are also “stacking up” within Labour, following Mr Corbyn’s statements on the position on the European Union and the limitation of profits.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labour was making changes to remove the whole idea of a limitation overall.
Hours later, Mr. Smith, the shadow labor and retirement minister, said the party was "very clear" that it was only against government plans to lower the limit from <0xC2><0xA3>26,000 to <0xC2><0xA3>23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour president to face David Cameron, since he is Tory chief, across the dispatch box in parliament in the last decade.
The Labour chairman, who promised a different policy approach, says he has "crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and has been given more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP has said that the prime minister’s question hour is too confrontational, and that he is refraining from both “beating skill” and struggling with backlash, and has instead set out to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality, and the challenges facing young people.
Mr. Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the shadow economic minister, will represent him if he does not attend—for example, if Mr. Cameron is traveling abroad.
He also raised the idea that other colleagues occasionally take the floor, and that he addressed John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, to discuss the issue.
When he became a leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said he wanted to move away from politics in the style of a "Kasperle Theatre", which is often linked to the Prime Minister's Question Time, but a few years later he admitted that he had failed.
Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990, the Question Time with the Prime Minister was considered the most important barometer of a leader's judgment and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position among his parliamentary colleagues, although critics have argued that it has become a caricature and needs far-reaching reforms.
'Shooted in Joburg': Homeless young people trained as photographers
The city center of Johannesburg is a tough place if you are homeless.
But a group of former street children have found a way to learn a skill and earn a living.
"I was shot in Joburg" (I was shot in Joburg) is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless young people how to take photos of their surroundings and make a profit from them.
BBC News has met one of the first graduates of the project.

Pound rises due to accelerated wage growth in the UK
The pound rose sharply, according to data indicating an increase in UK wage growth, while the FTSE 100 was boosted by the SABMiller bid target.
Earnings without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.9% between May and July compared to the same period last year.
This percentage has been the fastest and most accurate estimate of the time of interest rate increase since 2009.
The pound rose by more than 1% against the dollar to $1,5505 and climbed to 0.84% against the euro to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed with an increase of 1.49% to 6,229.21.
SABMiller was the outstanding share in the market, making a 20% leap after the takeover bid from rival AB InBev.
A transaction would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher, according to encouraging news from the Richemont luxury competitors.
Richemont’s latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China – a key market for Burberry – are reporting growth again.
Glencore’s shares rose by 5% after the mining giant said it had raised $2.5 billion through a stock sale as part of its debt reduction strategy.
The stocks of the packaging and paper group Mondi were the biggest losers on the index, falling by 4.3% after Goldman Sachs set its rating for the company to "sell".
JD Sports increased by 3.1% after the sportswear company reported a pre-tax profit of 46.6 million for the half-year.
The head of JD Sports says higher wages threaten expansion.
JD Sports CEO Peter Cowgill says a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean “more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers.”
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will offset the higher labor costs at his company, he says.
The cost could hit JD Sports’ expansion plans, he added, and that could mean there are fewer additional jobs.
Justin Bieber on a Bieber expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
Lippenische 21 years young, a hanfling with an upbeat frieze.
The guy with the platinum blonde hair is 100 million euros heavy.
Pretty much more.
Currently, Monsieur Bieber is in Berlin.
And the generation U17 is going crazy.
Like Wiktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton".
It's okay.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Including Ewa and Victoria from Poland.
Since 7 a.m., however, the Polish has been sitting on the cold stone slabs in front of the Berlin luxury hotel on Potsdamer Platz.
The Bieber-Bau: This is where your idol lives, whose posters are piled up in Szczecin, since Monday evening.
The suite, where the Canadian singer lives, costs just as much a day as her mother Ewa earns in half a year.
If at all.
She says, "Actually, my Victoria would have to be in the tenth grade in high school."
"I'm fulfilling her a dream".
Compulsory schooling?
Who's itching?
Not the fans.
Neither did Bieber himself.
He took care of it anyway.
For the adverts during the Superbowl's ad break, he cashed three million, a two-year deal with an anti-pick company washed many, many dollars into Bieber's account.
And with every doll that looks like him and walks over the counter, Bieber also cashes.
When Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, you're amazed at the windowsill.
He is said to have captured more than 100 million.
Some say the hype went too far.
Bieber is ranked number one in the U.S. and UK with his new single "What do you mean?".
Bieber himself, whose fourth album is due to follow in November, is not interested in the many zeros for the first time.
At least he does.
Pegida poster brings Lebanese to potato maker idea
Potatoes or donuts?
Both are possible - in the potato chipper developed by Oldenburg snack owner Hani Alhay.
Inspired by the saying "potato instead of döner" on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alhay put potato and meat together on a skewer.
The idea came up with a poster at a Pegida demonstration with the inscription "potatoes instead of döner", which he had accidentally seen on television.
Since then, a barbecue skewer has been rotating in his shop, which is stocked with meat and potatoes.
"This is multiculti for the stomach," says Alhay.
The idea has now been registered by the Lebanese at the Patent Office in Munich.
According to the authorities, it has recently been protected as a utility model.
Therefore, Alhay does not want to reveal how much meat and how much potatoes the skewer contains.
Just so much: "It tastes even better together," he thinks.
Culinary international understanding is also well received by its customers.
Metcash launches groundworthiness campaign to combat Aldi invasion
Metcash tries to protect the IGA branches from an Aldi march in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a groundworthiness campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a $700 million Aldi invasion.
While Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local food suppliers and building the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and social media marketing, as well as through events such as Adelaide Show.
IGA dealers and suppliers jump on board, with brands like Dunsborough ice cream maker Simmo distributing samples in IGA stores and store owners selling discounted South Australian Football League tickets to loyal customers.
Metcash is expected to release further details of its defense strategy on September 29, as the food, alcohol and equipment wholesaler conducts its annual investor strategy day.
There’s a lot at stake as South Australia and Western Australia make up nearly 30 percent of Metcash’s IGA stores and generate higher profit margins than Metcash’s IGA network in the Eastern states.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland – more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the Eastern states.
However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that twelve months after opening its first markets, Aldi will snatch away around five percent of the food market in these two states and will take away sales from all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
According to a report released this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million per year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year, generating sales of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in the food and grocery store and in the volumes on Metcash’s high fixed cost base could cost Metcash around $13 million in profit before interest and taxes, Mr. Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the Eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley expects Metcash’s food and grocery sales to fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017, and 2.1 percent in 2018, reducing its market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, founder of Magellan Financial Group, told a Melbourne business dinner that Metcash is likely to disappear within a decade.
Metcash refused to publicly respond to Mr Douglass’ comments.
But it is assumed that a Metcash board member contacted Mr Douglass last week.
IGA’s market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and revenue from Metcash’s food and food trade, which supplies about 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting operational debt reduction while simultaneously pressuring revenue and margins.
However, the wholesaler is resisting and investing more than $150 million to align retail prices with Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products each week, improving IGA retailers in improving their stores by faster growing fresh foods and delivering a better selection of private label foods.
Metcash’s CEO, Ian Morrice, says price adjustments and store renovation programs will increase in momentum and hopes that the wholesaler will return to profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by President of the Australian Tennis Federation Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damages" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and, according to the president of the Australian Tennis Federation Steve Healy, deserves praise rather than criticism for his own behavior.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo, often referred to as "Special Ks", was spotlighted by Kyrgios' infamous encounter with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fiery qualifying game in Cincinnati soon after, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the referee, with Harrison exclaiming, "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should have beaten the child."
While he was last seen smashing a tennis racket after a spasm thwarted a potential U.S. Open victory by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was steadfastly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for second place in the singles behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against the United Kingdom.
"One thing I'm pretty jealous about is the fact that, in my opinion, Thanasi was pulled a little into the dispute," Healy said.
He broke a club when he lost in the US Open because of a spasm, but he's not the first player to break a club out of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know he's not proud of it.
But, really, he’s behaved extremely well in the U.S. Open, even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of recognition.
He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him, and I think he was treated a little too harshly.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard and he fits into the team and so on, he has never had a problem with the other players, he is respected in the locker room, he trains hard, he is in good shape, he is a very stable and mature young guy, and I believe he deserves to be judged according to his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrgios into account in the important preliminary decision that starts on Friday, and he describes the "joint decision" as the right one for everyone, but he assures the man from Canberra to return to the team as a long-term solid component."
"First, we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not on all the controversies around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And I think Nick has made the ascent very quickly, which people like Federer and Murray have pointed out. He rises in the eyes of the public, and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we try to support him, we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions. Some time out of the limelight I can think of it is best for him, and in the limelight I can think of it is best for him.
Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes the border, holds back refugees
Hungary declared the state of emergency and closed off the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday, detaining all those who tried to enter the country illegally, all with the aim of stopping the influx of migrants.
Chaos followed at the border as hundreds of migrants gathered in a no-man’s-land and Serbian officials reacted with indignation.
The people who had fled violence stuck for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two checkpoints of the countries and built tents and settled there.
But frustrations increased.
As a police helicopter hovered over them, the migrants shouted "Open the border!" and shouted insults against the Hungarian emergency police.
Some refused food and water in protest.
Serbia’s foreign minister said it was “unacceptable” for migrants to be sent back from Hungary as more and more migrants arrive from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not a collateral damage.
Talks with Brussels and other countries must take place in the coming days," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The turmoil on the Hungarian-Serbian border came one day after the 28-nation bloc was unable to agree on a common immigration policy at a disputed meeting in Brussels.
However, the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in overrun Italy and Greece, expressing their hope that eventually - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be reached that the EU states would take in another 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special European Union summit on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent.
Hungary, however, did not place its hopes on a swift action by Brussels or its neighbours.
The state of emergency declared on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis, allowing them to block roads and accelerate asylum procedures.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said his country was also planning to build a barbed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influx of migrants through the country - after it finished a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D’Agata reported that even prison inmates were used in the race to build the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major bottleneck and a point of entry into the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted that most incoming economic refugees are in search of a better life, not war refugees who are entitled to protection – a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, make crossing the border or damaging the 4-metre (13-foot) high fence that the government had built along the southern border with Serbia a crime. These laws also set higher prison sentences for convicted traffickers.
"Due to the situation created by the mass migration, the Hungarian government declares the state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: illegal border crossing is a crime.
Parliament still has to approve the military deployment expected for next week, but Associated Press reporters have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs at the border for days.
Orban National Security Advisor Gyorgy Bakondi said authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border, 15 others had already penetrated deeper into the country.
They come over by damaging the fence, they are now in police custody and are accused of committing crimes under the new laws.
Authorities are in the process of repairing the fence quickly.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train wagon with barbed wire to close the borders arrived.
Chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and pressed a crowd to push into it.
About 20 managed to get in, but thousands stayed outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main motorway link from Serbia and Hungary, saying they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
2016 election: Hillary Clinton’s lead over Bernie Sanders halved in national poll
Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the democratic race for the nomination at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders gains ground against her.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of Democratic voters in the primary elections (58 percent before), while Sanders ranks second, with 27 percent (up 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether to run for the presidency, has received support from 15 percent of the primary voters.
More than five months before the start of the primary elections, most Democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion is clear on which candidates they will support.
But Clinton’s supporters are more consistent in their elections than the other candidates.
Since the CBS News survey, Clinton has lost to a number of demographic groups, while Sanders made some profits.
Clinton holds a great lead among women and moderates, but these lead have diminished.
Their support with the men has dropped significantly, and Sanders is only 5 points behind here.
Clinton’s advantage over democratic voters under the age of 50 has vanished, and she and Sanders are now on par.
However, Clinton still has a big advantage over older voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders with a two-digit lead with the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point lead with this group.
About half of the Democratic primary voters across the country say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were nominated by the party.
A quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would support her only because she is the candidate.
6% would not support it.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton’s current supporters are especially enthusiastic about her.
The views are more mixed among those who currently do not support Clinton – only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of primary voters say they support Clinton with enthusiasm, fewer Republican voters say so about their top candidate Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton’s supporters are asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it’s time for a woman to become president (13 percent) and that she’s the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton’s supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Consent to deal with the problems and eligibility are also quoted.
As the vice president throws a potential for the presidency into the balance, 57 percent of primary voters want to see him in the race – though a third believe he shouldn’t.
When Democratic primary voters are asked who would be their second choice for the party, Biden is at the top.
More than half of Clinton’s supporters say Biden would be their second choice far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton’s lead over Sanders will increase from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the election; however, that number has dropped by 78 percent last month.
Biden is by far a second in this measurement, but the percentage that sees him as the “most selectable” has risen.
Nevertheless, when it comes to the question of what is more important in a candidate, Democratic voters call questions about eligibility.
Similar to last month, not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these primary voters stands out as unacceptable.
The Democratic candidates or potential candidates produce good results on some important characteristics among voters of their party’s primary elections.
Majorities consider Clinton, Sanders, and Biden to be honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership skills.
Biden scores best in honesty among the three candidates, while Clinton’s strength is the lead.
Thirty percent of Democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say so about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent do not have an opinion about him.
Democratic primary voters generally also see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as ideologically consistent with their views.
With all these measurements, about a quarter of Democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
As questions continue to be asked about Hillary Clinton’s use of a personal email address and server during her tenure as Secretary of State, most Democratic primary voters are satisfied with her explanation of the matter, saying it hasn’t influenced their opinions overall.
But it’s a different story in the American public as a whole.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with their statement, while only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion on this was divided in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said the email controversy had no effect on their general opinions about Clinton, though 36 percent said their opinion about her had worsened.
It’s mostly Republicans, more than six out of 10, who say their views on Clinton have gotten worse.
Although Clinton is considered honest and trustworthy by her party voters, this remains a problem for her among registered voters overall: only 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May.
62 percent of voters do not consider her to be an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of voters across the country also see Trump as not honest and untrustworthy.
However, Clinton and Trump get good grades in leadership.
Of the six tested candidates, Biden, Carson, and Bush cut best in honesty.
A majority view Sanders more than honestly, but as with Carson, many do not have an opinion of him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the primary elections is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson rises close behind Donald Trump in nationwide poll
Ben Carson is close behind Donald Trump in latest CBS News/New York Times poll
The two candidates now account for half of the voters’ support in the new poll, and others are dramatically losing ground.
Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump in large numbers, increasing support from 23% in the last CBS survey conducted before the Fox News debate last month, to 27% in Tuesday’s poll.
But Carson shot from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The survey also found that Carson is well received by demographic groups and outperforms Trump among Republican voters with higher education.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, has been defeated with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who has fallen the lowest, from 10% support last month to now 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are in third place with 6%.
The margin of error in the sample of 376 people of Republican voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6% and was conducted in September.
The latest CNN/ORC survey released last week shows that Carson is rising in the polls – he lands with 19% support among Republicans, behind Trump with 32% support.
The latest survey by ABC News/Washington Post also showed Trump clearly ahead of Carson.
Looking at a Carson rising last week, Trump found some side hustles for the former neurosurgeon, even after Carson apologized for questioning Trump’s faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during a campaign appearance in Iowa.
Pleasant bathing temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently warm up to 29 degrees.
Even if peak values are only measured in the distance, a trip to the Mediterranean Sea is enough for bathing holidaymakers to find warm water.
A bath in the North or Baltic Sea at a maximum of 17 degrees is likely to be a rather short pleasure.
Some people are no longer going to the sea: The water in the North and Baltic Sea has a maximum of 18 degrees this week, according to the German Weather Service (DWD).
Bathing temperatures, on the other hand, continue to offer the Mediterranean: in the east, it even reaches up to 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic it is at the top 25 degrees, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt reaches 28 degrees.
Five Brotherhood members charged with the death of Baruch College newcomer
Almost two years after a student died during a harassment ritual of a student connection in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, murder charges are filed against five people.
Members of New York’s Baruch College Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood brutally attacked Chun “Michael” Deng during an introductory ritual in September 2013, delaying his transportation to the hospital, which contributed to his death, police said.
Officials said he was loaded with a 30-pound backpack full of sand with blindfolded eyes, and repeatedly attacked while trying to walk across a frozen field to a target.
Mr. Deng finally complained of a headache, then fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood did not call 911 after Deng fainted and reportedly waited an hour before taking him to a hospital, police said.
However, they had time to change Deng’s clothes, google his symptoms, and contact Andy Meng, the national president of the Brotherhood, to seek advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide utensils and basically put the welfare of the Brotherhood above that of Michael Deng," said police chief Wagner.
He could not be resurrected, and he died the next morning from his injuries.
According to an autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly injured with blunt force to the head, torso and thighs.
"Too many families have been destroyed by the harassment of the Brotherhood, and at least one student dies every year since 1970," Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, said in a statement.
Brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable, and this step by authorities is very important.
A County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a charge for third-degree murder for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, are also being charged with harassment and forming a criminal association.
"Not only do we want to blame the people involved, but if there is an organization that has sanctioned this - officially or unofficially - we will also hold them accountable," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch College has banned the Brotherhood, and the National Brotherhood has revoked its affiliation to the local group.
This will happen if the Fed raises interest rates.
An interest rate hike is coming, and the boom will stagger, bond yields will rise, and the economy will slide into a recession.
We know that.
What we don’t know is how long it will take and how long it will last.
In particular, the history offers little guidance for the economy on how to proceed.
A recession came within just 11 months of the first interest rate hike and lasted 86 months.
The Federal Reserve’s aggressiveness in raising interest rates is often, if not always, a factor in how the economy and financial assets react.
Therefore, representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on when it starts to raise interest rates, but rather on the period needed for normalization.
In fact, several variables play a role.
In the end, however, market participants might find that all the excitement may have been exaggerated due to an interest rate hike.
“The Fed’s first increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of “cheap money,” said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a statement to customers.
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal levels, but still at too low levels to lead to the seismic shock that many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that there will be no impact.
Here is a historical trend-based look at how some areas of the economy might react:
As the market has seen last month, anticipating interest rate hikes can make things volatile for a while.
Once the increase occurs, the impact is not so dramatic.
“There seems to be a tendency for asset earnings to be strangled 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may reflect the delay in monetary policy,” Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what happens after the Fed’s interest rate hikes.
More specifically, the market has mostly been on the uptrend over the past 35 years – about 14 percent – heading for interest rate hikes, fairly flat in the 250 days following (average profit of 2.6 percent), then back to normal after 500 days, with an average return over the past six cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis published by Bob Doll, chief investment strategy officer at Nuronve Management.
Deutsche Bank said the impact on the stocks tends to occur later in the increase cycle and the return begins to decline.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but interest rate increases often promote them.
In the current case, the Fed is faced with some conditions that did not exist before and that could accelerate a recession.
It is extremely noteworthy here that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point at a Fed interest rate hike.
According to Deutsche Bank, the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 were only twice the nominal GDP below 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Interest rate hikes in such a fragile economic setting could be risky and raise the question “if it’s different this time,” Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants have been preparing for a Fed interest rate hike throughout the year, and all eyes were on the Federal Open Market Committee meeting this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve an increase in this session, futures trading only gives a 25 percent probability.
"In our study, all of the increase cycles from 1950 to the present day took place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and very quickly overshadowed pre-recession highs after the start of the recovery," the report said.
In contrast, this is clearly a slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and this is 74 months so far.
The fixed income was also volatile, as the market anticipates an interest rate hike, and the pattern is quite similar to that of the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than on stocks when they change their strategic course.
In the case of bonds, returns seem to change direction as soon as the first increase/lower occurs in the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, bond yields are falling immediately, Deutsche Bank said.
Charles Schwab’s strategists believe that the rise in interest rates will bring yields between longer and shorter bonds closer together and lead to a flattening of the curve.
High-interest bonds often bring better returns in such a climate, although “we’re still cautious about expecting higher returns,” said Kathy Jones, a fixed-income analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones says markets have already adapted to Fed strategy expectations.
“In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some indications that the market has adapted to the outlook for tighter monetary policy,” she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is flatter, credit margins have expanded and volatility has risen – all characteristics of the market as the Fed tightens its strategy.
By and large, companies operating the bulk of their business in the US will benefit as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational corporations with high debt will be worse off, as a rising dollar will make their products more expensive in the global market, as well as financing their debt.
"History shows that 'quality' stocks tend to react extremely positively three months after an initial interest rate hike," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for customers.
Companies with a strong balance sheet have surpassed companies with a weak balance sheet by an average of 5 percentage points after each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital returns and low volatility in their shares also outperformed their low-quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
Debt is going to be a big problem.
Companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
Outside of pure stock games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savers could see profits from higher returns, even if experts disagree on how fast this will take place.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
The Conservative Member of Parliament criticized the channel for its "dumming"
He argues that he is increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rivals.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, saying they only imitated The Brits.
Parliament colleague Damien Collins attacked The Voice, saying it was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "turns" to Classic FM, claims a leading MP and increases new pressure on the broadcaster to prove that he is doing something that private broadcasters are not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC bosses that the public-service radio station was "dumb" and increasingly indistinguishable from its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word "dumb" - but it seems to be turning into Classic FM," he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, which launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which launched last year, seem to be just under a different name.
So, if you’re trying to do something else — these are two spontaneously cited examples where you’re actually just imitating what’s already on the market,” Mr Bingham said.
BBC director-general dismissed the allegations, arguing that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public awareness.
What I’m learning from Radio 3, I’m not going to learn about classical music anywhere else.
And there is a commitment to live music and music making that is truly unmatched.
"And the commitment of Radio 3, to find new music and commission new works, I really think is important," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Davey argued that harder work should be done to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production that came under fire during the hearing in the Committee on Selection of Culture, Media and Sport for trampling the commercial rival.
Tory MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC's musical talent show, which was bought by Dutch producer Talpa Media at an estimated cost of <0xC2><0xA3>22 million.
Do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly distinctive?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show – with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges – was produced “in a special BBC way”.
He added that he wishes the company "to find a hit from our in-house stable" when it next starts an entertainment series.
However, he refused to exclude the ordering of further series of The Voice in the future or to spend the fee-payer's money on other entertainment formats.
Internet revenues rose slowest in August and Black Friday may be responsible
In the first three months of 2015, there was a 7% increase in online sales.
Last month was the lowest result since the beginning of records in 2000
Online sales increased three years ago through the use of mobile phones for shopping
Experts believe Black Friday slowed spending in November
For over a decade, virtual shopping has boomed, and many of Britain’s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns.
But experts say there are now signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures showed only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
Total spending for August showed the lowest growth increase since the beginning of records in 2000, with only a five percent increase from the previous year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures showed only 7% growth in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000, then that has always evolved over time," Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG Sales Index, told the Guardian.
He explained that online sales intensified three years ago when buyers started making purchases with their phones.
It meant that more people could shop online and that people could do so in different environments, such as at home on the sofa.
But now this is commuting, and we may be seeing growth slowing down.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which has been imported from America, is cited as a reason for the declining sales.
Experts believe that buyers will withhold their purchases prior to this event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers gathered around their computers to make their bargains, and some merchant websites crashed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, where buyers struggled for bargains, could stop buyers from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that out of <0xC2><0xA3>5 spending, just over <0xC2><0xA3>1 was spent online.
For some products such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are now made via web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities.
Muslims bury those killed in crane accident in Mecca - Bin Laden's family is sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead are carried through the streets by Muslims at the first funerals in Mecca
Saudi Arabia partially blames collapse of giant Saudi bin Laden group
The health ministry said a total of 394 people were injured after the crane fell.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered as 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those killed when a crane collapsed at Mecca’s Grand Mosque.
The mourners, dressed largely in white, filled the track to pay their respects when the first of the dead embarked on their last trip to the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The mourning procession passed at the Holy Site, where only days before, a construction crane crashed through the ceiling of the mosque and then on the prayerful.
The bodies were released for the funeral when the Saudi king imposed a sanction on the construction company of the Bin Laden family for the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 prayers that were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mosque of Mecca were carried through the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, father of four children who were on his first pilgrimage when the crane fell.
Mr Akram was with his parents before the start of the annual Hajj at the Great Mosque.
Saudi officials have already firmly pledged that the Hajj will continue to Mecca with thousands who will continue to come to the city.
Today, King Salman said the Bin Laden group should not have stopped the arm of the crane when it was not used.
An Arabic version of the decree, published by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, said that the Bin Laden group was co-responsible for the collapse.
The news agency’s English-language service did not report this detail, but said that the company’s management was forbidden to travel abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the fall of the crane that plunged into a courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the Hajj, which takes place later this month.
The Bin Laden Group has not issued any statements about the collapse of de Krans, and its representatives were not available for comment.
The Royal Decree also rebuked the group for not up-to-date security measures and for not cooperating with meteorologists.
Dozens of cranes surround Mecca’s Grand Mosque as part of the massive construction project led by the Bin Laden Group.
The Bin Laden family has been associated with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and is taking over major construction projects.
The late leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a renegade son who was expropriated by the family in the 1990s.
The crash of the crane came amidst strong winds and rain, just days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage required at least once in the life of any healthy Muslim.
Officials said 158 people remained in the hospital.
Government officials ordered that 1 million rials (<0xC2><0xA3>174,000) be paid to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured.
The other injured will receive half of that amount.
B&Q Boss says the time of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
Britons increasingly employ craftsmen, says Veronique Laury
The number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has risen behind it
As a result, 200 additional Screwfix stores targeting craftsmen will be opened
At the same time, Kingfisher 60 B&Q sales outlets will close nationwide
By Rupert Steiner, City Chief Correspondent of the Daily Mail
It is claimed that Britons lay down their hammers and brushes in favor of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen who do the work in their homes.
If you can skillfully handle a hammer or a brush for painting walls, you seem to be in a minority these days.
Because British people are increasingly employing craftsmen to do home improvement jobs in their homes, according to the head of the company behind B&Q.
Véronique Laury, new managing director of Kingfisher, who owns the DIY stores chain, said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe offering services at lowest prices is now outdated.
Therefore, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix shops aimed at craftsmen and close 60 B&Q outlets.
Mrs. Laury said she wants to employ more women in B&Q stores, as eight out of ten purchase decisions in the store are made by women.
For the time being, the men predominate among the employees.
She said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households doing more renovations than in the past.
Mrs. Laury said: “There is still a majority of men working in our stores.
We need to move this more towards a balance.
Basically, half of our customers are women with 80 percent of decisions about buying items by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs Laury, who is one of only five women at the top of a UK leader listed in the FTSE100 Index, has also restructured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company to have employed exactly 50 percent of the team with women, including its board of directors and financial directors.
Mrs Laury said: "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board.
Kingfisher reported a decline in half-year earnings and revenues after the group shouldered the cost of closing the stores.
Due to the trend, Kingfisher, who owns Screwfix and B&Q, will open 200 new stores.
Aich/Dob officials charged with infidelity in court
On Wednesday, two officials of the Austrian volleyball vice-champion Aich/Dob had to answer for infidelity and tax evasion.
The defendants were not guilty.
One of them was also charged with abuse of office.
He was legally acquitted of this accusation in May.
The current process has been postponed.
According to Attorney General Robert Riffel, the preliminary investigation had revealed that the defendants used funds from club accounts that they were allowed to use in their functions for private purposes in the years 2006 to 2011.
The damage is estimated to be around 400,000 euros.
Sports officials have also been charged with financial crimes.
Judge Michaela Sanin, chair of the Senate of the Shepherds, dismissed this fact.
It will be negotiated at a later date.
On the grounds of the infidelity, the defence stated that the association had not at any time suffered a financial disadvantage.
The sports officials had only set off expenses and led the sports club, for which they worked from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money, out of debt - the liabilities amounted to around 600,000 shillings in 2001 (approximately 44,000 euros).
"At that time, we were facing the situation: are we leading the club or are we locking it up?" one of the defendants told the tax office's large-scale auditor in the bread profession.
With his colleague and co-accused, he then decided to take on this task.
With all the risks.
"We advanced money, put our life insurance as collateral at the bank," he said at the hearing.
It was agreed with the association: you can freely manage the money, only no debts can be made.
In addition, the payment of expenses had been decided retroactively until 1991, provided that financial success had been achieved.
Consequently, part of the expenses were paid only years later, namely from 2003, when there was a surplus in the account.
Therefore, lump sums and not detailed debits appeared, the former headman explained the processes.
The accounts and savings books managed the two defendants together, the second defendant said.
Why the payments were not disclosed to the association in detail, the judge asked.
The association was not interested in the details of the financial revelation, only the debt-free was important, according to the answer.
When in 2011 investigations began against the one official for abuse of office, an amount of 120,000 euros was transferred to the club account.
These were the charges, the defendants said.
This securities account ran in the name of the second defendant and, according to the statement, was not known to the association.
“Why?” the judge asked.
The interviewee did not know the answer for a long time.
Then he finally said he believed that this was the best thing for the club.
If something had happened to him, no one would have known about this money, the prosecutor put in the room.
The defendant was informed, the officer justified.
This transfer has been formulated as "reparation".
Why do you want to pay for damages? the judge and prosecutor wanted to know.
The first defendant then stated that he did not agree with this wording because the association had never suffered any damage.
But what should I do if the lawyer says, "You're all out of the way with that."
"Am I a lawyer?" he asked.
The official also said that he had never received a cent salary, he had only paid mileage and diets.
On diets, he had billed the club 1,000 euros per month, but the actual expense was much higher, he added.
The defendants were unable to provide accurate documents for the early years.
These were no longer kept after an audit, in which everything was judged to be correct, they explained.
The second defendant also paid mileage.
All corrections were made in cash, for which he had to drive from his place of residence Völkermarkt to the bank to Bleiburg, he explained in his statement.
The main hearing will continue on September 23 with the interrogation of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard cuts another 30,000 jobs
In addition to the staff cuts that have been ongoing for three years, the computer giant will cut further jobs as the company splits up.
The job losses at the US computer giant Hewlett-Packard (HP) have no end.
As part of its restructuring, the U.S. technology group plans to reduce its corporate customer division from 25,000 to 30,000 jobs.
This is expected to save $2.7 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.4 billion) in costs, the company said on Tuesday.
The move will result in a special tax of around $2.7 billion, which will apply from the fourth quarter onwards.
The cut of 55,000 jobs in the last three years has not yet been completed.
HP still employed around 302,000 people at the end of the financial year 2013/14.
After-market Hewlett-Packard stock fell 2.3 percent.
The company, which grew up with printers in Palo Alto, California, is currently splitting: In this way, the computer and printer business is to be bundled in a new company this year - separate from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services.
Both business units will be listed on the stock exchange.
Another disappointing PC sales as well as a weaker demand from corporate customers for its services recently added to the world’s second-largest PC manufacturer after Lenovo.
In the third quarter at the end of July, sales of PCs and printers fell by 11.5 percent.
Revenues fell by 8 percent to just under $25.4 billion.
This led to a decline in revenues in 15 of the 16 quarters.
HP is responding with a split and massive job deletion to change in the industry.
The 76-year-old company led by Meg Whitman has lately responded to the fact that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and are doing more and more business online.
Whitman’s restructuring plans foresee the reduction of around 55,000 jobs.
Conflicts: Majority supports anti-IS training mission
A direct involvement of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would, however, be predominantly rejected: 54 percent were against it, 35 percent were in favour.
The fact that other countries are flying air strikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria is 61 percent positive.
24% are against intervening in the conflict.
Cooperation with Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad was rejected by 51 percent of the respondents, and 20 percent were in favour.
29 percent were unable to decide.
Car: Second press day at the 66th IAA
The focus of the trade fair will be on connected, self-driving cars and electric mobility until September 27.
After two press days, Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Automobile Exhibition under the motto "Mobility Connects" on Thursday.
The public will be able to attend the IAA from Saturday.
The organisers of the car association VDA expect to receive about 900,000 visitors, as they did two years ago.
Röszke: Outbreak of violence at Serbian-Hungarian border
The Hungarian police have used tear gas and water guns at the Serbian border near Röszke against several hundred angry refugees.
Euronews correspondent Dániel Bozsik witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border checkpoint.
He reported by phone:
A group of refugees crossed the border.
Behind it a police line had formed and behind the police a water cannon was ready.
40 to 50 refugees began throwing stones, sticks and plastic bottles at the officials.
The officials initially used pepper spray continuously.
After that, the police used tear gas.
A lot of tear gas was sprayed towards the refugees.
This disbanded the group.
The refugees have now withdrawn somewhat.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried out of the zone.
Children who had breathed the tear gas screamed.
Other refugees collapsed and suffered from shortness of breath.
Press spokesmen of the Serbian police also suffered injuries from the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
Time to decide interest rates for the U.S. Federal Reserve
The world is watching as the U.S. Federal Reserve comes together on two days, Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision whether or not interest rates will be raised for the first time in nearly a decade.
A survey of 80 economists surveyed by Reuters found that a little more than half who thought last week that the Fed would do so now thinks the Fed will stay a little longer and will keep interest rates at the current level of 0-0.25 percent.
It’s a historic event because it’s been seven years since the Fed set interest rates at zero.
“For the first time, we are approaching a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero range and start a process of normalization of interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy is at a relatively good level of performance, with trillions of dollars added to the balance sheet and generating only low inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy outlook on global conditions.
It has warned markets to adjust for an increase, but the signs indicate that the odds against such a move are good.
The decision is due to be announced at 8 p.m. CET on Thursday
Death shooter at Delta State University left apology letter
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning—and before he shot and killed his colleagues later that day—Shannon Lamb wrote a note saying he “sorry” about the first murder and wanted “he can undo it,” authorities announced on Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, said Lamb, a lecturer in geography and social sciences education at Delta State University, called the emergency number around 10:00 a.m. on Monday morning.
He said he shot someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the emergency department staff that police had to send police officers to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night" and he also mentioned that there was a "cute dog" in the house but who "will not bother anyone" but will probably be upset.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he did not give it.
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots.
When police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, which said, "I'm so sorry, I wish I could undo it.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me."
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before finally taking his own life on Monday night when police surrounded him.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr. Lamb's imagination."
Despite reports Monday that Lamb allegedly believed Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said on Tuesday that there was "no information, no evidence" for a "triangle relationship."
Prentiss was described by Shawn O'Steen, who testified that they were married for about seven years, as a "good person."
The two divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter who is 19, and she was "destroyed."
He said that Prentiss was her daughter "absolutely best friends".
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, who was identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who owned a dog called Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
“She always wanted to help other people,” Knowles said.
Police said Lamb had called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them “he’s not going to jail.”
When police officers caught up with him on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb drove his car aside, ran on foot, ran into the forest, and killed himself with a shot.
Lamb received a doctorate from Delta State University in the spring of 2015, as stated in his Lebenslau on the university’s website.
Stars who have lost their fortune-bearer
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001, he fought against leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his longtime partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer.
The actor also allegedly struggled with drugs, and in 2008 he was convicted of drug possession.
All of this takes its toll.
Eurowings: Lufthansa rebuilds the Group
Lufthansa is planning a major group restructuring.
The Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year with a better organization alone.
150 of the world’s approximately 1,000 executives will have to pay for the workplace.
However, there are new negotiations with the pilot union.
Lufthansa is restructuring its corporate structure and is upgrading its low-cost subsidiary Eurowings.
The aim of the reorientation is to contribute approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>500 million per year to earnings from cost and revenue synergies, the airline announced on Wednesday.
Among other things, Lufthansa will no longer have a board of directors for its passenger business.
The low-cost airline Eurowings should be developed as independently as possible.
In future, Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings in the Executive Board team headed by Carsten Spohr.
With the renewal, Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the group intends to compete against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
So far, the organization of the 120,000-strong company has been complex.
The airlines operated under the umbrella of the Passage Airline Group, which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros.
New negotiations with pilots
In the tariff conflict with the pilots’ association Cockpit (VC), the negotiations are to be resumed after the court-stopped strike on Thursday.
The union announced this.
The topic of the talks will be the retirement scheme for pilots.
Cockpit wants to achieve "sustainable results in a year with a forecasted record result" as soon as possible.
The conflict between the trade union and the airline has led to various strikes in recent months.
In addition to the transitional supply of the pilots, the background is the savings concept "Wings".
It provides that Lufthansa will outsource routes to Eurowings’ own low-cost line in the fight against competitors.

Luke Shaw of Manchester United will not be able to play for months due to double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg in Manchester's Champions League defeat at PSV Eindhoven.
While this made the left defender cry and will exclude him from playing for at least six months, Louis van Gaal does not give up hope that Shaw can play again this season.
The injury was caused by a ruthless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV area.
He was treated on the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double leg fracture and is in the hospital."
He will be transferred tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester.
It’s terrible – a boy who comes to Manchester United at 18, has a very hard time and then plays fantastically, and then it happens.
He was wearing an oxygen mask in the locker room.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it'll take six months, and he won't play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno seemed lucky to have escaped a red card and a penalty penalty.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, has not punished the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian arbitrator was wrong.
You can judge for yourself when I say that a penalty penalty and a red card were due.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A tweet on Shaw's account read: "Thank you all for your messages. Words can't describe how broken I am, my path to recovery begins now, I'm coming back stronger."
Manchester United loses to Luke Shaw in defeat at PSV
The England defender has an additional incentive with the European Championship in France to recover until next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said, "It's a very bad injury."
When a player with this type of injury leaves the pitch, everyone is very sad about it.
It is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent.
Moreno suffered a bone break when Mexico played against Van Gaal’s Holland team at the 2014 World Cup.
"He's doing himself very hard because it wasn't his intention to hurt the opponent, and then when you hear it's a very bad injury, that's not good," Cocu said.
It was not possible for me to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was moving in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] had touched him, but I couldn’t see the attack on Luke.
Speaking to SBS6, Moreno said, "I know what it feels like, I know how hard it can be.
I feel very bad about it. I'm so sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital after a foul by Chris Smalling.
David Cameron knows the Lorax better.
It’s one thing that all parents will soon learn: If your child loves a book, it won’t take long for you to know it almost by heart.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When asked by a provider of childcare systems to name his favorite children’s book, the Prime Minister decided to write The Lorax, Dr. Seuss’s 1971 environmental fable.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on the SuperCamps website, and continues: "funny, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it's a book that I like to read to my children, because it always seems to give us a picture or a message that we've missed so far."
All in all, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron allegedly describes the plot of the book, instead reproduces a summary of the 2012 film version, which added new characters and details to expand the fairly short original text.
"In the midst of the walled town of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," one reads. A love interest was Dr. Seuss, whose real name Theodor Seuss Geisel, however, was completely unknown according to 1991.
As if that weren't suspicious enough: the text presented by Cameron reads partly like the summary of the Lorax film presented on the Internet Movie Database website and begins like this: "In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams."
Although he admits to being a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so familiar with the plot of the book. Here, an unnamed boy hears the local environment through the money-hungry, tree-cutting, thneed-knitting once-learner despite the protests of the name-given Lorax, a squatting, sniffing-bearded being, "the name of trees is spoken in the name,"
Most likely, such a relatively low PR task was delegated to a helper who did not read The Lorax to a child 20 times in a row.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text probably came from Cameron’s constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron’s staff, but made no further immediate comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened with exclusion from England's team, but it's still hard
Hitting Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but when you see the squad England chose for the tour, a repeat 3-0 test series defeat is not on my card.
I wouldn't rule out a win away.
Alastair Cook’s side may be less experienced than the ones three years ago, but there are good spin players in the batting lineup, and the community spirit is strong; they won’t bear any scars of 2012, just a youth-positive attitude.
With the ball, Moeen Ali evolves as a spin bowler and Adil Rashid, even if it represents an unknown size at the test level, is an option for the attack.
Adam Lyth resigns from the England Test squad and is replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to leave out Adam Lyth is, of course, difficult for me as his head coach in Yorkshire to analyze.
In his seven tests, there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricketers are focused on results.
There were no question marks on Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination, since - and I said this earlier - players are their own best pickers.
A long time ago, the course of Lyth would have been extended, but he had control over his own fate.
If he hopes to make more runs for Yorkshire, there is another chance.
England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even if he did not perform so well, and that does not surprise me; he is above all a team man.
The question of how much time a test batsman gets to set his mark is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances – like Sam Robson before him – while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton had the chance to play home and away.
The only accusation that can be made was that England first used Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - when Lyth was in peak form - but that lost chance is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he's a batsman that I highly appreciate.
He’s an X-Factor cricketer, which we saw at Yorkshire early this season when he scored 236 against us on a Trent Bridge pitch, which hit us very hard.
He must get at least the same chances as before him, but of course this depends on the team line-up in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of having Moeen beaten alongside Cook, which would produce an extra-spin bowler and get four quicks, came up, and I don’t mind.
I don’t see why a batsman can’t beat there, and that left-hander has already shown that he’s a devil’s dude of cricket players.
Moeen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire, but he’s a number 3 for them, and there’s no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at the first drop before appearing as the opener in 2001.
He made three hundred runs immediately and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the squad as a back-up spinner, and in my limited dealings with him, he impressed me very much as a young man.
People may be looking at his stats — an average of 31 with the club and 35 with the ball — and think it’s a point, but there’s not a large number of backup spinners raising their hands and the coaches have chosen youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Aside from the team, England has made some clever additions to the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the test matches could be a master coup.
He is one of the nicest guys in the game who will bring a wealth of experience as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and a powerful commitment to the setup.
I have always felt that he was made for the international cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela, he has insights that we can benefit from.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room can bring fresh air, even if the news is in line with what was said before.
Colly’s teammate at Durham, Ben Stokes, will not be deployed at the One-Dayers, Root got a similar break against Australia and I, for my part, have no problem with that.
Some may disagree, but coaches and team representatives do not set the schedule.
And you have to remember that as with the players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not made with ease.
The Brexit camp (Brexit <0x3D> Britain's exit from the EU) could gain momentum if the economy goes to a halt by 2017
David Cameron’s unprecedented renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting deeper into trouble every day, even without the choice of the brilliant Jeremy “Is it Yes or No?” Corbyn as the leader of Labour or the TUC, who is fighting fiercely over Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat friend said the other day that some member states, as deeply immersed in various crises as the EU is and not always out of their own fault, are fed up with Britain’s self-made agenda of split concessions and disruptive treaty changes, which they usually do not want.
In Brighton, the TUC decided at their annual meeting that they would not like them even if they endangered social protection.
We could also call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
Prime Ministers and finance ministers climb to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local figures, then come home and say they are winning allies for reforms.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wishes for a Britain looking outward inside the EU tent - "Leave us not alone with France," Berlin says - and shows that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have come to the point where they don't care if we stay or go.
Germany’s cautious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her, as has happened with the excessively long-lasting ones like Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France’s François Hollande is looking forward to his re-election or his replacement in 2017.
He is also a fading force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a left-wing one.
It’s hard to imagine that they’re going to tear themselves a leg to help the selfie Brits whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland’s exit from the UK – something they don’t want either, because most have similar separatist tendencies.
Therefore, some such ministers may even intentionally plan unhelpful remarks, entirely in the SNP style, during Britain’s 2017 referendum campaign to accelerate the Brexit process, my friend suspects.
"The renegotiation was a bankruptcy" and "Britain has gained nothing of value from the renegotiation."
Europeans know how predatory Fleet Street can be at their expense and what EU skeptics the oligarchy of the press barons is, as they were during the Tony Benn-inspired referendum in 1975 that supported our entry in 1973 at a ratio of 2:1.
They may weakly remember Boris Johnson, the arch-euro opportunist who made a name for himself as an “EU straight banana” Brussels correspondent in the early 90s.
In all his madness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
This included the medley of tax-fearing villains, phone-hacking foreigners, and the pseudo-non-nationals who own most of our major newspapers.
Actually, Tony Blair thought similarly about them, but found that when you sit in a cage with a hot gorilla, you better spread bananas to distract him, rather than becoming his lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairian than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron’s referendum whirl, because Blair had set the principle over the unadopted EU constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which opened a backdoor to him.
The press never forgave him.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly slap on the back on Monday in Westminster – I told him he didn’t need to waste any more time for me – seems in danger of repeating Neil Kinnock’s 80s boycott Murdoch’s strategy, a mistake then and now.
It may take time, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyn’s official position on Europe is – I kindly say it – in development.
He says we should stay in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside of Ukip’s traditional blue dye tendency and the wilder fields of Tory’s small Englishism can probably say yes to it.
It's what Hilary "A Benn, but no Bennite" Benn said on radio and on television this week, when the scout was fighting in him, not admitting that Corbyn's appointment of provocative John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70s when his old father tried to be disloyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues on television without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary's fight was even more attractive.
But fighting to stay “in all circumstances”—Benn’s expression—was not what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his fellow contenders and MPs, after all the reports at their Monday evening exam session.
Whatever Corbyn’s stirring bottom-up image wants to convey – remember that he even touched me – news discipline remains important in the age of television around the clock and, above all, in the vortex of social media, a breeding ground of paranoia and treason.
It is right not to give Cameron a free pass for Europe that allows him to take Labour’s support in the referendum campaign for granted, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn’s fundamental ambiguities about EU membership – in line with their Bennite siege economy, their anti-capitalist past – are no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents, for whom the narcissism of small difference is a central principle of dogmatic disputes.
As with his ambiguities about NATO - Tom Watson is firmly convinced that JC is not launching a campaign to leave - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superiors at home in everything.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspicious voters - to make concessions to the British, if all this can be pointless?
The U.S. is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost cut by the Tory government in power, which I was reminded of when I started on Monday of what was called the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticize Public Health England’s report on e-cigarettes
Claims by a state-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people, some with links to the tobacco industry, researchers said.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet by criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the “principal report” last month, describing it as a “comprehensive review of the evidence.”
However, some researchers have questioned the resilience of the data and pointed out the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the “extraordinarily windy basis” on which PHE justified its most important conclusion.
Two other researchers write in BMJ and have asked whether the claims “build on stone or sand.”
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said, "A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on demonstrating efficacy."
They said the public expected PHE’s claim that “the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking” to be based on a detailed review of evidence and modeling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who were summoned to develop a model for Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) to synthesize their opinions about the damage of various nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose managing directors were previously reported to have received from British American Tobacco Fund (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed BAT’s public health references in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting said they were receiving funds from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding he was supposed to have received from tobacco company Philip Morris International, they added.
The reasons for selecting members of the board are not provided, but these include several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of whom also state an industry funding in the paper.
Some other participants in this session are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The tobacco management of PHE also participated in the meeting.
The group’s research “confesses significantly” that there is a lack of “hard evidence for the damage to most products at most criteria,” McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these connections or limitations are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE's claims that "there is no evidence so far that e-cigarettes serve as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers" were premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said that BMJ’s claims had already been responded to beforehand.
He said, “E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking.”
One out of every two smokers dies from addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are low compared to that, but that we continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what evidence proves and what does not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from a disease related to smoking, and smoking costs the National Health System <0xC2><0xA3>2 billion a year.
By presenting clear current evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but represent only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we are fulfilling our national jurisdiction.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former head of Channel 4
Former chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, has said the BBC should stop broadcasting programs like EastEnders and The Voice, saying commercial rivals would "give their right arm" for hit shows like the Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said the broadcast fee should only be used to make the kind of programs not broadcast by other UK broadcasters.
He criticized the BBC for placing public-service programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience in harshly contested windows of time against the most popular shows of their rivals and by broadcasters such as BBC4.
After BBC Director-General Tony Hall said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said he had tried unsuccessfully to get in touch with the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4.
"I have problems with the idea that the BBC is commissioning or broadcasting programs that would also be clearly shown by unsubsidized rivals," Johnson told the House Communications Committee as part of his investigation into the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the broadcast fee, which I don’t think is a good idea in the medium or long term, you should at least produce it on programs that others don’t make or order.
They broadcast The Voice in a first-class window of time because they want to achieve the broadest possible support for their future.
The idea that no one else would show this is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's, of course, nonsense.
Johnson said, "I don't see why a regressive tax funded programs that could be funded even without subsidies.
The Voice is one such program, EastEnders is another, admittedly both in-house productions.
To be honest, other channels would give their right arm for it.
I am trying to see how this is supposed to be public television.
I don’t think that would diminish the BBC at all.
Johnson, an entrepreneur for series that ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said the BBC was to blame for the hunt for reviews "because of the ambitions of the people who work there, and because they believe this is the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments on the BBC's most popular broadcasts reflect what former Sky director Tony Ball suggested in his 2003 MacTaggart speech in Edinburgh that the BBC should sell shows like EastEnders.
Johnson said the more public-sector niche programs “should go to BBC4 where you can’t quite measure the audience, but they’re fulfilling their duties, and they can argue when they go on their hypocritical missions to justify <0xC2><0xA3>4 billion broadcast fees,” “Well, of course, we’ve created all these obscure programs that no one has seen.”
They put them in a window of time where no one ever wanted to see them.
Regarding the broadcast fee, Johnson told the committee, "I urge you to find a more regressive system in terms of terms on who can get the best value out of it.
Of course, you all think, we all think that you get a big value here for <0xC2><0xA3>150 a year, but for people who are a lot of money for the <0xC2><0xA3>150, ask me if that’s true, because they don’t consume much from the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 CEO David Elstein, who also testified before the committee on Tuesday, demanded that the BBC review its Reithian mission to "inform, educate and entertain."
He said little of BBC production would now be officially classified as education – he said it was 1% of its TV production and 0.1% on radio – and she should take an example of public television channels in Australia and Canada changing this into “informing, educating and entertaining.”
On the issue of partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas like the proms, which he said only a handful will be shown on television, and enter into alliances with the commercial channels to make everything available online.
Sonogenetics can control brain cells through sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change direction the moment they are irradiated with sound pulses.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by outbreaks of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change direction the moment they are irradiated with sound impulses that have too high frequencies for human hearing to be heard.
The impulses work by turning on motor neuron cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves.
Researchers Read and Write Brain Activity with Light
The researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method, called Sonogenetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the procedure could one day replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that emits electrical impulses into people’s brains to treat the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.
Threadworms usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did when surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found out, amplify the ultrasound waves, which then penetrate into the worms.
The amplified ultrasonic waves act on structures called TRP-4 ion channels found in the membranes of some of the worm cells.
The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned, according to a report by Nature Communications.
To create ultrasound-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically altered the worms so that some of their motor neurons carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When it applies ultrasound to the modified creatures, the sound waves are amplified by the microbubbles and transferred to the worms, where they turn on the modified motor neurons.
The procedure has some similarities to Optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to turn neurons on and off with pulses of light.
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent down to the desired location in the brain at an optical fiber, low-frequency ultrasonic waves can pass through tissue unhindered and can thus be sent to the brain from the top of the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus, it is possible to make the targeted human neurons temporarily susceptible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture equipment - right at your doorstep!
Advertisements shame Britain’s arms trade
Watch Amnesty International Anti-Weapons Fair video.
Terrible killer drones!
Ankle shattering leg fetters!
The scavenger bomb!
And electroshock rods that cause painful pain but leave no trace!
The cheerful voice and cartoon images leave no doubt that this ad for the world’s largest arms fair is a combative parody produced by Amnesty International to highlight the British government’s willingness to stir up weapons to repressive regimes via the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London’s Docklands.

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters that can be seen at bus stops and on the subway trains and that require a second look.
"Important Announcement: Do you ride the DLR from 15 to 18 September?" (Docklands Light Railway) reads in the fonts of the London Underground and the trademark of the DLR line, which turns into the image of a tank.
In September, a swarm of arms dealers will drive the DLR ... customers are asked to help stop the arms trade fair.
The 300 posters are by artists who exhibited their work at the Museum of Cruel Designs in Banksy’s Dismaland.
A collective called Special Patrol Group helped distribute in London, using "Ad Space Hack Packs," a <0xC2><0xA3>6 pack of inbus keys, which is claimed to "get access to about a third of the bus stop advertising space on the planet."
Transport for London doesn't find this poster "vandalism" funny.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists become more critical and try to bring political work to audiences outside of galleries.
Many artists get to work with activists within protest movements, noticing that they have to go outside into the real world in order for their art to have an impact on society.
Another of the anti-weapon trade posters greets commuters in the subway.
The video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP, which works for non-profit purposes with the graphic artist and voiceover artist, who also works for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was astonished by the silence surrounding the promotion of the arms trade fair – through a vacancy in the ExCeL calendar – and thought, “Let’s give them the campaign they’re trying to avoid.”
They played with the invention of a more realistic obscure corporate advertising, but "by blushing in with bright colors and animation, it remains more sticky."
“They have done a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair,” said Tom Davies of Amnesty International.
What we need now is an intervention by the British government and the guarantee that torture equipment will not be illegally traded on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art around the arms fair comes from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors make fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab revealed an order from the U.S. Army about “the AT4CS RS shot down from the shoulder.”
This includes a “uniquely shaped warhead that delivers outstanding after-effect effects inside the target.”
Whatever it is, it will not be pleasant.
Eight Golden Rules for Living in Student Homes
Eleven years ago, as a self-forgotten 19-year-old, I moved into a student residence, still believing in berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the tense smiles of those I have annoyed – and the numerous, long-standing complaints about others.
Most of what I’ve learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Moving into student residences ranges from slightly nerve-racking to absolutely frightening.
It’s tempting to talk: people tell you where you came from, if and where you took the Sabbath year, where you stand in relation to Corbyn and why you “honestly don’t love or hate Marmite, because seriously, guys, it’s just a yeast extract HAHAHA, I’m in my room.”
Breathe through.
And help others do the same - ask questions and show interest.
It directs the conversation and helps you find out the people you like as opposed to the ones you wouldn’t talk to even if your eyelashes were on fire and these were fire extinguishers.
Leave people.
People’s rooms often turn into drink receptions, movie night venues, and community meeting places, but they are also the places where people dress and pull their underwear.
Related: Don’t Think About Starting a Relationship at University
Introverts receive rough treatment at the university.
Your room should be a refuge, but many student residences form a space-to-space strolling culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
This can be hell for someone trying to recover.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to continue, but you have to go away so that I can get back the energy I used to interact with you."
Try to feel when a fellow friend is exhausted from socializing — and send him an SMS instead of knocking.
Speaking of knocking, do it.
A guy in my dorm had the idea that an unlocked door was an invitation.
He saw a few things.
Make friends by baking.
Since you’re starting college at the height of back mania, knocking on people’s doors to imagine a plate full of brownies is less strange than welcoming the 1950s “Welcome to the neighborhood, I’ve baked you something. So, and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions.”
Offering homemade treats is a great way to make friends.
Your roommates feel obliged to entertain and may end up associating your face with a tasty surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Poorly mixed lumps of flour, sugar, and fat cause people to fall asleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student residences.
Of course, clawing chicken is a theft, but is it also taking a drop of milk for your tea?
Check with the dairy owner.
Chances are they’re saying to serve themselves, even if they’re cooking inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it’s annoying, and you have my compassion — but try to handle it more balancedly than my roommate who added a dishwashing detergent to her milk to punish thieves.
She's in jail now.
You shouldn’t make any noise that keeps people from sleeping or working.
It’s not just about being a decent person, it’s about being, in the truest sense of the word, one of the people sitting in the glass house.
A girl in my hallway asked her neighbors if they care about putting Drum & Bass down a little bit, because it was three o'clock in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
They responded with even louder music.
When they finally stopped at 5 a.m., she kindly allowed her neighbors to sleep for two more hours before letting her own music flutter, locking her door, and going to her three-hour exam.
Wouldn’t it be romantic if your future spouse accidentally moved into the same student residence?
Conversely, it wouldn’t be awfully embarrassing if you thought of a roommate as your future spouse, walked up to her, separated again, and then had to see her every day, and maybe witnessed her pulling all the common friends over to her?
Of course, the heart goes its own way - but if a hot roommate is definitely not your future spouse, at least try to persuade your lower abdomen a little reason.
In the exciting moment when you notice that someone has left their keys in their unlocked room, the line between an ulcer and bullying is finer than it seems.
A good prank is funny, but it only takes moments to become a boomerang.
Give a valuable and amusing lesson about safety by hiding - but never ruin someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Close their door and put their keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but do not stick their possessions to the ceiling more than twice.
Townhouses for refugees, single parents, low earners
Real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds townhouses in the Eckental region of Middle Franconia for people who don’t have a lot of money.
So for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need housing, but also the single-parent mother and the low-earner."
"I'm showing how you can still build inexpensively and well today," the 44-year-old says in an interview
Thousands of refugees will be pushing into the housing market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes he knows how quickly cheap housing can be created: he is building terraced houses for refugees in a project.
Mr Gildner, many refugees will be pushing into the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: Massive accommodation in containers or gyms has no sustainability.
Because most people stay here.
Given the flow of refugees, we will continue to need sufficient housing in the coming decades.
A very banal, three-storey terraced house is the solution.
Gildner: A terraced house takes up the least space.
It facilitates integration.
This is different when you put people in residential blocks.
Each of the six houses currently being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each.
Each unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.
It may be that many refugees will say, it’s peace again, I’m going back.
Then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to the respective needs.
What is the cost?
Gildner: The price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184,000 euros, without land.
That's manageable.
The construction took six months.
That's appropriate.
Did the building regulations complicate their plans?
Gildner: In terms of construction law, I carried out my project correctly.
Especially complicated it always makes the impending Damocles sword special construction and the parking order.
Horrible.
It is still assumed that whoever creates three apartments in a terraced house needs at least three pitches.
Only in the cities is the place missing.
Refugees and asylum seekers do not have cars.
How did the residents react to their townhouse project?
Gildner: There were some who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
Which is definitely not true.
But aren’t you exacerbating the competition for affordable housing?
Gildner: It’s true: We’ve had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years, but luxury apartments have been built that hardly anyone can afford anymore.
My project has the message that even normal people need housing.
Not only refugees, but also the single mother or the low-earner.
I show you how you can still build inexpensively and well today.
That's what it's all about.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystem engineering in Regensburg and initially studied environmental analysis.
iOS 9: How to Get the New iPhone Operating System When Apple Update Releases
The new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app, tapping "General" and then selecting "Software Update".
When it is ready, the phone gives you the option to download and then to install.
Some have encountered problems after installing because they receive an error message stating that the "software update failed".
To get around the problem, users are advised to either wait for the rush to go back or try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process.
This could possibly mean deleting apps to create space – but Apple has made that less likely by slimming down the update. Likewise, it will be easier to do this when using a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall them once the process is complete.
It is worth making sure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger so that the battery is charged.
If the charge is too low, Apple won’t allow the update to continue, as the phone might shut down halfway and this could lead to a breakdown of the update.

Rosberg's only motto: Full Attack
In the fight for the Formula 1 World Cup title against his clearly leading Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton, Nico Rosberg knows only one motto: "Full Attack".
The World Cup second emphasized before the start in the crucial seven overseas races, "that I have nothing more to lose."
53 points separate the vice world champion before the night race in Singapore on this Sunday from title defender and double champion Hamilton.
The Briton has already won seven of the previous twelve races of the season and is also taking on the floodlights grand prix in the city-state as a favorite.
In 2009 and last year, the 30-year-old Briton was able to win the race.
Whether the current smog in the city-state will affect the Singapore Grand Prix is still unclear.
For days, a fog bell has been hanging over the city, triggered by fires on the neighboring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Chess Club has a prominent member
The chess club "Chessfriends Bad Kissingen" founded three months ago has added another member to its ranks, thus increasing the number of members to 19 players.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player who spent more than 40 times in Bad Kissingen for a spa.
Gauselmann is the holder of the Federal Cross of Merit 1st Class and honorary citizen of the cities of Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
Gauselmann supported the chess club in Bad Kissingen with a donation received by Chairman Alfred Klein.
This makes it possible to accept chess players who cannot pay the membership fee.
Youth work and talent search should also be promoted.
Gauselmann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact with the tennis club "Red-White" be seen as an expression of his connection with the spa town.
Quartiersbüro is looking for direct contact
Saludis and the Antonistift Altenzentrum have joined forces under the cloak of the Social Foundation and opened a new contact point at Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
In addition to consultations, you can also take part in courses there.
The social foundation pulls it down from the mountain into the city center.
More specifically, at Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
A new district office was recently opened there.
Here, right next to the shopping market, seniors and consultants will now receive information on questions such as nursing insurance or health and nursing insurance benefits.
For years, we have noticed with our outpatient care service that caring relatives are often left alone.
There are infinitely many questions.
"Neither are often many benefits of the cash registers not used, because the complexity of the insurances is hardly understood," explained the new housewife Jutta Weigand, who is also responsible for the Antonistift and the Bürgerspital as well as for the outpatient service "Amadeus" as head of the division "Altenhilfe".
In addition to the consultations, the new district office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
To this end, the salute was taken on board.
Therefore, additional offers such as fall prevention, memory training or physiotherapeutic treatment can be used.
The offers of the Senior Centre and the Saludis complement each other in an ideal way.
Saludis stands for prevention, prevention and rehabilitation.
"The senior center for care and nursing," described Heike Riedel, Managing Director of Saludis.
The reason for the opening of the new district office in the city center, both managing directors see the demographic change in particular.
This makes a good decentralized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg essential in the future.
In addition, Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) underlined at the inauguration ceremonies, the Quartiersbüro also devotes itself to loneliness in old age: "There are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular social gathering".
In this way, the Social Foundation makes a great contribution that seniors can live as independently and well as possible in their familiar environment.
The Quartiers office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m.
Eintracht Bamberg against Würzburger Kickers on 6 October
Now it is official: After renovation work at the Fuchsparkstadion the date for the match for FC Eintracht Bamberg against the third league Würzburger Kickers had not yet been fixed, the 6th of October was now set as the date.
The match between FC Eintracht Bamberg and FC Würzburger Kickers in the quarterfinals of the Bavarian Football Toto Cup has now been finalised.
The game will take place on Tuesday, October 6th, at 7 p.m. at the Bamberg Fuchsparkstadion.
"We are glad that we now know when the game will go on stage, now we have planning certainty," said FCE team manager Karlheinz Hümmer, who also points to the ticket pre-sale now launched.
It’s a special thing for our team to play against a third league player.
We therefore hope for a large number of spectators, and this is not without reason, because floodlight games have a special appeal.
In the round of the last 16 teams, FC Eintracht Bamberg moved in 2010 by victories at district league 1 FC Oberhaid (3:1) and at home against regional league 1 FC Schweinfurt 05 (3:2).
The winner of the competition will receive <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5,000 and will qualify for the first round of the DFB Club Cup 2016/2017.
The defending champion is third-league buyer SpVgg Unterhaching.
Vienna architect Karl Mang has died at the age of 92
Karl Mang, one of the doyens of Viennese architecture, is dead.
He died on September 5, at the age of 92, the Künstlerhaus announced on Tuesday.
With Mang, the Künstlerhaus loses an honorary member and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna", as the broadcast said.
Born in Vienna in 1922, Mang studied architecture at the Technische Hochschule in Vienna with Friedrich Lehmann during and after the Second World War.
Since 1952 he worked as a freelance architect, but also as a teacher, writer and head of the institute.
From 1972 to 1983 he was President of the Austrian Institute of Design.
In the 1980s he was commissioned to set up the Treasury in the Vienna Hofburg and to convert the Palais Lobkowitz into the Austrian Theatre Museum.
Park Penalty: Tim Wiese Accuses Policewoman With Money
Ex-footballer Tim Wiese was not noticed in Bremen.
Footballer was once, now Tim Wiese, ex-national goalkeeper in Germany and engaged at Bremen and Hoffenheim, wrestler.
According to his own statement, he has gained 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the past two years.
Intellectually, however, he did not.
Meadow had his hair cut in the city centre of Bremen when he saw a parking attendant handing out a ticket for his white Chevrolet Camaro.
Wiese then rushed out of the store, insulted the official and threw the fine at her feet, as the "Bild" newspaper reports.
The city of Bremen confirms the allegations, but is not yet aware of the consequences for the unusual incident.
"The case is still under examination," the city of Bremen said.
Only after that will it be decided whether or not the meadow will be displayed.
Panamanian authorities destroy 4,500 marijuana plants

For the past three days, Panamanian authorities have been tearing out 4,500 plants and burning them.

Witnesses are looking for the police for an incident in Bad Soden-Salmünster: On Friday evening, around 11:45 p.m., three young men were walking from Bad Soden towards Salmünster.
A member of the group, a 17-year-old Afghan, reportedly followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called for them to wait for him.
At that time, the group was at the level of the bft petrol station.
Three people were also present at the gas station.
One of these men then screamed at the young man and punched him in the face with his fist.
The victim suffered a nose fracture and bleeded heavily from the nose.
When his two friends hurried up and comfortingly appealed to the club, he initially abandoned his victim.
The injured young man was taken home by his friends.
The perpetrator pursued the group with a car to their apartment and drove there demonstratively several times.
When the vehicle was no longer seen, the injured person walked in front of the building to smoke a cigarette.
There, he was attacked again by the club and another male person.
With the help of a stick, they beat the victim’s face and thighs.
The injured person had to be taken to a hospital for medical care.
So far, there is only a vague description of the perpetrator.
One of the men was about 1.80 meters tall.
The second racket was about 1.65 meters tall and was dressed in jeans and a brown-white shirt.
The police are asking witnesses and whistleblowers to report on the phone number 06181/100-123.
Dr. Frank Müller takes over Felstehausen practice and invests <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>310000
Silvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller (from left) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
Samtgemeindemayor Bernd Bormann, economic promoter Uta Seim-Schwartz and Asendorf’s mayor Heinfried Kabbert are also pleased about this.
Doctors are missing in many places in the countryside - Asendorf, on the other hand, is fortunate: Dr. Frank Müller will take over the Felstehausen practice there on October 1.
While Ursel Felstehausen is retiring, her husband Karl-Heinrich will be halfway alongside his successor in the next few months.
After a renovation phase, Müller reopens the practice on 12 October, until then he invests <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>310,000 in the premises at St.-Marcellusstraße 6.
It was sympathy at first glance when the Felstehausens years ago met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll, who is currently completing her specialist training at the Verdener Hospital and also wants to enter the practice next year.
"We always had in mind that the Müllers would fit well in this practice," says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen and laughs.
"When it was time, I just called her."
The Müller couple liked the idea of running their own practice in Asendorf in the future.
"The proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us," says the 39-year-old Müller.
"We want to get to know and accompany the families over the years."
He also sees the advantage of being his own boss soon.
And so they agreed, the Müllers bought the house with the practice.
However, they will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
There, the two-time family father Frank Müller also grew up, his medical studies in Hanover followed stations in several medical practices as well as in the hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently working as a senior physician in Sulingen, and in 2009 he was appointed chief emergency physician in the district of Diepholz and volunteers in the DRK-Bereitschaft Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
Starting September 19, the practice will be prepared for the new boss.
While the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen works as a general practitioner, his wife Ursel (internist) specializes in gastroenterology.
The Müllers, both internists, want to settle down as general practitioners.
"The endoscopy is therefore coming out," says the 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongoll.
After the renovation, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long-term and stress ECGs and need a speaker room more.
In addition, the computer will be completely renewed.
The Müllers receive a grant of a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> 50,000 as part of a funding program from the county (25,000 euros) as well as from the Samtgemeinde (12,500 euros) and the municipality (12,500 euros).
"This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice continues," emphasizes velvet mayor Bernd Bormann.
According to Silvia Müller-Gongoll, around 2,000 patients come to the Felstehausen practice every quarter, in the northern German average there are about 500.
In Asendorf there is another general practitioner's office.
A positive side effect of the practice takeover by Frank Müller: The pharmacy remains in Asendorf, according to Ursel Felstehausen.
If she hadn’t found a successor, she would have gone.
By the way, those who visit Müller’s consulting session continue to look in familiar faces: the seven medical specialists and the cleaning staff of the Felstehausens take over.
With their farewell, an era ends in Asendorf, after all, the physicians have practiced there for 30 years.
"In the beginning, we only had two rooms," Ursel Felstehausen remembers with a smile.
She feels a little sad after a long time.
"But we continue to live in Hohenmoor and will certainly see many patients often," says the internist.
Her husband adds, laughing: "We have a 6,000-square-foot property."
"So far I've always pushed myself in front of gardening, now it could be different".
The couple also have two grandchildren and like to travel.
Croatia: "We are letting the refugees through"
"Now border controls will also be lifted at our southern border," Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner said.
Controls at the Hungarian border are maintained in parallel.
It is still clear that anyone who wants to make an asylum application can also do so "of course".
The care and safety of people is paramount.
But it is also clear that “clear signals are needed,” the minister said.
People need to know that we do not accept borderless migration flows, even across the Austrian-Slovenian border.
It needs a controlled approach.
Croatia considers "corridor" - Slovenia denied
The Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would also allow arriving refugees to travel further towards Austria and Germany and possibly also build corridors for the refugees.
However, this was not the view of Interior Minister Vesna Györkös Znidar in Ljubljana.
The idea of corridors is "absolutely unacceptable", Slovenia will intensify border surveillance, especially with Hungary.
The border with Croatia, on the other hand, is already heavily controlled as the external border of the Schengen area.
As the minister stressed, Slovenia does not want to lock its borders for refugees.
"Every EU member must fulfil his obligations, otherwise the system will not work," Györkös Znidar said.
As the Croatian government said, the first refugees had already attempted to pass the Tovarnik/Sid border crossing in the night hours of Tuesday to evade registration.
The Croatian police were able to pick them up in the nearby cornfields.
According to local media, police vehicles with new refugees have been coming in to Tovarnik, Croatia.
They are mainly Syrians and Afghans, including many women and children.
Emergency services and the Red Cross are also in operation.
In the coming days, his country is expecting about 4,000 refugees, Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic said.
In addition, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had previously taken migrants to the Hungarian border, were diverted to Croatia, Croatian and Serbian media reported on Wednesday.
However, the government in Belgrade denied that it was instructing people to take certain routes: "We can't, nor do we want to do this," it said.
According to media reports, a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border city of Sid in the morning, and more buses were expected during the day.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The occupants had been traveling through Serbia all night from the Macedonian border, about 500 kilometers away.
"We heard that Hungary closed, so the police told us to drive here," one of the refugees said.
They wanted to travel through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria further to Germany.
This could in fact lead to a shift in the current Balkan route Turkey-Greece-Macedonia-Serbia-Hungary, already predicted by observers, to a slightly further west.
Croatia: "Extensive possibilities for border control"
Croatian Interior Minister Ostojic had previously stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influx of refugees.
He did not mention details, but pointed out that Croatia, as a non-Schengen member, has "extensive options for border control".
Strict controls are being carried out to qualify for membership of the Schengen area.
Slovenia has been a member of this group since 2007, and the EU partners have consistently given the country a good testimony as regards the standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side, some 300 refugees remain trapped behind the Hungarian border fence.
According to Belgrade media reports, they spent last night at the Horgos border crossing, which leads to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely closed.
Whether the remaining refugees will continue to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic attempted to calm down the debate on alternative routes for refugees after the Hungarian border is closed.
It would not be a very high number of refugees at the moment.
It is not yet possible to say whether they would continue their journey via Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Helpers advise migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugee aid workers have already started to distribute maps to refugees on which alternative routes through Croatia are marked.
However, the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless: parts of the border area still have minefields that have not been cleared even 20 years after the end of the Croatian war.
On Wednesday afternoon, Croatian police announced that a team of mine clearers had been sent to the border region.
Stock market hacker: Ukrainians pay $30 million
Supranonok is said to have been a member of a group of cybercriminals accused of repeatedly gaining insight into unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire since 2010.
The information obtained is said to have been used to make insider deals in the financial markets.
According to the investigators, this resulted in a total of over $100 million.
"Today's comparison shows that even those outside our country's borders are ultimately caught," the SEC said in a statement.
The trials against 32 other accused in the case continued.
Most of the defendants are from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators are said to have acted in both the United States and Eastern Europe.
Ecumenical Hospice Aid Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years
Around the Mannheimer Paradeplatz there is a lot of activity.
People do their errands, partly quick steps, partly cozy strolling.
They control the two stations of the Mannheim Autosalon at Paradeplatz.
Stop the city trains.
A vibrant, lively life with a beautiful autumn sunshine and four large panels in the middle each with the title "Before I die I want"....
With this action, the Ecumenical Hospice Aid has drawn attention to its 20-year existence and is quite confronted with mixed reactions.
“It’s about life, so we went into the city and among the people with the action,” says Josefine Lammer.
The head of the Ecumenical Hospice Assistance is available to the passers-by for questions and discussions as well as the volunteer staff.
While some passersby spontaneously approach the chalk and add the phrase "yes to my life", "can read", "drive the camper through the US", "stop the war" or "don't suffer for long", others stop for a short time, read, say phrases like "I'm not that far yet" and then go on.
Again and again, small discussions develop on the margins about the action itself, about life, how to deal with dying.
Peter Hübinger is also on site.
“Only when I realize that the end of this world will come for me, can I live responsibly,” says the director of the Diaconal Works Mannheim, which together with the Caritas Association is the sponsor of the Ecumenical Hospice Aid.
Therefore, this public action is good for the 20-year-old.
That not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the boards, however, is understandable, after all, it is a very personal matter.
According to Josefine Lammer’s experience, the subject of death and dying is still taboo, although the hospice movement in recent years has contributed a great deal to the opening up of people.
An assessment that Angelika Godefroid shares.
The death and mourning companion is one of the volunteers of the first hour.
Faced with the topic through personal experience, she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in euthanasia.
When the Ecumenical Hospice Service called for volunteers, she immediately reported and was there when she was founded in 1995.
Godefroid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - who accompany the affected and relatives in private households, hospitals, nursing homes and the hospice of Saint Vincent.
They are all carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid can handle her task well and the experiences and experiences made in the process.
"I see life from another perspective, consider it precious and appreciate the moment," she says.
The offer of the outpatient Ecumenical Hospice Service is free of charge and independent of denomination.
The financial support of health insurance and donations from relatives and associations enables the training as well as further training and supervision of the death and mourning companions.
Training for new employees is offered every two years.
The tables described on Saturday are now on display in the House of the Evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the House of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
There, too, other personal wishes can be noted on postcards.
FedEx results mixed, financial outlook lowered for 2016
FedEx reported disappointing results for the last quarter, and the delivery giant lowered its earnings outlook to a full year due to weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transportation service.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
At this point last year, FedEx announced that it plans to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
The stock fell over 2.5 percent in premarket trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said to make a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year ending next May, 20 cents less than the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to a FactSet survey.
The lower prospect comes despite the price increases, which are on average 4.9 percent and will take effect on January 4th, and despite higher surcharges for ground transport of heavy and large parcels, which will be levied from November.
The company said it still expects earnings to rise year-on-year due to cost reductions, higher revenues and growth in online trading.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company is “producing solid returns when considering weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade.”
The plans for the holiday employment were announced a day later than that of rival UPS, which plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, roughly the same number as last year.
In the quarter ending August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than in the previous year.
Earnings per share amounted to $2.42 per share, just behind the $2.44 per share predicted by twelve analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.
Sales increased by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zack expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has seen a decline in international priority shipments over the past few years, which has stagnated sales in its express shipment unit.
But the boom in online shopping has boosted results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, sales of ground transportation increased by 29 percent, but operating profit was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The Express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while earnings declined due to higher labor costs in the freight business.
In premarket trading, about an hour before the opening, FedEx stocks dropped by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
On Tuesday, they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11.
At their most anticipated meeting in the year, Federal Reserve strategists spend two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduras mahogany table to decide if it’s time to raise the policy rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
Threatening above them at one end of the decorated, two-story meeting room is a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Fed Chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are supposed to put the economic interests of the nation above all other things.
The central bank has a dual mandate from Congress: to maximize U.S. employment and keep prices here stable.
But since the Great Recession, the Fed leaders have recognized that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X-Factor in a decision too narrow to predict. It will be announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to start being weaned from the unprecedented incentive of the near-zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Although most of the economy’s data shows it’s growing solidly, recent turbulence in global financial markets could make the already cautious Fed representatives anxious to amplify this volatility by raising the interest rate on federal bonds — even by just a quarter of a percentage point.
"Obviously, the labor market and inflation will be the most important thing they are watching," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economics officer at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise the interest rate, the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to keep waiting," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself uncertaints the financial market.
About half of the economists surveyed recently by Bloomberg have predicted a rate hike this week.
However, financial markets expect the Fed to wait, with a key indicator indicating only a 30% chance of an increase.
This indicates a fall in the stock market if the Fed raises the rate, unless the strategists mitigate the blow by promising that another increase is far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial average jumped by 228.89 points or 1.4% to 16,599.85.
The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed’s policies will maintain the rate this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody’s Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed would raise the rates at this point," he said.
If she does, “she would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so they don’t panic.”
Other experts argued that a rate hike would calm financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed on track to raise the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of the US recovery.
Yellen had said in spring and early summer that she expects an increase in the rate this year despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress would be needed.
Although job creation slowed down in August, the improvement in the labour market this year was solid.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years and close to the level the Fed sees as full employment.
Salary increases have shown signs of recovery.
And although inflation was constantly below the central bank’s annual target of 2%, Fed representatives said the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tightening of the labor market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world shrank at the end of last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial average fell more than 16% below its peak in May, when investors feared a slowdown in the Chinese economy would thwart global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, with the Dow now almost 10% below the May high.
For the Fed representatives, market turbulence affects the complex calculation of when to increase interest rates.
“If the events in the financial markets and the news of the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks, they would have pulled the reins in this session,” said Stephen D. Oliner, a senior research fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former US Federal Reserve employee.
Now he predicts that she will wait at least a month to better manage the effects.
“There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the U.S. economy, and there is almost no reliable data describing developments in China,” Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is not one of the Fed’s main concerns, so it should not be technically included in its decision-making.
But in the end, the Fed has become the world’s monetary authority.
The influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years.
The mere indication by then-leader Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could “tighten” its monetary expansion sparked confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed representatives can be expected not only to monitor developments elsewhere, but also to consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
Their decision-making is “more art than science,” said Zachary Karabell, head of global asset management strategy at Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA, noted this month that "the Fed has a history of overreaction to financial market movements that seem to be unrelated to economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, who advocates an interest rate hike, cited decisions in 1998/1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to lower its policy rate by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions “despite limited noticeable impact on U.S. growth,” Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials reversed these cuts.
The Fed should put aspects of financial stability first only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market collapse, said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England Interest Rate Setting Committee.
The recent turbulences are not coming close to this level, he said.
“She certainly doesn’t want to get into a situation where she’s afraid of an interest rate hike because markets are getting upset,” said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that is changed, I don’t think it should be ahead of time.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/stock was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C is often referred to as Thai Costco and is a Thai wholesale market that also sells to the general public.
Yeah, it's in Chinatown, not Thai Town.
The market / warehouse is a central point of contact and offers a confusing number of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and dishes, furniture, religious jewelry and Christmas decorations.
There is even a car department if you need engine oil.
The store is huge, and it takes over an hour to stroll through the hallways.
If the whole shop makes you hungry, there is a meal for you at the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The cooking kitchen (good and inexpensive) in this store is located near the cash registers and has various take-away options.
What's here: Do you need something - anything - Thai?
LAX-C probably has it.
Products are inexpensive and a number of them are sold in large quantities.
Fresh products include Asian specialties and regional Thai herbs, fruits and much more.
The meat counter is extensive, as is the fish counter - the staff behind the counter will clean and file the fish and even fry for you if desired.
A good part of the store belongs to the massive freezer department, where you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and gallant, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and bile, pork intestine, fish balls, regional sausages, commercially prepared foods and more.
Who buys here: restaurant owners and chefs, also individual families and individuals.
The wide aisles are suitable for shopping carts and forklifts.
You will find here: fresh Monthong Durian next to the checkout.
Where it is located: The store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the outskirts of Chinatown and downtown - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking area, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even if the shop is well frequented, it is not difficult to find a parking lot.
Hoyerswerda: Small life support for refugees
More and more refugees are arriving in Germany these days.
To provide you with a warm welcome is not possible without the involvement of countless volunteers.
Also in Hoyerswerda there are a whole number of people who unselfishly support asylum seekers in the city.
Among them are Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with body and soul.
Even with her 74 lens she still likes to teach.
Every Thursday she does it in the asylum-seekers’ home on Dillinger Straße.
There she helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language.
Of course, this is a completely different lesson than in a real school.
Brazil's pediatric society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS tries to shockingly educate women about the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding by presenting images of babies sucking on breasts painted with representations of unhealthy foods.
Breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins, and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that a higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet for pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can negatively affect the immune system.
Exceptions for the new Bernrieder Sporthalle
The municipal council Bernried approved the construction application for the 2.3 million euro sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof may be flatter for solar installation.
The planning for the long-awaited gym building at the Bernried sports grounds is progressing step by step: In the most recent municipal council meeting, the drafted building application was unanimously approved without major discussions.
Previously, the committee had, among other things, decided on an application for a construction law "exception" or "exemption" from the valid construction plan.
The "exception" was about the permission for a special form regarding the roof construction.
Accordingly, a "saddle roof with non-middle first and roof overhang" is to be erected.
The background of the planning is the intended use of the roof area for solar systems: "This will bring us together a wonderfully large south roof", Mayor Josef Steigenberger explained in the meeting.
The "liberation" was again about the inclination of the roof, which, for energy reasons, is supposed to be below ten degrees - unlike the plan prescribed in the construction plan.
The volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced.
An "exemption" was necessary because the development plan does not allow "exceptions" regarding the inclination of the roof - whereby the Bernried municipal council usually acts rather restrictively in the case of exemption applications.
However, this is not a recurring project when it comes to gymnastics: "We are not setting a precedent", says Steigenberger.
The gym building at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and the SV Bernried.
Approximately 2.3 million euros are included in the costs.
Subsidies are expected from school and broad-based sports funding.
In the next process step, the building application for the 18 x 36 meter large hall is now submitted to the County Council for examination.
Klinik Peißenberg moves to Schongau
The Peißenberg hospital is scheduled to close earlier than planned - namely in 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) becomes the new medical director at the Schongau Hospital.
The station and the majority of the employees move from Peißenberg to Schongau.
This is what the surprising plans of the district’s hospital GmbH provide, which was confirmed by provincial councillor Andrea Jochner-Weiß.
However, the Supervisory Board will take a decision on this, and it will meet next Wednesday, September 23.
If the plans were to be implemented, all of the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in Peißenberg would continue to be employed.
The vast majority would move to Schongau with Fischer and the still existing Inner Station.
The rooms are available.
According to Jochner-Weiß, employees who cannot come to Schongau will be offered a job in Weilheim.
Employees are informed about the plans.
The change has triggered the dismissal of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only been the medical director of the Schongau Clinic since the beginning of the year and is now switching to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.
On the question of who should succeed, according to Jochner-Weiß, the name "Fischer" came into play, who agreed to take the lead from 1 October and change with his team to Schongau.
For the house in Schongau, this in any case means an "upgrade" and a broadening of the offer in the area of "inner medicine", according to Jochner-Weiß.
Fischer is a specialist in pacemakers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) specializes in gastroenterological diseases at the Inner Station.
If the Supervisory Board agrees, Fischer and his team will manage both houses on a transitional basis for the next two years, until next year the former hospital of the Knappschaft, which still has 35 beds, is to be finally closed in Peißenberg after almost 140 years.
So far, the county had planned this for 2018, when the ongoing renovation at Weilheim Hospital is completed.
Landratin Jochner-Weiß, who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board, countered rumours that the house, which is owned by the federal shortage, will in future be used as a shelter for asylum seekers.
Jochner-Weiß could not say that there are several considerations as to how the property proceeds.
Currently there is a short-term care of the Caritas and a day psychiatry housed there.
"What could not have happened to us better, such an opportunity will not come back," said Fischer about the quasi-relocation to the Lech, which had been received by the employees "positively and very understanding".
There was no real perspective for the house, where Fischer has been working as chief physician for more than 30 years.
He was asked by Schongauer colleagues to take over the position of medical director.
In recent decades, the Peißenberg hospital (formerly 100 beds) has been threatened with closure, and departments have been closed, such as surgery and obstetrics.
The handballers of the Rhine-Neckar lions are challenged tonight (20.15) at the Bergischen HC.
The leader of the Bundesliga is the clear favourite in Wuppertal, but there is no reason for arrogance.
Last season the Badeners suffered a painful defeat at the BHC and have something to make up for.
Hunting accident with two injured at Pratau
Two tractor drivers were seriously injured by gunshots during their corn harvest on Tuesday afternoon.
During the harvesting on a cornfield near Pratau (Wittenberg county), several hunters were deployed, the police said.
After a shooting, a 63- and a 22-year-old man suffered serious injuries and were taken to hospitals.
How exactly the accident could have happened was unclear at first.
The criminal police are investigating.
Missing 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate victim of violent crime
A suspect has led the police to the body of the missing 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate since Saturday.
In the interrogation, the 20-year-old admitted to killing the youngsters and throwing their body into a canal in Rockenhausen.
A missing 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate has been the victim of a violent crime since Saturday.
The body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rockenhausen near Kaiserslautern, as prosecutors and police announced on Wednesday.
The suspect is a 20-year-old man who was also arrested on Tuesday night, who confessed to the crime and led the investigators to the location of the body.
The 16-year-old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after she had not returned home as agreed on the eve after a visit to an autumn festival in Rockenhausen.
In searching for the young woman, the investigators first encountered the victim’s personal belongings.
When interviews in the circle of friends and acquaintances of the missing people finally resulted in a suspected act against the 20-year-old.
The suspect then led the police to a canal in Rockenhausen where the body was found.
The detainee, according to the authorities in the police interrogation, admitted to killing the 16-year-old and putting the body in the canal.
The 20-year-old was scheduled to be brought to trial on Wednesday, and the investigators charge him with homicide.
Further information on the circumstances of the incident will be provided by the investigation.
Refugees Need Housing: Study Warns of Housing Gap
The situation in the German housing market is tense.
More and more refugees are also seeking affordable accommodation.
Pressure on the housing market is growing.
Social housing is facing a challenge.
The distribution struggles in the German housing market have long since begun.
With the arrival of refugees and job seekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing into a market that is already overloaded in many big cities.
They are competing with low-income citizens for the last affordable housing.
To meet the demand for affordable housing, 400,000 new units would have to be built each year by 2020.
This is the result of a study commissioned by the association "Social Housing".
For comparison, 260,000 units will be completed in Germany this year.
There are 140,000 homes missing.
After the first three months of their stay, refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in a first-admission accommodation.
Many then bump into the housing market and line up in the long queues in front of the rental apartments.
However, according to the Federal Statistical Office, less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent last year.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising number of refugees.
The study also highlights significant omissions in housing policy in recent years.
Germany is pushing ahead with a housing deficit that increases from year to year.
Currently, around 770,000 housing units are missing in the metropolitan areas, complains Matthias Günther, author of the study.
Many professionals therefore lived in large cities in shared rooms.
Young adults involuntarily stayed longer in the "Hotel Mama" because of the quietness of the housing market.
In the major cities, the number of square meters per capita has declined for the first time in recent years.
To solve the problem, the alliance "Social Housing" proposes a restart.
New incentives are expected to relaunch social housing.
In this way, the property tax could be waived and the property tax for subsidised dwellings suspended for a period of time.
In addition, according to the alliance, attractive tax depreciation options are needed.
The State Bank KfW’s support programme for refugee shelters is already being well received by cities and municipalities.
A good week after the launch, more than half of the approximately 300 million euros available had already been called up on Monday evening with 184 million euros.
Now the project could even be expanded.
Croatia and Slovenia set up corridor for refugees
After Hungary, there is virtually no passing through, as more and more refugees choose the way through Croatia.
Zagreb announces that it will grant transit through Slovenia to the north without any hurdles.
However, the route is dangerous.
Croatia wants to reach an agreement with neighbouring Slovenia on the creation of a corridor for refugees.
"I spoke with the Slovenian interior minister and if necessary, we will organize a corridor," Croatian interior minister Ranko Ostojic said.
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone.
The EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
After the closure of the Serbian-Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees have left for Croatia to reach Western Europe.
500 people have crossed the border near Tovarnik, reports the Croatian television channel RTL.
Hungary closed its border to refugees the day before.
In addition, new laws that came into force on the same day make ordinary asylum procedures in Hungary virtually superfluous.
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass.
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: "You can pass through, and we are preparing for this opportunity."
These people are there, it’s women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
However, there are people who did not want to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police had picked up the first refugees on the border of Serbia to the EU neighbouring Croatia in the morning.
According to media reports, most came from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They came to the Serbian border town of Sid both by bus and by taxi.
Immediately after their arrival, they tried to cross the green border on foot to Croatia.
At the Croatian-Serbian border, the refugees do not encounter border fences.
The border strip presents other dangers: there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav civil war in the 1990s.
Mine clearers should now quickly create a safe passage.
However, after the closure of the border, there are hardly any more refugees coming to Hungary.
On Tuesday, police counted 366 people arrested.
Shortly before the gate closed on Monday, there were still 9,380.
The new Hungarian laws classify overcoming and damaging the border fence as a criminal offence.
In the southern Hungarian border city of Szeged, 35 criminal proceedings were initiated.
The convicts face prison sentences of up to five years and deportation from the country.
According to the immigration authority, a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the newly established "transit zones" at the border, almost all of them - 93 - the most important transition Röszke.
Among the applicants are 13 families with young children and two elderly people.
On Wednesday morning, 40 refugees stayed there.
In practice, however, no one has the prospect of being granted asylum in Hungary.
In Hungary's view, Serbia is a "safe third country".
Refused asylum seekers will be deported there.
Only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the "transit zone" in Röszke.
In Röszke, workers started cleaning it up.
They collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people had left on the roadside in recent weeks.
Locking grids were removed and one of the reception camps in the border town was rebuilt.
No one wanted to comment on the aim of this restructuring.
After the closure of the Serbian-Hungarian border, only a few refugees remain in Austria.
The country has also strengthened its border controls.
Around 20,000 migrants were still in the country, according to government reports.
In Salzburg, about 1,400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany.
Train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on orders from German authorities.
In Freilassing, smaller groups of refugees regularly arrived on foot.
Mayor drove "stranded" across the border
"We were busy cleaning up after the bridge festival on Sunday, when suddenly ten people with suitcases stood at the entrance of the tent," said Wernstein's mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted to take the train to Passau.
However, because on Sunday Germany had surprisingly stopped rail traffic with Austria due to the flow of refugees, they had stopped in Wernstein," says Stadler, who immediately offered his help and drove the stranded people along with two other helpers and their cars across the border to Nahe Passau.
Previously, we had the unexpected guests first tasted, with snacks and drinks.
We said we'd take her to Passau by car.
"That was a matter of course for us," Stadler said in the O<0xC3><0x96>N talk.
They were very grateful.
One man couldn’t take it away from handing over a generous donation – 100 euros for the fire department.
"We were very pleased," said Stadler.
The stranded train passengers had switched from an ICE to a regional train in the direction of Passau on Sunday evening in Wels, in order to try it after the short-term announcement that the rail traffic to Germany was stopped, but still across the border.
However, the regional train was stopped in front of the border in Wernstein am Inn.
In Wernstein, the cross-border is generally high in course.
The bridge festival connected with the Bavarian neighbors on Sunday sociably, the day before a two-bridge run sportily - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bavaria from Neukirchen.
The fact that Viktor Orbán is now sending tens of thousands more to us is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Rather than immediately assisting in the Röszke camp with the establishment of structures that guarantee humanity, our Federal Chancellor has highly officially and publicly moved the attitude of the Hungarian government into the fog circle of National Socialism.
The sufferers of this policy are not only those Austrians who now face chaotic conditions in the border areas.
Refugees will also have to find that the “promised land” they have invited and welcomed is nothing more than another refugee camp.
It will be a major challenge to establish decent conditions for refugees in our homes in the face of ongoing refugee flows and the approaching winter.
And it will be an even greater one – to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad in search of 35,000 winter-proof quarters
Konrad has a lot to do with the refugee shelter.
Christian Konrad is used to saying that his word has weight.
The government has used the former powerful Raiffeisen banker to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees.
The chaos in the first recording center in Traiskirchen has already been handled by Konrad.
"We no longer have homeless people in Traiskirchen," he reported on his first success.
The accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday was also done without much fuss, Konrad said, praising the organizational "master achievement".
The Ministry of the Interior, on the other hand, spoke of a “crisis situation.”
In total, Konrad expects a demand of 85,000 quarters this year.
In order to meet the number, 35,000 accommodations will have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 will be provided by the states, 15,000 by the federal government.
If there are more refugees, we can do it.
"But it's not a barrel without a floor," Konrad said.
He has already had talks with the country’s leaders.
This would have assured him that he would also create shelters for the future refugees.
"In Upper Austria, things are going well," said Ferry Maier.
The former VP-Mandatar supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn to clarify how the Church will help.
The asylum coordinator also places great expectations in the ORF action "Helfen wie wir".
On the platform, individuals can easily offer accommodation.
There are also hotels that are empty in the winter.
Konrad and Maier yesterday criticized the standards for accommodation as "very high".
In times of emergency, it could not be that district administrators have to comply with a certain amount of towel holders or size of skylights.
For a limited period of time, "emergency standards" should apply.
In contrast to the Ministry of the Interior, Konrad justifies the fact that he is more successful in accommodation with his experience.
I am an elderly gentleman who is not easily told the untruth in the face.
Persuasion is his most important weapon.
Konrad and Maier do not incur any costs to the Republic, as they themselves explained.
They want to increase their number of employees to three to four.
The search for your own neighborhood has not yet been successful.
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephansplatz as an office.
However, there are apparently problems with approval.
Linz calls for a better division
For the time being, the city of Linz is planning no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips-Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees.
This is not necessary at the moment, as people can be accommodated without these measures, says mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
However, in the event of an emergency, additional locations should be checked for their suitability.
The city chief is critical of the distribution of refugees within the federal state.
Other districts also have to make their contribution here.
Seehofer: "Borders are not locked"
In a prolonged telephone conversation with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), Landeshauptmann Josef Pühringer (VP) agreed on Monday on the further procedure on the refugee issue.
Seehofer assured me that the German borders would not be closed.
The continued travel of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible.
However, there are now the corresponding border controls.
There will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany for the time being.
However, those seeking protection would be brought to Germany by regular trains.
Pühringer once again called for stronger solidarity on the refugee issue.
For Pühringer, the fact that Austria is now also reintroducing controls at its borders is "a logical consequence" of the action taken by the Germans.
The next Runtastic is a matter of time
The general renovation of the "New Shipyard" in the Linz industrial line is officially completed.
The listed IT group S&T has moved into four of the six floors of the office and production building, while the rest (2,700 square meters) will be leased to young, innovative technology companies.
"In IT, the smart minds are our raw material - and we have to try to make them work for us," says S&T CEO Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine investing in startup companies of the Neue Werft and later also acquiring some.
From the very beginning, S&T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - something Niederhauser promises himself: "The next Runtastic is only a matter of time".
S&T invested <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.7 million in the site, <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.3 million from the Techcenter, which belongs to one-third of the city of Linz, the state of Upper Austria and the federal government (FFG).
The building has been leased by Linz AG to S&T and Techcenter for 60 years.
30 percent of the 2,700 square meters of remaining space in the building have already been rented out, for another 40 percent there are requests.
Lia Peroni owner opens second store in the arcade
Furla handbags are the focus of the new shop.
In fact, Jutta Breit wanted to get a dog.
The 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni had to postpone this project in the pigeon market arcade: finally, she has now gained growth in the form of another business premises.
In the Furla shop opposite the shop, where she sells bags, suitcases, shoes and clothes from various manufacturers, everything now revolves around women's handbags of the brand Furla, wallets are available from 75 euros.
Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
The new shop has been in operation since yesterday.
Previously, several weeks had been rebuilt.
"But I've been thinking for a long time about opening another store," says Breit.
The decisive factor for the decision was, among other things, that the Furla producers, who are at home in Bologna, were also impressed by the idea of their own location, where only their handbags are sold.
"We are the only ones in the Greater Linz area who sell this brand," says the mother of two daughters, who herself has Italian roots.
Her fashion interest has been broadly put in the cradle by her mother.
I am most suited when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices.
Why so many women fall into excitement at the sight of a beautiful handbag, even the expert can not answer with the last certainty.
Maybe it’s because a nice bag enhances any outfit.
The Brulljesmacher from Kallstadt
The Palatine ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place whose inhabitants are called the givers.
Some people also associate this with the billionaire who wants to become president of the United States.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for excitement.
Whether he expresses himself xenophobic, attacks journalists rudely or reveals knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office stirs up the election campaign vigorously.
And it cuts well.
This is also registered in the Palatinate Kallstadt, where the grandparents of the real estate billionaire came from.
The New Yorker with the hair dryer is a concept for many in the wine-growing village on the wine road.
Some in the 1200-inhabitant place is over -zig corners related to it.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Palatinate: Donald Trump, here in campaign mode.
Simone Wendel made a film about Trump.
And what do the villagers think about his goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world?
"I think they find this somehow exciting, but are not as deeply impressed in their Kallstadt style," says Simone Wendel.
The native Kallstädter filmed an amusing documentary about the place and its famous offspring, including Trump and the Heinz Ketchup family.
Trump, who is not known for modesty, also speaks in "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014) - saying that he would surely be successful if he lived in Kallstadt.
He did not bring it there to the King of Hearts.
While there is respect for the performance of the family, there is also a tendency to think that Trump is “a bit of a big mouth,” says Wendel.
Accidentally, the nickname that Kallstadt has in the vicinity is "Die Brulljesmacher" - to Hochdeutsch: die Spender, she says.
So Trump comes from the village of the givers.
The Trump success story began in 1885, when his later grandfather emigrated and opened a gold mining venue in the United States.
The foundation stone of the real estate group was the first land purchases in New York.
But the life of the grandparents was not free from tragedy: their desire to return to their homeland in the long term failed in the Bavarian state, to which the Palatinate belonged at the time.
He did not accept Trump because he once ran away without permission, the director of the Institute of Palatine History and Folklore, Roland Paul, had declared the film launch.
Trump is the grandson of an "illegal emigrant".
This contrasts with the sometimes striking statements of the descendants.
He had repeatedly spoken detestably about Mexican immigrants in the U.S. and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.
“Just as he’s poltering, that’s not so sympathetic,” says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative of Trump (“The grandmother was a born Trump, the grandfather was born Heinz”).
The retired winemaker sees the American more distantly, "he's always so upsetting."
Does he think Trump will come?
"I can't imagine that," said the 72-year-old.
"He never cared about Kallstadt".
Pension manager Veronika Schramm mentions, like some Kallstadters, that a descendant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit, which was generally well received.
"I can't imagine that from Donald," says the 68-year-old.
She would think it would be better if he didn’t win the election, because “he has such radical views, I don’t know if that’s good.”
If those who were in charge in the United States at the time of his grandfather had been like him, "he would never have arrived there."
"There are more interesting topics than him," says winegrower daughter Sarah Bühler.
And as president?
"It's not my president," she says.
“The grapes will ripen even without President Trump.”
Wendel’s film, for which Trump has been interviewed for a long time, has seen 12,000 cinema goers, even in the United States.
The Upper Bavarian municipality of Ramsau near Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "Bergsteigerdorf".
From the hand of the vice-president of the German Alpine Association, Ludwig Wucherpfennig, the 1800-resident village in Berchtesgaden National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday.
There are already 20 "mountain climbing villages" in Austria.
In the neighbouring country, the Alpine Association is responsible for awarding the award.
A "mountain climbing village" may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants.
At least one-fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates reviews despite Nine's attempts to take on the loss of leadership on Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson rush to Canberra to report on the loss of the Liberal leadership, but there hasn’t been a major shift in today’s reviews.
Nine's breakfast show was broadcast from the federal capital when Malcolm Turnbull succeeded in overthrowing Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise, with presenters David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was in London as part of a week-long series of international television shows, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage of the distance did not seem to matter to Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise averaged 397,000 viewers at the five capitals, compared to Today 339,000.
Today scored a slight increase over the ratings for Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its number lagged behind that of last Thursday (343,000).
Today has closed the gap to Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today averaged 318,000 compared to Sunrise’s 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise has averaged 349,000 viewers to 314,000 on Today.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change affect these morning people more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for the review!

The big news for Seven was the impressive 800-word debut with the former series star of Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father who decides to settle on the coast of New Zealand with his two children reached a very impressive number of 1,219 million spectators.
Critics had wondered if Thomson could wear a hit show solo without the Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night answered this with a clear yes.
The X-Factor by Seven remained strong with 1.136 million viewers, easily beating The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven had mixed results on evening two of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 17:30) of the new quiz show, moderated by Andrew O'Keefe, resulted in an average of 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (5:30 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.) jumped to 623,000 spectators – enough for a small win over Eddie McGuire’s hot seat (613,000).
On Monday night, The Chase Australia’s first half hour reached 520,000 spectators, and in the second half hour, a staggering 720,000.
Hot-seat average 620,000.
The drop in the odds of the second evening of The Chase Australia will give Nine confidence that Hot-Seat will eventually prevail at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for Million Dollar Minute that failed to outperform McGuire’s show.

The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Secret Revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may unknowingly have apparently who wins The Bachelor.
The woman where Sam Wood finally lands in The Bachelor was enveloped in utmost secrecy.
And none of the three girls left will certainly not reveal whether she was the one who received the last rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski, and Lana Jeavons fellows the day before becoming out of three, you might have accidentally given a clue as to who will be the winner.
Sam Wood holds his lips tightly sealed until the final on Thursday
All three women have lyrically misunderstood why Wood is the perfect man, citing his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive attitude as reasons why they want to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked "If not you, who should get Wood's last rose?", their answers could turn into the game spoiler who won the heart of the bachelor.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski both quickly named Mackay as the best partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from day one.
"From the moment I walked into the house and noticed (Sarah's) and Sam's energies, I felt they were pretty compatible, and I've thought of that throughout the show," said Jeavions Fellows.
"Sarah stands on the ground with both feet, it's so much fun to be with her," Markoski added.
I saw them together, and they have the right chemistry.
They feel comfortable and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple.
From her point of view, Mackay said last week’s home visit made it clear that Wood could be “the one.”
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that obviously this is not just a game - I'm now unreservedly tuned to him," she said.
And when she was asked who Wood should choose, if not her, she was mysterious.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I love the remaining girls alike - it's a draw between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on Ten on Wednesday, 7:30 p.m.
Originally released as Sarah's first choice for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the U.S. - and there were many other teams sending inquiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a wise decision.
Some coaches would have banished Hayne to the bench for the rest of the game when he lost a fight like the Aussie rugby league convert did in his first punt return on Tuesday at the 20-3 win against Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity for a punt return and also into the ongoing game after an injury to Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the locker room after the game.
Instead of grinding his rookies through the mill in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly strengthened Hayne in his post-game press conference.
49ers sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget about his fake catch and take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne stumbles at a punt restored by the Minnesota Vikings in the first quarter
It certainly wasn’t the start Hayne and his massive Australian following had hoped for for his NFL debut.
Hayne left the field after the fumble swearing and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not imagine a worse start to his NFL career,
"That was a thing that happens, you just care about the next game, and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the carver to his Origin debut in 2007, when a pass in his own in-goal area led to a try for Queensland.
Overall, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posed for a photo with fans, holding an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia’s richest man, was arrested on a Siberian rolling field with gun violence.
After he openly challenged President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos confiscated, and his democratic efforts halted.
Free voters are demanding the recruitment of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees.
Party and faction leader Hubert Aiwanger warned at the beginning of the FW Autumn Clause in Großwallstadt of a serious crisis at Bavaria's schools, if there are not correspondingly new teachers for the many new students: "We need at least 1,000 additional teachers to save the schools from collapse," Aiwanger said.
"Otherwise, we will get rejections in the Bavarian education system."
The parliamentary group of the Free Electors will meet in the municipality of Lower Franconia until Friday.
In fact, very different main topics were planned.
But the record number of refugees now also dominates the Free Electoral Meeting.
"Of course, the issue of asylum will overlap the exam," Aiwanger said.
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN refugee protection zones in Syria, as they existed during the Yugoslav wars in the 1990s.
"That's not the way it goes, we have to deal with the causes," said the Free Electoral Chief.
Rejected asylum seekers want to deport the free voters as soon as possible.
Therefore, Aiwanger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum complaints: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges," Aiwanger said.
The FW chief criticized the fact that several federal states are not consistent: "We need federally uniform standards of the federal states."
"Bayern pushes off, others don't."
“We need to be more capable of action.”
But the state policy in Großwallstadt should not fall under the table.
A long-term burner remains on the agenda: education policy.
For the new school year, Minister of Culture Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) at 47 high schools has started the pilot experiment "middle level plus", in which an extension of the middle school from three to four years is tested - as a result, it then takes nine years again to graduate from high school.
But Aiwanger does not go far enough.
"The G9 issue needs to be accelerated," said the FW chief.
We call for freedom of choice for all high schools that want it.
Free ride with the G9 wherever desired.
Stronger Wall Street Helps Dax to Jump Up
The German stock market has closed with profits after a long-distance, directionless and nervous trading process.

Infineon stocks rose by a further 3.22% at the Dax peak.
According to a trader, a positive report from the US investor magazine "Barron's" posted this weekend.

4 people killed after police shoot rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets into a crowd demonstrating against the proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence erupted on Tuesday night in Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, Lead District Officer, said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside a police station, with some of them throwing stones and firebombs.
Mr. Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then fired in the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
Twenty policemen and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber bullets deployed, which are known to kill, but traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently produced such a high death rate.
The clash was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal’s southern plains, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say that new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.
There have also been protests in western Nepal by the ethnic group of the Tharus who want a state of their own.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been in violent clashes since the 10th century.
Killed August when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces – an important step towards a new constitution, but a highly controversial issue in Nepal that has been centrally governed for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been underway since 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process following the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
Legislators voted this week on certain clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu, and officials have said the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday.
Construction area planned in the city
The plot at the Emder Youth Centre Alte Post will be rebuilt.
The city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000-square-meter area.
A mix of trade, business and housing is planned - but there are no concrete offers yet.
Emden - The city of Emden intends to market an approximately 4,000-square-metre plot of land in the immediate vicinity of the Alte Post youth centre.
Preparations for this are currently underway.
It is planned to use the site for a mix of trade, commercial and residential.
You are waiting for the appropriate offers, it says on the part of the city.
Which investor is eligible is not yet clear.
Accordingly, no contracts have yet been concluded.
The city of Emden had already bought part of the property, which is located at the Ringstraße / corner Große Straße, a few months ago and had the building located on it demolished.
Project Hieve: Details are on the table
The plans for the holiday home settlement at the Small Sea near Emden are taking shape.
For the first time, the investor publicly presented plans for the project.
Several residents are still concerned - they fear the sale of their recreational refuge
For months, it had been negotiated, pondered, debated and drawn behind closed doors.
Now the plans for a new holiday home on the Small Sea near Emden are on the table.
The interested party, the medium-sized Emder company "System-Bau", presented its plans publicly for the first time on Monday evening at the Emder Council's Urban Development Committee.
This item was originally on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under pressure from the project critics and the FDP faction, who accused the investors and the administration of secretiveness, Ralf Behrends from the system construction management went into the offensive: "We do not yet have an answer to all questions," he said before the council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it is good to be able to face all the rumors now.
The project, which costs between 10 and 12 million euros, has been under discussion for months.
The images and new details about the desired hotel building evoked fierce reactions among sea bunker owners who had come to the meeting.
Roberto Schulz, owner of the sea bunker and member of the board of directors at the interest representative of the residents, Pro Hieve, complains: "This will be a giant block that outweighs all other buildings".
In addition, he fears, like many other project critics, that traffic would increase significantly due to the intended size of the plant: "There must be entire bus loads to make up for this," Schulz said.
What exactly happens on the well one hectare area of the former restaurant, however, is still open.
There is no operator yet.
"First we have to have a coherent concept," said Ralf Behrends.
Because this was still lacking, the development plans were still variable.
Twin offspring of gorillas at the Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo is delighted to see offspring of its gorillas.
26-year-old Dian gave birth to twins yesterday.
Twin births are rare in gorillas.
The last one in a German zoo is almost 50 years ago and was also in Frankfurt in 1967, according to the zoo.
The sex of the newborn gorilla twins has not yet been determined, as Mother Dian has so far held them tightly to the body.
First the "picture" had reported.
NHC predicts 60 percent chance of cyclone south of Cape Verde
The U.S. National Hurricane Center predicted a wide low-pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde islands on Tuesday, which has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical hurricane in the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined low-pressure system, roughly in the middle between the Cape Verdean Islands and the Small Antilles, also has a 60 percent potential to form a tropical hurricane in the next two days, the Miami-based weather experts added.
Google launches doubling donation campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL. O) announced a doubling donation campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have overrun European nations as they flee war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google has an unusually personal approach when announcing the donation call on its blog.
Instead of having a manager make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven years old, wrote about her personal experiences.
“Our journey included many dark train and bus rides, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear,” she wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe, many people like my family are desperately seeking help.
The donations go to four non-profit organizations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants: MSF, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million will be doubled on google.com/refugee relief to $11 million.
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For slightly overweight diabetics, weight loss surgery can be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes may last at least five years, according to a new study.
It is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatments.
“The mortality data takes a long time to show something,” said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on weight loss surgery, who wrote an editorial on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight-loss surgery or obesity surgery, use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body’s ability to absorb food.
Over the years, obesity surgery has proven to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted in people who are morbidly obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a certain amount of weight in terms of size, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from Taiwan’s Min-Sheng General Hospital used data they had collected in a study since 2007, comparing two types of obesity surgery—gastric bypass and gastric tube formation—to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI among those who underwent this surgery dropped from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in this study.
Meanwhile, the BMI in those who received non-surgical diabetes treatments remained approximately the same at 29.
Among those who underwent surgery, 36% had diabetes completely and 28% partially resolved.
In the medically treated group, diabetes resolved completely only at one percent and partly only at about two percent.
In addition, the results in blood pressure, triglycerides, and "bad" LDL cholesterol controls were "generally better in the 'surgical' group," the authors found.
The researchers also monitored patient blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c level dropped from around 9 percent to around 6 percent.
In the medical therapy group, however, it remained stable at about 8 percent.
But this better “glycemic control” — as reflected in the improved hemoglobin A1c level — did not reduce mortality in five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the bypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the gastrectomy group (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved greater decreases in BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%), and was more likely to have a complete overcoming of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
While the new study shows no survival benefit from surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese people who underwent obesity surgery were about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years — compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study showed no benefit for survival in surgical patients, Blackstone said it is reassuring for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the procedure.
"This is the critical point of this study because it says that this surgery is lower in this lower BMI group," with no increased risk of death or kidney disease, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient with their BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long to get people to take this seriously," she said.
I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have their bodies firmly linked to obesity and diabetes, a reversal is really hard."
Love story takes place in the Hunsrück
It is a subject that is currently getting more and more attention in fiction: a young woman, unpopular and unpleasant at school, meets the swarm of her youth after years, and he falls in love with her.
Also in the recently published novel "Actually we are not so" by Luisa Binder.
Beyond the love story, the novel should be especially interesting for Hunsrück readers, because it plays in boredom and the surrounding villages.
The full-time author grew up in Langeweiler and is delighted that she was able to set a literary monument to her hometown.
"It is impossible for anyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to ethics studies.
He called for the interests of humanity to be put before the interests of individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was admirable, but not appropriate to the situation.
"It is impossible for anyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany’s and Austria’s efforts to cope with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"Taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime, you need to think about long-term solutions to how real peace and real development, mainly through education, can be created for these Muslim countries," he said.
Ultimately, we need to think about how to reduce killings in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of violence.
"The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama addressed the issue of violence and also commented on George Bush’s actions following the 9/11 terrorist attack, noting that the US’s violent response drew a chain of uncontrollable events.
After September 11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solve this problem is through non-violence.
"I know his motives were good, but he used violence, and that has brought unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Four-fold increase in children taking hand sanitizers in the last 4 years
Poison control centers in the U.S. report an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of twelve who take heavily alcoholic hand sanitizers, according to the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, cases of hand disinfectant intake among children under the age of 12 reported by poison control centers rose from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children are getting these products more and more frequently, and unfortunately, a percentage of them end up going to the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children deliberately drink disinfectants while some do it to impress their friends or because of a test of courage on social media.
Videos on YouTube show how teens drink disinfectants just for a cheap experience.
Teenagers have allegedly mixed disinfectants with alcoholic mouthwash to get a harder drink.
Younger children can be attracted by attractive scents of disinfectants.
“A child doesn’t think this is bad for it,” Lopez said.
Many of the more attractive (hand disinfectants) are those that are perfumed.
There are disinfectants with strawberry, grape and orange scent that are very appealing to children.
Hand disinfectants contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in toddlers, a few splashes can lead to alcohol poisoning.
"It's highly concentrated alcohol," Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the poison emergency call center at the University of Kansas hospital, told Fox 4 in Kansa City.
So, you wouldn’t leave a sip of whiskey around, but people leave these hand disinfectants within reach of children, and if children get it, then it’s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently taken four splashes of strawberry-scented hand sanitizer at school, was taken to an emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice the threshold legally considered drunk in an adult, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room doctor who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta.
Nhaijah laughed at her words and was unable to walk when she arrived in the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children's hospital for signs of brain trauma because the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had slammed her head, Ritchey said.
"That was very scary," Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, told CNN.
It could have been deadly for my child.
Lopez has advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or disinfectant wipes and store hand disinfectants out of the reach of the child.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing hand sanitizers containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol, a lethal solution, rather than ethyl alcohol, which was listed as the active ingredient.
In January, three fourth grade students in New York State planned to poison their “common” teacher by laying antibacterial products around the classroom, according to a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand sanitizers and banished them from her room.
The police viewed the frustrated plan as "spoofing" and referred disciplinary measures to the school authority.
Villingen-Schwenningen: Three vehicles damaged
In a collision on the crossroads between Nordring and Auf Herdenen, a 33-year-old driver was slightly injured in a collision.
A 60-year-old truck driver drove on the crossroads in the direction of the roundabout industrial area and noticed too late that two vehicles ahead of him had stopped at the roundabout.
As a result, he crashed his truck into the rear of an Audi and pushed this vehicle onto a Ford Fiesta in front of it.
The vehicles involved in the accident suffered property damage of about 10,000 euros, the police said.
The 33-year-old’s Audi was no longer ready to drive and had to be towed.

Griffiths plays down talk about disharmony
There are rumors of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, which Griffiths spontaneously rejected, insisting that he and his teammates are not under increased control as they are preparing to confront the Dutch leader.
I don’t think we’re under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The lack of title competition in Scottish football bores Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic as there is no title rivalry with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently an ambassador for Ajax, said: "In Holland they no longer show highlights of Celtic games and why?"
It's because the Rangers aren't there.
People here aren't just talking about the return of the Rangers.
You're talking about the old firm.
They talk about both teams together and that’s what interests them.
There’s a lot of excitement in the old company games, and it’s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I will turn things around, Deila swears.
RONNY Deila has accepted that Celtic must fight, but the Norwegian boss vowed to turn things around.
Following the defeat of Malmö and subsequent elimination from the Champions League followed the defeat of 10-man from Aberdeen, who are now clearly at the top of the table with five points ahead.
Deila said, "Celtic had bad times before, and we'll be back."
Now we want to get out of there as soon as possible.
I know it’s very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what’s happening.
We feel that way, but we have to go on.
We really, really need the support of Celtic because that makes the players better.
Standing together now is so important.
Warburton cautiously on January transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago suggesting he was targeting some January transfers, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is cautious in signing new additions, insisting he doesn’t want to disrupt the Ibrox squad’s unity.
The former head of Brentford said, “The January transfer window is very different from the summer window.”
Players arriving this summer have this pre-season time to integrate what you’ve seen with our own group this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target Michu with withdrawal notice
Swansea striker Michu, talking to Celtic during the transfer period, has indicated that he could withdraw if his contract with the Swans expires.
The 29-year-old has been plagued with an annoying ankle for two years and hasn’t managed to leave Wales this summer.
Hearts set to SFA battle over Neilson's comments
The Hearts led 2:1 when Paterson was sent off the field and then lost 3:2, but the defender’s Red Card was later lifted – Collum’s third Red Card, which was revoked in eight months.
Neilson sticks to what he said, insisting, "I haven't questioned integrity, I haven't commented on performance."
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
The incorrigible Hibee was rebuked after he admitted to singing a song with offensive lyrics about ex-hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred at a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh in front of an Edinburgh derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a derby, and it was the heat of the moment," the forward said, adding, "It's safe to say that I won't be returning to Tynecastle unless it plays for Celtic Glasgow."
Tannadice Supervisory Board has confidence in Dundee-United management
Simon Donnelly insists that Dundee United's board still has confidence in the management team to turn things around - but admits that the decline has to end on the pitch.
I think Stephen Thompson has confidence in us.
We'll get the boys back on track," Donnelly said.
McInnes happy to "win" against Hamilton.
Derek McInnes admits that his Aberdeen team desperately struggled against Hamilton Accies to see a seventh consecutive league win, bringing them a five-point lead ahead of Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooney’s penalty in the first half.
McInnes said: "There is no team that has won everything, in cup games or leagues, that hasn't won games of this kind either."
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged, while it is rising in the UK as a whole.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 164,000 between May and July, while the number of unemployed for the UK as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million in the same period.
Scotland’s unemployment rate of 5.9 percent was above that of the UK’s of 5.5 percent, according to figures from the Office of National Statistics (ONS).
In the meantime, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months, with the number of employees now reaching 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 percent over the quarter – a figure above the UK average of 73.5 percent.
Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell commented on the latest figures, saying, “The long-term plan of the government has laid the foundations for a stronger economy.”
It’s been almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the UK.
During these 12 months, we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decrease in unemployment.
Drunken people disrupted the process
Since the security staff could not satisfy the situation, the staff called the police.
Only with the use of pepper spray could the officials take the disturbers into detention.
A breathing alcohol test in a 16-year-old showed 0.89 per milli.
The young man was picked up by his mother.
A 28-year-old had 2.15 percent and initially remained in custody.
Why I Will Be Witnessing an Execution in Oklahoma
A little later today, except for a late legal intervention, I will watch a man be put to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn’t, I’ll be sitting in a spectator gallery in the death row at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by the poison syringe.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
The invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day drew near, I began to fear.
So, why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the U.S., and since there are often more applications than seats available, a macabre lottery is taking place to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media seats from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen will watch it emotionally.
I can't do this.
I will be sitting next to Richard Glossip’s closest friend, with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like the guy.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to take a notebook and a pencil to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of giving up my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner’s story as he wants it and you will get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she “could have formulated it better,” but she still thinks it’s wrong what I’m doing.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn’t tell me what I have to write, and I wouldn’t do it even if he did.
I told him he could remove me from his witness list at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be present to write there.
When he dies, he thinks public relations will help the movement against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter for the Huffington Post, will sit next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I have made.
I don't want to go into all the details here again.
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the assassination of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the act.
But I believe there is a strong likelihood that he is not guilty of murder.
I am sure there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from that perspective, I'll see him die.
I cannot claim to be truly objective.
There will be other reporters you can turn to for it.
What you will get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.
Man persuaded to come out of Canning River after wet police chase
The Canning Vale policeman remained dry when he persuaded the man from the Canning River.
An attempt by a man from Perth to hang up the police was unsuccessful when he was in shallow and swampy waters, just a few yards away from a police officer who tried to "gentlely persuade him to return to the shore."
Canning Vale police were summoned on Tuesday for a house peace breach incident in Beckenham.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to escape them towards Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
"He stood in the water and said, 'I'm not coming out, come and get me,'" Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine said.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too enthusiastic about wetting his uniform, so he applied a more reliable tactic - "A good cop negotiated".
"Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape," said senior sergeant Castledine.
Championship footballer Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car into the trench to escape an alcohol check and then tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but inspired locals to humorously plan a Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims stewards tried to spy on him and threatens to end racing
Peter Moody claims that stewards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his stables last year and threatened to end the race immediately.
He targeted Racing Victoria’s stewards and integrity department, claiming they were conducting a personal campaign against him with Lady Tatai’s Late Scratch due to a race day treatment, the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself in difficult conditions when it came to the positive cobalt powder test at Lidaris, which he cannot explain.
He had held himself back for 18 months because of the espionage allegations and did not want it to "look like too high hanging grapes."
"I had no intention of saying anything about it, and I've been sitting on it for a long time, but sometimes you're so frustrated that everything comes out at once," Moody said.
You know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to walk around raised head, and I want my owners to think that I am trying my best for them.
If they start to think I’m not doing that, then I shouldn’t be a coach anymore.
I need to think about what I do with my license.
Previously, Moody had detonated the bomb in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable.
“Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown, and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man—whom I’ll name if asked—offering him a job in my stables to provide information about what I’m doing inside my stables,” Moody said on Racing.com.
You seem to think I'm a scammer.
If that’s the case, they should certainly grasp their noses because they failed in trying to grasp me.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, acting president of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of this at the time and still are today.
Should that make me think it’s personal?
Has the RVL behaved cowardlyly, perhaps blaming people outside of coaches for what is going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I so bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think it's me.
Maybe they have to take my license and disown me, and I have no doubt that what I say makes them think about it now.
But I’ve come to the point where I don’t care, and that makes me sad.
That really makes me sad.
I will put pressure on them and push them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The coach's frustration levels have built up with the long-running cobalt investigation at Lidari, and the late scratching led him to say he could "throw his license over the table."
Moody, best known for his preparation of the undefeated Black Caviar champion, called the race day treatment rule "sad" after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse's legs, which violated the rules.
"It's against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for it," he said.
"One of my employees mistakenly applied mud to the leg.
It could have been like that last night.
It could have been all day yesterday, which was the case.
It was the same on race day.
Moody could face a three-month disqualification for treatment with the pack on race day. An investigation into this issue has been opened.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don’t know anything about the horse.
"We all see that we need rules, but you've gone too far here," Moody said.
Man Arrested After Driver's Escape
Police arrested a man on the weekend after a collision with a cyclist and subsequent driver flight in Cobram.
The cyclist was taken by helicopter to Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Murray Valley highway.
Police said the driver continued driving without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Natalia turned up to the police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with driver flight and omission of assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in the hospital and is in stable condition.
Melbourne Storm Coach Craig Bellamy Strikes Back Against Rivals Due to Claims of Wrestling
Melbourne storm coach Craig Bellamy has called criticism of tackling his players as an "agenda setting" of two Premier League favorites of the NRL.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed the Storm players to "ring fight" with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a barely concealed note to the Storm team after his team scored the final victory against the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, calling the game a "pattern example" of the rugby league, saying the two from Queensland were not "too good" in the wrestling.
Bellamy defended his team's tackling, saying they were focused only on their "contact" in tackling.
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading coaches on his team sounded confident to him, as it meant they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team.
"That keeps popping up -- I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when they beat us 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven’t changed anything about our defensive system or techniques throughout the year, but over the last six weeks, we’ve made our contact at Tackles a real focus, and that brought us the trend reversal.
Trent has been there for three years now, and he obviously has a great team to train, so he’s probably not used to losing, so it was a bit of a shock for him.
It’s funny how this happens again and again at this time of year.
Bellamy attacked Bennett's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "boring" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday night to ours on Friday night and how exciting their game was," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010 St George was criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said he would take care of a shithole.
But now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting, especially his young players with their speed.
This is the ball game you want to play when you have this type of player.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play like this.
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they’re a little worried about having to play against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn’t think of us when it came to the big games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm vs. Roosters scored a higher score than the game Broncos vs. Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably a good game, I haven’t watched it yet, but what was the result? 16 : 12 ?
Our game was 20:18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is that an exciting game?
Or are breaks and no points something exciting?
For me, these are the game plans.
If they mention us, it means that we will meet them in one phase.
The Storm team is free this weekend as they have won the right to receive either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks next Saturday night in the pre-finals at AAMI Park. Ticket sales start next Tuesday morning.
Serbian with $200,000 bail after drug charges
A man who may face a life sentence for his attempt to get possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled into Queensland was released on a $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month after federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Solay, which came from South America via Vanuatu and landed in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was seen meeting his co-accused at the marina during the morning and later at Café Coomera Roadhouse, where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a potential life sentence for attempting to own a commercial amount of cocaine, Maksimovic’s lawyer argued that there was no evidence that he was trying to own the entire amount and that could have been in the cafe for a harmless reason.
The Supreme Court judge, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the danger of Maksimovic’s escape.
He has clear relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia,” he told the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal case, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maksimovic’s mother and stepfather had offered a $200,000 bail as collateral together to achieve his release.
"After reading the two persons' sworn statements, it is clear that the provision of a security of $200,000 represents a real financial burden," said Judge Flanagan.
But that alone will not be enough to stop him from not appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic was released on bail, on condition that he handed over his Australian and Serbian passports, reported to police daily, and adhered to a curfew from 18:00-06:00.
Accident on A5 near Karlsruhe: Driver's cab torn apart
In a collision with three trucks on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe, a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening.
Two of the three trucks involved had braked in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel.
The third driver noticed it was too late and tried in vain to turn left at the last moment, police said.
The driver's cab of the driver was completely torn apart.
The driver was seriously injured in a hospital.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe-Nord was completely closed for six hours until 2 a.m.
The damage amounted to 122,000 euros.
Stevan Hogg used phone from girls to lure pedophiles to send pictures
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to request pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg picked up the girl’s phone when it was asleep, logged into an online messaging service from which he received a series of indecent pictures of children sent to him by another user.
The girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Hogg.
She looked through it, found the confusing messages and immediately alerted her mother.
The police took care of it and saw the five images, then analyzed computers found under the address and discovered "relevant" web searches using terms for finding improper images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officials that he did so because it would “leade pedophiles on the internet” and he then “pretended to be a police officer to scare them.”
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction -- that he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that the searches on the computer were done by him, but said it had happened because he wanted to claim to be a police officer to scare pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and whom he asked to send even more photos.
He said he did it to entice her.
He said he was sick in the head when he drank, and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms Robertson added: “When the girl found the messages on the phone, she called her mother and was trembling and crying.
She then also saw the indecent pictures on the phone and confronted the defendant with them.
The girl was interviewed and said the defendant was using computers and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to the indictment of taking indecent pictures of children on June 14 last year, violating the requirements on January 25 of this year, and not appearing in court for a hearing on March 24 of this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not appear in the register of sexual offenders, as it could be argued that "no significant sexual element" could be found in his offence.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the verdict until October to receive background reports on social work.
Hogg was given bail in this case, but was held in custody for hearings on other pending cases.
It was added to the list of sexual offenders before the date of the verdict.
Smugglers dodge small border crossings with Germany
More and more refugees are being picked up off the large checkpoints at the German-Austrian border.
Many smugglers, out of fear of discovery and arrest, left people increasingly at smaller border crossings.
"We are on the Austrian side," a spokesman for the federal police said.
Along the Inn border river, more than 1,000 refugees have been seized in the districts of Passau and Rottal-Inn since Tuesday.
They had reached the German side on foot via bridges and dams.
There they are received by federal police officers and forwarded for registration.
According to Federal Police figures, there were significantly more refugees at Munich Central Station on Wednesday compared to the beginning of the week.
Around 700 people arrived in the state capital by 8.00 a.m. alone, a spokesman said in the morning.
After the reintroduction of controls at the German-Austrian border, refugees had reached the city on Tuesday, 1759.
Stuttgart: Tropical Storm "Henry" is expected in the southwest
Meteorologists warn of storm surges in the southwest on Wednesday afternoon.
Due to a low-pressure area over Western Europe, warm sea air is currently flowing into the country, the German Weather Service (DWD) in Stuttgart said.
The strong low is the foothills of the tropical storm "Henry", which has crossed the Atlantic from the Bermuda Islands in recent days.
Heavy storms and thunderstorms are expected especially in Baden.
According to DWD, gusts of 60 to 90 kilometres per hour can be expected until Thursday morning in the Black Forest, on the Swabian Alb and in the Lake Constance district.
On Friday, the sun can be seen longer.
The crowd makes it: every two years, the car manufacturers show their novelties at the IAA.
In 2015, the number of compact cars that are currently selling particularly well was particularly high.
Cars from the compact class are currently in particular demand: Around 28.1 percent of new registrations accounted for this segment in August alone, according to the Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt (KBA).
This is also reflected at the IAA (Public Days 17 to 27 September).
Between all the futuristic concept cars and new premium and luxury cars, many new compact models will be presented this year.
One of the biggest premieres for the German automotive industry is the Opel Astra, which will be available at the dealers in the autumn.
"The Astra is an extremely important model for us," said Opel CEO Karl-Thomas Neumann at the fair.
It is at the core of the brand.
In order for the volume model to sell well, the new Astra should not become much more expensive.
Opel expects to start below its biggest competitor, the VW Golf, which starts at <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>17,650.
The current Astra costs from 16,990 euros.
The Astra is available with a new 1.4-litre engine with 74 kW/100 hp.
In addition, Hessen offers other diesel and petrol engines from 70 kW/95 hp to 147 kW//200 hp, which for the first time also include three-cylinder petrol engines.
Unlike the main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra initially only exists as a five-door car.
The second variant will follow in the spring, which can also be seen at the IAA.
And what else is happening next to the Astra at the IAA on new compact cars?
Renault Mégane: Renault is launching the fourth generation of its Astra competitor Mégane.
At the fair, the Mégane can only be seen as a five-door car in a conventional and an emphasisedly sporty GT version.
It will be on sale at the beginning of next year, then also as a combi.
Infiniti: The Infiniti Q30 is brand new in the segment.
With the new model, the Nissan branch wants to find its position in the fast-growing segment.
With its curved lines, the compact Infiniti fully fits into the brand’s design line.
The base model will have a gasoline engine with an output of at least 90 kW/122 hp.
The offer also includes a diesel with 80 kW/109 hp or 125 kW/170 hp.
Suzuki Baleno: New in the segment is also the Suzuki Baleno, which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt.
The model is offered with petrol engines, including a newly developed 1.0-litre turbo engine and an output of 82 kW/111 hp.
According to the manufacturer, the maximum torque is 170 Newton metres (Nm).
Sales of Baleno in Europe will start in spring 2016.
DS 4: Not entirely new, but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4, which can be seen at the IAA.
On the outside, the designers of the noble Citro<0xC3><0xAB>n off-roader put their hands on the front: Here, the radiator grille was redrawn and the modified headlights equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, the infotainment system has been modernized, the number of buttons has been reduced by a touchscreen and Apple’s CarPlay has been integrated for the first time.
In addition, a number of revisions and new variants such as the refreshed Mercedes A-Class or the Peugeot 308 GTI will be added to the IAA in the compact class.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square meters of cell are indignity
The Federal Constitutional Court has righted an ex-detainee of the Tegel Prison, who had been in a too small cell for months.
Because of the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are generally entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in too small cells.
This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to the judges, those concerned can hope for money even if they were confined for only a few days in the confined spaces (Az.: 1 BvR 1127/14).
A former prisoner was thus successful with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe: he was housed in a single cell with about five square meters of floor space in the Berlin-Tegel Prison between June and November 2009; the toilet was not spatially separated.
After that, the man, who according to his lawyer is now free again, had been transferred to a larger cell.
His liability action for unworthy detention conditions against the state of Berlin failed.
But the constitutional judges upheld the judgment of the Berlin Chamber Court and turned the case back there for re-examination.
You see the human dignity of the man violated.
The Court of Appeal now decides on the amount of compensation
Even if, for legal reasons, only a few days of imprisonment were decisive for the compensation, there was a claim for compensation.
Otherwise, "a deterioration in the legal protection of the personality would be to be feared."
The Court of Appeal must now clarify the amount of the compensation.
In the past, constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners.
In April, they agreed to indemnify a prisoner for his naked imprisonment in a cell.
According to a 2011 decision, the multiple occupancy of a cell without a separate toilet is also unworthy.
Karlsruhe also confirmed on Wednesday the Berlin Constitutional Court, which had certified a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 an inhumane accommodation.
The plaintiff at the time was housed daily for between 15 and 21 hours for three months in a cell of the same type as in the Karlsruhe case.
The Berlin prisons had also been in the headlines in recent weeks due to lack of staff.
Prisoners are therefore repeatedly locked up for 23 hours, the aggressiveness increases, even fighting is said to have already occurred due to the tense situation.
According to the Judicial Press Office, 21 jobs in Tegel are not filled due to a shortage of young people, 19 are expected to be omitted in 2016.
Angela Merkel and refugee policy: "We can do it"
Immigration of refugees is a huge challenge – the Chancellor is determined to accept it.
What happens to Germany?
Around 800,000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year, according to the forecasts of the Federal Ministry of the Interior, according to Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to take in a million refugees.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: We can do this, and we can do it."
What is to come in Germany, the following overview conveys.
According to different forecasts, between 350000 (estimated by the Federal Ministry of Construction) and 400000 (estimated by the Pestel Institute) homes are used annually - for the next five years.
This is almost twice as much as it has been built so far (250,000 apartments).
The lack of housing is dramatic, but above all for affordable rental properties: Every year, 60,000 to 80,000 social housing units fall out of the rental price obligation, and refugees will also apply for these particularly affordable apartments.
Federal Minister of Construction Barbara Hendricks (SPD) therefore wants to double the funding, from currently 518 million to one billion euros.
This is far too little from the point of view of the Pestel Institute: 80,000 social housing units would have to be created annually and the federal government would have to invest a grant of 6.4 billion a year.
Scientists and the Federal Minister of Construction agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investments in housing.
According to estimates by the Institute for Labour Market and Vocational Research, it can be assumed that in the long term 55 percent of refugees can be employed in Germany.
However, refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications to help them get started, criticizes Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education at the Bertelsmann Foundation.
For the integration of refugees, however, it is crucial whether they find work in Germany.
Work is the key to social contacts, for the appreciation in the host society, but also for the self-esteem of immigrants, says migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt.
According to Thränhardt, there has been a political turnaround in Germany: from a work ban on refugees to the recognition of work.
While there used to be a work ban for asylum seekers of up to five years, it was reduced to three months in November 2014, as was the residence obligation, which restricts asylum seekers to a place of residence.
In society, the view that refugees should be given faster access to the labour market has prevailed in the majority of cases, also because of the shortage of skilled workers.
A major obstacle to access to the labour market is a lack of German language skills.
There is not yet a sufficient range of general and occupational language courses.
Studies also show that workplaces are most often mediated through personal contacts.
According to Thränhardt, network building is therefore the king’s way to work integration.
The Berlin school administration has found that only a few refugee parents give their children to daycare, an estimated 10 to 15 percent: "For the rooted parents, it is very important to keep the family together," says Ilja Koschembar, spokesperson for Youth and Family in the Berlin Senate Administration.
In order to convince the family of the benefits of the daycare, the administration distributes handbooks in different languages.
Should the need for educators increase sharply due to the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacities - for example by allowing more specialist schools.
In the countries, students without knowledge of German are prepared for classes in welcome classes.
However, they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language.
There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stoffers of the Berlin School Administration.
The Deutsche Studentenwerk estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany.
In principle, no federal state prohibits asylum seekers or patients from studying - the only exception so far was Berlin, but interior senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now abandoned his stance.
Access to higher education could be made easier for students willing to study.
Refugees with a residence permit or tolerance will no longer receive benefits under the Asylum Requirements Act when they start studying.
In principle, the latter do not receive bafög, since they do not fall under the circle of bafög-eligible persons.
Patient refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be eligible for Bafög, from 1 January 2016 this period is shortened to 15 months.
This funding gap must also be closed, however, demands Steffen Krach, Berlin’s secretary of state for science, and the Deutsche Studentenwerk.
Students should get bafög immediately.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many, religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should gradually grant Islam the same rights as the churches, and develop the existing state-church right into a new state-religion relationship.
It would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare association that takes care of the new arrivals professionally.
Rights also include duties.
Thus, the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be ready to cooperate with the state in many areas and give it certain control options.
This includes a willingness to act heartily against religious fundamentalism.
The chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, on Thursday expressed concern that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany.
Those who wanted to carry out such conflicts in Germany "immediately lost their right to live here, in Germany," he said in the Bavarian Radio.
He proposed translating the Basic Law into Arabic.
In the future, integration will be a subject of society as a whole much more than it is today.
This will also require a change in the majority society, and the reduction of discrimination and racism will become more pressing.
As a result of European decisions, Germany has had an anti-discrimination body and a general equality law for a short decade.
But it is learning very slowly, as the NSU murder series showed, in which police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: What migrant organizations and the interest groups of non-white Germans have been demanding for a long time and what international agreements such as the Antiracism Convention oblige Germany to do, must become a reality in the next few years if the country is to remain peaceful and its new citizens should use their opportunities - for the benefit of all.
In general, Germany is able to provide medical care for the previously expected refugees, says doctors president Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"As far as man power and capacities are concerned, we can do that," he told Tagesspiegel.
However, additional money would have to be put into the system.
In order to avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery urges all arrivals to hand out health cards immediately upon registration.
Benefits provided could later be settled with the federal states.
And in the long run, it is highly questionable to feed off so many people with the limited list of benefits provided for by the Asylum Requirements Act.
Otherwise, the doctors mainly create the language barriers.
Thea Borde, a Berlin health scientist, has already demonstrated that migrants are less well-educated about their diseases than other patients.
Not only in clinics, but also in medical practices, interpreter costs would have to be taken over, she demands.
Many refugees would also be helped with more general medical contact points in the emergency ambulances.
And with a different diagnostic look.
Among refugee children, for example, there are significantly more untreated disabilities, and among young people it is about HIV education.
However, with some of the other diseases, German doctors would be clear from their education, Montgomery says.
"Parasite infestation or tuberculosis are not so difficult to detect." And as far as the lack of doctors is concerned, the refugees may even have relief in sight.
The Syrians have a highly developed education system, some refugees are even doctors.
In order to practice, however, they would have to prove their qualification and possibly take exams again.
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill, according to estimates of the Federal Psychotherapeutic Chamber (BPtK): most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
Refugee children are particularly vulnerable, explains Dietrich Munz, president of the BPtK.
A recent study from the Technical University of Munich shows that one in five Syrian refugee children arrive in Germany traumatized.
Those who suffer from a post-traumatic stress disorder suffer from so-called flashbacks with shortness of breath, dizziness, heartbeat and death fears.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders, severe fearfulness and emotional numbness.
To prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic, early treatment is necessary, Munz explained.
So far, however, only four percent of mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy.
Although mentally ill asylum seekers can apply for psychotherapy in the social offices, the processing usually takes several months.
In addition, in the social services, specialists or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses would usually decide whether therapy is necessary or not.
This often leads to misjudgments, Munz says.
Manege invites you to dream
With the new staging "Passion", the Circus Probst draws on the traditions of circus art.
The goal is to draw every age group into fascinating acrobatics, animal dressings and unique entertainment.
Now the circus Probst invites you to dream in the equestrian centre on the brick.
"Our passion is the circus."
"I can't imagine living without my circus family," says Stephanie Probst, animal teacher and junior director.
"Passion" - under this motto is the current maneuver staging.
For more than 33 years, the circus has been in the hands of the family Probst.
The gift of enthusiasm lies in the blood of the family.
“It’s important to us to get people out of their everyday routine and take them to a completely different world for two hours,” said the 27-year-old junior executive.
"Management cocktail with world-city flair," this is how Director Reinhard Probst calls his concept.
50 cities on the nearly 3,000-kilometre tour can now experience this flair.
The program of the circus convinces with talented artists from all over the world.
Awarded at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family captivates audiences with wit and charm.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their craft.
With the heroes of the silent films, the Cuban duo wants to take it easy.
Ease and agility - with these words they identify themselves.
Her humorous art at the mast is intended to conquer women's hearts by storm.
Apart from numerous salmon ointments, the acrobatics of Circus Probst also fascinate with fingertip sensitivity and jointness.
Balancing with the unicycle on a ball?
No problem for He Yuan.
Snake people fascinate and frighten at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics like few others and fascinates with its agility.
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every way.
"The animals belong to our family," emphasizes Stephanie's mother, Brigitte Probst.
Misconduct in the holding of circus animals is all too often a topic at various animal welfare organizations.
Stephanie Probst also commented: "If our animals aren't doing well, we aren't doing well either".
Around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each caressing unit.
The "four-legged artists", as they are affectionately called, are, if possible, read every wish from the eyes.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal doesn’t feel comfortable, it doesn’t want to go into the equestrian arena either.
The most important thing is to take good care of the animals.
The Probst family is particularly proud of their Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a Shetland pony stallion and a zebra mare.
The two animals lived together for eight years and nothing happened.
"But then, suddenly, our little jumbo was there," says Brigitte Probst.
The Zebroid is not yet ready for the manege, but it is the unique mascot of the Circus Probst.
There should be something for every visitor.
"One thing is for sure," says Stephanie Probst: "Whether five or 1,200 spectators, we always do our best and are there with all our heart."
The Circus Probst invites to its performances from 17 to 20 September every day at 5 pm and 8 pm.
On Sunday, the program starts at 11 and 16 o'clock.
Thursday is family day, for the performance at 5 pm the prices are reduced.
In addition, the animal show is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe makes a false speech in parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa’s oldest leader, fell from a podium at the beginning of the year.
He remained uninjured, but the video of the case quickly spread through social media.
The opening of parliament was also clouded by allegations by opposition MPs that they had received anonymous death threats and were warned not to accompany Mr Mugabe’s speech with buh cries.
Last month, they buoyed him and interrupted him during his speech in parliament on the state of the nation – this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The spokesman for the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) Innocent Gonese said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their phones warning them not to interfere with Mr. Mugabe's speech.
"The message comes from a number that is not displayed, but it is titled 'death'," he told journalists after Mugabe's speech.
It warns the Members of Parliament concerned that immunity in Parliament ends, and as soon as they leave Parliament, their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective.
The chief spokesman said the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was "concerned" about the dangers to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and savings efforts in services.
HP will split into two listed companies later this year, separating the computer and printer business from its fast-growing corporate hardware and service business operations.
The expected job cuts will lead to a burden of over $2.7 billion as of the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
"These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett-Packard company," said Meg Whitman, HP Chairman and Chief Executive, who will lead the unit after the separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today, and we have a broad and in-depth portfolio of businesses to help businesses transition to a new style of business," Whitman said.
As an independent company, we are better placed than ever to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion in annual revenue and “will be focused on delivering unprecedented, integrated technology solutions to businesses,” the company said in a statement.
It splits a company founded in the 1930s by graduates of Stanford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to manufacture electrical equipment and whose Palo Alto garage has been called "the birthplace of Silicon Valley".
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to address the shift from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The move by HP, the world’s second-largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies, is the latest in the field, based on the belief that tightly focused companies are delivering better performance.
FC Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must stand behind injured Jack Wilshere before match against Dynamo Zagreb
Wenger stressed to Wilshere that it is only September and if his rehabilitation is as planned, there is no reason why he can not play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England and given his history, his participation in the European Championship next summer is certainly still uncertain.
The big shame about this current issue is that Wilshere had severely ended the last season after a separate ankle injury and then regained his old swing during the preseason.
"This type of injury does not threaten the career," Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal well.
It's not a big deal.
This was just an accident.
It was not related to his ankles or the injuries he had previously.
This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger acknowledged, there is the associated risk of further injuries whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It also develops an unpleasant pattern.
The investigation by Premier Injuries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases from Wilshere since its debut six years ago.
He also played in only 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games in the last five seasons.
The broader picture for Arsenal is that in six of eight seasons since 2007/08, they were one of the two Premier League clubs with the most days of injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that an improvement in injury rates will continue during last season.
"Sometimes, when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period of time, a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain combat power," Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to overcome this.
I hope his body stabilizes, I’m confident he’ll do it and he’ll go through a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal will start their Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb ahead of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger will face a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are allowed to start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and give the players who need it a little break," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are clear favourites to progress through Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the largest intimidation effect in Europe.
Dynamo is also undefeated after 41 games after the "invincible" campaign was launched last season.
The stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday night, measuring on the Richter scale 3.2.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has drawn the lessons of last season with the Champions League capitulation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope of leading the club to his first European Cup triumph with his management.
"This drive is immense," said Wenger.
It has never worked at Arsenal.
We were very close to it in 2006, but on the other hand, I’ve been in business long enough to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: The Comedy Show That Gives Us Serious Lessons About Men's Friendships
The lack of similar representations in shows is obvious, especially in view of how the need for men to open up has now become even more desperate than ever before, as suicide rates among young men at a 15-year high prove.
In 2013, it was the leading cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to tackle the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced 2015 as the Man’s Year, with the aim of challenging the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the fight to overcome this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with “healthy moods,” his chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the risks of mental problems.
But of course, you have to have friends first in order for a friendship to work.
In the age of social media-led communication, with its emphasis on style over substance, the immediacy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, lively and successful, even if in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much more deeply.
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained, money really can’t buy happiness.
The nice thing about Friends was that this focus was turned on the head.
Each character was defined not by his work, but by his personality, which shone through the interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, moments watching football in comfortable armchairs, and the longing of Ross for Rachel - all of this came from knowing that men can definitely relate to it, even if they often hold back from fully exploring their feelings.
As a phone pastoral staffer explained to me, ... “my listening role for people who feel depressed and at risk of suicide has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference.”
The men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends.
The old saying “I can cope with it” has a tremendous effect, like the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when you talk openly about problems.
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer longer-term coping mechanisms.
It clearly presents the small moments of men's friendships.
As much as my objective outsider status over the phone may help people in moments of despair, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, if you’re visiting Comedy Central FriendsFest this weekend with the completely redesigned backdrop to celebrate the day, why not take your friends to a drink at Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone sitting around at Starbucks alone, give them a smile and say hello.
You never know what a difference your friendship could make.
Friends will be broadcast on Comedy Central from start to finish – the entire 236 episodes – for #FriendsFest
Di Maria meets to help PSG crush Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his goal against Malmö.
Di Maria will make his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday, helping PSG to pass Malmö.
Here is the game report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani held course when Paris Saint-Germain started their Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmö at the Prince Park Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria hit less than four minutes after starting his Champions League debut as a PSG player, which put the French champion on the road, but after that they missed a number of opportunities before finally raising their lead when Cavani scored a header goal in the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donetk also in Group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion, as they are not only aiming for qualifying for the K.O. rounds, but an improvement on the way to the quarter-finals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it was not a class game of Laurent Blanc's team with Zlatan Ibrahimovic's missed chances in front of the goal. He was later replaced in the game against his hometown team and the club with which he started his illustrious career already in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League, so it's a good start to win 2:0, cause problems to our opponents and look back relaxed, even if there are certain things that we still have to perfect over the season," Blanc said.
“This is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret not having scored one or two more goals."
After his injury, Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team in one of three changes, which was able to hold a 2:2 draw on his own place against Bordeaux in the First League on the weekend, but he was knocked out by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine winger was referred to as the man who can take PSG to the next level in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United last month, and he hinted at why when he walked into Marco Verratti’s pass behind the Malmö defense before finishing nicely past Johan Wiland in the long corner of the net.
However, if anyone believed that PSG would make a big win, he was disappointed.
Malmö, who beat Celtic in a play-off to reach that level, competed at Anpiff with nine internationals on the field and was a heavy opponent with a five-man defense and two deeply lined in midfield.
But apart from a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, who passed far past Kevin Trapp’s post in the 34th minute, they offered little in the attack.
Instead, PSG sometimes gave up on itself, with some missed passes and bad finishes, not least by Ibrahimovic, who failed in no less than five attempts in the first half alone and then was abandoned after Cavani had deployed him after the restart.
Nevertheless, he proved much more skilled when he brought his fellow players into the game, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic that Di Maria turned into a swing shot that was diverted by Wiland at the post in the 52nd minute ...
The second goal finally fell shortly after the hour mark thanks to Cavani, who scored his sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic caught a left flank of Maxwell.
This ended all thoughts that Malmö could get back into the game, and only an excellent intervention from Wiland from the shortest distance to stop David Luiz could keep the end result low before substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi was dismissed one goal at the end.
Malmö's coach, Age Hareide, later admitted that PSG played a class over his team, and the Norwegian said, "Our last Champions League game was in December last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which does not have the same level.
The qualifying games are not enough.”
Hats off to Paris!
It was a great game of them!
Glencore raises $2.5 billion through share sales
Swiss-based mining giant Glencore, affected by falling commodity prices, raised $2.5 billion on Wednesday through a stock sale as part of its huge debt repayment plan.
The London-registered company Glencore said in a statement that it has sold new shares worth about <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion to pay off its own debts.
The company, which lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is struggling with falling commodity prices as China’s economic downturn pushes demand and has a devastating impact on markets.
The issue of subscription rights brought Glencore’s share price to the top of the London Stock Exchange early Wednesday morning.
The stock jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened up 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore had announced the $2.5 billion stock sale last week as part of its broader plans to repay around a third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new holdings at 125 pence per share, which meant a 2.4% discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
There were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns about long-term inhibited growth in China have cut iron ore prices by about half, coal, copper and other commodity prices have fallen by 20 to 40 percent.
Refugees arriving in Weimar
On Tuesday afternoon, after a mostly long flight, 49 people reach the city administration in Weimar.
The refugees are from Syria, Albania, Afghanistan, Macedonia and Somalia.
The youngest arrival is a six-month-old girl from Syria.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in a statement on Tuesday.
The visit, Xi’s first official in Washington, will take place on September 25 and will echo President Barack Obama’s trip to Beijing last November, the statement said.
US President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan at a state dinner this evening after the two leaders held bilateral talks.
“President Xi’s visit will provide an opportunity to expand U.S.-Chinese cooperation on a range of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while also giving President Obama and President Xi the opportunity to tackle areas of disagreement constructively,” the statement added.
XI, whose first visit was announced in February, is expected to meet several U.S. technology leaders in Seattle on his way to Washington before moving on to New York City for the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address a number of controversial issues, including Washington’s concerns about alleged China’s cyber espionage and his growing self-confidence in the disputed waters of the South China Sea.
440-hp sports car lent out and driven to scrap
A 29-year-old wanted a dream come true and borrowed a Ford Mustang.
On the rainy highway came the evil awakening.
At a company in the district of Gotha, you can fulfill your dream and borrow and drive a V8 US sports car Ford Mustang Boss 302 with 440 hp.
So did a 29-year-old from the district of Gotha.
On the A 71 near Arnstadt, the dream was over and over.
The 29-year-old lost control of the sports car, got into a sling on a wet road and drove into the guardrail.
The sports car suffered total damage, no one was injured.
The property damage is estimated at EUR 40,000.
Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented 2008 move to FC Bayern
World and European Champion Xavi has been playing for al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
FC Bayern was apparently close to the commitment of Spain’s superstar Xavi a few years ago, who played for FC Barcelona at the time.
Eight times Spanish champion, three times cup winner, four times champions league winner, two times club world champion, two times European champion, one time world champion – Xavi’s title list is breathtaking.
In the summer, the now 35-year-old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar.
But in an interview with the Marca, Xavi now reveals that he was already ahead of his departure from Barcelona before the European Championship 2008.
“They told me that Barça wanted to sell me.
"Madrid won everything then, we won nothing," he says.
And FC Bayern also registered that.
Xavi: "There was an offer from Bavaria."
"Rummenigge wanted me."
As a reminder: in the summer of 2008, Jürgen Klinsmann took over FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason Xavi didn't change
But the change did not happen.
And the decisive man for this today works for the German record champion: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: "Barça signed Guardiola and I played a great European championship."
"Pep told me I wouldn't change, that he couldn't imagine the team without me."
"He's got me."
Who knows how Bayern’s 2008/2009 season would have been with Xavi.
Xavi stood for Barca in the quarter-finals of the Champions League against Bayern over the entire distance on the lawn, knocked out the Reds (4:0, 1:1) and celebrated the king-class triumph at the end.
Matt Damon plays down diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about diversity, saying she was not needed behind the scenes.
During a Sunday Night episode of HBO’s Project Greenlight, the seasoned actor interrupted Brown when he stressed the need for alternative perspectives regarding a black protagonist in the project’s chosen screenplay.
“When we talk about diversity, you do it with the cast of the film, not the cast of the show,” Damon said.
Brown reacted shocked, with offended disbelief, shouting "Hoo! Wow. Okay," as the actor's comments on The Martian solidified.
Damon and Brown joined producer colleagues Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show finalists.
“I want to invite people to think about – whoever the director will be – how they treat the figure of Harmony,” Brown said.
The only black person, and she's a whore being beaten by her white pimp.
The producer of Dear White People advocated for finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the directing rights to the film; Damon replied that her directing could "in the end give us something we don't want."
After the discussion aired, social media exploded with disapproval over Damon’s comments.
Twitter user Mr Pooni expressed his anger at the clip by writing "Matt Damon talks about the only black person in the room, so he can explain her diversity - this is SO WHITE that it hurts."
The tweet earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since its release.
Damon’s comments come at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion.
After teenage Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement made a nationwide impact, urging lawmakers and authorities to put an end to discriminatory practices against colored people.
In February, singer Prince made an allusion to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matter," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still have their meaning.
More recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement have published a statement in response to the question posed by Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be seen as a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter network is a love group," the leaders said.
Recently, it was announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media moguls who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or had already met the pope is unclear.
American Ninja Warrior crowned first champion
Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening, taking home the $1 million Grand Prix.
The competition show, which just finished its seventh season, had never seen a competition participant complete all stages of its obstacle course.
During the season finale, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, made it to the final.
The last task included climbing on a 75-foot-long climbing rope in 30 seconds.
Britten finished the task within time, becoming the first athlete to complete the strenuous phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero finished this challenge three seconds faster, making him the winner.
Caldiero spoke to E!News after the hard-earned victory, still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of $1 million.
"I mean, it's amazing to think about it, I've never made or had more than $10,000 to live on," Isaac E! said about his heap of money.
As suddenly as I can't even imagine what this is like... the future is unknown.
Lead producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why Britten, although he was the first to finish the course, did not receive any prize money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there's more than one finalist, it gets the one with the fastest time," Weed said.
How much money is a wonderful price and life changes, it receives the great gratification.
I don't think he has any resentment about it.
He is so happy to have done what he has done.
He received many awards from fans.
He's such a great guy and a family father.
He is a hero to his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If I should be beaten by someone, then I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same way if they had changed the roles.
America Ninja Warrior has been extended for an eighth season, filming will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneak past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS--The second half of the season was not particularly fun for the Detroit Tigers.
They used to be one of the best teams in baseball, but today the Tigers are in last place in the American League Central.
The Tigers are reduced to their role as spoilers, but played this part perfectly against the Minnesota Twins on Tuesday with 5-4 in Target Field.
The Twins wasted a chance to rise within a game half of the Houston Astros for the second American League wildcard spot.
For Detroit, if only for an evening, it was a return of the three letter F word that was so hard to grasp over much of the second half of the season.
"All wins are fun, no matter how it comes," Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said.
Tiger pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) beat up 6 times in the 1/3 innings and allowed three runs.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine games.
"I want to end this year strongly," Simon said.
It’s hard to throw any game in the bullpen, and that’s why I want to get very focused into the game.
The designated Tiger hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-hit match since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He swung the baton well," said Ausmus.
He looked good at (beating training), looked much better in the bullpen, and he brought it right into the game.
With three runs behind at the end of the seventh inning, the Twins had their best chance of getting back into the game.
Center Fielder Byron Buxton finished the inning with a double on the left field line.
Right Fielder Aaron Hicks reached a bunt, and Simon brought his second baseman Brian Dozier to strikeout before being replaced by left-hander Blaine Hardy.
Hardy surpassed Mauer, the only man he faced, in front of designated rookie batsman Miguel Sano, who snatched right-hander Drew Verhagen a two-run.
With a pair of runners and the final run in the second, Verhagen brought the third baseman Trevor Plouffe to a double play.
It was the 27th time in the Major League leading this season that Plouffe hit a double play.
After Detroit added an insurance run at the end of the ninth inning, Wall made an RBI double against Tigers Bruce Rondon's closer, scoring the score of 5-4.
However, the right-hander punched Sano out on three pitches for his fifth save.
Detroit benefited from an immobile Phil Hughes to kick off the game.
The Tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against the right-handed veteran who had been removed from the injury list prior to the game after missing more than a month due to a back injury.
"Obviously not the start I wanted," Hughes said, "but I felt more comfortable as I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pitches there in the third inning."
After receiving the leadoff batter in the first, Hushes released a single to second baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into the game, who made a single "up the middle" at the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez managed his 0-21 success series with the runners in the scoring position.
Third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right, making another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game as he tried to get to third, ending the threat.
The Tigers finished second, scoring a one-out double from catcher James McCann and a two-out single from center-fielder Anthony Gose to 3-0.
"That was a big blow," Twins manager Paul Molitor said.
He didn't hit very well, but he got the right spot.
Hughes was in a pitch count, not scoring any points in the third inning until he was replaced by the reliever right-hander A.J.Achter.
Hughes had three runs with six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
NOTES: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez resigned due to a throwing shoulder injury.
He is being examined by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the list of injured since mid-August due to a strain on the shoulder, is due to be activated for the launch on Wednesday.
With Sanchez out of the game, LHP Daniel Morris is removed from the injury list to start against the Twins.
Norris 1-1 in four starts with the Tigers since he was acquired in exchange with LHP David Price on July 30.
He has been missing since August 20 due to a rupture in the right hip joint.
The Tigers and the Twins will finish their series of three games at Target Field on Wednesday
Norris (2-2.4.43 ERA) will play against Minnesota's RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)
Hundreds of refugees stay in Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on its way to Hesse.
His arrival was expected for the night of Wednesday.
The people who traveled in it should then be accommodated in emergency accommodations in Wiesbaden, as the city of Wiesbaden announced on Tuesday evening.
It was estimated that between 450 and 750 refugees would arrive.
Several sports halls of the Hessian state capital had been prepared for this case in recent days.
Up to 1,000 refugees can stay there temporarily.
They will then be distributed to other municipalities.
In the past ten days alone, 7,500 people had arrived in Hesse, according to the Giessen government bureau responsible for the first admission.
Frankfurt and Hanau have also set up emergency shelters in sports halls due to the large number of refugees.
Ischinger: German military action in Syria an option
The head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, considers military measures with German involvement in Syria a possibility.
"I believe that decisive reflection on military action options cannot take place without Germany," he said.
He accused the European states of “collectively looking away.”
Four years ago, we were glad that the cup had passed a military involvement in Germany.
"Now the conflict is crashing at our doorstep," he said on Deutschlandfunk.
The former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid to the refugees on the ground.
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
After Germany, Austria has reintroduced controls at its southern and eastern borders.
Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner said on Tuesday evening on the Austrian TV channel ORF that no one will be sent back to Hungary even now.
Germany also did not send refugees back to Austria.
“No, that’s agreed,” she explained.
On the question of an agreement that would allow Germany to take in a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Mikl-Leitner said that there had already been talks on this matter between the Director-General for Public Security and representatives of Germany.
She did not mention concrete figures and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin.
In recent days, tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria from Hungary via the so-called Balkan route.
Their goal is mostly Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann, together with several other EU heads of state and government, requested a special summit for next week.
Germany began temporary border controls on Sunday.
So far, the EU countries have not been able to agree on a common approach in the crisis.
The EU Interior Ministers will take a new initiative at a special meeting next Tuesday (September 22) for the binding distribution of another 120,000 refugees.
In view of the strong refugee pressure in Germany, the federal government wants to support the countries more strongly in the initial reception and distribution of people.
The federal government will manage this together with the countries, Merkel announced late Tuesday evening after almost four hours of consultations with the Prime Ministers at the Chancellery in Berlin.
Merkel stressed that those people who needed protection would get it too.
However, those who do not have a staying perspective cannot stay in Germany either.
This view was strongly shared in the round.
The chancellor stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a "giant effort".
Thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route.
On Tuesday night, Hungary closed its 175-kilometre border with Serbia.
A few hours later, the government in Budapest announced that it would also close the border with Romania with a fence.
Unlike Serbia, this neighbouring country belongs to the EU.
Hungary wants to prevent traffickers from seeking evasive routes across Romania, Hungary’s Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said about the planned new border fence.
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who had cut the fence.
In Turkey, according to eyewitness reports, thousands of other migrants made their way to the Greek border.
Cassini spacecraft finds ocean on Saturn's moon Enceladus
Under the ice tank of Saturn's moon Enceladus sweeps a global ocean.
This is what researchers conclude from observations of the Cassini spacecraft.
Thus, the moon easily tumbles on its orbit around the ring planet.
This swamping movement is small, but still too big for a permanently fixed celestial body, Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, said in a statement Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyses in the journal "Icarus".
It has long been known that there must be liquid water under the ice sheet of Enceladus.
As early as 2006, Cassini had discovered ice volcanoes at the south pole of Saturn's moon, spitting water vapor and ice particles and thus feeding Saturn's so-called E-ring.
At least at the South Pole, there had to be an underground sea, the astronomers concluded at the time.
However, the extent of the hidden ocean was not clarified.
Rama missing in 1860 Munich several weeks
The 1860 Munich had to renounce Offensiv<0xC3><0xA5>kteur Valdet Rama for about a month.
An investigation revealed an adductor injury in the 27-year-old, the association said.
Rama had complained of pain earlier this week.
According to the Munich Lions, the diagnosis means "foreseeable four weeks of forced break".
"It's hard for us, Rama is a tough loss."
"Of course we have to think now," sports director Necat Aygün told the Bild newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of a clubless professional.
As a training guest, however, the sixties initially presented a defensive man.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was last active in Belgium and was previously also under contract with VfL Wolfsburg.
The Croatian currently has “the opportunity to prove his ability.”
Rubin Okotie can return to team training next week after his concussion.
On Thursday, the Austrian national player is scheduled to enter running training.
Okotie had been injured in the game at Fortuna Düsseldorf (0:3) in a violent clash on the head.
Contrary to initial fears, however, he remained without a serious injury.
No diet fruit - mangoes contain a lot of sugar
Mangos are exotic and juicy-sweet.
But those who want to pay attention to their lean line are often discouraged by them.
Because mangos contain a relatively high amount of sugar - especially sucrose.
The exotic fruits are healthy nonetheless: they contain B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. Above all, however, mangos contain a lot of vitamin A and its precursor beta-carotene.
Those who eat the fruits thus support vision, immune system and metabolic processes in the body.
When buying mangos should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasant.
The peel color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so even green mangos can taste very tasty.
They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days.
Then, of course, they taste pure or in sweet foods.
However, a mango also gives a special touch to hearty dishes.
It softens the slightly bitter taste of some leafy salads such as chicory and radiccio.
And a mango chutney fits well with fish, poultry, lamb and game.
The U.S. parcel service, UPS, has re-established up to 95,000 parcels for the Christmas business in the U.S.
The company has already started recruiting seasonal workers, UPS said Tuesday.
Especially drivers are sought.
Last year, UPS had already increased its workforce by 95,000 for the holiday season.
Given the booming online business, UPS and its competitor FedEx have been making early arrangements to be ready for the Christmas business since last year.
In 2013, delayed deliveries had brought harsh criticism to the parcel services.
First a hairstorm, then a striking cold front
In the coming night, in the valleys of the Alpine north side of the Föhn breaks through, MeteoSwitzerland announced on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and in the night until Thursday, the hair dryer blows partly with storm force through the Föhn valleys.
After Föhnende on Thursday morning we cross a striking cold front, which brings heavy rainfall, wind gusts and a drop in temperature.
As MeteoNews writes in a statement, Switzerland is currently at the forefront of an extensive low-pressure area over the British Isles in a strong southwest current.
On the north side of the Alps, the dryer breaks through the valleys at night until Wednesday.
As a result, the hair dryer blows until Thursday morning in the Föhn valleys with gusts of 60 to 100 km/h, occasionally and especially in the Urnerland sometimes with over 100 km/h.
The hair dryer can penetrate into the adjoining central country, and on the mountains even hurricane gusts of more than 120 km/h are possible.
While in the north on Wednesday stormy hair dryer provides for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees, the humidity begins to stack up on the south slope of the Alps.
There is rain here, which will last until Thursday night.
In total, south of the Alps, some more than 100 litres of rain per square meter have to be expected in the next 48 hours, after large amounts of rain have already fallen in the last few days.
On Thursday morning, the hair dryer runs out, as a result, a cold front with strong, partly expansive rain rolls over Switzerland from west to east.
Together with the cold front, the wind refreshes strongly to stormy, and the temperatures drop significantly.
The following days present themselves in the north with 15 to 20 degrees in the autumn, while in the south it becomes sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees on the weekend.
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
Almost 500 years after the Reformation, there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome.
In the presence of City President Ignazio Marino, a previously nameless square in the park on the Oppio Hill was christened on Wednesday in the name of the German Reformer.
On the "Piazza Martin Lutero" he is now honored as "German theologian of the Reformation".
The park is located in the middle of ancient Rome right next to the Colosseum.
The naming had been requested by the working group of the Protestant churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome, recalled on Wednesday that Protestants in the city of the popes for centuries as a minority could often only live their faith in secret.
The square makes it symbolically visible that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) was a young Augustinian monk who spent several months in Rome at the turn of the year 1510/11.
He felt the city at that time as a decaying babel of sin.
His negative impressions, according to historians, must have strengthened him in his later struggle against Rome.
Luther had then initiated the division of the Western Church with his theses against the indulgence trade.
Hammer artist invested three years in personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (gilded) crown of thorns is one of the main works that Otmar Alt painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.
In the beginning was the word?
No, not with the Otmar-Alt-Bible, which has now appeared with magnificent pictures.
In the beginning was the picture for Otmar Alt, who in 150 motifs formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas.
His "language" with colorful colors and imaginative forms has been preserved by the 75-year-old - which is by no means synonymous with "fun" pictures.
On the contrary: adapted to the respective topics, this can seem quite gloomy.
For about three years, Otmar Alt worked on his Bible project, for which he made a subjective-artistic selection from the many topics of the "Book of All Books".
Cycles have arisen, which are devoted to topics such as the Way of the Cross, plagues, commandments or Our Father.
With this, he spontaneously fascinated several partners: This applies to the Luther publishing house with its theological orientation as well as to the Kettler publishing house with its focus on art books.
And there is above all the author Klaus Altepost, who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting.
He has interpreted the Bible passages selected by Otmar Alt and thus "translated" them into the present day, into current contexts.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of Alt’s painting.
They are embedded between the original Bible quote by Martin Luther and a sentence by the artist, who here formulates his very personal thoughts on the respective situation.
The jewelry cover has golden letters.
Thus, the 75-year-old allows double a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high level of intimacy.
Emotions were ultimately triggers for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in 1940 in Wernigerode and raised in Berlin, comes from a family belonging to the strict Protestant Herrhuter Order.
"Education has already happened with the cane," recalls Otmar Alt.
"I have tried to work this out, perhaps to reconcile myself with the Lord Father again."
His second concern is to give art more importance in a fast-paced time: "The perception of visual worlds today is shaped by advertising, and it is loud.
Symbolism is suppressed.
Artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things.
Pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative.
"In this regard, I am a dinosaur".
Otmar Alt wants the viewers to let themselves "fall into" the pictures, let them affect themselves, discover and feel what power they have: "The image seeks its opposite".
On Tuesday, at the presentation of the Otmar-Alt-Bible at the Otmar-Alt-Stiftung, Klaus Altepost confessed to being "always" a lover of Otmar Alt's art: "I like how he understands life with his pictures".
Old did not pay attention to fully grasping the Bible, but chose the topics that were important to him, even mysterious ones.
"This was not a cooperation on an equal footing," says Altepost: "This is about the pictures, the text merely explains."
For Hans Möhler of Luther-Verlag, this work is an invitation to "deep his life and find freedom".
Otmar Alt’s paintings speak for Möhler both the (biblical) language of love and that of responsibility.
Part of the originals - paper and canvas paintings - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will open on 15 November at the Otmar-Alt-Stiftung.
Construction start for BMX train is approaching
Plans were made, space was found, companies were commissioned, mounds were modeled for a circuit: a year later, almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BMX track, it was already over.
Absences in politics and administration caused resentment, especially among the local residents, who did not want to tolerate the railway.
So hill deported, new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permit.
The approval will be received in October, the First Municipal Councillor Sabine Mosebach-Bock could now announce in the Children and Youth Committee.
"I hope that something visible will happen this year," she said.
Work on the former indoor swimming pool should then begin without a "further remembrance break".
DFB intensifies its commitment to refugees
The DFB is expanding its commitment to refugees until 2019, and the Bundesliga is sending a clear signal this weekend.
Football responds to the worsening situation in Germany and assures politicians its help in dealing with the problems ahead.
"I consider this to be the biggest challenge facing our country since reunification."
“No one can say that, it’s not my business, I have nothing to do with it.”
"It must be of interest to everyone to get a grip on this issue," DFB chief Wolfgang Niersbach said.
At his annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin, he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively.
"I will be in the Chancellery next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State Ms. <0xC3><0x96>zo<0xC4><0x9F>uz and the Chancellor there."
"The issue will certainly play a central role," he announced.
Football can and will help.
But the decisive steps must be taken by politics.
The German Football Federation has therefore extended its refugee initiative "1:0 for a welcome" by four years.
"Through the Egidius Braun Foundation, we have ensured that this programme continues until 2019," Niersbach said at the UEFA meeting in St. Julian's/Malta.
A number of Bundesliga members also support this program.
Already this weekend, the 36 professional clubs are setting a clear signal when they will wear the inscription "We help - #refugeeswelcome" on the left shirt sleeve instead of the usual sponsor logo (Hermes).
"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help wherever and as they can," Leverkusen's sports director Rudi Völler told the "Bild" newspaper on Tuesday, describing the project as "a matter of course".
“The refugee drama is for everyone, no one should look away.”
"We football leaguers can, no, we must use our power, our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly," said Hertha manager Michael Preetz.
Hoffenheim's managing director Peter Rettig spoke of a "prominent sign of the league".
The women's national team invites 100 refugees to Halle/Saale for the qualifying match against Hungary this Friday.
Niersbach described the support of refugees as "a great community of German football".
That all 36 licensing associations have started their own projects in their locations is great.
Equally great is that small and small clubs are active there.
The message "1:0 for a welcome" we have issued is lived in football.
"This is of tremendous importance," he said.
In this year and next year, the association, together with the DFB selection and the Federal Government, will each provide <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300,000 for the integration of refugees.
"The clubs have already called up the entire sum for 2015," Niersbach reported.
Reports: SAP CEO loses an eye in an accident
The CEO of Europe’s largest software company, Bill McDermott, has reportedly lost his left eye due to a fall in early July.
In the accident on the stairs in his brother's house in the United States, he fell after midnight on a glass of water that he carried in his left hand, the "economic week" reported on Wednesday.
"He's almost bleeding, was fainting, then dragged out onto the streets - he told us that last week," said Hasso Plattner, SAP co-founder of WiWo.
McDermott can do his job.
"We will meet at the beginning of October before the Supervisory Board meeting in Walldorf," said Plattner.
The 54-year-old manager was present at the meeting and "fully capable of working".
McDermott announced in an interview with the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" (Thursday's issue) that he would return to Germany in October and continue to lead the software company.
"I'm full for SAP, full in my job."
"Of course, I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Hasso Plattner all the time," McDermott told the "SZ".
McDermott usually commutes between Germany and the United States, but since the summer he was no longer at the German SAP headquarters in Walldorf.
It was important to him to go public with such a personal story, the manager of the "SZ" said: "Anyone can do something like this."
"It's important to get up again when you've fallen down."
McLaren replacement pilot Magnussen out of combat ...
Magnussen tweeted a photo and said he had suffered the injury when he fell off the bike.
He is therefore not eligible as a reserve driver for the two main pilots Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button at the night race in Singapore on the weekend, as well as at the Japanese Grand Prix a week later.
Football: BVB without Reus against Krasnodar: Weidenfeller in goal
At Borussia Dortmund, all hopes for a comeback of Marco Reus in the first group game of the Europa League have finally broken.
The international player will also be missing the leader of the Bundesliga in the duel with FK Krasnodar on Thursday (19:00 p.m./Sky).
"We can't rely on him," Thomas Tuchel said Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be back in the Bundesliga top game against Leverkusen on Sunday, the BVB coach left open: "We expect a return from him to training on Friday".
Given the high burden of his professionals, Tuchel will not only change his tribal elf at the Reus position.
So he announced a change in the goalkeeper position.
That’s why Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of Stammkeeper Roman Bürki.
"He trains at an absolute top level," the football teacher praised the world champion.
However, whether Weidenfeller will be used in all Europa League matches in the future, Tuchel left open.
It is highly likely that he will also play the second game.
The research statement of fellow player Reus that the final entry for the BVB in the Europa League should be the goal, midfielder Julian Weigl thinks understandable: "This does not make Marco so wrong."
"I think we have a good chance of taking the title."
Robotic cars: government wants to lead the way for Germany
According to the will of the German government, Germany should be a technological pioneer in the change of the car.
The Federal Cabinet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which includes investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the IAA car show about a "new era of mobility".
Automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and reduce traffic congestion, Dobrindt said.
He also wants to discuss the issue with his counterparts from the G7 countries, who will also meet with industry representatives at the IAA.
Among other things, the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphasizes the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid transition to digital radio.
To test new technology, a test track is currently being built on the Autobahn 9 in Bavaria.
So that the driver "is not burdened with additional liability risks," the federal government wants to "review the legal framework and, where necessary, adapt to the new developments."
For example, Germany wants to work internationally to increase the permissible maximum speed for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 km/h.
The federal government also wants to work for an amendment to the Vienna Convention, which so far only provides for people as drivers.
With automated driving, the car is increasingly taking the lead, the driver is becoming more and more a passenger.
The technology is primarily based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds.
According to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, highly automated driving on highways will be technically possible by 2020.
However, driverless vehicles on public roads are to be expected “only far beyond 2020.”
The authors of the study estimate the value added in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the site in Germany to be around 8.4 billion euros for 2025.
"The digital networking of the car can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic," said SPD transport politician Sören Bartol.
However, the question of liability in the event of accidents and the security of the personal data of drivers must be clearly clarified.
However, the Germans still see self-driving cars with skepticism - much more than French or Americans.
A survey conducted by the Forsa Institute on Wednesday at the AA on behalf of the testing organization Dekra concludes that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail in the next ten years, 32 percent expect only in 20 years, 31 percent do not believe at all.
In France, 21 percent of respondents expect autonomous cars by 2025, while in the US, 33 percent expect autonomous cars.
However, drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely entirely on a self-driving vehicle.
According to a survey by the digital association Bitkom, only seven percent would agree to surrender control throughout the entire journey on all roads.
On the highway, this could be imagined in the flowing traffic at least 15 percent, in the traffic jam 45 percent.
One in four would not leave the car in control under any circumstances.
Boll cancels team and double start at table tennis European Championship
According to the current state of play, the Dusseldorfer will only open in detail at the title matches from 25 September to 4 October.
The final decision is to be made no later than September 22.
“This is a huge loss for our team.
"The boys found out in the morning."
"But we are strong enough to get the title even without Timo," said Bundestrainer Jörg Roßkopf during the European Championships course in Düsseldorf.
Boll was on the flight to a long-term agreed sponsorship date in China at the time.
The 34-year-old German champion is expected to return on Friday.
"Without Timo, the downside is that we are no longer such a clear favourite," single European champion Dimitri Ovtcharov said.
The Hamelner, who heads the seat list in Yekaterinburg, however, also reminded of the European Championship 2013 in Schwechat.
“At that time, Timo was also missing and we became European champions.”
"That's what we should look for," the World Rankings Fifth said.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw has suffered a serious injury to his right leg.
In the Champions League game at PSV Eindhoven, the defender was hit in a tackle by Héctor Moreno and replaced after a long treatment.
The first diagnosis indicated a shin fracture in Bastian Schweinsteiger’s 20-year-old co-player.
Gaultier feels too old for an Enfant terrible
It is a mixture of a very large fashion show and a wax figure horror cabinet: The designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich.
The highlights: mannequins that look terrifyingly human thanks to video projections.
They wear the spectacular creations of the French designer, who, among other things, with Madonna’s stage outfits became the star of the fashion scene – and with it, he put men in skirts.
“I can’t say today that I’m the enfant terrible of haute couture because I have white hair.”
"It used to be bleached, now it's real," Gaultier said.
For visitors to the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk" (From the pavement to the catwalk), which will be on view in the Kunsthalle of the Hypo-Kulturstiftung from September 18th, it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his initially disliked attitude towards a show about his person.
Actually, he was against it, because: "For me, an exhibition sounded a bit after death," he said.
When you die, you go to the museum.
The impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris.
“It’s about so much more than just beautiful clothes,” said the director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Diederen.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give a glimpse into the hardly overlooked work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever completing an education.
The show is not structured chronologically, but it is an excellently choreographed overall work of art, for which a lot of effort has been made: for example, a stylist has been dedicated to hairstyle the dolls.
According to curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot, 14 tons of material were transported to Munich.
Shortly before the start of the Oktoberfest, there was another special treat: a lederhosen outfit with a corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He has always been interested in strong women (“women are smarter than men”) and for people who are a bit different, Gaultier said.
Gaultier’s old teddy can also be seen in the exhibition.
He stands for the designer’s first, timidly fashionable gigs.
As a child (he was not a good student and bad in football) he put on his teddy bras and clothes, Gaultier said.
Playing with a doll, his parents would not have allowed him.
He later taught himself how to design fashion.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier told in Munich.
Later I bought them, of course.
For his first fashion show, he couldn’t pay the models.
They got nothing, but they were allowed to keep the clothes.
Jewelry instead of curtain - Plauener lace as a fashion niche
In the past, the long embroidery machines in and around Plauen were about making meters.
The embroidered fabrics and lace were created in large quantities for customers, who processed them into blankets and curtains, for example.
This alone no longer works today, explains Andreas Reinhardt, Managing Director of Modespitze Plauen.
Instead, fashion is important again.
In the early days of the Plauen lace, fashion played a greater role, was then displaced by the home textile industry – and is now rediscovered as a niche.
Reinhardt cites a few examples: lace in jewellery, in accessories such as bags and in regional costumes.
In general, the so-called vintage fashion, which is based on past style eras, forms an increasing order potential.
Those who do not serve niches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market.
With us, they already make up half of all orders.
Modespitze Plauen is, together with nine other companies, a member of the industry association Plauener Spitze und Embroidery.
Only you can wear the protected label.
In the last 15 years, around 80 percent of sales have been lost.
There are almost no more private specialty stores and wholesalers.
Our products hardly reach the customer in this way.
Today, mass goods are produced much cheaper in the Asian region and are almost exclusively sold in chains.
In addition, exports are weakening, currently to Russia and the US.
There are plenty of reasons for new ways.
The industry association also tries to score points through environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer of the Embroidery Pearl in Falkenstein explains: "Since this year, we have been carrying a quality seal that shows that we produce ecologically and socially compatible".
Reinhardt adds: “This also applies to the materials used.”
Diploma designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberger branch of the West Saxon University of Applied Arts Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specializes in embroidery and lace.
In order to oppose the competition from the Asian region, you need to find high-quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
There is a tension between the freshest ideas of the designers and the companies, who have to think economically," says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design is often only slightly varied to keep a customer base.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historic snowball tip.
The machine embroiders small balls in some places.
The Plauen goldsmith Bianca Hallebach-Krauße was inspired by this: "I couldn't do anything with traditional Plauen lace before."
Now she uses the snowball lace for her jewelry.
In an elaborate process, it embosses the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region identify with the Plauen lace theme - young and old," says Reuters.
It also delivers to the US, Australia and Finland – especially to customers whose ancestors lived in Plauen and its surroundings and who want a memorial.
With this I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the Plauen lace.
Disney is planning a new "Mary Poppins" movie
Legends are not to be touched, but Disney is still dare to make a new film of his classic "Mary Poppins".
According to "Entertainment Weekly", this is not a remake, but a kind of sequel that plays with the magical nanny 20 years after the first film.
It is about the experiences of the nanny with the Banks family during the Great Depression in England.
Who plays Poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear.
But the director is already certain: Rob Marshall, most recently with "Into the Woods" in the cinema.
Xi urges to open the economy more broadly to the world
The economy needs to open up more broadly to drive growth, President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday to a group commissioned to steer the reform.
"China should work to attract foreign investment and know-how and improve business start-up strategies," he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Leadership Group for deepening comprehensive reform.
Promoting new start-ups and advancing reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The leadership group has adopted a number of guidelines, including a negative list for regulating market access, relaxing border control policies, promoting state enterprises (SOEs), raising private capital, and overhauling the resident reporting system.
According to the statement, a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment.
The system is gradually tested and improved by test programs.
The initiative is significant as it assigns a greater role to the market in allocating resources, ensures a rule of law business environment and makes the market more open, the statement said.
The government will also loosen controls on the powers conferred on companies and ensure that companies decide how they conduct their business.
The statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
As part of an offer to open state-controlled sectors, further areas will be opened for private investment.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide better services to them," the statement said.
In addition, it will make it easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the "Green Card" by optimizing the requirements and facilitating the application process.
The right of lawyers to exercise their duties and to employ professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.
Prime Minister Li Keqiang and key leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also attended the meeting, as reported in a statement post-meeting.
EU wants to double mercury limit in predatory fisheries
The European Commission intends to double the limit values for mercury in large predatory fisheries, thereby imposing a significantly higher dose of the neurotoxin on consumers.
The consumer organisation Foodwatch, which has a corresponding EU working paper, strongly criticised the plans: "Risks and side effects of misguided industrial and environmental policies are being passed on to pregnant women and toddlers with full force," said Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limit values of the nerve agent for large fish at the end of the food chain, such as shark or swordfish, should be raised from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish for "economic policy reasons".
However, large predatory fish are already so heavily contaminated with mercury that on the basis of the still applicable limit values, about 50 percent of the catches may not be sold.
After doubling the limits, only 14.5 per cent would be unavailable.
In return for this easing, the EU wants to tighten the limits for other fish from currently 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram, according to Foodwatch.
However, Foodwatch called this a "trick" because smaller fish, such as carp, are usually so low in loads that they already meet the planned maximum levels today.
The reduction in small fish is therefore "a perfidious diversion maneuver that alone helps the economy," Wolfschmidt explained.
Mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans and is highly enriched via the food chain, especially in predatory fish.
The federal government therefore warns that "already small amounts can cause damage to the nervous system, especially in the case of unborn children".
However, the Federal Ministry of the Environment explains on its website with regard to the applicable maximum levels that a "health hazard to the general population" is not to be expected.
Mercury enters the environment mainly through coal burning.
The German coal-fired power plants emit more than six tons of mercury a year, two-thirds of the total amount emitted in Germany, according to a written statement from the Federal Environment Ministry to the Greens MP Annalena Baerbock.
The concentration of mercury in fish, for example in the Elbe, the Rhine and the Danube, was "permanently and extensively exceeded," the "mirror" had quoted from the paper in March.
Last year, Europe-wide warnings of mercury in fish were already among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU warning system RASFF.
