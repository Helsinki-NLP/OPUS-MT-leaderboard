No liberating novel for Tymoshenko by parliament
The Ukrainian parliament today refused to abolish the paragraphs on the basis of which the opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko had been convicted.
The new regulation, which could have paved the way for the release of the detained prime minister, MEPs rejected at the second reading of the request for mitigation of penalties for economic offences.
In October, Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for concluding an allegedly detrimental agreement with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The verdict is not yet final, and in December the appeal of the convicts will be heard in court.
Timoshenko himself describes the verdict as a political revenge of the regime and also in the West, the trial raised the suspicion of bias of the court.
The motion, Section 365, on the basis of which the Prime Minister was sentenced to remove from the Criminal Code, was supported by 147 MPs.
226 votes would have been required for his adoption.
Libyan victory
The history of the Libyan liberation struggle or Libyan rebellion already knows its losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
Only the winners are to be defined.
As is customary in this region, Islamists win in the elections, the question is only which - the moderate or the radical.
The National Transitional Council acknowledged the Shari’a customary law, of which one now has a certain idea with God.
Libya would be a country without crime, because for theft, in short, you cut off your hand.
Women should also quickly forget about thinking about emancipation, any apostates will be executed, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, society will be united by the Qur’an.
In short, there will be an order in Libya that would be hardly conceivable in this country and, above all, hardly desirable.
Only - our lifestyle is not the only one and objectively not the best and would hardly fit the aforementioned Libyans.
From this point of view, it is rather strange that the Muslim fighters could even be helped by the unbelieving dogs.
For their apologies, it may only serve the fact that NATO's airstrikes were not led by any general from America, but by Allah Himself, whose omnipotence was praised after every successful hit.
The winners in Libya? The West is not one of them.
We only took part in a gunfight, served the interests of Islam, and our politicians got rid of themselves in the person of the dictator of a political ally, without any advantage.
After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we preferred to refrain from a military occupation of Libya.
As a result, the householders are free of a concern - namely the expulsion of the crusaders.
But will the mineral oil companies also get the black gold at a ridiculous price without occupation?
Hardly, and so the West can at last rightly boast of its unselfishness in terms of protecting human rights.
Unless the Shari’a representatives destroy them.
The Beginning of a New Era of Crisis
France and the rest of Europe in the focus of investors.
On Tuesday, a statistical storm raged through Europe.
Each country published its GDP data for the third quarter.
The Czech economy stagnated compared to the previous quarter, while Germany and France increased.
But the bond market is breaking all records today.
Investors are keeping an eye not only on Greece, but also on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the European Zone, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries published their preliminary forecasts of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by 0.5%, as expected, and France's GDP grew by 0.4%.
Both countries simultaneously corrected their data for the second quarter, in which Germany recorded higher growth than originally expected (growth by 0.3% rather than 0.1% predicted), while France admitted a slight decline by 0.1% (original data only spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in the third quarter of this year compared to the previous year.
Compared to the previous quarter, however, gross domestic product stagnated and the trend of slowing down economic performance was confirmed, according to the CST.
The results are therefore worse than the forecasts of analysts.
The main events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in the third quarter of this year compared to the previous year, but it stagnated compared to the previous quarter.
According to preliminary and seasonally overcalculated data, the German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter.
In the eurozone as a whole and in the EU, the economy grew by 0.2 per cent from the previous quarter between July and September, in line with analysts’ expectations.
The Greek economy shrank by 5.2 per cent compared to the previous year.
The return on their 10-year government bonds rose to 28.45%.
The yield of Italian and Spanish government bonds rose to their critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries are also beginning to feel problems...
The yield on Czech government bonds remains below 4%, even though the situation in the region is deteriorating.
In Germany, votes are being raised that the ECB should become the creditor of the last instance.
Czechs qualify for Euro
In Montenegro they won 1-0 and now celebrate their qualification for 200 million
The football selection has mastered the most difficult task of the whole season!
Thanks to a well-established goalkeeper <0xC4><0x8C>ech and a magnificent goal from Petr Jirá<0xC4><0x8D>ek, she won 1-0 in Montenegro.
With a large portion of luck, Czech football was able to defend its luxurious advantage from the home game and will once again not be missing in the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the ascension game in a detailed reportage.
Little excitement in the first half and a huge portion of luck in the second.
The Czech selection also won 1-0 thanks to the final weakness of the home team, a brilliant <0xC4><0x8C>ech's and the hero of the day Jirá<0xC4><0x8D>ek in Montenegro and has thus redeemed their ticket for the European Football Championship.
Also due to the precise defensive play of the Czech team, they could only put the Montenegrins under more pressure in the second half.
The bad luck of the game was Damjanovic and Vucinic, who shot two giant odds.
Also thanks to an excellent Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech, the Czech selection will be involved in the European Championships next year, it is also gratifying that the domestic football will receive a premium of about 200 million.
From the very first few minutes, there was a lot of fighting football.
Both teams combined for a long time and so was mainly played around the middle line.
Also in the second half, the pressure of the home team remained out and the wide defeats in front of the penalty area were successfully averted by the Czech defence.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country’s core program.
They formed a living shield.
A few hundred college students formed a living shield around a core object in Iran.
With this gesture, they wanted to demonstrate their support for their country’s nuclear program before a possible Israeli attack.
The students had prayed Tuesday afternoon in front of the object and then announced the death of the United States and Israel.
A few hundred students from the university in Isfahan, Iran, formed a lively shield around the nuclear technology center in Isfahan, where uranium is processed, on Tuesday.
They wanted to show that they were ready to protect their country’s nuclear program, even with their own lives, if necessary.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently noted in its report that Iran has apparently not given up on its efforts to develop a nuclear weapon for a long time.
Israel is also talking about a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Students had prayed in front of the entrance to the complex at noon and then announced the death of the United States and Israel.
In the event of an intentional attack to paralyze the Iranian nuclear program, the Israeli press said the nuclear enrichment plant in Natan’s target would also be located in the center of Isfahan.
The menu of an obese child: it doesn’t eat breakfast and eats sausage for dinner
More than one-third of children aged 9 to 13 have problems with obesity, with 9 percent of all students and 5 percent of all children being overweight.
Recent surveys have shown that obese children are mostly from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
This shows once again how important for the healthy development of a person is the environment in which he grows up and the examples that surround him.
On the tables of obese children, sausages are up to half more often on the table than in families where normal-weight children live.
More than 19 percent of overweight children had fries for dinner on the eve of the education campaign under the motto "obesity is no coincidence".
In families with little kids, sports is not exactly one of the favorite occupations, but it also affects the majority of today's students - only 15 percent responded that their parents find time for active exercise at least once a week.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place last year at the end of the school year, surveying almost 900 children from primary schools across the Czech Republic.
This was already the second year of the action "Obesity is not a coincidence", which is supported by the General Health Insurance and the company Unilever.
So far, more than 12 thousand students from 4th and 8th grades have participated in the project.
Unhealthy diet and lack of exercise in the family are decisive factors that are responsible for the frighteningly increasing number of overweight or even obese children.
"For example, only half of the children surveyed cited eating breakfast-second breakfast-lunch-vesper evening bread five times a day -- one of the main prerequisites for a healthy diet," said one of the survey's findings.
No breakfast and sausage for dinner
Experts point out that even relative small things, such as the regular breakfast time of the family, are important for the healthy development of a child.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 percent of the families of the students eat breakfast.
And - in most families, everyone eats breakfast on their own.
Worst was the finding that breakfast is not eaten at all in every tenth family.
Breakfast is considered to be the cornerstone of a healthy daily diet.
Among other things, the survey test revealed that in the families of overweight children, unhealthy fries are consumed much more often.
And almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet sodas every day (70 percent)
While more than 40 percent of children surveyed do sports, only less than half of their parents do – namely only 15 percent.
Create your own menu
Another part of the survey enabled selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to create their own meal plan based on the choices offered by appetite and opinion.
"What Czech children between 12 and 15 prefer in terms of nutrition is far from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among her favorite foods were many meals, meat dishes and of course sweets.
"Alarming is above all the great popularity of sweet sodas," the final report to this survey emphasizes.
At lunch, i.e. the main dish, pastas prevailed just before poultry.
The children almost did not like legumes and also the popularity of fish and vegetable dishes as lunch was very low.
Return to Health
At the same time, however, the survey also showed that the children are quite willing to change their eating habits when they get the right information.
"In the control group of survey respondents who completed the questionnaire after completing the enlightening talk "Obesity is not a coincidence", in many cases, a significant shift in preferences towards principles of healthy eating was noted," the project's results stated.
This was eye-catching, for example, with the sweet limes, where many children began to give priority to ordinary water.
The children also crossed in the questionnaire much more often poultry or fish as the main dish of the day and were willing to eat less dumplings or sweet foods.
Professionals claim - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introductory article about how stylists learn, I had a bit of memorized that this was a bit too much stuff for the beginning.
I had no idea what was to come.
Lectures by three professionals from the industry, the clothing of problematic figures and a seminar on how "on the square" works.
It's supposed to get worse.
The closer the exam gets, the more information and practical tasks are ahead of us.
But even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is still fully occupied.
This time we discussed with Director Alena (not a single man participates in the course) how to attract a woman who does not have an ideally proportioned figure.
And that is most of us.
Some have a too short neck, others have a too young figure without proper curves and others are chubby.
It is up to the stylist to visually conceal wide shoulders, extend the neck or conjure up the necessary curves.
We also got tips on how to dress a woman like Jennifer Lopez - with a big bust, wide hip and narrow waist - pretty and figure accented, without making her too provocative.
For example, if the difference between waist and hips is so big that the skirt or pants really do not fit, you should have at least one piece cut to measure.
You will certainly not regret this, because well-fitting clothing is simply priceless.
In such a tailor-made skirt you feel much better than in one of the poles that always slides up and down, stands off in the waist, etc.
Young figures can, in turn, allow themselves to wear clothing with folds, bumps, applications, embroidery or cuffing.
With all this information and figure types, I’m glad I have a whole week to go through my mind.
And yet I am afraid that it is almost impossible to do given the task.
Each of the students was assigned a celebrity, for whom she should devise suitable outfits - daywear and evening gown.
In doing so, we should take into account the current look, the fashion style of the corresponding star and its figure type.
I'm supposed to "put on" Miranda Kerr, whom you may know from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
Inside I cheer, because this is for me personally much better, than for example Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has probably gained a hundred kilos lately (well, that's a bit exaggerated), or the young Selena Gomez.
We should cut out the garments from magazines or search the internet, print them out and then graphically edit them.
The "moodboard", as the whole result is called, should then express our very personal style and our relationship to graphic design.
It is very important to also think about the graphic side of styling.
The stylist not only attracts the models purely physically, but also designs the so-called product page in the journals (according to specific specifications, for example, trend handbags, coats, etc.).
That’s what stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about.
But that's not until Sunday.
This means that a stylist must have a good overall overview.
The Saturday lecture, filled with information about figure types, was immediately spiced up by three visitors from the industry:
by stylist Jan Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, by fashion designer Jakub Polanka and by fashion photographer Ben Ren<0xC4><0x8D>.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and that a stylist should be able to take advantage of it.
And a sent-in stylist can work with a single piece of clothing in very different ways.
The magic word is variability.
For example, you can wear a trench coat as usual over the jeans, such as a t-shirt or coat, but you can also wear it on the naked body, wear heel shoes and wear it as a dress.
It is enough to roll up the sleeves or the collar and the whole look looks quite different.
"Play with it," he stressed.
But most of all, the advice was: "First you need to know the rules perfectly."
"Only then can you hurt her," Jakub said.
Finally, I realize why we have to pause all these teachings, what you can combine with what and why, even if you often see something completely different in fashion journals.
Not to mention fashion shows.
Thanks to the photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared a lot more clothing variants than he ultimately photographs.
So for a fashion story with ten pages (to say ten outfits) you have to be prepared to style at least fifteen.
And also that the clothing on the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes looks quite different than in reality.
All of this is to be expected in the design of the outfit.
That image and style sometimes make up half of the success, that was also confirmed by Jan Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>.
All you have to do is look at Madonna, a not-so-brilliant singer whose image and marketing have turned into a world star.
In the Czech Republic, you are more reserved towards the services of a stylist.
Even well-known personalities often consider this to be thrown out money (the main thing is that I bring something that I look like is secondary).
And if any of us can be styled, then we should expect that he or she is very likely to impose a completely different (smaller) size on us than he or she actually needs.
Then you only have to google to find out for sure that the tabloid press writes, the corresponding celebrity has gone back to or gone down, etc.
Jan and Mario urged us on Sunday not to believe that a stylist just needs to focus on fashion and then "assemble" the outfit.
In his work, he must primarily communicate with the people he styles and he must be a balanced psychologist.
Evaluate people without offering themselves and standing up for their opinions.
"If any manager orders us to sift her wardrobe and to add pretty pieces, then we can't clear her the whole wardrobe and say, 'Oh my God, that's terrible.'"
“You have to find at least a few commendable things to recommend what you can contribute to it,” says Mario.
He also showed us very concretely what a so-called "place bag" must include.
So such a bag, which you tie at the waist and carry with you all the necessary property.
In addition to such clear things as scissors, hair removal rollers or safety needles, it also contains such utensils as a nylon thread (this helps the stylist to photograph products, such as handbags or hats), special clips, with which the clothes are ripped at the back, if it is too large (stitched needles or other fabric clips are not capped with it).
But in order not only to listen, but also to try something practical, we learned how to properly glue shoes.
Even when photographing in the studio, where the floor is flat, you can damage the shoe sole, let alone the outside.
We glued and glued...
You should not even touch the shoes with the scissors, so that you do not damage them.
So you have to be really clever.
Mario delighted me by praising my "creation" without restrictions.
The skill mentioned is not exactly my strength.
All of this was only a fraction of what we heard on the second weekend of the course.
One thing has now become clear to me - to dedicate yourself to styling at a professional level is not a breeze.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race across America
Testimonial
The original carefree ride is made by a series of completely avoidable, dilettante mistakes to the routine ride to the early shift.
Although the ambitions were largely met, what good is it if obviously no one wanted to do a little more?
Even before he came to the counter, the new part with the subtitle "The Run" aroused high expectations.
After all, he promised to move the already aged game series "Need for Speed" once again to a new dimension and in the playable demonstration examples, he didn't seem to be just one of many action racing games.
We were also curious about the fitting passages in which the main protagonist gets out of the car and continues on foot.
But as you are already used to with NFS, in the end, much is different than you expected.
Sure - potentially it's quite decent arcade races, but overall, the game is narrowed down by some superfluous mistakes that have been present in this series for more or less a few years.
So they are actually no longer mistakes, but rather signs of a basically incomprehensible laziness of the game developers.
The adventure begins very well.
For the first time, you are introduced to the story, whose main character Jack has certain problems of personal character; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, on the west coast, you get on the steering wheel - with the task of being the first to be in New York.
The basic idea includes a whole series of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and more than fifty individual races.
This means that each race is held on a different track and that the individual stages take place in a different, sufficiently different and interesting environment.
You don’t have the impression for a moment that the game would offer the same thing over and over again.
Some environments are still very pretty to look at, although the technical level of the graphics does not go beyond that of the previous parts of the series.
So nothing world-moving.
But the drive through the desert, through autumnal landscape or high up through deeply snowed landscape looks visually very pleasant.
Occasionally, untypical elements bring a little variety to the individual races.
In the desert, for example, one is surprised by a desert storm that severely restricts the view.
In the mountains, you have to be careful that you are not spilled by an avalanche.
By the way, the individual races are built in fairly well one after the other.
Only a few, but they are enough.
For a while you try to overtake the prescribed number of opponents (in principle, a classic race), then you have time to catch up (classic race against the stopwatch), then you expect a personal duel with a single opponent.
And the police are also involved, who want to mess up the whole thing.
A novelty is passages in which Jack leaves the car.
It’s more about certain interactive animations where Jack escapes from someone and where the player has to help him by pressing the right button at the right moment.
So nothing complicated.
However, it is surprising that there are far fewer such passages in the game than you would expect (concretely only three).
Ultimately, this is more to the advantage of the thing, because so at least this element has no chance of becoming boring - it belongs in the context of the above mentioned elements that make the game more varied.
The driving model walks in the footsteps of the previous parts.
That is, from today’s point of view, it does not tear down trees, on the other hand, you could not say it would be bad.
If you are looking for realistic simulations, you have to look elsewhere.
But an action-packed racing continues to do justice to the local driving model, although you could find better in the competition.
Until then, everything is fine.
Real problems only appear after a while.
In contrast to the driving model, the collision model is not entirely OK.
It is unlikely that a game of this kind will calculate complicated deformations and collisions, but if you have practically no idea how the car behaves before an impact on any object, then obviously everything is not fine.
Typical example: When overtaking or passing by oncoming cars, in some places you "strike" the other cars only slightly, but in other, almost identical situations you get into slingshot and turn wild pirouettes.
Or the carriage will go to scrap.
Thanks to the restart system, it doesn't matter anymore, but it's annoying.
The restarts are solved in this way: if you have total damage or land far away from the track, then you throw the game back to the last point of the track.
Only - in each race you only have five restarts.
Once you’ve exhausted it, everything starts from scratch.
So the restarts are more like a tool, in case something doesn’t work, but you shouldn’t rely on it.
But sometimes even the restart doesn’t help, there’s nothing else that helps but to learn the critical section from the mind.
It is extremely unpleasant that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, you have to go through some curves in a very specific way, otherwise you simply do not pass through.
Elsewhere, you always encounter "civil" cars in the same configuration, whether you are first or fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is especially annoying in situations when you see the opponent passing by two cars in front of you, but until you arrive there, the cars are already in such a position that you have to drive them around or brake.
And it doesn’t matter when you arrive there, because everything is designed so that it always comes close to your nose to this situation.
The counterparts have even more advantages.
Throughout the game there are a few places where you are always overtaken by the same opponent at the same place and again here without regard to the timing.
The most insane is at the end of the game on the long bridge that you pass in the opposite direction.
The counterpart must obviously overtake you here on the devil come out.
And if he is already in front of you, then of course he takes your sight, so that you initially drive your own car a few times in Klump.
Sure - you just want to make the game more exciting and exciting, but this intention is so clear that it quickly spoils the joy of the game.
And that’s a pity, because despite the simpler driving model, the game is overall quite entertaining and in some places so action-packed that you almost don’t know where your head is.
And in principle, it doesn't matter what "blame" is on it - the concept with fifty unique routes, the arrangement of the races in a way that no boredom can come up, or something completely different...
An unusual idea is also the change of car during the races.
You should not overlook the gas stations on the route, because it is here that you can change the car, although in most cases the car that you currently have is enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for the urban areas, the strong American limousines for the straight highways and exotic super sports cars for the technical rides, for example on the serpentines in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the mode of the game history goes the task mode (challenges) - i.e. the races in the individual locations you know from the story.
Here, there are not only medals, but also experience points to win for your own profile, which is common for the tasks (challenges) and history.
In order to get to the higher driver level, different items must be unlocked: from the car to the backgrounds for the profile.
This is simultaneously connected to the online function Autolog, which compares its own results with those of other players and also provides further collective functions.
One of the other incomprehensible carvings is a situation in the last race of history.
Here you get by car into a subway tunnel (for my sake), where you can rest in the dark on the rails for a long time (for my sake).
On the speedometer, figures look between 150 and 200 km/h (for my sake), but there comes suddenly a subway from behind and drives an uncompromising to scrap.
In our editorial team we will probably argue for a long time about whether this was a blackout of the game designers or whether the authors think we are so stupid.
The technical side is nothing overwhelming but at least the overall visual impression is quite appealing in most cases and even brilliant here and there.
It is all the more annoying that at some exciting moments the refresh rate slows down and this is sometimes quite dramatic.
However, this applies in particular to accidents involving a larger number of parties, where a continuous FPS is of no use anyway.
The sound playback is OK and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to address as broad a scale as possible rather young audiences, a soundtrack a lá "something" was created - but who buys such a game because of the music?!
Need for Speed: The Run: The Run: Need for Speed: The Run: The Run
If the game wasn’t diminished by the above-mentioned totally unnecessary mistakes, we could have claimed with the tone of the chest that The Run is the best piece by NFS in recent years.
But that’s how the game seems to be somehow unfinished.
It’s a great pleasure in itself, but you should be prepared to make these mistakes with the power of airport headlights.
Concert of the "Students of the Velvet Revolution" with singing ensembles of the Charles University
The Festival Festa Academica now offers for the third time the combination of the World Student Day with the anniversary of the Velvet Revolution and this together with the music experience.
During the festival, we present ourselves to the twenty specialist and university choirs.
The focus of the festival is on the two concerts that will take place on November 17.
"The Charles University has a large share in the festival."
"The choir of the Faculty of Education and the Faculty of Humanistic Studies are also represented among the participants, and the festival committee also includes Rector Václav Hampl," said Jakub <0xC4><0x8C>aloun, head of the organization team.
The absolute highlight of the festival is the public concert of specialist school choirs, which takes place on November 17 from 2 pm on the square in front of the National Technical Library in Dejvice.
On the program is the composition of the important Czech jazzer Karel R<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xBE>i<0xC4><0x8D>ka "Celebration Jazz Mass".
In the evenings the concert "Students of the Velvet Revolution" (Studenty sametu) takes place in the gala rooms of the Volkshaus in Vinohrady, where university choirs also perform, choirs of the Charles University not excluded.
Festa Academica aims to not only celebrate World Student Day and commemorate the 22nd anniversary of the Velvet Revolution, but also to present choral music to the public at the highest level and to promote the creative cooperation of young people.
The main organizer is the Association of Czech Choirs in cooperation with the Johannes Kepler Gymnasium.
Bohuslav Svoboda, the mayor of Prague and Václav Hampl, the rector of the Charles University, took over the patronage of the entire event.
The festival takes place from 16 to 20 November in Prague and Pardubice.
In addition to festive concerts, the schedule also includes numerous music meetings, student happanings, matinees and other events.
Detailed information can be found on the website of the festival www.festaacademica.cz
EU Ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have the reputation of negativists and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has tangibly lost balance among the individual institutions."
I didn't expect such a hard war to burn out."
"It will take five, six years for the waves to smooth and everyone will get used to their new role," began Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassador to the European Union, quite sharply her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
In the first part of her lecture, in which she succeeded in describing the individual institutions of the EU and their mutual relations in such a clear and understandable way that she could have envyed so many lecturers at the Faculty of Law of the University of Charles.
Ms Vicenová also praised the new permanent chairman of the Council of Europe Herman Van Rompuy:
"At first, criticism was loud, he was too inconspicuous - a gray official who was not fit for such a role, but I have to say it took everyone's breath away how well he took care of the matter.
“He is a person who is able to listen patiently to twenty-seven member states, to communicate with them and, above all, who has clear ideas of how to proceed with the EU.
The new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained it in response to the question: Who is this - the European Union? Which number should I call?", which is an important step towards unifying and improving the readability of EU policies towards countries such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us from our oil-bearing quarrels
Mrs Vicenová also devoted herself to the agenda on which the European Union lived, lives and intends to live in the near future.
The Czech presidency of two years ago was a success.
The Czechs had mastered the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also hosted the Eastern Partnership Summit.
She described the fall of the government during the presidency as a major negative, which had severely damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently busy.
In the words of the ambassador, the situation was rather hectic not only in the Presidency but also in the subsequent crisis, which has not yet been overcome.
And the EU’s seven-year budget still needs to be approved, which makes things much more complicated due to today’s economic situation.
Whether it will be a slim and sparse budget, which industries will be given priority, which countries will be more and which will be less funded - all this is now on the agenda.
The ambassador also recalls her own slogan with which she came to Brussels: "Understandable about Europe".
“If I don’t like something, it’s grey shortcuts, foreign words and jargon that no one understands.
How should I, as a citizen, really know if you really think of curvy or round cucumbers and bananas of different sizes in Brussels, or if someone really wants to ban us from quarrels?
It would also have liked to use the soil of the EU to get more Czechs into European institutions.
Europe of two or different speeds in view
In the opinion of the EU ambassador, the Czechs are in the reputation of being Eurosceptics, who perceive more the negative than the positive side of the matter.
The weak representation of Czechs in European institutions is all the more annoying.
This is due to many factors, including the restraint of our candidates, their inability to write letters of motivation and, last but not least, the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, it also highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, the so-called V4.
"Believe me, if a Pole or a Hungarian comes to me and a Slovak is nearby, then the Frenchman next to me will say, 'Hey, what do you put the heads together - is this your V4 again?' and make a pretty sour look.
According to Vicenové, the EU expects tough rules for the budget policies of the member states in the future.
As much more real than a "European Federation", it regards the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds.
"We have the countries of the eurozone and the countries outside the eurozone.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the institute of strengthened cooperation."
"For the first time, it was said that only those countries should cooperate who want it and those who don't want it should stand quietly aside."
"There will be more and more such institutions, which will ultimately lead to a strong 'Europe of different speeds'," Mrs Vicenová expects.
In this regard, it also recognised the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in enforcing the principle that all issues affecting the EU as a whole must be discussed by all Member States and not just by the countries of the eurozone.
Brand Story:
Innovator IBM enters the second century of its existence
If you wanted to look for a suitable word that most accurately characterizes IBM's strategy, this would probably be the word "longevity".
For the general public, IBM is synonymous with technological revolution, known as a modern company, although a century has passed since it was founded.
The foundation for this longevity was already laid by their first boss - the visionary Thomas J. Watson sen.
Already he represented the slogan, countless worldwide problems could easily be solved if people were willing to think a bit.
His slogan "Think!" thus became the hallmark of the future giant's life (and at the same time the title of the company's in-house magazine, which began to be published at IBM in 1935).
This was also the basis of Watsen’s well-prepared corporate culture.
"For us from IBM, this long-term thinking means a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was successful for a whole century because it remained true to its principles and did not shy away from changing everything else around it.
This allowed us to transform technology, business and society in the course of our first century.
We hope to achieve even more in the next hundred years,” said Samuel J. Palmisano, today’s director of the company on the occasion of the anniversary.
Well-thought-out system
As early as the 1930s, Watson had social care for his employees - in a similar way to the entrepreneur Ba<0xC5><0xA5>a in Czechoslovakia: the IBM people had paid leave as one of the first American employees, an insurance policy by the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as work clothes and a well-thought-out pay system for the best newcomers and merchants.
IBM’s long-term relationships with its customers are equally well-informed.
The company was brilliant in talent promotion from the start – being one of the first companies in the world to eliminate discrimination – and was able to choose accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan is also that Palmisan at the head of IBM will be replaced by a woman next year – Virginia Rometty.
She has been with IBM for 30 years, and has previously held the position of Sales, Marketing and Strategy Manager.
In recent years, IBM has been making so-called online brainstormings, from which many future strategies and innovations grow.
No wonder - there are enough ideas, after all, almost half a million people are employed in the company.
An institution with a good reputation
Their unwavering position in business guarantees the company a strong image, both internally and externally.
"From the beginning, IBM had the concept of an institution rather than a mere technology company," said Economist, Harvard Business School professor and author of a book about IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
“IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems using technology,” added George Colony of consulting firm Forrester Research.
As the company itself emphasizes, it is a difference to be only present in the market or to shape it directly through this presence.
IBM – called “Big Blue” in the states of its logo because of its family history – has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It is one of the most versatile technology companies ever – IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in an incredible range of products – from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all American technology companies, IBM holds the most patents, and five of its employees have already been awarded the Nobel Prize.
His most famous inventions include, for example, ATMs, credit cards, financial swap, barcode or even the floppy disk.
At around $220 billion in market capitalization, IBM was the second-largest technology company this year (equal to Apple), overtaking Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
The look ahead
Not all products and innovations met the taste of today's customers - unhappy were, for example, the attempt with its own operating system OS/2, the online service Prodigy or even the computers IBM PC jr.
“Business is based on moving forward, so you can’t be emotionally bound to the past,” says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That’s why IBM has no problem building its foundations on different platforms – and if they don’t work, they’ll leave again.
In contrast to the opponent Microsoft, which in principle with its operating system Windows stands and falls.
Promising technologies
In IBM’s profits, services, software and hardware account for one-fifth of the total.
In 1990, hardware was the most represented, with a share of more than fifty per cent.
Since 2000, IBM has sold $15 billion worth of profitable assets, but at the same time invested $58 billion in the purchase of future-proof technologies.
IBM continues to invest in these investments after 2008, when the modern financial crisis swept the world for the first time like a storm.
Here too, IBM remained faithful to the legacy of its first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who increased his investment volume in the middle of the Great Depression.
So far, it seems that the company IBM survives today’s crisis unharmed.
Since 2008, the value of IBM’s shares has risen by 120% in a rocket-like manner, and the company’s net profit is growing continuously.
IBM’s corporate slogan is: everything can be changed – except the values.
This is also why we can expect this flexible giant to cope with the next crisis.
IBM History: From Cheese Cutter to Spaceflight
Founded one hundred years ago in New York, IBM (International Business Machines) had a rather complicated name at first - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It was not until 1924 that it took over the name IBM – originally a brand name for a subsidiary in Canada and South America.
IBM was founded by the merger of four companies whose history dates back to the 1980s.
They possessed technologies such as the famous punctuation card clocks to record the start and end of work.
The architect of this new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who also chaired the Supervisory Board until 1930.
And it was Flint who hired the head of the competition company Thomas J. Watson to help him manage the company.
This leader then even eclipsed the founders of IBM – based on Watson’s ideas to this day, the company’s invincible culture and identity.
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as the name suggests, began manufacturing and distributing all sorts of machines for trade - from sausage and cheese cutters to cash registers.
In the first four decades of running the company, Watson doubled his revenues to $9 million and the company gradually expanded to all continents.
Watson was so essential to the company that he sat in the chair for forty years, only then was he replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, IBM technicians and computers helped NASA guide flights into space – to Mercury and Saturn, and in 1969 also the famous human flight to the moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first computer family with the same computing architecture - the IBM System/360 series.
A classic PC, which set the computer standard at the time, was launched in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but on the other hand, it bought the consultant share of the company PricewaterhouseCoopers and thus entered fully into the business of consulting and high-value services.
The strategy that IBM has been paying off over the last three years is the “Smart Planet” concept.
It embodies the intention to use technologies wisely in previously unplanned areas, e.g. to improve the situation in transport and urban administration.
In the retail sector, IBM recently launched the “Smarter Commerce” platform to help retailers guide the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
As early as 1932, IBM established a branch in the then Czechoslovakia - the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM <0xC4><0x8C>R also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The Central and Eastern European Headquarters is located in Prague, where there is also a world-class top-level research team that deals with voice recognition technology.
Darina Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta - you can keep this donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová (53) says - now it's over!
After her husband Josef Rychtá<0xC5><0x99> (53) became their lover by the patron of Iveta Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ová (45) Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and come home.
But now the patience is finally over and she has set clear rules for the rest of her life.
"Joseph can come home, but no more than my partner," explained D. Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová.
When Darina Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová offered refuge to the singer I. Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ová in her own house, she probably would not have even dreamed of what would happen to her husband.
When Iveta moved out and back to <0xC5><0x98>í<0xC4><0x8D>any at her insistence after 30 days, Joseph immediately went with her.
He even publicly admitted that he loved her.
Over time, Darina resigned, and it even seemed as if she wanted to reconcile with her unfaithful husband - but now she finally gave him the running pass.
Rychytá<0xC5><0x99> does not care who his wife sleeps with
If Rychtá<0xC5><0x99> Iveta Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ová should leave in the future, then he will certainly not receive open arms at home.
“He is the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to end his days in our common home, then I will not drive him out.”
"However, not as a beloved, lost old donkey, but as a person with whom I still have certain attachments," Ms. Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová revealed; but she also said that she had already separated from him emotionally and insisted on mutual decency alone.
The fact that Darina locked him the back door, Joseph bears with dignity so far.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'm staying with Iveta, that doesn't change anything."
"My wife wants a paper marriage and I respect that."
"The company continues to run, I take care of the repairs, the garden, the property, I make the purchases."
"I talk to Darina normally, but we don't share the bed," said J. Rychtá<0xC5><0x99> (the newspaper) Blesk.
If Darina wants to find a new love, he doesn't want to stop her.
“We don’t sleep together, so I don’t care if she has a boyfriend or who that is.
I realize that this is my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and therefore I take all responsibility.
The worst female vices: How about you?
If you ask the men to name some typical female vices, they will invariably shake some out of their sleeves.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, in which we review a few unsuitable things that make the blood flow in the veins of the men?
Shopping addiction
Does your husband accuse you of being a shopping addict?
Do you need to buy at least one fight each week?
Do you like to go shopping and can it be a little more during promotions?
In your case, it is really a weakness.
Some women are at least aware of this and try to keep their shopping desire half under control.
But hand in hand, what woman can stand to stroll through a clothing store in search of a well-fitting outerwear and not try all (in all possible color combinations) in the cabin?
Although shopping is a hobby for most women, for men it is often pure hell.
Think about how many times you've told your husband, you'd better stay outside.
Constant dissatisfaction
“Am I not too fat?”
"I would have to lose at least five kilos - should I start jogging or doing gymnastics?"
“Do I like you at all?”
Does this seem familiar to you?
Yeah, yeah.
Then you are probably one of those women who are obsessed with how they look.
That doesn’t mean you should let go, but many men are allergic to it if their wife constantly complains about her appearance.
The stronger sex agrees - with increasing frequency of complaints, women are becoming more and more incompatible.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It is a battle against windmills.
Clean windows, wipe tiles and dust, rub the tub - and this at least twice a week.
Do you scold your partner because he is once again trampling on the clean tiles with dirty shoes, you scold the children because the just rubbed sink is already dirty again and because the glass door at the living room cabinet already has fingerprints again, where polishing makes so much trouble?
If you suffer from this kind of "deviance", then you should know that you should not exaggerate and that order and cleanliness in family life are not the first priority.
This immeasurable sense of purity can ultimately also harm the mutual relationships and, above all, the peace in the family.
Sticheln
"Dirty gymnastics pants get in the laundry basket."
“Do you really want to put on the old socks again tomorrow?”
"You don't just throw a wet towel on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a tirade, you should not be surprised that this brings him to the palm of the hand.
Of course, that’s not bad, they just want everything to be in order.
If the men knew this, then the women might not need to complain so much.
Gossip and gossip
Some women like to clap and clap, there is whispering behind their backs or even slander or you forge alliances.
Women are focused on relationships, which is why they like to hedge through such topics, such as - who, where, with whom, how and why.
Probably every one of us women has a bit of harmless gossip and gossip in stock.
Hands on the heart - this is probably all women's own.
But this is not to be confused with gossipers of the coarsest caliber, to whom nothing and no one is sacred, who despise everyone around them and who pose a significant danger, especially for women’s collectives.
Jágr and Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek helped Philadelphia win with their assists
Ice hockey striker Jaromír Jágr played a major role in the NHL's 2 assists on Monday in Philadelphia's 5:3 victory on the ice in Carolina, making him the most prolific Czech player in the NHL.
In both cases, Claude Giroux was the beneficiary of the review of the thirty-nine-year-old ice hockey star, who added another assistant and was named the best player of the match.
Jakub Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek also recorded two assists in the same game.
Jágr claimed to reporters after the game that he had prophesied Giroux a great evening.
"Even before the game, I'm telling him he's going to have a hat trick today."
I kind of felt that."
"Sometimes a feeling like that comes across," Jágr explained, after whose action Giroux scored a goal on the first shot of the Flyers.
A little later, the second hit also had "a Czech trace".
Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek won the puck behind the Hurricanes' gate and presented it to the successful Maxim Talbot between the circles.
A second before the start of the first third, home player Patrick Dwyer scored a short hand, but the second third then returned to the Flyers.
Concretely Giroux.
In collaboration with Jágr, he scored his third goal, after which Wayne Simmonds directed his shot to the fourth goal.
“I love playing with him.”
"I'm not saying he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely one of the best three," Jágr commended his center.
“I wouldn’t have thought in my life that at the end of my career I would be playing with such a hockey player as I did with him.”
"I'm very happy about that."
"I cut my game to myself."
"All those years in the NHL, my fellow players have been setting their game on me and now the spear is turning around," Jágr smiled.
Carolina made play even more dramatic - through the hits of Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, who prevailed from a penalty shot, came close to a goal.
Matt Read, however, prevented any further complication, in which he was successful in excess of two against one.
"Excellent Pronger still acted in our zone."
"He caught the puck, I took a ride and (read) moved to more distant posts."
"I tried to hit him and I'm glad it worked out," Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek described the last hit of the game from his point of view.
This victory put Philadelphia at the head of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defensive player of Montreal Jaroslav <0xC5><0xA0>pa<0xC4><0x8D>ek injured himself in the game against Buffalo and resigned in the second third because of an injury to the upper body.
The Candiens, in addition to their experienced Beck, also paid their lead an undefeated in the penalty shoot-out 2:3.
One of the penalty shots could not be transformed by Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Plekanec.
More than the lost points, the coach of the home team probably hurt the high disease-related failure in the defensive - the game they only played with five defensive players to the end.
"That's bad."
"We ended the encounter with only one experienced player, the rest were young players."
"But nothing can be done, we have to deal with that," said Jacques Martin.
"With every change, one wave of attack after another and we had nothing to oppose it."
“We should have made the game easier and brought the puck out of our third.”
There were still reserves here," said P. K. Subban, one of the defenders.
Czech goalkeeper Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Pavelec withdrew thirty shots from Tampa Bay, contributing significantly to the 5:2 win over Winnipeg.
The goals of the Jets, which ended a series of five defeats, included five different shooters.
Development of travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, there were only five approved state travel agencies in the former <0xC4><0x8C>SSR: <0xC4><0x8C>edok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
The travel agencies at the time mainly sold only travel to the socialist Eastern Bloc countries, in the West then only selected ones were allowed.
And so Czech tourists travelled to the Baltic Sea (in the German Democratic Republic - the GDR), to the Soviet Union (Sochi on the peninsula of Crimea on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and to Hungary to the Balaton.
A slight exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when you were also allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia embarked on a pro-Western course and therefore travel to Yugoslavia was severely restricted.
A great paradox of those socialist times was that not even citizens of the Eastern Bloc (i.e. also the Czechoslovaks) were allowed to travel freely within the framework of the socialist countries.
For example, if a citizen of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSR wanted to travel individually to Poland or even to the Soviet Union, he would need a so-called invitation letter, otherwise individual travel would not be possible.
Even then, the travel agencies also offered travel to the West, but then you had to accept huge snakes or also spend the night in a sleeping bag in front of the travel agency, or at least have "good acquaintances" in the travel agency.
Even so, things had not gone well.
The so-called foreign exchange commitment - the condition for a trip to the West - was only given to "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so without the foreign exchange commitment it would have been impossible to raise the necessary funds (western currency) for a trip to the West.
The vast majority of Czechs therefore spent their holidays inland, no wonder that the Czechs bought countless weekend houses and datches - a habit that continues to this day.
The velvet revolution of 1989 was followed by a travel revolution of the Czechs.
While until 1989 a holiday in the GDR or in Bulgaria was the measure of all things, last year the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their holidays abroad in countries all over the world.
A huge paradox, of which we are no longer aware today, is the fact that you could not travel to the currently most popular holiday country of the Czechs - Croatia until 1989, because it was part of the then Yugoslavia.
Right from the beginning of the 90s of the last century, the foreign exchange obligation in the neighbouring Western European countries was abolished, which caused a huge wave of short visits, especially to Vienna in Austria and to Germany.
The Czechoslovaks simply couldn’t get enough of their travels to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to be there for at least a few days.
For example, the Czech holidaymakers slept in the tent in the park when traveling to Paris, because who would have had the money for accommodation in a hotel or in a guesthouse at the time.
A typical feature of Czech trips abroad at the time was a trunk packed with canned food, beer and permanent sausage etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the freely exchangeable Czech crown - after decades, our tourists were finally able to buy the Western currency freely.
Our level of living and, as a result, the average salaries increased, which led to another important moment in 1997.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, travel agencies began to regularly prepare charter flights after 1997, making air travel incredibly affordable compared to the past, thanks to the ability to negotiate volume discounts.
By the end of the 1990s, the Czechs, with the exception of the United States, had already exchange-free payments with all the highly developed countries of the world, making travel even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of "post-velvety" travel came in 2000, when, thanks to the high demand, the first direct charter flight was completed to an exotic country - to Thailand.
Since then, direct charter flights with Czech passengers have been flying to far-away sunny countries every year; this year, twelve exotic destinations are flying directly from the Czech Republic.
About 100 thousand Czechs travel to exotic countries every year!
Another significant moment in the epoch that marked our “post-revolutionary” development came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the United States lifted the visa requirement for Czech tourists, making our country one of the most advanced countries in the world.
In 2008, the Czechs spent for the first time more than half of their holiday abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history spent more than 15 thousand CZK per capita on a single holiday stay, including the costs at the resort.
The general meeting is expected to find a new chairman - again a stalemate threatens.
For almost five months, Czech football has not had a chairman and threatens that the successor of Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek at the head of the Czech Football Association (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R) will not even be known after the extraordinary general meeting in Nymburk on Thursday.
To date, there has been no agreement on the voting order.
And without this, there is no voting at all possible on the three potential successors.
Three interested parties want to manage Czech football - Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Paclík.
In June, Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek resigned from his position, urging his colleagues to agree and find a strong personality to lead football in the future.
Only - in the era after Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek, the old quarrels between the two association chambers broke out again, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This became clear on September 16, when the new chairman was to be elected.
The delegates to the Annual General Meeting had come to the People’s House in Prague’s Smíchov district for nothing, because the trial did not lead to any result and it was not just about the election itself.
It was not even possible to agree on who was actually entitled to vote at the full assembly - only the statutory representatives or even the officials with a power of attorney.
At least partial agreement was reached on this point, to which also contributed the recommendation of the Institute for State and Law, whose opinion is that representation on a power of attorney is not acceptable.
However, the disputes over the electoral order continue.
Neither did the Executive Committee clarify the matter, in whose meetings, whether ordinary or extraordinary, in principle nothing else is on the agenda.
Even though views on the election changed a few times, the neuralgic point remained the same.
The question is: what should be done in the third round to avoid a stalemate situation?
"The point of dispute concerns whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes, or whether to find a completely different model," stated Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Svoboda, one of the three deputy chairmen of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R, who represents professional football in management.
According to the statutory model, in the third round, the candidate who receives the greater percentage of support in the chamber for which he is running wins.
Moravia is reportedly willing to compromise that the candidate who receives the higher vote from both chambers will win.
The Czech side, in turn, insists on the condition that the winner receives at least a two-thirds majority in this percentage count.
"Then the two preliminary rounds no longer make any sense at all, this mode would call into question the whole bi-chamber concept," Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, who would best not to bend the electoral order, but to vote according to valid statutes.
Surprisingly, Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Paclík agrees with this, even if it turns out that the statutory electoral order is most likely to meet Pelta of all candidates.
"My wish is to be elected as far as possible in accordance with the Statute."
"So that no nonsense substitutes are devised, as at the last Annual General Meeting," said the owner (of the football club) Victoria Plze<0xC5><0x88>, who for the first time runs and in his statements distinguished himself especially against Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
In his opinion, the new chairman will be known in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates will also work together constructively in the future.
"The potential qualification of the national team for the European Football Championship today would certainly contribute to calming the minds."
"If football is only riding on the euphoric wave, then the willingness to cooperate is also greater," says the Jablonec official, who brings the greatest experience of all three adepts, both at a professional and regional level.
Rajchl is more reluctant.
"I hope for an agreement, but unfortunately the situation is ambiguous."
"This is not a matter between the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are certain efforts to 'bend' the regulations for their own purposes."
"Therefore, a renewed blockade at the Annual General Meeting is not ruled out."
"I hope, however, that common sense ultimately wins," Rajchl said.
Only - a lot of time to agree on all sides is no longer left.
Some negotiations are supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the football generality will be complete by the time of the qualifying game at all.
The charter aircraft, with which Dalibor Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era and Rajchl, among others, were to fly to Podgorice, could not even take off in Prague in the morning due to a technical failure and so they feverishly searched for a replacement variant, how to bring a part of the executive committee to the venue of the barrage incident.
In the end, the meeting at ministerial level is probably decisive, which it is supposed to be on Wednesday.
Josef Dobe<0xC5><0xA1>, the Minister for Education, Youth and Physical Education, would have liked to move the divided parties within the country’s largest sports federation to an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: government grants, the trustworthiness of Czech football and also the upcoming Annual General Meeting of <0xC4><0x8C>STV, which is supposed to lead the Czech sport in the new direction after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclík goes into the fight for the chairman’s position because he sees no suitable candidate
If Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Paclík, the head of the Pilsner footballers, had been able to identify a strong candidate before the extraordinary general meeting, who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new president of the Czech Football Federation (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R), he would not have engaged in the fight for this top position at all.
"If there was a good candidate, I would fight for him and give up the election."
"But in the current situation, it was not possible to find such an adept," said Paclík <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
So the main reason for Paclík to go into the duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl is to prevent the alleged favorite of the election, Pelta, from getting to the top of FA<0xC4><0x8C>R.
Paclík also emphasizes that in the event of his victory, he intends to exercise the function of chairman only for one year, i.e. until 2013, until the date of the ordinary general meeting.
In the position of chairman, he would have liked to have seen an experienced top manager who is not too much involved in football.
“I spoke personally with some of the people in question.”
“I can’t believe some people told me they didn’t want to identify with Czech football at the moment.
"Such views would have liked to change," he said.
Most of all, Paclík allegedly disrupts Pelta's connection with the chairman of the Pilsen District Football Association Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial reputation who is considered a powerful lobbyist behind the scenes, with the ability to influence delegate votes at general meetings.
For this reason, it is unacceptable for Paclík that Pelta should hold the position of chairman.
"Today's state of affairs would be preserved and in Czech football it would not progress at all."
"The support of Berbr, a clever businessman, would be twice as bad for football," Paclík said.
He also suggests that Pelta's name fell some time ago in connection with phone interceptions to investigate a corruption case, but that Pelta emerged with impunity.
"I don't know what prestige a win by Pelta should bring to football."
"And how would we stand in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said <0xC5><0x99>ekl Paclík, who said his previous statement, "he will sell the Pilsner football club if Pelta becomes chairman," but already sees something more serene.
However, if Paclík were to win the Thursday election, he could imagine a future cooperation with Pelta.
Similarly, another candidate – Rajchl, who had supported Paclík before the October Annual General Meeting, which ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I would go to."
"He has great abilities".
"I could well imagine him, for example, as the head of the national team."
"But I don't think he's capable of leading the association as a manager."
"I don't put my nose in matters I don't understand about," said Paclík, who had caused a stir in September that he was at the head of the arbitration committee with Lu<0xC4><0x8F><0xC4><0x9B>k Macela, who replaced Dagmar Damková.
Paclík himself claims that he feels fit for the role of president of the association.
And relying on his skills in managing private companies, since last summer he is also the head of Pilsen, who with his support in May celebrated the first triumph in the league.
"I have the power to change something in the football environment and contribute to some cultivation of it."
"In order to limit the influence of certain stakeholders who tend to influence disciplinary and appeals commissions, which degenerates into disgusting situations," Paclík said, who makes no heel out of his antipathy to Sparta boss Daniel K<0xC5><0x99>etínsk<0xC3><0xBD>, for example.
One of his priorities was the strengthening of relations between the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he would lobby political leaders for more money from the lottery tax to flow into the sport.
"This is one of the crucial things that the new chairman should devote himself to."
"When it comes to taxing gambling, as the political parties declare, I understand their arguments, but they also have to say plainly where the money is going," he said.
His connection to Pilsner Klub does not see Paclík as a handicap either, although he himself stresses that the chairman of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R must be "non-partisan".
Pelta, in turn, is connected to Jablonec, Rajchl to the Prague Dukla.
"That's not exactly ideal."
"But it doesn't make much sense in my opinion to transfer my shares at Pilsner Klub to a third person in order to return after a year and a half," Paclík said.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R, which will rule out a stalemate situation in the future.
Two days before the annual general meeting of the football association, one of the candidates for the chairmanship, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if he was elected, he would make a strong commitment to the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R to get new statutes, which would rule out disputes about the electoral order in the future.
The official from Jablonec is confident before the Thursday negotiations in Nymburk and believes that the election campaign will certainly defuse if the Czech elections are successful.
Pelta had already promised before the unrealised election in September that he would focus on the national team and the raising of funds in the event of his election.
He decided only at the last moment to participate in the elections before the last Annual General Meeting and so the two-month break would help him to defend his ideas about the management of football and to present them in a broader context.
"People at all levels are dedicated to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the chairman to be known on Thursday."
"He feels that it is high time for the association to be led by someone," says the man, who is primarily affiliated with the Jablonecer club, but who also worked for many years at Sparta and on the executive committee.
This is also why he believes he has sufficient experience to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that the euphoria that prevailed at the time of Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek is responsible for today’s problems with the election.
"Unfortunately, at the June General Meeting, statutes were approved that were not as perfect as everyone had assumed.
If they had not allowed different interpretations, we would have had a chairman from September onwards," Pelta said.
It was precisely the revision of the most important document of the Citizens' Union that he used as an enticement for delegates.
“If I should become chairman, I will personally take care of it and be willing to take personal responsibility if it doesn’t work out.”
"This is a principled thing without which he cannot be," Pelta claims.
In addition, he does not try to distinguish himself from his counterparts.
He had already announced earlier that he could imagine working with Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl, whom he recognizes because of his legal education, and he knows well that his opponent would be his first deputy.
Even Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Paclík had not attacked him for a long time, who in turn did not leave a dry thread on Pelta.
In football, he has been moving for over a year and can already point to certain successes."
"However, his attacks were derogatory and many people were shocked by his election campaign."
"For this reason, too, many now doubt his real character," Pelta addressed his opponent, who probably remains faithful to his proclamations, which he already expressed in September.
In his opinion, his most powerful weapon is the knowledge of football from the lowest playing classes to the national team.
And this should be the flagship of Czech football.
"I would also endeavour to end all affairs - from the Causa Bohemians to the echoes of last year's corruption scandal."
"Immediately after that, I would plunge into negotiations with the private and state sectors to ensure sufficient funding for the whole football," said the forty-six-year-old candidate <0xC4><0x8C>TK two months ago.
At the time, he also promised that his entry into the top of Czech football would not mean personnel cleansing.
"I would first have to familiarize myself with the work content of all employees," he said in the direction of Strahov, where there is understandably nervousness due to the long anarchy.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that accompany the upcoming Annual General Meeting, he believes that the delegates will not go to Nymburk in vain on Thursday.
"If really the only controversial point should be how to choose in the third round, then we'll get over it."
“Football needs credibility and it only wins it back when it finally has a new leader,” Pelta remains optimistic two days before the possibly crucial day of his official career.
Rajchl promises that FA<0xC4><0x8C>R will start working hard under him
If former deputy chairman Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl were to be elected as the new chairman of the Czech Football Association at the Annual General Meeting on Thursday, it would allegedly spoil the mood of many people in the association.
Rajchl promises that in the event of his election, he will start working hard.
He wants to introduce system changes and hold the members of the executive committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also pledged to resolve the Bohemians case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money into football and otherwise continue the work that previous chairman Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek has begun.
“As president, I want to dedicate myself to football as a whole.”
From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, to national elections, professional football, to high-performance youth football."
"I'm not saying that I want to do everything alone," Rajchl said in a conversation for <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
"I am a team player and therefore I want to distribute the competences in the Executive Committee in such a way that each member is dedicated to a certain area."
And I’m going to distribute hard tasks so that football progresses with milestones in every segment.”
Many would not be delighted with this because, instead of just criticizing the work of others, they would now have to start working really hard themselves," he added.
Due to the critical atmosphere in the football movement, I have considered not running at all.
“I know I work 20 hours a day.”
"But I need to know that it makes sense and that people are standing behind me who don't constantly throw sticks between my legs and question every step I take," he said as an explanation of why he hesitated.
“A lot of people told me I shouldn’t give up, otherwise others would too.”
“It’s a trust that can’t be wasted,” he said.
He is also said to be motivated to continue the work he started under Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
“In two years, we’ve done a lot of work and I don’t want to throw that away.”
"Procedures have been started, which will probably only come into effect in a few years and I would only be reluctant to see someone stop them," he said, expressing his concern that in the event that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta - was elected, the situation could return to the times before Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
"I believe in systematic action and that's something that Mirek Pelta doesn't bring."
"Behind him are people who would make football so that he would only be there for the elect."
I may be accused of some things, but not that I am biased."
“I try to be objective.”
"I want football for everyone, because then it's going well for everyone and not just the chosen ones," Rajchl remarked.
He also disagrees with the claim that he is only a chairman of the Czechs.
"Although some people say the opposite, I really intend to do the best possible for Moravia."
"For example, it's time to consider whether you should not divide the league into a Czech and a Moravian section, whose winners then each ascended to the first league."
"Then it could not happen that today only three Moravian clubs play in the league, which is a problem especially for the young players in Moravia," Rajchl says.
Now that the head of the Pilsner club, Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Paclík, has joined the fight for the position of chairman, Rajchl does not dare to assess his chances of being elected.
"I feel a strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me as its deputy chairman and now recognizes that clear successes are behind me," Rajchl said, who also sees the saving of tens of millions of crowns for unfavourable contracts, the agreement of television contracts and the negotiations on the lottery law as his success.
On the other hand, he blames himself in part for the fact that the association does not pull a single string.
While he says Pelta "is disqualified from the start to restore confidence in Czech football," he thinks the second rival - Paclík - is a strong candidate who really has something to offer football.
"No one can question that he has done excellent work in Pilsen in just one year."
"If he were elected, he would probably continue the things that Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek initiated and also the staffing in the commissions he would obviously not change in principle."
He certainly wouldn't want to turn things in his favor," Rajchl says about his rival.
Europe's most beautiful pools
Jump into the blue
by Julia Stanek
UFO-look paddling pools, splendid pools in Budapest: those who travel through Europe can experience their blue wonder - and after a city tour or a hike, rest their tired legs in bubble baths.
A book shows where wellness in the water is most beautiful.
If Iris Meder went on a search trip in the past year and a half, one thing in her luggage should not be missed: her swimsuit.
Laying on the water, she looked high in elaborately designed domes, she swam towards marble puddles waiting for her at the edge of the basin, and marveled at meticulously restored Art Nouveau swimming pools.
If she liked a bath, she quickly recorded it in her notebook - with interesting details about the construction and history of the building.
The architectural historian Meder explored more than 200 swimming pools in this way - and now presents them in her recently published book "Badefreuden": Volksschwimmhallen in Munich, historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest, "Hardcore concrete buildings" in Taunus.
Through 13 countries she led her "travel to the most extraordinary baths in Central Europe": in addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true bathing enthusiast.
She doesn't have much to do with sports, says Meder - only in the water it is different.
It’s annoying that swimmers have to accept blue tiles and chlorine stench, while joggers can breathe in the enchanting scent of spruce forests or listen to the cheerful birdsong in the park.
“I wondered one day why swimming pools always have to be so ugly,” says Meder, who lives in Vienna.
"So I started collecting beautiful baths."
Water surface doubles architecture
Spasms in the spring basin and essential sauna oils - the wellness factor in baths is therefore so large, because all the senses are served, according to Meder.
And if the builders have made an effort, swimming pools can be a real eye-catcher: "Instead of a floor, you have a water surface in bathrooms."
"It is transparent on the one hand, but on the other hand reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything doubles visually: high vaults, colorful tiles, springboards.
On 190 pages, the small-format picture book "Badefreuden" conveys information about the architectural and cultural history of historic wellness oases - but above all, it makes you want to jump into the blue.
Notable specimens were discovered by the pool collector Meder during her research in Hungary.
In addition to magnificent spas such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi Bath in Budapest, it found a nitrate-containing water in a quaint karst cave (cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a thermal bath, whose basins are filled with alkaline water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jásber).
Spectacular views, on the other hand, are offered by many heated outdoor swimming pools in Switzerland and Austria: while the Zurich rooftop swimming pool has the whole city in mind, you can look at the snow-covered Arlberg in the outdoor swimming pool of a bath in St. Anton - and: In the steam room there is a window from which you can observe the activity on the ski slopes.
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design awaits bathers in Längenfeld: The Aquadome <0xC3><0x96>tztal looks like a UFO just landed in the Alps.
From three bowls open upwards, it steams in winter, while in the background the mountains of the <0xC3><0x96>tztal project into the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool, pool collector Meder put the smell of chlorine in her nose.
Many thermal baths smell like sulphur, in the <0xC3><0x81>rpád bath in the Hungarian town of Békescsaba it smells so strongly of fuel oil that you hardly think you landed in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkali hydrogen carbonate-containing healing water, which is almost black and whose silt sticks to the skin as soon as you slide into the pelvis - a wellness experience of a special kind.
In one place, however, Iris Meder was also disappointed in her search for beautiful bathing places: When she wanted to visit the outdoor and sunbathing pool in the Czech town of Luhatschowitz, she found a confined terrain.
The bathroom, designed by the architect Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Jurkovic in 1902, has since been closed.
As Meder glanced through the weathered windows of the red-white-yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw weeds growing between the tiles.
On the other hand, the decay has been counteracted in a magical swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
Three phases of construction have already passed this bath; you can discover not only neo-Romanesque elements dating back to the time of its construction in 1844, but also a Moorish hall in the style of the Alhambra, which was added around 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the Palais Thermal has been the favorite bath of pool connoisseur Iris Meder - and not only because it originated in the Black Forest.
"It is already a feat to merge such different architectural styles into such a great unit," says Meder.
In such a palace, the dive in the thermal pool is apparently only a minor matter.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank examines commodities business
By Christian Teevs
Is Deutsche Bank giving up its agricultural commodities business?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE-Informationen, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the poor of the world.
In January, the CEO wants to draw consequences.
Hamburg -
According to a study, 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn.
Two-thirds of the respondents even demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions quit this business because it exacerbates the problems of the poorest people in the world.
This is the result of a Forsa survey commissioned by the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In it, author Harald Schumann shows that betting on global commodity exchanges is driving prices up – and that banks are therefore complicit in the global hunger problem.
The consumer protection campaign is directed specifically against Deutsche Bank CEO Josef Ackermann, even if major banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Initially, commodity betting was intended to hedge traders against price fluctuations.
But nowadays, most experts agree that the sugar cockers have decoupled from supply and demand – and make at the expense of the poorest profits.
Unlike the US competitors, Ackermann responded to the criticism, promising to examine the allegations and saying that no business was “worth jeopardizing Deutsche Bank’s reputation.”
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the allegations from the Foodwatch report.
The audit should be completed by the end of the year, and the results will be presented to the Executive Board of Deutsche Bank - including recommendations on how to deal with it.
At the end of January, the head of the bank will then announce the consequences it is drawing.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the commodity business, or even the complete abandonment.
Ackermann builds on his image
Foodwatch CEO Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time reaffirmed his criticism of the financial industry: "The betting on rising prices of food shows particularly drastically how ruthlessly banks are harming the general good today."
As the top banking lobbyist, Ackermann is now particularly in charge.
“Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio that involve spending money on food prices,” Bode said.
"Whether Mr. Ackermann is about hungry people or the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann’s insight comes as a surprise at first glance, but it is clear that the CEO wants to give a perfect picture a few months before he leaves office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the CEO will not change to the Supervisory Board as planned.
With a departure from the controversial agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And for possible losses he hardly needs to shave himself - this would eventually have to do with his successor.
One in two would terminate commodity investments
Foodwatch strives to keep the pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 internet users have participated in the organization’s campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey, for which the Institute Forsa surveyed 1001 people on November 7 and 8.
Only eleven percent believe it is legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments in which food prices are wagered.
Many banking customers would also draw personal consequences if they learned that their bank is involved in such transactions: one in two would, according to the survey, cancel all investments in which money flows into commodity speculation.
43 percent would discourage acquaintances from such a bank, 49 percent said they would consider canceling their account and switching to another institution.
The 21st House in Vienna
The relocated pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural history with highs, lows and happy end: The Austrian World Exhibition Pavilion of Brussels won prizes in 1958, became a museum in Vienna, stood empty and disappeared.
It is now reopened as an exhibition house.
If modern post-war architecture, clear shapes, glass halls, bold swings and new building materials typical of the belief in technological progress are infused with, then the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer is a striking and famous example for the 1958 Brussels World Exhibition.
Schwanzer’s pavilion was awarded the Grand Prix d’Architecture for its lightweight and floating steel-glass construction.
The building is still considered to be a milestone of contemporary architecture.
He made the architect so famous that he also built the pavilion at the next Austrian World Exhibition.
With his legendary BMW four-cylinder house plus bowl-like accessory building in Munich, he finally became internationally famous in 1973.
Its pavilion, which was planned as a temporary exhibition building, had been erected after the World Exhibition in the Swiss Garden at the South Station in Vienna, and rebuilt in 1962 and opened a museum of the 20th century - the "20's house" was called it.
However, the building was neither spatially nor technically suitable as a museum - no walls for hanging art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used until contemporary art in Vienna got a new house.
Since 2001, the building was empty and came down more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has rebuilt the pavilion, it is now called "21er Haus" and will be used as a museum of contemporary art in the future.
On Tuesday evening, the Museum Belvedere, to which the house belongs, opens its first exhibition there - a success in every respect.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, an art historian with a considerable career, among other things, in her youth as an art runner, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as founding director of the Museum der Moderne Salzburg, insisted on the conversion of politicians and conservationists, she procured public funds and private sponsorship funds and determined the use.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba were to be exhibited by the foundation of the same name, a café and a bookstore were to exist, and an office building had to be built for this purpose.
Strict supervision, small budget
For the performance, Krischanitz was the ideal occupation.
Not only because he had sensitively rebuilt and expanded Joseph Olbrich’s Secession in Vienna and won the competition, but because he studied at Schwanzer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was for him a “very important place”, where he had looked at the exhibitions “almost every weekend”.
He knew the original design, and he knew the problems of the building, which already lost its generosity and ease during its transfer to Vienna and its reuse.
There were far bigger problems with the current renovation: The building was "an energy shooter," says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facade were replaced, glass fiber-reinforced insulating glass was used and the glass roof was replaced by special safety glass.
Cold bridge steel beams have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings have been refurbished.
Two basements made room for the new use, a lowered light pit between the house and the road provides the exposure, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the light tail pavilion.
The original exterior doors have remained, the house is painted in old red-brown anti-rust shade.
The cinema is exactly as it used to be.
And all this under the strict supervision of the monument authority and with a small budget.
"Often a material had to be found that is good and cheap and also liked by the monument protection office," says Krischanitz, pointing to a rugged floor in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and conversions, the building has remained flexible and lightweight.
The pavilion “was coming from Brussels,” Krischanitz recently said, a typical “drop-in-the-city story.”
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "raise a real consciousness".
In this case, however, the 21st-century house is not in the wrong place, because it has been an urban development success: Around the Swiss garden, the completely newly planned "Hauptbahnhofsquartier", with offices and residential buildings, is being built.
And another luck might happen: the 21st house could get reinforcements from another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berliner Temporäre Kunsthalle, and as you can hear, she is already negotiating with the city for a neighborhood location in the Swiss garden.
Railway plans a million-dollar winter crisis package
The railway has devised a crisis plan to prevent train failures in the winter.
The number of employees should be doubled.
It costs millions.
In the fight against winter-related train failures and delays, Deutsche Bahn is spending more than 70 million euros in addition this year, according to a newspaper report.
The "Bild" newspaper reported in advance, citing an intra-group crisis plan, that investments of a total of around 300 million euros were planned by 2015.
The aim is to achieve better availability of vehicles and rail networks even in extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, it is planned to double the number of internal and external employees for snow removal on railway facilities and platforms to 16,000 people.
The goal is to clear platforms of snow and ice within four to five hours until the start of operation and 90 percent of the operational necessary turns.
Two months ago, after a top meeting with government and industry, rail chief Rüdiger Grube warned of train failures and delays this winter.
Last winter, the train had considerable problems in passenger traffic, as it lacks reserves, among other things, in difficult weather conditions.
Numerous new regional trains have been waiting for approval from the Federal Railway Office for years.
There is also a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway has also been making it possible for years that it has to have axles of ICE trains tested much more often in the workshop after an ICE had an axle break in Cologne Central Station.
Deutsche Bank to pay millions of dollars in the US
After the turmoil over head Josef Ackermann comes new trouble from the US: Deutsche Bank has to pay a million fine there.
As if the problems at home were not enough for Deutsche Bank, the industry giant is now also catching up with its past in the US: The Frankfurt Institute pays 145 million dollars (106 million euros) in a comparison to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It is about the sale of mortgage securities.
The financial market regulator NCUA accuses a whole series of large banks of misleading the cooperative banks with false promises to buy the financial products; they had minimized the risks.
Such papers lost sharply in value during the financial crisis and dragged the banks into the depths.
"We are satisfied that we were able to resolve the issue without the parties having to go to court," said a Deutsche Bank spokesperson in New York.
The bank admitted no guilt with the comparison.
The same goes for Citigroup, which pledged to pay $20.5 million.
NCUA chairwoman Debbie Matz welcomed the welcome of the two money houses.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the U.S. cooperative banks and intervenes in case of bankruptcy to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA seeks compensation for the billion-dollar damages incurred.
The comparisons now concluded are the first of their kind.
The regulator had also feigned other major banks and sued JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
The mortgage securities in question are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on home loans.
When the U.S. real estate bubble burst in 2007, it became the fate of a variety of financial firms.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers overturned.
Even though events have been going on for a few years, banks in the United States are currently facing a sharp wind.
Investors and regulators have filed countless lawsuits to obtain reparation or remedy for wrongdoing.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the biggest wave of lawsuits.
It accuses 18 major international banks of outperforming the two state-owned real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in mortgage transactions worth around $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also has to face a lawsuit from the FHFA, which deals with several transactions worth a total of $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority demands that the Frankfurters stand up for "substantial losses" without, however, giving an exact sum.
Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as unfounded and declared that it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett raises $10 billion at IBM
Financial guru Buffett is investing heavily in the IT company IBM.
Since March, he has bought shares worth more than $10 billion.
So far, the great American investor Warren Buffett had always stated not to invest in IT and computer companies, as the long-term development of the companies can only be predicted poorly.
Now, however, he had read IBM’s annual reports and changed his mind about investments in the industry.
He had to understand much earlier that IBM primarily provides services and procures computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered a knighthood in the financial world.
As a result, IBM is now allowed to call itself "Sir IBM".
Buffett has revealed to CNBC that since March he has bought IBM shares worth $10.7 billion.
Berkshire Hathaway has become one of IBM’s largest shareholders with a 5.5% stake.
Buffett said that even IBM hadn’t yet known anything about the engagement.
He commended the management, which had made decent profits even during the economic crisis.
"They did a great job," Buffett said about the strategy.
IBM has been relying on lucrative IT services such as the operation of data centers for some time.
The more than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting as well as powerful corporate computers.
Buffett had avoided tech companies to date.
He says he only invests in companies whose business he understands.
Instead, Buffett approached a freight railway, a lubricant manufacturer or machine builders.
Its holding company Berkshire Hathaway owns, in addition to around 80 own subsidiaries, shares in a number of large corporations such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Municher Rück.
The 81-year-old had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and expanded it into one of the most valuable companies in the world with smart investments.
However, his lifestyle is modest.
He is therefore a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of earning money earned him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha".
After the announcement of the Buffett investment, IBM’s shares rose by one percent pre-market.
Big Blue, as IBM calls it, is worth more than $220 billion on the stock market, making it one of the most valuable technology companies in the world, along with Apple and Microsoft.
At Microsoft, Buffett said, but he does not want to join.
Bill Gates is a close friend.
The threat is tangible
After the discovery of the "Zwickau cell", Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a “bloody ideology” that is now reviving.
The murders of eight Turkish and a Greek small businessmen in the years 2000 to 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
This news is being responded to in Turkey and within the German Turkish population in Germany with fear and concern.
For many German-Turks, a ghost that has long been believed to be dead is returning: Since the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence against Turks with a right-wing extremist background.
The fact that there is xenophobia in Germany was never questioned.
However, the uncovered right-wing extremist network reveals extents whose dimension is far from foreseeable.
"Is the bloody ideology alive again?" titled the Internet edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The newspaper "Sabah", on the other hand, stresses that one of the perpetrators was a V-man of the constitutional protection, and expresses concern that German authorities may also be involved in the right-wing swamp.
The Turkish municipality of Germany reacted wisely: it recalled the victims of racist violence on the weekend with a vigil in front of the Brandenburg Gate.
Only two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, had thought in a solemn act of the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
In cheerful colors, it had been staged together - as a story of success.
It seems like a blow to the coverage of some Turkish media: "Germany's gift to the fiftieth" is the headline of an article in the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", which refers to the background of the murder series.
Even the German edition of the "Hürriyet" cannot fail to draw this mental connection.
"It's starting to stink," Ahmet Külahci's column is titled.
He stressed that people had been murdered, paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany with their work.
In German-Turkish internet forums, the actions of the police and their subsequent success as a search force are discussed in a critical manner.
The authors wonder why the German authorities were not much more likely to look for suspects in right-wing extremist circles.
Some of them are at least rhetorically prepared for drastic means: "If the migrants continue to be sloppy here, then there is nothing left but self-defense and arms."
"That will probably be the best self-protection."
"The kindness of the enlightenment and the adequacy of the punishment of the entire network very strongly depends on the inner peace in Germany," writes Selen.
What it means when internal peace in Germany is in danger was illustrated by the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the nineties.
The photo of the fire ruins of Solingen is deeply embedded in German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event showed the Turks living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans that distrust and distance can result in right-wing violence.
The attacks, however, sharpened the we-feeling on the Turkish side.
Don’t repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press at the time, the failure of German politics after the attacks was particularly criticized: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the Solingen fire attack, he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish president, but was represented at the funeral in Cologne by his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel at the time listed in his speech how many duties the local Turks paid.
It’s like a person’s value is calculated by the amount of their taxes.
The current coverage of the Turkish media shows once again how deeply many German Turks have since distrusted the state of law in the country.
In addition to the efforts of extensive enlightenment and re-evaluation of far-right terrorism in Germany, open words are needed this time.
The Scandal Bank of Lake Zürisee
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since slipped from one crisis to the next.
Now let's have a German judge.
This is not what Axel Weber would have thought.
After his spectacular departure from the top of the Bundesbank, it was announced in July that he would take on an almost equally spectacular new job in 2013: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Swiss big bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel Weber was publicly pleased, praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly acquired solidity and made friendly remarks about the future colleagues.
"The UBS has made the turnaround".
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel".
But in September it became clear that everything would be completely different.
A UBS dealer in London had bypassed all of the bank’s hedge systems and cheated around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.7 billion.
UBS CEO Oswald Grübel, a banker not only famous in Switzerland, had to leave.
The Chairman of the Board of Directors of UBS has also been deemed to be beaten since then - and everyone asks: When will Axel Weber finally arrive?
Already it was announced that Weber was allowed to advise the bank from February 2012.
And he is already taking over the chairmanship of the board of directors in May – not just in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
This is going to be tough for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, but rather an economics professor and central banker and would certainly have needed a period of familiarization.
He then assumes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just proved once again that it has long earned the title of "Europe's biggest scandal bank".
On the one hand, UBS is huge – until recently it was the largest wealth manager in the world – and on the other hand, it has been sliding from one scandal to the next for years.
Nothing, it seems, is spared the once so proud Swiss bank.
It started in the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the silent and solid, but also exhausted Swiss asset manager had combined it with ambitious goals: it wanted to become a very big number in investment banking, too.
On the one hand, UBS managed $1.6 trillion more money from wealthy customers than any other bank in the world in 2007.
On the other hand, as an investment bank, she had advanced into the league of the largest banks in the world.
That made an impression.
The former banker and later long-time banking professor in Zurich, Hans Geiger, tells us: "I always presented UBS to my students as a model of a good bank at the time."
"From today's point of view, you ask yourself: How could I be so wrong?"
He was greatly mistaken.
In 2007, it became apparent for the first time that something went wrong at UBS.
In the middle of the year, CEO Peter Wuffli surprisingly resigned, who until then was considered a highly intellectual and equally brilliant banker.
A few months later, they knew why he had left.
The bank’s investment division had tangled up with subprime papers and had to write off billions.
To blame this, UBS announced a capital increase of CHF 13 billion.
In fact, it found investors, but ones that some people would have rumbled about until recently: an untransparent Asian sovereign fund from Singapore and an Arab sovereign fund that was so concealed that you didn’t even know its name.
But that was only the first blow.
It was worse in April 2008.
The bank had to announce new billion losses, CEO Marcel Ospel, the second best-paid board of directors in Switzerland, resigned in 2006.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: UBS faced the collapse in view of its misinvestment in the financial crisis and had to be rescued by the state.
The National Bank bought UBS for tens of billions of problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a forced convertible bond, via which it could become co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shocked – for she noticed how dramatic it is for a small country to host such large banks.
Finally, the balance sheet total of UBS in 2007 was more than five times that of Switzerland’s economic output (see graph).
"Once again, we could not save UBS," says banking researcher Geiger.
The first disaster followed the second.
Already a few months later, UBS surrendered in the tax dispute with America and agreed to release the data of wealthy customers who may have stolen taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, she agreed to a payment of $780 million – as a repayment of unjustified profits from these transactions, including a penalty charge.
UBS thus confessed more or less openly to having helped with tax evasion.
At the same time, she lost something that had always been her capital in the competition for rich customers: the nimbus of secrecy.
After the scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was no longer the same.
This was followed by the resignation of the CEO and Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of customer money.
Within a few months, the bank had lost credibility in both key business areas: in investment banking due to misspeculation and in asset management through tax evasion aid.
And just as it got a little calmer again, just as you thought UBS would get it back, this unfortunate merchant story follows: A single merchant cheats 1.7 billion euros before the bank realizes that something is going wrong.
And it turns out: risk management in investment banking is obviously still not working.
"With the Adoboli case, one had to find that risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, economist and financial professor at the University of Zurich's banking institute.
The CFO of a large German bank is also sure: "The problem with UBS is that it has no control over risk control."
It was precisely the idea of caution with which the Swiss bankers had long ago begun to become guardians of the great wealth of the world: not too great risks, but security for money - might even collapse the world beyond the Alpine Republic.
The vaults of Swiss banks had become a symbol of unwavering reliability like Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly noble chocolate.
The headquarters of UBS in Zurich still fits the stereotype of the sound Swiss private bank - it is only a bit larger.
Already the location is classic.
The bank is headquartered on Zurich’s Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly from the main railway station to Lake Zurich, which is surrounded by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are magnificent, the shop rentals are among the tallest in Europe.
Jewelers such as Tiffany's can be found here among Swiss traditional shops such as the Confiserie Sprüngli.
Swiss banks have resided here for centuries: from the National Bank to the Palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Baer.
You enter the reception room of UBS through a heavy revolving door.
Inside the walls are marble-clad, in front of thick leather armchairs, next to the bench logo a large sign for the "safe".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: safety.
This idea of the Swiss bank has both Swiss major banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but at some point displaced it - or betrayed it, as the boss of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all, like all Swiss bankers, he also does business with the two major banks.
UBS had become much too big, he finds - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons had also spread.
The Swiss have nothing more to say.
"And if so, they have long adapted to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, it was Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, giving it high profits first, and then the debacle: No European financial institution has lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the Swiss big bank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster became apparent.
"On that Wednesday, the government coalition of the small seven-million country decided the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "The UBS Crash."
Politicians approved up to CHF 68 billion or around EUR 45 billion to save the bank that is bankrupt.
How could this happen?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem above all in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks merged into a huge group.
A bank was created that was already too big for small Switzerland at the time of the merger - and continued to grow.
This helped the two different predecessor banks of UBS to complement themselves: a rich but sleepy bank with a focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer but already more internationalized bank.
Suddenly, the internationalized investment bankers came in favour of a lot of money with which they could turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, CEO of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says banking researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the high intellectual, the modest who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the belly man who has worked his way up from the bench to the top."
But Ospel ultimately relied on Wuffli.
And Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake in the end: "He thought his models were the reality," Geiger says.
“This is a tragic case.”
Tragic, perhaps.
Obviously, pride came before the fall.
Employees of UBS clearly remember the executive meetings at which CEO Wuffli repeatedly issued the same slogan: Goldman Sachs step down from the throne.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She led the League Tables, the rankings that documented the success of the banks of that time.
That’s where UBS wanted to go, to the top.
She had already taken a few steps.
In the foreign exchange business and in stock trading, she played at the top.
Business consultants who were commissioned, however, highlighted a weakness: In the international interest rate business, in the banking language "Fixed Income", there is a huge distance to the largest banks.
UBS has gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS embarked on an adventure that almost cost her life.
Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and a hedge fund founded before it invested in American subprime investments.
It developed into a huge machine that packaged and passed on securities on American mortgage loans - but also kept risks on its own.
Even when other banks long ago sought the exit.
“Even in the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was on fire, UBS bought there,” says banking expert Geiger.
So big the euphoria, so deep the case.
One manager after another had to go when the attempts to clean up were more difficult than expected.
Posts at UBS became the spinning seat and are still shaky to this day.
Whoever runs the big bank now has an almost impossible job.
He needs to find a strategy for a bank that has lost all the obvious business models.
Banking researcher Geiger already has an idea: Stop investment banking, focus on asset management, return to the Swiss roots.
The bank does not (yet) want to go that far.
But investment banking is expected to shrink sharply, so much is already clear.
Next Thursday, the new bank chief Sergio Ermotti wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italo-Swiss was actually only intended as a transitional solution when the bank surprisingly separated from its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he has asserted himself: he should permanently manage the business of UBS, Züricher Bank announced on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to its mid-1990s status.
3500 posts will be deleted.
But that won't be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who's that?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is probably already asking himself.
So far, he has only said that he and his wife will be looking for an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe burdens U.S. stock exchange
The impending recession in Europe has taken the courage of U.S. investors to the start of the week.
The changes of government in Athens and Rome remained without impact.
The throttled industrial production on the continent stifled the hopes of a stabilization of the debt crisis in the nucleus.
The general relief over the change of government in Rome and Athens could not prevail.
The euro fell against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass was still half full last week, not half empty - but now the problems were back in the foreground, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
Financial values in particular were on the sales lists.
The Dow Jones index of the default values quoted at the close of trading with a minus of 0.6 percent at 12,078 points.

Industry in the 17 euro countries has significantly reduced their production and is preparing for the end of the boom.
The companies produced two percent less in September than in the previous month, according to Eurostat.
“We’re not an island, we’re dependent,” said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe will not be able to free itself from a recession so quickly, and there will be further signs of weakness in banks.
Investment legend Warren Buffett only confirmed this caution: It is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do anything to end the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview.
Therefore, it is too early to invest in European government bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett threw a decades-old principle over the heap and entered the U.S. technology industry.
His investment of more than $10 billion in IBM supported the traditional group’s share price and allowed him to start listing barely one percent higher against the trend in trading.
The paper closed almost unchanged at $187.35.
Buffett has paid an average of $170 a piece and now holds 5.5 percent.
The share price of his investment firm Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3 percent.
Bank of America’s shares declined significantly more than the market at 2.6 percent.

Intelligent crows spread in cities
In many places, seed crows are considered "problem birds": But the highly intelligent animals can no longer be expelled from the cities, experts claim.
Some like it, others want to get rid of it very quickly: crows have been part of the cityscape for centuries, but in many municipalities, residents' complaints about the dirt and noise of the animals are accumulating.
So far, no means of combating the "problem birds" is in sight.
Seed crows can no longer be taken out of the cities, experts said at the first crow symposium in East Frisian emptiness.
There, experts from the entire federal territory discussed possible ways out.
You are looking for alternatives in the cities
Conservationists also attributed the problems in cities to the displacement of the particularly protected seed crows: the use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly destroying the traditional habitats.
Hunting, increasing cultivation and the felling of typical breeding trees made life difficult for birds.
Crows are under conservation.
Large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs can be found in the Westphalian province of Soest, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen, as well as in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project for the mass killing of crows in the county had provided negative headlines.
Critics had described the capture of the animals in bird traps and the killing with clubs as particularly brutal.
"The normal displacement, the uglyness, does not help," said the city and landscape planner Werner Klöver from Leer.
Splashing away nests with water or cutting down trees often has unwanted consequences, also said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals dodge, large colonies split up and spread elsewhere."
Disgrace is only conceivable as an exception in hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't get them away."
Without the surrounding countryside, the problem in the cities could not be solved, Mayor Wolfgang Kellner from Leer said.
It is conceivable that a combination of the animals’ resentment from sensitive living areas and lure offerings would be possible in order to relocate them elsewhere.
"Infoboards instead of chainsaws" on the other hand, the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens advertised for a completely different treatment of the animals: "A pimple in the face we can ultimately best bear with confidence."
Jürgens co-founded the Ascheberg Crow Teaching Path in Schleswig-Holstein, where signposts inform about the life of the highly intelligent seed crows.
The project is already being accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also had his own opinion on the criticism of the noise of the birds: "There is a lot of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: Seed crows not only use tools to get a treat, but also produce their own tools as tools.
Behavioral researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested on four seed crows how far the intelligence of the birds reaches.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to collapse a scaffold with stones in order to reach a moth larva.
Without much training, they determinedly recognized what size and shape a stone must have to allow the platform to collapse.
In a second attempt, the clever crows had to solve a more tricky problem.
In a vertical cylinder, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a moth larva.
With the beak, the birds could not reach their prey.
However, the researchers had laid them pieces of wire.
From this, all four animals formed a hook, with the help of which they then fished the bucket on the handle from the tube.
Three of the four seed crows even succeeded immediately.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal at Euro 2012
The Bosnians and the Turks had no hope of a coup.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and also Ireland are at the Euro 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have solved the last tickets for the 2012 European Championship in Poland and Ukraine in the play-offs.
Led by double-successful superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal beat Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made the fifth consecutive European participation perfect after the 0-0 of the first match.
The Czechs scored a 1-0 (0-0) in the play-off rematch against outsider Montenegro, after the first game (2-0) had already been a clear matter.
There was nothing left to burn Croatia in the 0-0 against Turkey, Ireland won a loose 1-1 (1-0) against Estonia.
Nani (24th), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored the further goals for Portugal.
Former Wolfsburg Bundesliga professional Zvjezdan Misimovic with a converted metre (41st) and captain Emir Spahic (65th) had shortened twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic saw the yellow-red card (54th).
Bosnia had already failed in the play-offs of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa to Portugal.
Portugal took a bespoke start at the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon.
Ronaldo chased a free kick from around 30 meters to the early lead in the stitches.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his wide shot qualities and scored from 25 meters to 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did not take place in the first half hour, had their first clear chance through goaltender Edin Dzeko.
The ex-Wolfsburger from English leader Manchester City put a header at the bottom of the latte, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33rd).
Jiracek meets for Czech Republic
Afterwards, the focus was on arbitrator Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding.
After an attack against Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penalty area, Stark decided on Schwalbe and showed the Portuguese the yellow card (36th).
On the other hand, Stark gave a controversial metre after an action by Fabio Coentrao, which Misimovic certainly transformed.
But after the break, the 2004 vice-European champion made it all clear with four goals.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek also ended the last doubts in the 81st minute.
This is the fifth time in a row that the 1976 European champions compete in the European Championships.
However, the team of coach Michal Bilek with the Bundesliga legions Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg) also had luck and had to survive a horror second already in the initial phase.
Finalist Petr Cech with a reflex prevented a possible own goal at the last moment by Tomas Sivok (9th).
Montenegro had its greatest opportunities when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic shot just past the goal of Cech in the 40th minute of the turn from the penalty area limit.
After the break, the crossbar had to save for the already beaten world-class goalkeeper of the Czechs, again the striker of FC Seoul had withdrawn (50th).
The gate shortly before the end finally made everything clear.
In the meantime, Turkey missed the football miracle of Zagreb.
Four days after the 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not go beyond a 0-0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink almost certainly has to clear his place on the bench of the 2002 World Cup third, the Croatians are delighted with their fourth participation in a European final.
In front of 31,000 spectators at the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks almost had a dream start.
Selcuk Inan hit only the pole in the seventh minute with a distance shot, attacker Kazim Kazim could not sink the bouncer in the goal.
After the horrific second, however, Croatia took more and more control.
Even after the break, the Croats did not let anything burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic from VfL Wolfsburg, who made room for Dortmunder Ivan Perisic from the 62nd minute, Bundesliga legionnaires Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were still in action.
Trapattoni goes to the European Championships
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated the first European Championships in Germany since 1988.
Stephen Ward led the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already made a preliminary decision with the 4-0 success in the first game, in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57th) balanced out for the guests.
Ireland pushed at the pace from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
It was only at the last moment that the Estonian rear team prevented the possible lead hit.
In the 32nd minute it was done.
After an accident defense from finisher Pavel Londak, Ward was on the spot and pushed the ball to 1-0 over the line.

SAP plans to double its workforce in China
Europe’s largest software company, SAP, is investing billions in China in the next few years and intends to almost double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, about two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euros) are expected to flow, the Dax Group announced on Tuesday.
"We will create additional research and development facilities and hire employees accordingly," Co-CEO Bill McDermott announced at a customer fair in Beijing.
The workforce is expected to grow from currently around 2,500 to 4,500 employees.
The number of branches of the world leader in enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP has a presence in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
Approximately 4,000 of the more than 176,000 SAP customers worldwide are located in the boomland.
China’s growth plans are also an important component of the Dax Group’s 2015 strategy.
SAP plans to increase sales to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 billion by 2015.
Last year, the Walldorfers had raised around 12.5 billion euros.
Currently, the software provider’s business, which employs 55,000 people worldwide, is almost unprecedented.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
"Now we want to expand our activities (...)," McDermott explained.
"Our goal is to promote sustainable growth in China supported by comprehensive education."
Massacre on a personal level
Empathetic and generous, Peter Englund's new book "Beauty and Horror: A Story of the First World War, told in Nineteen Fate" begins with a long list of protagonists that comes to your heart.
Here’s a tip on how to do it: carefully cut out this page and make it your bookmark.
You will get to know these people very well in Englund’s romantic narrative, and these protagonists will function as your GPS, as a lighthouse in those few moments when you, like Englund’s men and women, are lost in the mist of war and deprived of your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
He has written an unusual book, which he not inaccurately describes as "a work of anti-history."
It contains only a few big names, important contracts or famous battles. There are hardly any ambassadors, furious reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It is less a book about what happened, he explains, but rather "a book about how it was." It is about "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Beauty and Horror" almost sums up the war experiences of 20 more or less inconspicuous men and women on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanists to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance drivers and office workers.
Some of these people are becoming heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, lose limbs, go crazy or die.
Each of these lives flickers like the votive candles in a church, some are added, while others are extinguished.
Englund's book deviates from the usual history books.
It also corrects the notion that the First World War was only the devastating position war on the Western Front.
"Beauty and Horror" wanders with expert views over other war scenes: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
On the soldiers in this book fall beehives, one celebrates Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, Tsetsefflies are an unsolvable problem.
This is a moving book from the very beginning.
The war floods the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a hurricane Katrina smelling like Kordit.
Imagine that you are a woman who is at home with her children and hears gunfire in the distance. Are you staying or are you taking the flight?
Who's coming?
Hardly anyone understands what is happening or why this war is being waged at all.
"Missing facts," Englund notes, "were furnished with assumptions, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumors."
"Beauty and Horror" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German ship sailor.
Her stories were mainly taken from memories, letters and other previously published material.
Their life stories can be frightening or poignant, but they are extremely vivid in englunds of detail-losing accumulation of small moments.
Many of them deal with lack and help themselves.
In the story of a German schoolgirl, he tells: "Substitute, substitute everywhere."
"Replacement coffee, false aluminum, false eraser, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He talks more about substitute food in Germany.
He describes "meat made from pressed rice and baked in mutton fat (and last served with a false bone of wood), tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato peels, shoes that were soiled with wood."
There were, he notes, "837 registered food substitutes allowed in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
An American recognizes his own urge for savagery and says of the war: "One feels that this is, in spite of all, what was intended for men rather than sitting in the armchair, with the evening paper or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whiskey in hand, and pretending that such a façade meant civilization and as if there was no barbarism behind his own hems and fortified."
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he is likely to die and that no one will take notice of it or take care of it.
"When you step away from the idea of sacrificing yourself, you want to think that this is happening in front of an audience," he writes.
Instead, it’s as terrible as “a convicted man who was hanged in secret.”
Other observations deal with the disintegration of old Europe and new forms of terror.
"The conflict became increasingly an economic competition," writes Englund, "a war between factories."
He captures the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiary of the still young century": "the word clever and ideologically convinced mass murderer in a tailored suit, who slaughters while sitting behind a desk."
People behave in unforeseen ways and there is just as frivolous behavior as heroism.
Englund discusses the soldiers who were actively trying to infect a prostitute with a venereal disease in order to escape front service.
"The grotesque expression of this can be discovered in the trade of gonococcal eiders, because soldiers bought and lubricated their genitals, hoping to get into the hospital in this way," he writes.
"Those who were really desperate rubbed him in the eyes, which led to them being blind for the rest of their lives."
In this translation from Swedish by Peter Graves, Englund’s poetry becomes smooth yet unobtrusive and perfectly adapts to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, he captures the way the war "uniquely unleashed uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders make them fight.
The best books on World War I were mostly more distorted like Paul Fussell's "Great War and Modern Memory" or novels like Erich Maria Remarque's "Nothing New in the West" than extensive history books.
Englund's band joins an unconventional hall of fame.
His book has the most devastating ending I've ever read in a non-fiction book.
I don't give it to you anymore.
But it's as if he had snatched us away with his book this page with the main characters in front of his nose and set on fire with a match.
After an early misstep a meticulously planned assault
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing helmets.
They had decided on the night from Monday to Tuesday, because at that time there were hardly any people in Zucotti Park.
The operation was kept secret and only a few high-ranking officials were informed. All others initially believed to be participating in an exercise.
Police Chief Raymond W. Kelly was in the middle of them and his presence underlined the fact that the operation was full of challenges.
The incidents of the past weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which violates the rules of the department and gave the occupiers a huge increase in public sympathies, were no longer allowed to repeat.
And so the police action to remove the protesters from Zuccotti Park was carried out after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared these by observing how occupations were handled in other cities.
A disaster exercise had taken place with a look at Zuccotti on Randalls Island.
Officials reinforced the so-called chaos training — counter-terrorism measures, including the rapid displacement of a large number of police officers — to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session took place on Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to move into the park came “at the last minute,” said someone familiar with the commands, which spoke of a declaration as “exercise.”
"The few police officers I know involved didn't know it was about Zuccotti Park," someone said.
"The only ones who knew it was about Zuccotti Park were the high-ranking officials of the resort."
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson that the city had learned.
On October 14, officials wanted to clear the park, but then retreated when hundreds of protesters came together after they learned of these plans.
Officials from various police units were involved in Tuesday’s operation, including deployment commandos from across the city – hundreds of mobile officials who are usually deployed in highly criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that during the day, many people enter and exit the park, almost like commuters, so 1 a.m. at night is a good time to enter.
"It was appropriate to do this when the least number of people are in the park," he said.
Ambulances with Jupiter lamps and loudspeakers were ready for departure at Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near the Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and the pre-recorded messages roaring from the loudspeakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
When the public officials entered the park in their light blue windjackets, many protesters simply packed up their belongings and left the place.
Police said no tents would be touched until 1:45 a.m. to give protesters time to pack their belongings together.
Other teams of officials were seen gathering in the area to intervene should arrests in the park become necessary.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, spokesman for the police chief, said this was done for their own safety.
But many journalists claim they wanted to keep them from watching the police action in the park, and they said the officers' handling was very harsh.
Mr. Browne said television cars could have taken pictures in Church Street on the west side of the park.
As the police moved towards the west due to the big mess of personal belongings of the protesters, including suitcases, artificial turf and bags of clothes, her city cleanser followed, who picked up what had been left behind.
Some protesters who refused to leave were dragged outside, and pictures of them appeared on the internet a short time later.
A main core of protesters took position near the kitchen area of the camp in the center of the park.
Some erected barriers and the police continued their methodical arrests.
About 10 people in the epicentre of the camp tied together on their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Civil protection officials were called to cut them off.
As Mr. Kelly said, no arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 p.m.
The evacuation was completed after 75 minutes, according to the police.
Mr. Browne said 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests, he said, were due to "inappropriate behavior and resistance to an arrest."
The most prominent official on the spot was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the highest uniformed official of the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, chief of the police department, was also there.
Despite his presence, Mr. Kelly "didn't lead the operation," as Mr. Browne said.
In case they had access, a second group of officials were waiting on the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
Barricades were erected in Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and in Pine Street, a block further south.
It could be seen as the police from these locations expanded the perimeter around the Zuccotti Park.
In one place, several officials, many of them with shields, were drove people outside.
There were about 28 people in the north.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
Around 5 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protester jumped onto the roof of a police vehicle and other protesters let the air out of the tire of a police bus.
In one place the crowd threw a piece of plywood.
In the end, a police officer and a protester came to the hospital.
Union of caregivers will file a lawsuit against the city for dismissals
The union, which represents hundreds of school supervisors who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, as the dismissals are not necessary and discriminatory due to their inappropriate influence on the schools that poor students teach.
The lawsuit is probably the last possibility that remains open to the union, District Council 37, in its efforts to reverse the dismissals.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, care coordinators and other employees, who were among the worst-paid employees in the city and had lost their jobs on October 7, the union leader described as a political revenge for the fact that last year the city had been denied access to a health fund maintained by the working groups.
This allegation was categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a hearing with the city council, Dennis M. Walcott, director of the schools, said last month that the redundancies were part of the budget that was passed in June.
A member of the city council shot back and told him that the budget did not specify that staff would be fired from school aid.
City council officials said they had and warned the Ministry of Education of a lawsuit. On Wednesday, there will be a press conference, formally announcing the filing of the lawsuit before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The lawsuit will feature Mr. Walcott and the city’s Department of Education as defendants and count eight dismissed workers as plaintiffs, all of whom are colored or Latin American women, like most of the helpers who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city’s Justice Department, said the city was unable to comment on the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on its individual allegations.
According to a draft lawsuit filed by the New York Times, the union has focused on the number of dismissals at schools in the city’s poor neighborhoods to support a lawsuit for inequality, claiming that poor schools have lost more helpers because they are chronically underfunded.
She explains that while there were no dismissals on Staten Island and few dismissals in the schools of the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school assistants in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, have lost and 46 helpers in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx have been dismissed.
With the loss of five out of eight school assistants employed at public school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit states: "This is not a neighborhood of disciplined parents who can organize donations to catch budget cuts."
P.S.: The budget of the 36th district was cut by 3.26 percent this year, and money was lost when the city changed its calculation method for extra funding for each poor school enrollment.
The union also complains that the heads of the high schools were misled by the language in a memo that approved the dismissal of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the plot, although "excess" in the United States usually describes the change of a teacher from a school's payroll to a pool of available workers paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six care coordinators have been dismissed, not transferred," says the draft lawsuit.
Mission Ends, Congress Ready to Agree on Libya
In the end, it looks like Republicans and Democrats in Washington are already reaching agreement on the Libyan uprisings.
All that was needed was the success of the revolt, the arrest and assassination of longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the end of American interference.
On Thursday, the Senate International Relations Committee will pass a resolution under the chairmanship of John Kerry (Massachusetts), along with Senators John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), praising Libya for the successful rebellion and the U.S. troops for their “bravery.”
"This resolution honors the brave people of Libya who have begun to rebuild their country," Kerry said.
"It is a confirmation of the support of its democratic efforts by two parties."
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing has been easy in the Libyan debate.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties and the White House debated the wording of a series of resolutions approving or disapproving the role of the US military in NATO’s Libya mission.
In June, Kerry and McCain passed a resolution authorizing the restricted use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected in the Senate by a broad fringe group of both parties and no vote was taken.
However, on the same day, the Senate passed the law, and the Chamber overturned a decision to cut funds for American operations in Libya.
As a result, the U.S. mission got into a kind of legislative purgatory — with a Congress that was upset enough to criticize Obama’s approach to the mission, but not angry enough to finally pull the floor under his feet.
Then the indecision of the Congress was overtaken by the events.
Tripoli fell among the Libyan rebels in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
The Senate may be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations "congratulates the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary endurance in their self-liberation" and "praises the men and women of the U.S. military and their coalition partners who support military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The resolution also reaffirms “the national interests of the United States in a successful and irrevocable transition of Libya to democracy.”
Will the new measures receive full support from the Foreign Relations Board or will they divide legislators, as the June law did?
The final version meets the opposition of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the committee's top Republican.
Lugar’s spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to the Capitol, it is up to the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional amendment that demands a balanced budget, a top priority in almost every congressional legislature of Republicans and some Democrats.
The measures under the leadership of Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or any other area that is currently coming to a vote in the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have so far unsuccessfully tried to bring their amendments to the vote, even though they have tried enough times.
Goodlatte’s amendment is just one of 68 constitutional amendments submitted to this Congress, covering a wide range of topics.
Some are double – the same law has been submitted to both Congress and the Senate – others are only slightly different from each other.
There are at least 15 versions of the balance sheet amendment in the Senate alone and another dozen that would "control federal spending".
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their clients—especially beginners among Republicans who want to polish their resume—the opportunity to boast that they have “written” such a measure.
The Budget Control Act, passed in August, requires both the Senate and Congress to vote on a change in budget balance.
In March, 58 senators voted for a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such a change.
In addition to the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that members of Congress can submit, while Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to lift the limitation on two presidential terms.
Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments that, among other things, guarantee the right to good education and health care.
An amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage is a recurring proposal, as is an amendment prohibiting the burning of flags.
Some legislators also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if two-thirds of the states reject them.
As eagerly as members propose changes, they move as quickly as they did in previous years.
In the 111th Congress, legislators presented 77 such amendments. in the 110th Congress 66.
The pace fades compared to that of the early 1990s, when members regularly proposed more than 150 changes every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they weren’t much more successful than today’s ones.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed to Congress as early as 1789.
"Hit but not defeated," Giffords said in first TV interview after the assassination
Ten months after an armed man shot her at a close range during an election event in Tucson, Republican Gabrielle Giffford's (Arizona) appeared on national television on Monday night singing alone to Broadway play "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and saying the desire to recover was greater than the one to return to Congress.
When she appeared with Diane Sawyer on the ABC News "20/20", she rang for words and needed help walking.
The show showed the heavy slow recovery from the damage caused by the bullet that split her skull, pierced the left side of her brain and crossed her head from front to back.
Three months ago, she surprisingly returned to Congress to triumphantly cast her vote on the debt brake.
In her first television interview after the January attack, in which six people were killed and 13 injured, Gifford smiled, laughed, and sang — describing her recovery as “difficult.”
When Sawyer asked her how she was feeling, Gifford (41) replied, “Very good.”
The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour “20/20” special recorded just before the release of the couple’s new book: “Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope.”
The special tracks Gifford’s recovery since the January 8 attack.
In videos that Kelly had recorded in the first few weeks, she is seen in the hospital bed, with her bald head shaved and a long scarf over her forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers if her husband encourages her to do so.
Months later, Giffords sits in a wheelchair while therapists show her how to perform simple movements.
A nod to the head.
A tear with the lips.
And then, their first words: "What."
After a few days, Giffords whispers another word: "Toast." She wants her breakfast changed.
Videos played on the ABC show show show that music played an important role in Giffords' recovery: You can see the congressman singing along with the therapists to Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'".
In an interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spends two hours a day on therapy, said she can’t remember the day of the assassination.
Her husband said he read Giffords an article in a daily newspaper about the assassination on March 12, when she interrupted him and asked for the first time about the six people who had been killed during the assassination.
Suspected shooter Jared Lee Loughner is imprisoned in a Missouri prison and is being forced into medical treatment while he waits for his trial.
"Many people have died," Giffords told Sawyer.
"Heart, heart, heart."
In the course of his wife's recovery, Kelly told Sawyer, she said, "I was hit."
"So, I'd say, 'Gabby, you weren't defeated,'" Kelly said.
You were just hit.
And you’ll get through this and you’ll recover and you’ll come back stronger than ever before.
Troops feel compassion rather than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
One hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines gathered around him.
The crowd in black tuxedos stood up and applauded.
"The soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the fundraising campaign in the spring.
A senior military officer at the gala, who was observed, among other things, by the chief of staff and then-chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
“They were introduced like orphans,” the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers meant it well.
I know, I know.
But it wasn't respect, really not, it was pity.
The sharply contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and the most distant, sometimes admiring American public.
The troops are overwhelmed with praise for their victims.
But praise has its price, officials say.
The public increasingly behaves as if the people in uniform are hurting them.
"We were by no means victims," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But apparently the only way to support is to push us into the role of unhappy souls."
The issue is extremely sensitive to military leaders who do not want to appear ungrateful or in dispute with the public they serve.
They also realised that the anger the returning troops faced in the last years of the Vietnam War was far worse.
As a result, conversations about compassion take place in silence and private between war veterans.
After his two sons returned from fighting with the Marines, Colonel A.D. Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would look at them with a sense of awe as they had defeated rebels and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if a “angry, violent veteran is hiding beneath the surface,” said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and took over a high-ranking state post in Washington upon his return.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some of the interviewees subtly asked if he was able to withstand the pressure of a demanding post in Washington right after his return from the fight.
"When you talk about your ministry, you have to keep the negative impressions against it," Cancian told his sons.
The lack of lightness of the military is partly rooted in the lack of American interest in the war.
Achievements on the battlefield are rarely praised by a country that has little experience with the military and sees little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“We as a nation no longer value military heroism as it was absolutely usual in World War II,” said Lieutenant General David Barno, commander of U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public is largely focused on the suffering of a civil servant.
Troops find recognition for the number of attacks they have endured, the number of friends they have lost, or for the severity of their injuries.
Military Faces Growing Pressure to Hardly Persecute Rape
This week, an important hearing will decide whether 28 women and men will be charged with non-intervention in a rape before the military court.
Should this not happen, hundreds of plaintiffs will be available for the next hearing.
Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant when she was raped by a fellow soldier at night.
It was October 2008 and she was just returning to her barracks in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when she met a male colleague carrying a 12 pack of beer.
He asked her if she could take a drink to her room.
"My alarm bells went on," Lyman said.
But the Texan woman wiped her concerns aside.
I thought, "Oh, what, he's 19.
“He’s from Texas,” she said.
"I wish I had listened to my gut feeling."
A few minutes after they went to Lyman’s room, the man stepped behind them, pushed them down and raped them, she claims.
This week, November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military employees are anxiously awaiting a trial with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, to decide whether to admit a lawsuit they have brought against former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld.
The lawsuit claims that Gates and Rumsfeld have not acted against the widespread rape within the military and in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
In February, filed by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., the lawsuit initially included 17 plaintiffs, but rose to 28 in the following months: 25 women and three men, all claiming to have been raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers, and that the military failed to investigate, convict or prosecute the attack.
Burke says they're pursuing the top military leadership because the problem starts there.
"The military is structured hierarchically," she says.
"Who are the individuals who are in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation? The leadership."
Burke also says she has contacted nearly 400 other survivors since February, many of whom may be part of future lawsuits.
Their strategy: Instead of all plaintiffs laying their eggs in a basket, so to speak, they will file many more lawsuits if necessary to maintain the pressure.
The defense team for the Department of Defense, led by Attorney General Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit.
The court files available to Newsweek detail the defense strategy, primarily that the military cannot be charged by current or past soldiers for injuries that have occurred in the armed forces.
Under a 1950 law of the Supreme Court, the so-called Feres Doctrine, the government is not liable for injuries inflicted on soldiers in active service.
"The alleged damages occurred during the plaintiffs' military service," the document states.
The Ministry of Defence refuses any comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not admitted to combat, the distinction lies only in the name: modern wars rarely have clear fronts.
Both in Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers play increasingly important roles, especially in establishing contact with indigenous women in war zones.
The result: between these two wars, 150 soldiers died, two-thirds of them in combat.
It’s time for the military to be modernized, Burke says.
And she is not alone in her struggle: three more lawsuits are pending besides her.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans' Legal Services Clinic is preparing a lawsuit against the four main military academies for allegedly promoting a misogyny atmosphere.
Independently of this, the nonprofit Vietnam Veterans of America is filing a lawsuit against the military, focusing on the diagnosis of “personality disorder” that rape victims received to release them from service – a common approach according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women’s Action Network, a human rights group.
In December, her group filed a lawsuit against the Veterans Administration accusing her of discriminatory practices in dealing with performance claims for individuals who claimed to have been sexually abused in service.
Nine laws were submitted independently to Congress by a mix of senators and representatives of both parties, providing a number of clues.
In 2010, according to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office of the Ministry of Defence, 3,158 sexual abuses were reported.
But most abuses are not reported at all and, according to the Pentagon’s own estimate, this number takes into account about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases that occur each year.
The report, published in March, also examines the prosecution rates: in 2010, 20 percent of the cases recorded went to court in the military, only half as many as in civil law.
The plaintiffs in Burke’s case describe their attacks as just the first of a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, she reported the alleged military police rape less than an hour after the raid.
That night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape to a whole series of police officers, doctors and commanders.
She had a rape kit and the blood of her attacker, which came from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge, who asked her about the sex she had before the assault with her boyfriend.
Six people testified as character witnesses in the name of the alleged perpetrator, who was ultimately acquitted.
"I still remember well the day the verdict was read," Lyman says.
"I thought the labor would start, I ran out of the courtroom screaming."
"They took me to the psychiatric ward and I remember when I came out, I said to my commander, 'This was not his procedure, that was my procedure.'"
Lyman was asked to see a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder and declared it incapacitated.
In January 2010, she was dismissed dishonorably, so she received no support whatsoever.
Whether the lawsuit filed by Lyman and the other plaintiffs is advancing is pure speculation, says John Turley, professor of law at George Washington University Law School.
Yet, he notes: "In my opinion, they should move forward."
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was questioned for the first time.
I am a critic of the Feres doctrine.
The military is lagging behind for a decade because they do not have the same incentive and deterrence that a liability entails.
He adds, “Opportunities are against them... but it’s important for them to try.”
These things will change only when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing does not follow its path, Burke, the plaintiff’s lawyer, will begin with her hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
“We will continue to fight the military in this regard until reforms are made,” she says.
Or until we die, whatever comes first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Watch You on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just one of many guys who posted their anti-immigration opinion online.
On Monday, Breivik, who has confessed to having committed an assassination attempt in Norway in July, in which 77 people were killed, had his first public hearing in court.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: he spent a lot of time in front of his computer before his attack, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support far-right groups on social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find them?
This is easy - you just have to log in to Facebook.
“We found that it wasn’t hard to get to them,” says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recent report by the British idea factory DEMOS on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook’s hiding of personal data is so encyclopedic, Bartlett says, researchers simply need to use the site’s advertising tool to accurately determine their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy – just like marketers have been doing for years.
Bartlett’s team found half a million fans of far-right groups across Europe and then encouraged them with adds, but instead of linking to a new band or diet product, the adds invited users to a survey asking about their level of education, their attitude towards violence, and the assessment of their own future.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview more than 10,000 supporters of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries – without even having to leave their offices once.
“It’s a fairly new research method,” Bartlett says.
Some of the results are hardly surprising. Online promoters of far-right groups are mostly young, male and annoyed about immigration.
But in a kind of surprising twist, “those who combine their online activism with an offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who stay behind their computer screens.”
DEMO’s work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Idea factories, medical researchers, and political scientists use the site to study everything from health issues to societal trends such as likes, text messages, and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding on average three content per day, Facebook’s “data supernova” is generating a research boom that has increased the number of scientific papers with the name of this page in the title by nearly 800% over the last five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is the fact that you can study people through this site that you usually don’t reach with your clipboard on the street.
"If you used to try to interview people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"They had to inform the party first and it would never have granted them access," Bartlett said.
“With Facebook, it all falls away – you go straight to them.”
Others say that the site provides a way to identify and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues has found that students who discussed their obsession on Facebook are significantly more prone to problem drinking than students who remained silent about this topic.
Moreno suggests that equivalent students, such as residential consultants, monitor the site and help a student post too many status updates.
"You can't solve a problem if you haven't recognized it," Dimitri Christakis, Moreno's co-author and head of Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle, told the Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify endangered children who otherwise would not have been found."
Facebook is also constantly tapping into the data of its own population.
The site’s data team has compiled statistics on relationship status and Valentine’s Day, voter turnout in the 2010 midterm elections, and a National Happiness Index (using primarily data that only Facebook has access to—masters of digital freedom have long known that the site should make its large data mine accessible to others for research purposes.)
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them whether they want to or not, and in order to be able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, you allow the site to share your own personal information.
But what if Facebook users become part of a survey they don’t even know about?
While researchers have strictly defined guidelines on how to collect their data offline, everything is allowed online.
“I don’t think many users have thought at all about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles,” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, to a 2006 study examining the public pages of students on Facebook.
As for her, it was all about her and her friends.”
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research participant is absolutely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how many of the information in a user profile and in posts are true.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things,” Selwyn said.
Therefore, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn thinks that a clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
“There is no substitute for going out into the real world and talking to real people,” he says.
"Social research has to take care of the social - and a lot of social life is still taking place offline."
"Cold and inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik appears in a public court for the first time
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who has confessed to two bombings in which 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, even in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo described himself as a "resistance" fighter.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a templar of Norway," he said in front of a courtroom with more than 500 people.
"I appeal to the court because you have received your mandate from organizations that support hate ideologies and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the laws, but I don't confess to guilt."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "didn't want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which he can express his views."
For the same reason, he denied Breivik, who brought a pre-written speech, permission to contact the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered police to keep Breivik in detention for another 12 weeks, he has no access to the media for four weeks, and said the authorities will closely monitor all visits and all correspondence over eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims participated in the hearing.
Some came hoping to see Breivik in the eyes, others wanted confirmation that he would stay behind bars.
Everyone participated with the goal that everything turns out to be a lockdown.
"I thought he looked cold and inhuman," a survivor of Utoya told Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"It was unpleasant, but for me it goes a bit further after I saw and heard the suspect."
Breivik wore a dark suit and a blue tie and seemed quiet and professional throughout the hearing, looking journalists and survivors in the eyes as he entered and left the building.
Despite Breivik’s bizarre indication that he was part of a larger “resistance” movement, the judge came to the conclusion that he was not mentally ill and said that there was no evidence that he had accomplices.
It may please some that the July 22 attacks seem to have been the work of an individual extremist and not a group of radicals.
But does this automatically ease the sorrow and confusion that an entire nation still feels?
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he doesn't," the victim's family said.
"It would be so much easier if he did."
7 Lessons From The Interview With The Deceased Steve Jobs Shown In A Theater This Week
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, highlighting the technology genius as a great modern inventor.
But what Apple fans find perhaps the most revealing in the recently rediscovered Jobs interview, which was dusted off this week before special film screenings in the key markets, is how much this creative mind has understood business processes and workflows.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer, and a self-proclaimed hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer who was eager to craft diagrams—a man who believed that many executives suffer from “a disease of thinking,” “that a really great idea makes up 90 percent of the work... [but] there’s an enormous amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product.”
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of the Idiots" about the break-up of the personal computer. And he sat with Jobs for more than an hour, in which they conducted one of the rare, in-depth conversations.
By that time, 10 years had passed since Jobs had been pushed out of Apple, and he was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, looking forward to widespread adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringley’s interview was used in specialist idiots, he says the interview’s copy templates were missing on delivery.
It was only after Job’s death that a full VHS copy was discovered in the director’s garage.
This slightly revised footage forms the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview," which will arrive at the Landmark Theatre this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to hate in-depth interviews, Jobs appears surprisingly eager to explain his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
In the course of the interview, there are four long breaks between questions and answers – 10 to 15 seconds of reflection, in which jobs clearly weigh their thoughts and are striving for accuracy.
There are also moments when Jobs’ perfectionism comes to light when he seems impatiently responds to Cringely’s questions, pushing him to respond more quickly to topics or side actions of greater importance.
Recorded before the era of Pixar, iPod, or iPhone, the Lost Interview seems kind of terribly far-sighted when Jobs evaluates what other companies think is right or wrong and presents his own vision of the future of the computer.
It's one thing to read posthumous appreciations of Jobs' career, but seeing Jobs here as the eager dreamer on his way to greatness is something completely different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could and should be.
Shortly after he had done all this here, he left and did it.
A quick look at seven notable sequences of the Lost Interview:
How he learned to run a company:
"Throughout the years in business, I always ask, 'Why are you doing things?' And the answer you always get is, 'Oh, that's how it's done.'
No one knows why he does what he does. No one in the business really thinks deeply about things.
That's what I found.
Jobs continues his efforts to streamline accounting at Apple.
Astonished at how costs were recorded - usually starting with "standard costs" that were mere guesses and then adjusted with "deviation" - he developed an automated factory that ensured that business costs could be determined to the smallest.
How the Pope was enlightened:
Jobs talks about the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak, a device with which you could sneak into the telephone company and make long-distance calls for free.
Much has been written about the device, but Jobs’ enthusiasm when he describes the Blue Box as an act of self-empowerment is contagious.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a paid phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another while looping through as many satellites as possible.
"We sent stuff around the globe half a dozen times and when you yelled at the phone, it came out on the phone next door a minute later," Jobs said.
“We were young and we learned that we can build something ourselves that can control trillions of dollars in infrastructure around the world.”
We both didn’t know much, but we could build this little thing that can control a giant thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don’t think there would be Apple without them.
Jobs goes on to tell of a glorious prank Wozniak and he almost pulled off when they called the Vatican via Blue Box in the middle of the night to talk to the Pope, while they did their best to mimic Henry Kissinger.
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two had to laugh before the pope himself came up on the phone.
How he fell in love with technology (and unpreparedly called Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, when he was looking for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he looked for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after her 20-minute phone call, Jobs got a part-time job at Hewlett-Packard for the summer.
"That had a remarkable impact on me. It was the only company I had seen at that age and it shaped my views on what a company was and how well it treated its employees."
Later, Jobs became one of the HP employees who visited the company’s research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw “the first desktop computer ever manufactured.”
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with a brown tube and I fell in love with him.
I would climb up at HP as a teenager and hang on to this machine and write programs for them.
How to Improve Innovation:
Several times in the interview, Jobs talks about how to invent new products spontaneously.
Early in his career, when he installed some boards, a customer asked him to assemble the entire computer.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to think through both the assembly and delivery of the finished equipment.
Later at Apple, he recalls the problems he had in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember breakthrough arguments... they screamed at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I got up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15. That was incredibly credible.
About large companies that are diminishing:
Long before resurrecting Apple, Jobs foresaw the ways in which so many industrial giants stumbled with their visions and lost control of their shares.
“Let’s say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make a better copyer or printer, then what?”
They own the stock monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [it’s such people] who ultimately run the businesses and the product that pushes people out of decision making.
The product genius that has led to this monopoly position is eradicated by the people who have no concept regarding good products vs. bad products - craftsmanship necessary.
This is what happened at Xerox.
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
It could have been 10 times bigger if it had been Microsoft in the 1990s.
You have captured the defeat of victory.
About innovation as an art form:
“There’s a lot of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product... when you develop this great idea, it changes and grows.”
You learn a lot about your subtleties.
You have to make votings, certain things you can't, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You have to remember 5000 things, these concepts, and bring them all together...
Ultimately, it comes down to taste, it comes down to trying to deal with the best stuff that humans have created and then trying to bring those things together into what you do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We are always shameless in stealing great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people who work there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who happen to be the best computer scientists in the world.
Had it not been for the computer industry, they would have created fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas Dine with Opponents of Health Laws as Court Accepts Case
On the day that the Supreme Court assembles behind closed doors to discuss the politically dividing question of whether one will hear a challenge to President Obama’s health laws, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a dinner sponsored by the law firm that the case will be represented in court.
The incident took place last Thursday when all nine judges met for a meeting to discuss the petitions for examination.
One of the cases to be dealt with was a lawsuit filed by 26 states against the far-reaching health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that became the buzzword among conservative activists across the United States.
In fact, a five-and-a-half-hour basic discussion is expected in March, the outcome of which is likely to spur the 2012 presidential battle, which will be in full swing at the time the court decision is announced.
The attorney who will stand trial and claim that the law is to be tilted will presumably be Paul Clement, once prosecutor-general under the administration of George W. Bush.
Clement’s law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that supported the Federalist Society’s annual dinner, an old-fashioned group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, which contested the law.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., who is financially involved in the outcome of the process.
The dinner took place a few hours after the court had deliberated on the case in a Washington hotel.
He served, among others, with Mitch McConnell, the Republican group leader in the Senate and an outspoken opponent of health reform.
The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: the two judges have been attending events of the Federalist Society for years.
This does not violate moral rules.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they were, they would probably fall under Principle 4c of the Code, which states: "A judge may participate in charitable events by law and other organizations, whereby the judge may not be a speaker, an honorary guest or, according to the program, a guest of such events."
Nevertheless, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms related to the case, as well as to a company with a massive financial interest in it, sufficed to alert moral and government activists.
"This astonishing break with morality and the contrary to the Code punishes the lawsuits of some judges lying that the court adheres to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of the Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the United States.
"The judges won and dinned during a benefit event with lawyers with pending proceedings in court."
Their performance and support of a fundraiser for this event undermines any claim to impartiality and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little consideration for critics who say they would mix court matters too easily with groups that are guided by the agenda, such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
On the other hand, the Conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was attorney general under the Obama administration when the first lawsuits came to court in first instance.
Her critics urged Kagan to withdraw herself from hearing the case because of bias, as she was too involved in defending the law to be biased.
Kagan does not make any arrangements to do this.
Boeing lands record $18 trillion order
Emirates will order 50 Boeing 777 two-speed aircraft with an option for 20 more aircraft.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner to Oman Air, a business worth more than $1 trillion.
It’s really a rare news that a company gets an order over 50 pieces of its products.
But it’s a big deal if the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the list price for these 50 aircraft is a record total of $18 trillion.
Equally unusual is the client of Boeing: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast released on Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that airlines from the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 trillion over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced on the weekend its largest ever order for commercial aircraft, measured by the value of the order: 50 dual-speed Boeing 777 jets.
The hammer order came from the airline Emirates from Dubai.
The airline also has, Boeing announced it in 2011 at the Dubai Aviation Show, an option to purchase 20 more aircraft, raising the total list price to $26 trillion.
On Monday, Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8, the so-called Dreamliner, which greatly improves fuel consumption and passenger comfort.
The list price for six of these aircraft is more than $1 trillion.
“This is absolutely positive for Boeing,” said Neal Dihora, Morningstar’s stock market expert.
"The quality of these special customers is very high."
Many airlines in the Middle East are owned by oil-producing countries.
So they don’t just have the money to pay for the planes; rather, an increase in oil prices that usually harms airlines, as this is one of their biggest cost points, isn’t as harmful as the country earns at a higher oil price.
This is important because they tend less than other airlines to cancel or postpone aircraft orders as oil prices rise, Dihora said.
"They have a natural hedge," he said.
The order from Emirates reaffirms Boeing’s leadership in the large-aerospace aircraft market and helps keep Airbus competitor SAS at bay, which is attacking dominance with the A350.
Boeing’s victory at the air show comes four months after Airbus announced it would postpone the launch of the largest A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
The launch was postponed to gain more trust after customers demanded a higher payload and reach.
The Boeing shares rose 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican President's sister apparently loses election in Michoacán
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that drug dealer opponent Fausto Vallejo of the PRI supported in the race for the post of governor.
President Felipe Calderon’s sister apparently lost her application for the office of governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections, claiming on Monday that drug dealers had influenced the race in favor of one of her opponents.
According to the preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Party of the Revolution, the PRI, has won the race for the governorship in the Western state.
"The intervention of organised crime throughout the electoral process and especially yesterday is alarming, not only for Michoacán, but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview a day after the election on Sunday.
"They threatened our candidates, our staff in the polls ... they occupied election booths, built road blockades ... and commissioned people to vote [for the PRI]."
The PRI ruled in Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.
But they are striving for a return and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes for a victory in the July presidential election.
Vallejo seems to have narrowly beaten Claderon, who had led in the polls before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate of her brother’s conservative Partido Acción Nacional PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the Left Democratic Revolutionary Party PRD, the current incumbent governor, came in third place, a severe defeat for the divided and unhappy Left leadership for the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denies ties to drug dealers and urges other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels that specialize in marijuana, heroin and amphetamines.
It is the homeland of President Calderon and he has chosen Michoacán to launch a military-led offensive against drug traffickers in December 2006.
Violence continues.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election during an election event for Luisa Maria Calderon and numerous candidates have stepped out of the local elections for fear.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, no matter how disgusting the elections in Michoacán seem.
The man who will probably represent the PRI in the race for the presidency is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory will give us courage to look forward to next year."
ADB urges Asia to help save the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) calls on India and China to support the rescue of the eurozone in its severe debt crisis in order to prevent a long-term downward trend that will slow down the growth of Asia’s economy.
Rajat Nag, administrative director of the ADB based in Manila, said the two fastest growing economic nations in the world must do “everything in their power” to speed up the recovery of the currency block either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct mutual agreements.
He warned against the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) who are "passionate" about the difficulties in Europe, and said that financial support for European leadership and European resources by Asia will help prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
“We’re all in the same boat.”
"So anyone who can help Europe out of this crisis is helpful," he told the Financial Times in an interview on the margins of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some degree, but it's not immune."
"If China and India can help, then by all means."
Europe’s monetary union has been in a serious debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy’s interest costs have risen dangerously and the prime ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
The emerging severe debt crisis in Europe sparks fears that the global economy could plunge into recession and led to calls for the leading emerging economies to join forces to support the eurozone.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channelled through the IMF, but said that mutual agreements – such as the purchase of EU bailout funds, the European Financial Stabilisation Facility (EFSF) – would provide greater negotiating power to European partners in Asia.
Indian Trade Minister Anand Sharma said that “India will do everything in its power” to help the eurozone as its own economy now suffers from declining exports and the drying out of foreign capital flows.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We are facing major challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth."
“It’s not an option, it’s an assignment, because where else do we find work for our millions of young men and women?”
Others argue that developing economies such as India have no reason to help the rich Europeans when they themselves face major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University, said it would be politically very difficult to sell aid for Europe to the 1.2 trillion people in India, more than 800 million of whom live at $2 or even less a day.
"Sometimes they'll find out that the Greeks are going to retire at 50 and spend holidays on the beach. Then you have a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, executive director of the World Economic Forum, similarly asked why India’s reserves should be used to keep in Greece the numerous and well-paid public servants, with jobs in poorly managed, loss-making institutions such as the railways.
Mr Nag said that the eurozone crises will have "significant domino effects" on all of Asia.
The ADB’s forecast of economic growth by 7.5 percent in Asia for 2011 now threatens “the risk of grading” due to the impending threat from Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets would need to create “crisis plans” to protect themselves from a downward trend and a significant capital deflation of their words.
Pentagon Urgent Warnings of Possible Defence Cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warmed Congress on Monday when he warned that automatic budget cuts would unnoticed national security, triggering a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon’s halls to the war scenes in Afghanistan and the civilian production lines.
The Pentagon is already considering cuts of $450 trillion over the coming decade, but now fears that further cuts of $600 trillion or more will be needed if Congress cannot reach an end to spending.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry," Panetta wrote in a letter to Republican senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said a failure by Congress to reach a budget agreement, which will lead to a so-called seizure, would result in 23% general cuts, as well as a halt to numerous new projects.
"Such a high cut, carried out in such an unthinking manner, would make most of our ship and construction projects unfeasible -- you can't buy three-quarters of a ship or building -- and seriously harm other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would also be forced to involuntarily separate ourselves from much of our civilian personnel and, since the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would have to leave civilians on a safer basis in order to achieve the goal."
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who uphold our military and seriously damage our readiness to alert."
The cuts would ultimately hit the combat troops," Panetta said.
"While the wartime contingents in the anti-terror fight are not directly affected by the seizure, the serious interference in the basic budget would adversely affect the war effort," Panetta warned.
"Personal hiring has been shortened, which would lead to delays in the hiring and hiring supervision that support the war."
"The salaries of the staff would be reduced, leading to late payments to wartime traders and legal and political support would be disrupted."
The two senators responded to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for more details about the potential impact of automatic cuts on the Department of Defense.
"The consequences of confiscation of the Department of Defense would initiate a rapid decline of the United States as the world's leading military power."
"We are vehemently opposed to this draconian act," the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon, when they published Panetta's letter.
"This is a result we can't live with, and it's certainly not one that should be imposed on us."
“The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and its occurrence should not be allowed.”
Whether Panetta’s letter and the new warnings from the senators will increase pressure for a compromise in the budget or reinforce demands to exempt the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has increasingly outspoken the possible cuts, although he has been able to gain many years of experience with the budget in Congress and the White House before coming to the head of the Pentagon, and knows that he faces tough decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense painted a gloomy picture of what might be coming – a military with a shell but without a core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without ammunition."
"It's an air force squadron without adequately trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings, and bombs without adequately trained soldiers capable of carrying out the mission," Panetta said in his opening address at the Pentagon.
"It's a force that lacks morality and alertness and is unable to deal with potential opponents."
“She really makes you angry.”
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta cited new details of how reductions "create significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, serious limitations of our global deployment and enforceability, resulting in an unacceptable risk in future war operations."
And Panetta said some of the largest defense projects could fall victim to the deletion, including those that have already been tested and are already in the early planning phase.
This list also includes the fighter F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomber, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat Ship, and the new ground combat vehicle that the Army and Navy need to replace the Humvee.
Stopping further development and testing of the F35 would save up to $80 trillion over the next 10 years, but proponents say it’s an important next step toward armament so that potential dangers can be banned by China and other opponents.
How to Uncover a Lie
A look at the current headlines shows how worrying and widespread deception and lies are in daily life.
The Republican presidential candidate, Herman Cain, is busy overseeing the allegations of sexual harassment by several women, both accusing each other of lying.
Penn State’s leadership is accused of perjury for allegedly withholding reports of a retired football coach sexually abusing boys.
Last week, over an open microphone, French President Nicolas Sarkozy claimed to US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
New York Congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weidner made a fool of himself when he circulated denials that were very quickly refuted by irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of campaign funding violations related to the cover-up of an extramarital affair.
And then, of course, no one who has experienced it forgets the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered when he lied about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky during his second term in the Oval Office.
Stories about cheating in school and at college exams are widespread.
There have been instances where teachers have given their students the exam responses so that they could stand well in their own performance reviews.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send a message that lying and cheating are okay.
How much deception do we experience?
Studies have shown that we lie 10 to 200 times a day.
However, many of these lies are considered to be emergency lies.
Another study shows that strangers lie to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
Recognizing lies or “revealing lies” is one that is important for everyone to learn, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from a social game such as charades, in which the goal is to shout “Have Yourself!”, unmasking a deception is a reputable field of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities that have carried out far-reaching research projects, particularly in the fields of psychology and physiology.
One result of the research is that most ancient myths about lying have been exposed.
Lies look into your eyes.
They don’t always stutter, stutter, blush, and blush.
But it cannot be concluded from this that these liars are difficult to uncover and uncover.
A trained liar can penetrate to the truth by learning something about the structure of the assertion, the fine facial expressions, about questioning and timing.
I have spent several years examining the scientific findings of the comprehensive and steadily growing field of unmasking. And it is clear that unmasking a deception is a modern ability that is easy to learn and helps us to get around in our complex world, especially when hiring or questioning people or negotiating or administering is one of our own professional responsibilities.
Good liars are very good at assessing other people, arousing their interest and controlling their own emotions. And they intuitively feel how they are perceived by others.
Thanks to research, we know that extroverted people are more likely to lie than introverted people, that men are more likely to "self-oriented" lies than women whose lies are more "oriented towards others" -- usually they want to protect the feelings of others -- that married people are less likely to lie to their partners than unmarried people (but the lies they are mostly telling are lies.
We also know that if one person has been exposed as an offender, others feel less guilty about lying to that person.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First, by observing the normal behavior of that person.
This is called baselining, the starting position.
It provides a point of reference for the subsequent evaluation of changes.
Observe the attitude, laughter, voice quality of your subject.
You should know better when someone is usually constantly tripping with their foot, so they don’t wrongly accuse him of tripping with his foot during a meeting.
Then pay attention to accumulations of conspicuous verbal and nonverbal behaviors.
Consider these accumulations as alarm bells that shrill, not as evidence of disguise.
People who are deceiving may solidify when they try to remember their story. Maybe their feet are pointing towards the door or they are leaning towards the exit, changing their position in a significant way, or showing a "relaxation after the hiring conversation", this deep, relaxing exhalation, and the change in posture when all the hard questions are over.
Questioners often erroneously signal that an hiring interview is over, only to look for this relaxation after the hiring interview.
Also, pay attention to the language of your subject.
Scott Peterson's slipper is famous when he used the past form when he claimed his dead wife was still alive and triggered a national search for her.
Deceiving people can also use a distant language: "I had no sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or if you repeat a tricky question overall.
The most common verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" when answering a tricky question: "Well... to tell you the truth... as far as I know... to the best of my knowledge and conscience."
This makes the answer more perceptive than factual, as a result of which the alarm bells often sound.
There is no magic to unmask lies, but you can learn skills that make unmask possible.
Thanks to these skills, everyone can rarely become the victim of fraudsters, both in private and professional life.
Controversial oil pipeline plan revised after endangerment due to delayed U.S. approval
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada into the Gulf of Mexico, which upsets trade unions while reassuring environmentalists, the pipeline-building companies are trying to re-plan the project so that it can return to normal.
TransCanada said on Monday evening that the planned pipeline will be diverted from the ecologically sensitive area of the Sandhills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Nebraska parliament building.
Alex Pourbax of TransCanada said the company remains confident that the pipeline will eventually be approved, albeit with a different course.
This came after an announcement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs last week, after which a decision regarding a federal approval for the project would be postponed until the new possible course was reviewed, which avoids the area of the Sandhills in Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a large underwater supply.
"This is a real step forward," Republican Lee Terry, a Nebraska Republican, told Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs may postpone a decision until 2013, following the elections next year, even though officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Last week, Obama said in a written statement that the decision was a task of the State Department and pledged his support.
The 1700-mile pipeline was to connect Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would pump 700,000 barrels of oil a day from the province of Alberta to the refineries in Texas.
To do this, the pipeline would have to cross six states.
Environmentalists hate them, but labor markets love them because they estimate that the pipeline creates 20,000 jobs.
But Nebraska’s lawmakers, who oppose the plan, are weighing the laws to force a departure from the Sandhills and Ogallala Aquifer region, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study on the impact on the environment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has found that the project would have little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy industry says that the chief auditor of the Ministry has requested a separate probe of the review procedure, which focuses on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a consultant to Hillary Clinton in 2008, is in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company commissioned to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice as it is associated with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle charged for allegedly forcing a toddler to vomit for fear
A New York family claims that disco diva Patti LaBelle had a raid in the lobby of her Manhattan building that scared her little daughter so much that she surrendered.
The diarrhea of “Lady Marmalade” singer made 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so scared that she suffered from “personality changes, sleep disturbances” and “increasing fear of strangers,” her family told the Manhattan Supreme Court.
It was on November 10 last year that stage worker Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve wanted to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was picking up the car, Roseanna Monk walked with the luggage and Genevieve on her arm into the lobby in her building on Riverside Boulevard.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and dropped her daughter off for a moment.
"Someone came up behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing right now?" I said, "Yes," and went to take her back on her arms," she said.
LaBelle warned the pregnant woman angry.
"She said in an aggressive tone, 'You shouldn't drop your daughter off near the door,'" Roseanna Monk said.
"I told her, 'I don't care what you say or think.'"
She got angry and started to scold - she used the F-word and the A-word and got very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and started pouring water out of the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve had become hysterical.
"I said to this woman, 'Look what you did to my daughter,'" said the child's mother.
LaBelle rushed at the mother, who was still carrying Genevieve on her arm, and had to be held back by her companion and pulled to a waiting car, Roseanna Monk said.
The baby screamed so much that it had to surrender, she said.
Later, the LaBelle family apologized in writing, but received no response.
LaBelle’s lawyer and representative did not respond to calls asking for an opinion.
The lawsuit is for undisclosed damages, but the family’s lawyer, Sam Davis, said he doesn’t charge any fees and the family plans to donate the money they get to child cancer care.
"We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her behavior," Davis said.
“This kind of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially when it is shown to a kindergartener who is carrying an 18-month-old baby on her arm.”
Climate adversities slowed down the economy
In the first year that Mario López Valdez is in government, unemployment and undeclared work rose in Sinaloa, while foreign investment declined and the economy stagnated.
2011 will be remembered in Sinaloa’s economic history. It is the first year that Mario López Valdez, who calls himself the initiator of change and fosters great hopes for economic growth, is in government. However, due to the climatic adversity, growth cannot be talked about, but, on the contrary, the main economic indicators deteriorated.
The low temperatures in February not only caused million-dollar losses in agriculture, but also placed tight limits on the growth of the state economy and caused a general decline in economic activity of 3.6 per cent in the first quarter. This is mainly due to the historical decline in agricultural development of 31.16 per cent, which slowed down on other economic sectors.
According to a report published by the Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable (Mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development) on the impact of the frost, 582,000 hectares of agricultural land were damaged, of which 78.03 percent were completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07 percent were partially destroyed.
The decline in economic activity by November has led to a steady increase in unemployment in the Mexican state. The Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía observed a rapid increase in unemployment in the first quarter of the year, because from January to March, 55,053 inhabitants of Sinaloa had no employment, which corresponds to 4.53% of the working population. In the second quarter, the number of unemployed people rose from July to July.
Lower liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa this year is due to a number of factors. Economist Gerardo López Cervantes, Dean of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the University of Autónoma (UAS), comments, the policy of public institutions indirectly explains the growing unemployment.
"What we are currently observing is an increase in unemployment, which has to do with several factors, including losses in liquidity in the market as a result of the cuts in funding by the legislation passed in Congress to combat money laundering, because for those who are banned from accumulating dollars, it is not easy to get them to work for themselves, to invest them or to use them for anything else," he said.
Migration Stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that increasing unemployment is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people leaving the country in search of work abroad, especially in the United States, has declined. This is due to the problems of entry on the one hand and on the other because it is also difficult to find work there. These people stay here and are looking for work here, which increases unemployment," he says.
Black Labour
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious, considering the high proportion of undeclared work, which, according to INEGI, includes 60.38 percent of the workers in the country who work without paying into the social security funds.
Unemployment and undeclared work are the low wages, the lowest in all of Mexico, according to the statistics of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social and the Secretaría del Trabajo y Previsión Social.
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa was 5,352 pesos by September, which is much less than the general government average, which is 7375 pesos.
Decline in ADI
In addition to the decline in economic activity and rising unemployment, 2011 saw the strongest decline in foreign direct investment (FDI) in the last decade. According to the Secretaría de Economía (State Economic Authority), the ADI was $630,597 from January to June, which represents a decrease of 87.74 percent compared to the $5,143,312 in the same period of the previous year.
For its part, the Secretaría de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno (Governmental Authority for Economic Development) recorded a total investment of 17 280,000 pesos in 2011, mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
The debt
In view of the economic crisis, the state government applied for a loan of 3 000 000 000 pesos at the National Congress in July, which was to be invested in infrastructure projects to reactivate the economy in the 18 municipalities. The state congress approved an amount of 200 600 000 pesos, but no positive effects of the debt on any of the industries in the country could be detected until November.
Reactions
For the representatives of the entrepreneurship, the first year of government made Mario López Valdés’ inability to rule obvious.
Miguel Loredo López, chairman of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación, said that in 2011 no efforts were made to harmonize the views of different sectors, including the state government.
"The economic activity in Sinaloa was really very poor this year. It needs to be worked hard to regain the terrain lost this year and in 2012 we need to make a double effort. The efforts of all, and in particular the progress of the already well coordinated government team, have not been sufficiently coordinated," he said.
Slow economic development
Loredo López stated that events such as the frost at the beginning of the year made the country’s economic development difficult and slowed down.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including the frost. One of the most important impacts is a slowed economy that is not moving enough to produce an economic dynamic that could generate a decent flow of processes, products and services, so we will close the year well below our expectations," he said.
Redefining vocation
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, chairman of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana in Sinaloa, said the state had to be encouraged to engage in more dynamic productive activities.
"In general, we have observed that work has been done. We believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program to redefine the economic vocation and line of the country, because it is important to activate all the material and human resources of Sinaloa," he said.
There is a lot to do
The chairman of Coparmex stressed the importance of developing a future perspective that guides the government’s efforts in a better way.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas. Economic development has progressed, but it is important to develop a long-term program," he explained.
He stressed that the current state power has made progress with the government.
"There are areas in which one can say that the government has acted more comprehensively. What I can say is that it has worked and that the government is aware that a lot of work is still ahead of it," he said.
Arrest for 8 kg of marijuana
A resident of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in prison for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Republic’s prosecutor’s office announced that the drug dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was punished for a crime against public health – here the possession of marijuana destined for the trade.
According to file AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, on June 7, 2010, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by Mexican military forces while monitoring the Cipriano Valdez street opposite Guard No. 80 in the village of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer drove in a white van, in which he kept a black bag in a box in the car and on the passenger seat a small backpack in which the military found eight kilos and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated goods were handed over to the judge of the district and the convicted person remains in the detention centre.
Debt for construction works
According to Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel López Miranda, the social buildings intended for migrants in the programmes Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 are at risk of not being completed due to lack of funds or only with great delay.
The head of the city’s Social Development Authority stated that, although the construction programs have already advanced, they are now in danger because the state government has not paid the funds due to it, which exceed 11 million pesos for the three programs.
He said that the total investment in these three programs amounted to almost 50 million pesos, of which 25 percent fell to the state. So far, only the Federación and the municipality have contributed funds to the construction work, which is why a delay in the construction termination is to be expected.
"12 million they have to contribute, and even though the year is already coming to an end, they haven't given us a penny, and that even though they should have paid us a part already in July," he said. "To be not too late, we have already started construction, and they are already far advanced, but we need the money."
He pointed out that under the government of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the state had failed to meet its obligations, so the municipality had to take out a loan of 7 million at the beginning of its reign, corresponding to the amount that the central government should have raised.
"We had already done this in the last legislature, because the state did not have enough economic resources. The programs continued and this year we had to get the funds that the state had not spent to participate in these programs," he explained.
Although the state authorities were obliged to disburse these funds, he commented that the Minister of Administration and Finance, , had been asked to speed up the administrative work and pay the outstanding share as soon as possible.
"Almost 12 million they have to contribute, and although the year is already coming to an end, they haven't given us a penny."
The court approves the transition to digital television in Mexico for 2015
The transition from analog to digital signals has been one of the most important changes in recent years worldwide.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional lawsuits filed by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the presidential decree requiring the shift from analog to digital signals from 2021 to 2015 due to the lack of eight votes required to challenge the law.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, believed that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his powers when he issued the legislative decree detailing the switch to terrestrial digital television.
With this decision, the constitutional dispute initiated by the Senate was rejected because it did not receive the qualified majority of eight votes required for the court to decide on constitutionality or non-constitutionality.
In the project for the lawsuit, prepared by the Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, it was proposed to declare the Decree-Law unconstitutional, since the regulations concerning radio and television are the responsibility of the Comisión Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federal Commission for Telecommunications in Mexico), which is why the decree-Law would contradict the principles of this.
In favour of the project, only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted themselves.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies filed constitutional complaints against the Decree-Law. After accepting the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero no longer applied the Decree-Law and stopped all activities to establish the digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers also rejected the lawsuit filed by the Chamber of Deputies, without entering into the debate on the project, for which Minister Sánchez Cordero was also responsible.
In his contribution, the Prime Minister stated that he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the country government may not regulate with general rules the measures that the public administration is to take.
"I also do not believe that doing so would affect the independence of the regulator", she also recalled that the central government is responsible for planning strategic policy areas, such as the telecommunications sector, for constitutional reasons, because it is the central government that manages state affairs.
Replacing analog signals with digital is one of the most important changes that has taken place around the world in recent years, and it brings about a better use of the radioelectric spectrum, an increased quality of the signal and more channels.
The postponement of the transition, she said, was a postponement of the enjoyment of digitization, which is a decision in the public interest that has not only technical aspects, "because it covers economic, social, political and security aspects."
These matters, she stressed, "make the action of the entire system necessary, according to the principle of economic governance by the state, they included a group of features that put the Constitution into the hands of the central government."
She recalled that many countries around the world had already made the digital transition through the government, even though they had highly specialized facilities.
It cannot be concluded that the government would intervene in the powers of Congress by issuing the contested decree, because the laws passed by the legislature would be complied with," she assured.
The possibility of counting the ballots in Michoacán individually is being considered
According to PREP, the difference between first and second place in the election of the governor is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes out of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
The possibility of individually counting the ballots this year is a reality in the elections in Michoacán, because according to the data issued by the Programa de Resultados Electorales Preliminares (PREP), the difference between first and second place in the governor’s elections is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes out of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
In this sense, the President of the Consejo General del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that just last November the electoral office had adopted a series of regulations to harmonize local regulations with the reforms of the federal states in election matters.
It should be remembered that Michoacán had not adapted his political constitution, nor his electoral law, nor his electoral justice law to the reforms adopted by Congress, so that they had not entered into force in this round of elections, and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided their publication in the State Gazette within the time limits set for it, arguing that he had no objections.
On November 9, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) ruled on the constitutional complaint filed by the local legislature, deeming the vote of the State Commissioner on the constitutional reforms "invalid and unlawful" as he does not have the right to "decide or veto it".
María de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal explained in an interview about the possibility of individual counting of votes that thanks to the adoption of the guidelines by the Consejo General del IEM, there was now the possibility that the local electoral authority could count the ballots in part or in full.
Thus, the votes contained in one or more electoral packages may be partially counted under the following conditions. The results in the minutes do not agree; the minutes on the counting and calculation of votes do not exist on record or it is not in the possession of the Chairman of the Election Committee or there are obvious errors or amendments in the minutes.
In addition, the total counting of the fully filled ballots may take place if there is a difference between the alleged winner and the second-placed person equal to or less than one percent, provided that at the beginning of the meeting an explicit request is made by the party or coalition chairman, who is the second of the aforementioned candidates.
The counting of votes may also take place in its entirety if, after completion of the ordinary calculation, it is determined that the difference between the alleged winner and the candidate in second place is equal to or less than one percent, provided that an explicit request is made by a representative of the party whose candidate has become second, in which case the electoral packages subject to partial counting would be excluded.
It is worth noting that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation, where, according to the PREP, the difference between first and second place is just under 0.16 percent, although the votes out of 129 out of a total of 923 electoral protocols have not yet been counted.
His Last Will
His ashes will be scattered over the Zapalinamé mountains, the family confirms.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés poured down on Saltillo, his birthplace, this Sunday evening. On Monday, the death show and a mass took place.
According to family members, the lieutenant's last wish was that his ashes would be scattered over the Zapalinamé Mountains.
After a tribute, the family of Bacio Cortés and the others who died in the accident returned to the capital city of Coahuila on a Mexican air force plane, the closest people to the Colonel attended the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon, the ashes of the Lieutenant Colonel landed on the funeral hall on the Boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, where the family members and friends came.
At 5:30 p.m., his remains were examined at the Saltillo Technological Institute, which was initiated by his former high school colleagues and his American football team, to which Felipe Bacio belonged while preparing for high school.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and that his ashes would be scattered over the Zapalinamé Mountains, as he always said to his family and friends," Sandra Bacio Cortés, sister of the pilot, said in a statement.
From her point of view, the Lieutenant Colonel had fulfilled all his dreams and she believes that he had stood in the fullness of his life. "He was a successful man, exceptional as a father and as a son, a loving brother, and he always stood up for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left Saltillo very young to enter the school of the Air Force of Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some could not believe it because they thought it would make him feel dizzy even on a truck, yet he always strived to realize his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembered him as a good man: "He had hardly arrived in Saltillo, and already the whole family wanted to welcome him, as on the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man remembers that even at the age of seven he had gone to Zapopán for the graduation of his family member, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he liked best: flying a plane.
A final farewell
The Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, was passed with all honors under the leadership of Governor Jorge Torres López. Their honors were given to him by the people and the government, the Mexican Army of the Sixth Military Area, the Mexican Air Force, headmaster and pupil of the Saltillo Technological Educational Institute, where he studied sports as well as in 1985.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago when the helicopter he flew, in which also sat Secretary of State José Francisco Blake Mora and six others from the same authority, crashed.
At 18.05 the cremated remains of Bacio Cortés, a citizen of Saltillo, arrived to be handed over to members of the Mexican Air Force by the funeral company, led by Major Jaime Martinez, in the forecourt of the barracks, where he was already awaited by his family members, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his teacher, his mother, and other students.
The abandoned body was found on a property at Cadereyta NL
A few hours before the discovery, military officials presented the media with eleven people who had been arrested in the same village in connection with the organized crime.
Three men were found murdered by gunshots in different parts of the body and a gunshot of grace in an abandoned finca in the town of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The event had taken place at mileage point 1.5 of the road from Cadereyta to Santiago at the height of the municipality of El Castillo.
Several transients saw that the door of the country house surrounded by a beige-brown wall stood wide open.
When they looked into the house, they found the bodies of three people about three meters further inside, which they immediately reported to the competent authorities.
One was wearing a yellow T-shirt and dark pants, without shoes; next to him was another, dressed in a white top.
Nearly a meter away was another person’s body in a red t-shirt and blue pants.
All three were on their stomachs.
According to local information, the three people must have been murdered in another location because no cartridge sleeves were found.
On the wall of the country house can be read inscriptions that one organized crime gang writes to another, in addition, several shots were found in the wall and door.
11 people arrested in Cadereyta
The Secretaría de la Defensa Nacional presented 11 persons, including a minor, who were part of a gang of criminals working mainly in the village of Cadereyta and who are associated with kidnappings, murders, halconeo and secret funerals.
According to the information made public, eight people were first arrested on November 11 in the settlement of Los Alveros and a prisoner was released.
Three properties and a mobile phone were secured and the detainees confirmed to be members of the criminal group "Los Zetas".
On November 12th at 6:00 a.m., the military found a car with no number plates and two occupants in the village of Rancho Viejo in Cadereyta.
Inspecting the car, the military found a long weapon, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Later, on November 13 at 2 p.m., one of her accomplices was arrested in the municipality of La Frauda, who tried to escape at the sight of the military.
They are charged with secret burials in the towns of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
On Wednesday the formation of the new Italian government
The elected Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to introduce him to the new government that is to face the crisis that has led Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
The elected Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to introduce him to the new government that is to face the crisis that has led Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
A message from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm the formation of government.
It is assumed that he will present a majority technocratic cabinet, although it is not yet clear when the new prime minister will take office.
Monti said he would present the president with the results of the talks with the political parties on the formation of government.
"I would like to reaffirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to cope with these difficult times," he said.
Monti did not explicitly confirm the formation of government, but his comments show that the obstacles have been overcome.
The "frame is now well-defined," he added.
Monti has managed to form a government in less than three days, which is much less time than normal, while Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has driven the cost of debt to an unbearable level.
The new government, led by former EU Commissioner Monti, must adopt a tough austerity package, which was demanded by the Euro politicians in order to regain the shattered confidence in Italy.
Pressure on Monti’s haste was further exacerbated by the volatile market situation, which resulted in Italian government bonds being charged with 7% interest for 10 years, which corresponds to the situation in which Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for the European bailout shield.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian industrial association Confindustria, told the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government with all our might."
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to come out of this emergency.
Monti’s chances of success were significantly increased by the support of Silvio Berlusconi’s PDL party, which had to resign on Saturday as a result of the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are designed to produce good results," said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is essential, because so far many of its members have spoken out against a majority technocratic government that Monti is currently forming.
Support from Parliament
Monti’s new government needs strong parliamentary support to implement the likely unpopular austerity measures.
Opposition to his efforts or delaying reforms could once again lead to a devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Federation of Foreign Banks is also exerting pressure on Montis, saying that a failure would be a disaster.
Monti began Monday’s debates with political parties, trade unions and business associations, as well as youth and women’s organisations.
On Tuesday evening, the session will be closed.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who has initiated an extremely rapid change of government in response to the crisis.
After brief breathing out at the end of last week, when it became known that Berlusconi would resign, as a result of uncertainty about the success of the new prime minister, the cost of Italian government bonds has reached critical limits again.
A rescue of Italy with a national debt of 1.8 trillion euros would be too much for the current EU bailout umbrella.
Monti said his government would have to last until the next elections, which are expected to take place in 2013, despite predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms instead of preferring the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that it should only be made up of technicians, a sign of their concerns about the process imposed by the pressure of the financial markets.
Political sources point out that mutual distrust and disagreements between the parties complicate the inclusion of people from political life.
Spaniards have more games than the Ticos
Of the 22 players called up from Spain, ten have over 50 international games on their cheeks.
Costa Ricans have only one of the 22 called-ups with 50 games behind them.
A huge difference for Costa Rica when the 22 players from both countries are compared for the friendly game that takes place today at 3:05 p.m. at the San José National Stadium.
While the world and European champions, number one on FIFA’s monthly ranking, can look back on a considerable number of Class A selection games, the three-coloured team only has defender Michael Umana as the only one with over 50 international games.
He reached this number last Friday with the match against Panama (0-2) in Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish players who play in the Liga de las Estrellas (Star League) and influential clubs of the Premier League of England have the opportunity to participate in numerous home games (league and cup championships) and high-ranking European Cups such as the Champions League every year.
In addition, the experiences with the Spanish fury in complicated elimination matches at the Eurocup and the football world championships.
The Tico footballers, on the other hand, have few international matches as part of the Concacaf, which is at the bottom of the FIFA rankings.
We’ll see how the Spanish team draws their last record: goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who reached a tie with former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta on last Saturday (defeat 0-1 in London) with 126 overseas games.
Casillas will play today against the three-coloured team and Spain will set a new record of 127 international games.
Xavi Hernández, player of Barcelona football club, owns 106.
Casillas and Xavi even received recognition from UEFA last week, along with others of the Iberian team who had reached the magic number 100: the quoted Zubizarreta with 126 and Schalke’s midfielder, Raúl González, with 102.
Carles Puyol is also approaching the number of hundred with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc Fábregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
From the side of the Ticos and close to Michael Umana are the left side striker Júnior Díaz with 48 games and the striker Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From then on, only five came to over 30 games: Keilor Navas at 31, Randall Azofeifa at 32, Michael Barrantes at 31, Carlos Hernández at 36 and José Luis López at 35.
The ones with the least games.
Less than 30 matches have been played in the Spanish team Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
From the side of the national team come on less than 30 games Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest aren’t even close to the 20s.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba has two, Víctor Bolívar has only one in Costa Rica and <0xC3><0x93>lman Vargas and Edder Nelson have not made their debut yet.
Spain's historic goalkeeper is David Villa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz scored the most goals with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The quintet included Costa Rica in its tour to celebrate its 20th anniversary
"Playing in Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In the exclusive conversation with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam says the band is prepared to give one of their best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
For more than 20 years they were expected, but the band assured that a dream came true for them when they played in Costa Rica.
This was assured by bassist and co-founder of the group, Jeff Ament, who gave Viva an exclusive interview from Brazil last week.
The band is in the South American part of their tour to celebrate their 20th anniversary and on Sunday, the 20th, they will make their only stop in Central America.
On this day, they will perform at the National Stadium at 7:30 p.m. together with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
They read an excerpt from the conversation, whose full transcript can be found in the online edition of La Nación.
For your Costa Rican fans, a dream comes true when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what that means for your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream come true for us.
This is just the second time we’ve played in South and Central America, and so far it’s been great.
I have only been once to Costa Rica for a holiday. It is such a beautiful country that we will definitely stay there for a few more days.
It’s exciting to bring our music there.
I ask you this because the fans of the band are completely devoted, they experience the days before the concert most intensely.
What do you say to your most enthusiastic fans?
Thank you for being at our side all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry to have taken so long to get here.
Some people even think that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Isn’t that a bit of pressure from your visit?
Some of the greatest shows we’ve done in the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We played on some giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that they have made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we want to play there.
We love this country, we love surfing and we love the jungle, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo where the waves are simply unimaginable.
My friends have always gone surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Together with Mexico, these are excellent areas for surfing. In this way, we have learned about people who love surfing.
With a look at the tour you have offered giant shows with many songs.
What are your plans for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we have never played there, we have no limits.
We will try to give the best possible show with a lot of different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and offer our fans a good and versatile repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why? Why?
I think that’s partly because we have nine records and we can play over 120 songs, and each likes a different song, so it’s not easy to decide which one we’re going to play.
If we include two or three songs that we haven’t played in a long time, we can better maintain our concentration and they surprise us because they remind us of the reasons why we liked these songs, otherwise they could be forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting for us, and I think that’s why it’s so interesting for the audience.
With this tour, you celebrate your twenty years of history.
When you look back, do you find it hard to believe in your success?
Yeah, totally.
First of all, I don’t think any of us ever imagined playing in a great rock band for more than 20 years, and that sounds like a dream.
We also continue to rely on this blessing and find it great to be able to make music together even now.
We like each other and are excited to produce music.
We are lucky to be able to drive to the places in the world that we have always wanted to visit.
Things couldn't stand better.
What did it mean for you to have actively participated in the birth of grunge?
It has always been an honor to be part of this group of big bands.
We are good friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and abundantly unusual when a movement emerges from a group of friends.
From time to time, a band comes out of a city, but it is already unusual for five or ten groups to come from the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Soundgarden on their tour. We are still happy to be friends with them all and it honors us to be part of this emerging Seattle sound.
It’s also very unusual for a band like yours to have stayed with the same musicians for so long.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which alone is much more time than many bands can endure.
First of all, I believe that we all appreciate being happy to be still alive and, moreover, we take care of each other.
We are all close friends, which is why musical paths have opened up that give everyone the freedom to experiment.
One person knows the other and his music, and we couldn't be better off.
Your relationship with fame has not always been easy, but on the other hand, your success has allowed you to always do what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
The way we have grown has made it easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure not to be on tour too often, because it’s too easy to fall for this game with huge crowds who love your music.
As long as you keep in mind that people came because of the music, it reminds you that you have to pay attention to the music and what it created, without being obsessed with being a famous rock star.
What memories do you have of your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote very good songs and it was great in the beginning.
For three years we were a band that had never released a record until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
We were disappointed to have taken so long. We are still good friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who built the band with us. When I listen to a song or see photos, I think of what an incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh. It was always a pleasure to go to work and talk about other topics of football and laughing together.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The national band Las Robertas are responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and have chosen the band for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos of several groups and we liked this band the best, so we’re curious to see what Las Robertas can offer live. That’s sure to be exciting.
Why do you always change the lyrics of Yellow Ledbetter when you play live?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
He sings it, and I think he sings the first thing that comes to his mind.
Who influenced you as a bass player?
of so many+
The first to come to mind are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge alive, even though it is no longer a fashion item?
I don’t think we all feel very connected to the word grunge.
When I think about it, I think about the bands I mentioned before, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and everyone else who came up at the same time. If they are still important today, I think that’s great because it’s worth listening to this music and bands like Mudhoney are making better music now than ever before.
Initially her music was darker, now she is more positive.
Why? Why?
That’s interesting, because I think there are a few songs on the new album that might seem a bit lighthearted, but there are also other songs like The End or Just Breathe that are classified as very dark songs, although they also have something positive in them.
The tears came to both of them when I heard Ed playing them. They are very dark songs.
I think when you get older and something traumatic has happened in your life -- like losing a family member or a friend -- that affects your artistic work and your music, and these two songs clearly embody that for me.
But I also believe that you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori returned to hospital for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday to investigate the muscle loss of his legs, his family doctor informed.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who served 25 years in prison for violating human rights during his reign (1990-2000), has several diseases, including tongue cancer, which has been operated on four times and is under control.
Alejandro Aguinaga, Congressman and his personal doctor, told TV that Fujimori was being examined for three days at the Peruvian Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplásicas hospital to determine the reason for his pain and muscle loss in the lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that, in his opinion, Fujimori could be pardoned for humanitarian reasons, yet he did not wish to do so because he considers him innocent.
He was operated on four times for tongue cancer and lost 18 kilos of weight, along with other conditions such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst in the pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and blood circulation problems in the legs, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been in the National Detention Centre for Special Operations of the Police since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the killing of 25 people by the death squad of the Peruvian army, which was secretly active during his reign.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
An official delegation, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica and made up of several ministers and entrepreneurs, will start their visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and discuss political issues of the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart Felipe Calderón, which, according to the president of Uruguay, will be the culmination of his full schedule with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the collective of Uruguayans living in Mexico.
The meeting of both presidents in the city of Guadalajara "is suitable for exchanging information on all policy areas between the two countries," the South American country's presidential office announced on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is seeking Calderón’s support regarding the incident with France when French Prime Minister Nicolas Sarkozy placed the South American country on a list of tax havens at the G20 summit in the French city of Cannes.
In his discourse, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that are still acting as tax havens, which was rejected by Uruguay and prompted a request from his ambassador to the European country.
Mexico has chaired the G20 since November, a group of the world’s most powerful emerging and industrialized countries, and since January this year an agreement has been in place on the exchange of tax information to avoid double taxation with the South American country.
In recent years, the government of Uruguay has tried to accelerate the concretisation of tax information exchange agreements to be removed from the "grey list" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), according to countries that have not introduced all international standards for tax cooperation.
On a business level, there has been a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay since 2004, which has contributed to a growing exchange of goods between the two countries.
The mustache installer enters the third dimension with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has been fighting tirelessly for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but so far never in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he fights for the girl's love in stereo technology.
The game, which is coming to store counters around the world this month, has been tailored from the very beginning to the features of the portable console Ninth 3DS, which can be played three-dimensionally without any special glasses.
“Mario is the character who has to tell how the stereoscope works without glasses,” said Omar <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, who is responsible for the press specialized in Nintendo in Spain at the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez explained that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "Nintendo's first video game to be developed for this console from the very beginning" because hit articles like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" have so far been adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo’s spokesman underlined that, although it is three-dimensional, “Super Mario 3D Land” is an “affordable” video game that allows for a fast, fluid gameplay.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contained two games in one: the first part is "light" to catch the less clever users.
After that, the experts can "turn a second round" about the different levels of the game, which are becoming increasingly difficult.
In addition, users can choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action. However, to overcome the obstacles without becoming victims of the "optical effects" must always be played three-dimensionally.
This trip to the three-dimensional world of Super Mario also means the return of the character to a portable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game, Nintendo winks at the fans of the saga and repeats the success recipe of the last editions: The moustache-bearded installer must overcome perilous platforms to free Princess Peach.
However, the player encounters news about the movements, the environment, the disguises and the enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Colom guarantees extradition of Portillos to the United States
Guatemalan President <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he would grant the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo to be held accountable in the United States for the $70 million money laundering conspiracy.
The process on the US request for Portillo’s extradition ends so that it can be brought to justice.
In a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was based on the independence of the judiciary and the government, taking into account that a decision-making court had already ordered extradition.
He stressed that during his administration he did not interfere in court decisions and accepted all extradition requests that he was informed of.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín is extradited for murder and serious bodily injury, Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom's action is a governmental act that takes place when all judicial and constitutional instances of condemnation of the former President of the State (2000-2004) have been exhausted.
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court of Guatemala, Portillo must be extradited once his legal situation in Guatemala has been clarified and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted of the embezzlement of 120 million Quetzales in the Ministry of Defence during his reign. This trial preceded the extradition, but the minister objected and revived the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people at risk of social exclusion
The organization was created to avoid the marginalization of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of the social welfare organization Trinijove have led to important results: During this quarter of century, 6,000 young people at risk of social exclusion were supported in order to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, there are over a hundred jobs created for this social group.
On the occasion of the anniversary, an account was drawn yesterday at an event in the former factory buildings of Fabra i Coats, in which more than 300 people participated.
Trinijove was founded in 1986 in the Trinitat Vella district with the aim of helping young people with low education, without work, with drug problems threatened by the risk of marginality.
Yesterday’s celebration in Sant Andreu was attended by numerous leaders of institutions and institutions that have worked with the association over the past 25 years.
The participation of political representatives of different directions during campaign times proved the impartiality of the work done by Trinijove.
In addition to the President of the Generalitat (Parliament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol participated in the celebrations of the former Socialist Minister of Education Ernest Maragall and the former mayor and current left-green city councillor Ricard Goma.
The large hall of Fabra i Coats was also visited by the current Catalan Minister of Social Affairs and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director General of the Social Work of the Sparkasse La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas emphasized that Trinijove was created in very difficult times and that today's times are no less complicated, but he added that the work done so far "is a good foundation".
For the President of the Generalitat, Trinijove is an example who knows how to fight against difficult circumstances and gives hope to people in difficulty.
"The economic crisis is nothing new for the club and the work it does," he said.
Occupied house where giant parties were held was cleared
The homeowners had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building at Balmes No. 51 (Barcelona).
The 12 house occupiers left the building yesterday afternoon without any resistance.
Everything indicates that the nightmares of the neighbors of the house No. 51 on Balmes street have come to an end.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building yesterday at noon, which they illegally occupied and in which they had organized huge festivals that had driven the neighborhood to despair. The eviction was carried out on judicial order without police intervention.
After the evacuation, the door lock was replaced to avoid a similar situation.
"From now on, access will be controlled," the house administrator confirmed.
The house occupiers, who had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest were inhabited - took the entire electrical system and part of the water supply, and they had painted the walls and left behind all kinds of garbage, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
In the three lower floors, huge parties were celebrated that lasted up to two days, driving the tenants to despair.
Next to the building is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which also suffered damage from it.
Their owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that their business had declined by 80% since the start of the house occupation.
The owner of the discotheque pointed out that the homeowners were doing their unfair competition, because they sold the drinks for three euros, while these cost 10 euros in the discotheque.
In addition, the owner of the recreational venue had been reported by the neighbors for rest disturbance, while, according to her statement, the noise did not come from the visitors of the disco, but from the occupiers and especially from the guests of the festivals that were organized there, and which, according to the statements of the angry neighbors, were becoming more and more prolonged in recent weeks.
The manager of the discotheque explained that the harassment had been so great that it agreed with the owner of the building to have no rent to pay for the last nine months.
The Guardia Urbana (urban police) also confirmed that it had received more complaints from the neighbors in the last few weeks.
Last week, the leader of the PP (Partido Popular - People's Party) in the City Council of Barcelona, Alberto Fernández Díaz, called for the building to be cleaned immediately and to get to grips with the problems of civic coexistence as well as the downturn of the neighborhood.
He explained that before the summer, only one floor of the building had been occupied, but that in recent months the house occupiers had penetrated into all floors of the building and almost all apartments.
In that sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to take action against the anti-social actions in the building."
Yesterday another building in the Nou Barris district was cleared by the Catalan police.
At 3:30 p.m., police approached Montral No. 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who had watched four people attempt to enter the building.
The four were immediately arrested.
Park or mountain?
Apart from the disputes over the fees, the architects agree with the tender.
The municipal call for proposals for the 16 gates reopens the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the disappearance of the Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its blasphemy paper on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona city.
It was even compared in numbers to the Central Park of New York.
With the collapse of the CMB in 1987, the park became, in the eyes of many, the upper limit of Barcelona, because the capital of Catalonia is one of the few that does not spread north-south, but up (mountain) and down (sea).
Collserola’s classification as a natural park plays with this idea.
The model was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone with wild boars in the role of the Yogi bear.
In September, the city issued a giant tender consisting of 16 competitions for further access gates to Collserola.
Without a doubt, a gate points to the concept of a park.
Either this is the case, or someone intends to set gates to the country.
The question arises: Collserola, park or mountain?
Not only from an organizational point of view, but also with a view to a reflection on the city, the tender is the topic of conversation in the mouth of all architects from Barcelona.
It’s almost a recurring topic that two members of this old-fashioned caste who meet in the elevator can resort to.
And this is precisely the fact that provides the fabric for one of the rare similarities between what three architects from Barcelona think about it, and some university professors who have applied for the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The tender is appropriate.
For Roldán "it is necessary to speak about the "front of the mountains" after the attack on the coast, as far as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, who spoke about the green apples, has not been carried out.
“One should assume that Barcelona’s biggest park is the beach.
Partly because it is easily accessible.
Collserola is more complex,” judges the architect, for whom the title “Gates of Collserola” carries a “lexical trap”: it is not to be imagined “as access to a park, but as a confinement of areas where action must be taken.”
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with urban development experience, regards the proposal as an “intellectual challenge” that carries “some dangers”.
Dangers due to the "uncertainty that the design of a public space entails today" according to the experience of the 1980s, which had its "swan song" in the area of the Forum.
The first fear is one’s own constraints on what can be built.
"Limiting something always means defining the next step," i.e. going beyond it.
"One has to think about new urban planning tools, because the current [referring to the Plan General Metropolitano (PGM) ] can lead to a real disaster."
Modol, who adheres more closely to the question, simplifies the view that the side of Collserola, which goes towards Vallesana, "can be understood as a park that does not go towards Barcelona", for purely topographical reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study by the Patronat de Collserola, which should not "get deaf ears", although he is grateful to the city administration for giving his board the opportunity to participate in this project "from the first moment".
In addition, he notes that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the guideline that allows architects to participate in the debate, although he expresses his "doubts" about whether this technical profile should guide the created multidisciplinary teams ("exactly the right thing," he says) "We architects should be just a tool."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the headline of this article is complex, as there is no global view of Collserola in the tender terms: "There were 16 competitions in cross-section," he says, "on the Axis Mountain-Sea. But there is no longitudinal perspective that looks at the area as a whole."
This, at least in his case, led him to participate in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the program and the definition of a project for a gate would collide with that of the architect of the gate next to it.
In his opinion, the city should absolutely guarantee that the strip directly above the Ronda de Dalt is equipped in its entire length to create a smooth transition between the city and green areas.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal who comes free
After 72 days of silence, Casino Red’s authorized representative released the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey from the trial that is being held against him for alleged blackmail.
After 72 days of imprisonment, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal is released after the authorized representative of Casino Red has forgiven him before the District’s Second Criminal Court, which is leading the trial against the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey for extortion.
After the assassination of Casino Royale, Sergio Gil García, the owner of Casino Red, released a series of photos and videos showing Manuel Jonás, who allegedly forced him to pay a sum of money for the city council to approve the secret operation of the betting house.
According to the criminal complaint, the prosecution opened a criminal case against the brother of the panic mayor, who was arrested on September 2 for 30 days.
After four hours with the official of the Ministerio Público 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales, he was taken to the Casa de Arraigo 1 in the Barrio Antiguo of the capital.
He stayed there for 49 days after a second arrest warrant, after the official of the Ministerio Público had dismissed the crimes for bribery and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to the Cadereyta detention centre for allegedly bribing the owners of Casino Red with one and a half million pesos, while he remained in the Central Security District for only a few hours as he was threatened with death.
The authorities allowed him to participate in the trial as an inmate of the municipal prison of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On 25 October, the secretary of the District’s Second Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, sent him a detention order, stating that after the nearly two-month investigations, there was sufficient evidence to accuse Jonás of paying 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the betting house to open it in return.
This Monday, Casino Red’s authorised representative, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, asked Judge José Luis Pecina to release the mayor’s brother’s sentence, which is why he will be released in the next few hours.
During the court hearing, Ramiro Arias, the official of the Ministerio Público associated with the court, García Gómez, asked if he had repaired the damage and who the owner of the betting house had forgiven, but the lawyer withheld the name.
In accordance with Case 197/2011, Jonás Larrazábal is acquitted. In the following, no appeals against the proceedings can be made, and no damages are claimed.
After hearing the authorized representative of the betting house about 3.50 p.m., Larrazabal Bretón was immediately set free.
The court secretary, Jorge Yánez, drove to the San Nicolás de los Garza Municipal Prison to inform Jonás that he had been acquitted and his case would be placed in the file.
He also informed him of the court order for immediate release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome announced details of the plane crash in which Secretary of State Francisco Blake and seven other people were killed.
The Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes - SCT informed that the findings of the investigation into the accident in which the government secretary Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people died indicate that the helicopter, with its entire undamaged structure, hit the ground directly without the pilot could have an emergency landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary for Communications and Transport, mentioned that the pilot had confirmed before take-off that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the propeller wing had contact with trees at a height of 25 meters, with the helicopter losing the hull, seems to indicate that the helicopter had had several ground contacts."
He also explained that the helicopter was built for 19 occupants, which is why it met all the requirements for the transport of the personnel.
In addition, he said that during the investigations in the area where the machine had fallen, no helicopter parts were found.
"During the search, no aircraft parts were found elsewhere, the surcharge affected the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 occupants, which is why it met all the requirements for passenger transport.
The area has an inclination of 7 to 30 degrees.
Currently, it is a priority to get the results as soon as possible, but it could take several months, perhaps even a year.
For his part, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Mexican Secretariat for Aircraft and Auxiliary Services) assured that the helicopter from the Estado Mayor Presidencial had flown at travel speed and the aircraft had fallen on a soft slope.
"This information reinforces the assumption that it was a normal flight operation at the time of the impact."
At a press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant points to be taken into account in the investigation:
Visible flight:
In accordance with the flight standards, it was a flight according to the rules of visual flight, which means that the crew should have had sufficient visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The AICM recorded suitable weather conditions at take-off, with some deep-hanging clouds rising as it continued to fly towards the border area between Mexico City and the State of Mexico.
Selected routes:
It is possible that the team had chosen a lower area with better visibility towards the Cuernavaca Valley because of the clouds.
Impact point:
The collision coordinates and the last radar record of the helicopter match, and there may not have been any loss of control of the aircraft or any deviation from the flight route prior to the impact.
Scattering the remains of the aircraft in a limited area:
The information available to date indicates that the helicopter was impacted from a straight and lateral direction.
The pattern of scattered aircraft remains suggests that the helicopter with its undamaged structure hit the ground.
No evidence of fire or explosion:
The remains of the aircraft at the scene of the accident do not indicate a fire or explosion.
The latest investigation results indicate several ground contacts.
On-site investigations have found aircraft parts at an altitude of 9,200 feet above sea level, the terrain is sloping and has an inclination of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter probably broke.
Some information suggests that the helicopter may have had several ground contacts.
After a minute search in an area beyond the locked area at the accident site, no scattered aircraft parts could be found, reinforcing the assumption that the undamaged aircraft structure had bounced to the ground.
MSS Announces a Research Protocol to Find the Gene for Obesity
The Social Security Institute of Mexico is conducting a research project on finding the gene for obesity in children and adolescents, supported by IPN specialists.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Social Insurance Institution of Mexico) announced that it is conducting a research project on the discovery of the gene for obesity in children and adolescents under the title "Genetics of obesity in childhood and adolescence", which aims to find the genetic markers associated with obesity.
Miguel Cruz López, head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica at the Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, explained that an interdisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was set up.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the study. Interested parties can come to the sports courts of the IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where tests with children and adolescents are conducted every Saturday from 8.00 am.
He stressed that the investigation began at the sports field of Cuauhtémoc (in the west of the state of México) and will continue since 8 October at the sports field of Nezahualcóyolt (in the east of the state of México).
When the target of 500 to 600 subjects has been reached, the study will be continued at the Independencia sports field (in the south of the capital district) and completed at Morelos (in the north of the capital district).
He explained that the aim of the study was to get to know the factors and the role of genetics in connection with the development of obesity and to identify risk factors in Mexican children and adolescents for the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the World Diabetes Day, he stated that it was aimed at completing nutritional questionnaires for three thousand children and adolescents aged six to 14 years with the consent and supervision of their parents.
They will also be asked questions about their physical activity and family history to control risk factors that could lead to diabetes or kidney failure.
He also explained that on the mentioned Saturdays, the subjects were measured (weight, size, waist circumference), their blood pressure was controlled and blood values such as glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (trying to identify genes associated with childhood obesity) were determined.
Cruz López stressed that this investigation would be conducted in response to health care professionals’ concerns about the alarming weight gain of young people.
"The health surveys from 1999 and 2006 showed that in almost six years the proportion of obese boys increased by 77 percent and that of girls with obesity by 47 percent, and that obesity also increased dramatically," the IMSS specialist said.
He stated that the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of the population of Mexico was different from that of other peoples.
He stated that one Mexican is, on average, 65 percent Native American, 30 percent European, and 5 percent African, which is reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and obesity.
In general, he explained that the genetics of obesity are expressed in the inability to burn out the excess energy (calories) taken to us, so that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the study participants would be a comprehensive study of children, which would determine whether they had a degree of overweight or obesity.
It would even investigate the occurrence of dark skin folds in the neck and inner arm (acanthosis), which indicate the likelihood of pre-stage metabolic disorders and diabetes.
All information would be treated confidentially and communicated to parents in writing by the doctors. The doctors will explain all measurement results to the parents and suggest lifestyle changes that are appropriate for the prevention of disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three basic factors responsible for overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of exercise, that is, lack of exercise in everyday life, spending most of the time of the day in front of the TV and using means of transport, instead of walking short distances.
The high calorie intake, that is, an increased consumption of sugared beverages and carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburger, etc.) together with a high fat and protein intake as well as the genetics to be analyzed in this research project.
UNAM asphalt prevents impact holes
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at the Mexican University of UNAM, develops modified asphalt with polymers to make the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
If paid attention to the signs emanating from the road surface, it would not be necessary to completely repair almost 200,000 punch holes when the rainy season in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México erupts, said Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at the University of UNAM, warning and assuring the number of punch holes to be reduced considerably.
In his lecture “Technical Holes” on the occasion of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory he is responsible for is developing polymer-modified asphalts to produce a mixture similar to asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera believed that this type of modified asphalt should be used in areas with extremely hot climates, such as in some cities in the north of the country, to improve the behavior of road surfaces and thus avoid the appearance of impact holes.
He explained that the asphalt - the heaviest part of oil - is a hydrocarbon compound, one of which has a high molecular weight - the so-called asphalts - and the other part a low - the so-called malthenes. Together they give the road surface its characteristic toughness behavior.
Tough-elastic behavior of the asphalt means that it behaves like a liquid at high temperatures of almost 180° C. At 120° C. it is very viscous and at 50° C. it is almost solid, while it becomes brittle at very low temperatures.
"This means that the resistance of the asphalt on the roads is not uniform, but changes in one day depending on weather conditions and temperature fluctuations," the chemical engineer said.
The researcher of the FQ noted that the streets of Mexico City had mostly a flexible road surface, composed of six layers of material, the last three of which included asphalt.
Between the top layers lies a wear layer of asphalt, which consists of small stones bathed in asphalt and then solidified.
Every single stone of this wear layer had been bathed in asphalt.
When the vehicles move on and forces are generated, this layer allows for a good distribution of forces in the road surface.
"If it were modified asphalt, the forces would be even better distributed," said the chemical engineer.
"Above the wear layer," he explained, "a final layer is laid, the so-called support layer, which consists of tiny stones, i.e. of sand, which was also bathed in asphalt.
Since this layer is in contact with the vehicle tires, they require a greater mechanical force than the wear layer and it must produce friction.
As this road surface receives and distributes the most forces, the support layer also needs an appropriate thickness and the material it is made of must be maintained.
Weather conditions, especially humidity and temperature fluctuations, are other important factors to consider, especially water," he said, "because it significantly affects the behavior of the wear layer.
When the terrain becomes damp, water penetrates into the layer and is difficult to expel, causing a softening of all layers of road surface and, as a result, the appearance of bump holes.
If a punch hole occurs," he said, "the top layer is first removed, while the wear layer is only affected afterwards. But the damage does not occur immediately, but it is a process that should be maintained by appropriate maintenance programs at the first signs."
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores stated that the vehicle load is another important cause of the occurrence of impact holes, so the thickness of each layer of road surface must always be proportional to the vehicle load and it must be ensured that this regulation is complied with in order to avoid frequent impact holes.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that there was still a lot of research to be done, for example on asphalt emulsions, which are already on the market in other countries, and with which the impact holes could be repaired easily and without the application of high temperatures.
What was missing from the candidate del Valle to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that influenced the failure of Melina Ramírez Serna to receive the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle receives his 14th misstep.
Once again, Valle del Cauca went empty in the award of the crown for Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to be content to stand on the winning podium, showcasing a silver crown and the band she identifies as the new Miss Colombia.
With the result obtained this night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico 2008 took the crown and the cedar, the department already comes to 14 misses, and Melina joins the legion of women from Valle del Cauca, who had almost held the crown in their hands. Lorraine, Mary Benoit, Miriam Ospina (1947), Clara Bor Domínguez
The big question that many people are asking today is: What is missing?
After all, the result corresponds to the decline of a great favorite, who had shown at every demonstration that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia. Not for nothing she had been elected the Queen of the Police and the Mayor Rostro Jolie of Vogue, titles that also the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro had received, and who took the crown of the house of Miss Colombia.
The first factor deemed decisive for the jury’s decision to appoint her First Miss is that she had not convinced the answer to the question “Which book influenced you the most and why?” which had been asked to her by Martín Murillo Gómez of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied to the questioner:
"I read a lot, I pretty much believe in literature, I think it's a way to civilize, ultimately I think the book that shaped my childhood the most, 'The Little Prince', is a rather profound book.
I am currently reading <0x60>Guilty and Atonement'. It is a book of universal culture that we should all read. I am currently reading a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called <0x60>Passions'.
A response that encountered little counter-love, firstly because of the concept of "civilizing" and secondly because it had not explained concretely how each of the books it mentioned had influenced it.
But after completing the ceremony, Melina explained that she felt calm and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, it happens what needs to happen.
And for all people, please read a little bit of <0x60>The Little Prince'. It's a great book.
Among other things, it is said that the favorite of El Valle is burned out.
A journalist from Bogota indicated that the fact that she was the preferred one, who received all the acclaim and who had received all the prizes in advance (Gastronomie competition Oster, public vote on the best handmade costume and Reina Madre), "had made the other candidates jealous, which the Queen could not stress on the stage."
And this was noticed at her first performance in her swimsuit on the Hilton Hotel’s beach and at her two elevators at the coronation ceremony.
Although she performed safely with both, she lacked the strength and momentum that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico showed.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program "Como en casa" at the RCN channel, said that the fact that Melina was crowned Miss "shows that the candidate who wins the most prizes during the competition will not eventually become queen".
In addition, Valle went out of the way at the end of the press - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle was unable to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
It will already have its reason that two days before the international jury compilation, Lucy Doughty stated that they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social affairs of their country.
"Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond the physical and focus on the social sense that she had already worked on projects before participating in the competition," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with her defects of the derriere and fibrosis noted in the stomach area, but this is contradictory, because the jury chose her as a candidate for 'natural beauty' with a healthy body, good eating habits and responsible physical work.
The coach of the Queens, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina did not have the best body, that there would be better, "but her problem with the fibrosis on the abdomen, which for me honestly was barely noticeable, pushed her score on the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of the journal Cromos believes that the fault of the Valle del Cauca woman was the surgical procedures she had undergone.
"Operations are okay, but Valle didn't know how to make them right.
Her body has never been her strong side, and this place she had to pay for."
Because of this award, which is awarded for the first time by the National Beauty Competition, a cruel prediction emerged after the appearance in the swimsuit, which was to come true at night. It was rumored that Raymundo had given Melina a consolation prize in order not to let her enjoy the crown.
Whether that’s true or not, the fact is that Melina is starting her reign year, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that offers her the opportunity to represent Colombia at one of the international competitions on the appointment of the National Beauty Competition.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite her overwhelming appearance for Cartagena, had missed the crown.
So was the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A lophoscopist from Cali went into history as the man who identified "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials plays a key role.
Last November, a lophoscopist from the Cali Prosecutor’s Unit of Investigation (CTI) came in as the man who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia) by comparing the fingerprints: “Alfonso Cano”.
Of the seven lophoscopists in the CTI department, this week Eliazar González, a Puerto Tejada man who has been involved in criminal investigations for 21 years, had been on standby this week.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in Chocó communities, where he often had to go to the jungle for five days to reach the place where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to Valle and after completing the required courses he specialized in lophoscopy, which is the examination of the skin that is subjected to friction, i.e. the palms of the hands and feet.
During the week of the operation against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was advised to pack clothes for at least three days.
Something great awaited him.
Friday night he flew in a helicopter from Palmira to Cauca.
He knew that he was to identify two bodies, and that there was a suspicion that one could be the man who had led the oldest guerrilla in the world, so he was to take with him the ten-finger imprint of Guillermo León Sáenz (his actual name).
However, when he reached the place where the body was, he was unable to identify it because of its physical appearance, because it was not in the least similar to the pictures he had seen in the mass media.
He had no beard, was dressed like a farmer in the area, wore no glasses, and was much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Armed with a magnifying glass, ink, a planter and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the body’s fingerprints to those on the print sheet.
He had seen it right: it was "Alfonso Cano".
The same night, this Puerto Tejada-born man was responsible for telling the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that he was actually the head of the FARC.
In search of traces
For a dactyloscope from Sijín in Cali, the tribute given to President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González at a press conference on the deployment against "Cano" was very important.
Many people do not know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science with no error rate, which can be a key factor in resolving a crime.
Lophoscopists not only identify bodies, they also support investigations into murder and robbery cases and confirm the identity of the people arrested.
At the time of their arrest, many offenders present false ID documents or they have none.
We'll take their fingerprints and search them in the database.
The researcher told us that in the event of a theft, he had to tear a piece of wall out of a house, because the thief had supported himself with his hand exactly at this point when he pulled out a safe filled with jewelry and money.
"Walls are difficult because their surfaces are unsuitable for fingerprinting, but in this case we were able to take the whole hand print and identify the offender who had participated in several thefts," he recalled.
Fingerprints can also be used to relieve or burden suspects of murder.
Recently, a dead person was found surrounded by bottles of alcohol.
In the investigation, it was suspected that a family member might be suspected, and in fact a fingerprint on the bottle matched.
Although this does not guarantee that it is the murderer, it is linked to the place where the crime was committed.
A CTI dactyloscopist explained that "the fingerprints would be taken from the object with chemical or physical reagents."
When they appear, a planter or ribbon is used to take them with you.
After that, the prints are sent to Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the civil registry office.
“The problem is that there are still many Colombians without identity papers,” the expert from the CTI explained.
He said that not everything is the way it was portrayed in the TV series SCI.
Just as not everything that shines is gold, not everything you touch is a fingerprint.
But it can still be used if you make a corresponding comparison.
The “indignates” challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters gathered in tents in Zuccotti Square.
Most of them obeyed the eviction order and moved to a nearby park.
Members of the Ocupy Wall Street movement challenged New York authorities on Tuesday as they tried again with a court order to enter Manhattan Square after being cleared of the square at dawn and trying to occupy another seat at the Big Apple.
Hundreds of protesters gathered in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to gain access to a court order allowing the "indignated" to re-tent at this point, while another section of the movement adhered to the eviction order and occupied a park further north in the city, where there were nine arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp in the square, we will gather in another place and continue the battle by legal means for the return to Zuccotti, with sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, one of the spokesmen of the movement.
Bray explained that the response of the “indignates” to the eviction of their tent camp, which had been ordered directly by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, came before the court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the violent eviction of the square and authorizing the protesters to camp.
In addition, the "indigents" occupied a new park, located at the intersection of centrally located Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the Holland Tunnel entrance, which connects New York and New Jersey and is owned by Trinity Church.
They were able to occupy the site for at least an hour, but afterwards police arrived and arrested some of the protesters, although Bray cannot give exact numbers. He assured the Efe news agency that he had seen several journalists handcuffed among them.
The organization assured that hundreds of people had arrived at this point, where a detachment of religious leaders had also arrived as a sign of their support for the members of the movement and for mediation with the police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti Square (a privately owned site) remains closed pending a judicial hearing scheduled for Tuesday to analyze the legality of the eviction that took place at dawn.
Some of the protesters driven by the square carried photocopies of this court order and distributed them, even giving them to some police officers guarding the square, resulting in "some small clashes," according to Bray, who reported that some police officers had beaten protesters.
The court order prohibits the authorities from removing members of Occupy Wall Street from the square, as well as the application of "laws passed after the occupation and prohibiting the demonstrators from returning to the park with their tents and other things they had previously used."
Mayor Bloomberg made it clear to the press that this judicial order had lifted the reopening of the square to public traffic and the protesters, pointing out that the city laws did not allow them to re-establish tents and sleeping bags in this place.
The mayor personally defended the early morning evacuation of Zuccotti Square, where nearly 200 people were arrested, and which was decided because the protesters were “violating the law.”
Bloomberg said he had given the order to evict the square because it had "transformed into a place where people did not come to demonstrate, but to break the laws and in some cases to harm other people", because "some businesses had received threats" and the residents feared "for their quality of life."
"Evacuation at dawn was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is basically interested in protecting the financial interests and not the interests of North American workers," the movement's spokesman added, accusing the mayor of "not respecting the freedom of the press."
Occupy Wall Street officials said they were considering organizing "big actions" for Thursday, together with community organizations and trade unions, to commemorate the two months that the protests have been taking since September 17.
Pamela Anderson is in the TV Christmas show The Virgin Mary
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, she will appear on December 1st on the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas"
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", lifeguard in "Baywatch", rabbit in "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary on a Christmas show on Canadian television.
The private TV channel CTV today announced that Anderson, along with the "crooner" (ballad singer) Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, will appear on December 1 on the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" and breathe life into a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today broadcast images of the television program in which Anderson - who also appears on the Internet for the distribution of a self-filmed porn, in which she appears along with her former husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee - as the Virgin Mary with a doll in her lap to portray Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Native American origin who recently worked as a presenter on Charlie Sheen’s show “My Violent Torpedo of Truth,” appears as a child of Jesus.
CTV’s Christmas program not only relies on Anderson and Peters, but also on Canadian singer Bublé, who married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, and who is not far from this controversy.
At one of his concerts in New York, Bublé had recently referred to North American Kim Kardashian as a "whore."
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP grows 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of free fall from early March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, which is still recovering from the devastating earthquake that led to a nuclear crisis, and the worst disaster Japan had experienced during World War II.
The first estimates by the government in Tokyo valued property damage at $300,000, a blow that seems to be weakening despite the difficult world economic situation.
After three quarters of losses, the data on gross domestic product from July to September were used to finally close this chapter: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% to the year-calculated ratio.
Measured in the second quarter – Japan’s fiscal year starts in March 2012 – it also represents the fastest growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery can be explained in part by the sale of machinery for the reconstruction of the areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, the companies increased their investments by 1.1% compared to the 0.9% decline in investments recorded from January to March, the first decline after six months of unstoppable increases.
Nevertheless, the actual upheaval of the Japanese economy is not based solely on Keynesian impulses that use the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructure.
Japan has woken up, especially thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, driven by growing spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The Stigma of the Yen
Tokyo has entrusted itself to the domestic market after the yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the "refuge currencies" of investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and the blurred forecasts for the U.S., a privilege that burdens the accounts of export companies like a tombstone.
With a harder currency, products abroad are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of major technology producers.
Toyota and Sony, for example, attributed their weak business results from July to September to the listing of the yen.
While markets continue to besiege the peripheral EU countries, the government of Yoshihiko Noda remains vigilant.
"You have to pay attention to the ongoing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the effects of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said the Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
The prospects are really not very uplifting.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said most member states had shown clearer signs of slowing economic development in September.
The indicator, which anticipates the turning points of the world economy, revealed that the biggest economic potentials would have been slowed down.
He dropped by four-tenths to 100.4 points compared to the 100.8 in August.
The eurozone is even below this average, which is at 100, after falling by eight-tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens raises doubts again
Papadimos says austerity measures will be passed, but conservatives won’t sign a written agreement
With the high-risk premiums of the peripheral countries and widening uncertainty, Greece is also further lost in the maze that emerges from the major European debt crisis.
The impression that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional government is more a response to the pressure from Brussels than a real conviction of the political forces is slowly being proved by facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, pointed out yesterday that there were no alternatives to the structural reforms and that the one hundred days agreed upon upon his appointment might be too short for their implementation, the leader of the conservative party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, assured that he will support the new austerity measures and not in any way take his demand for new elections back to the scheduled February 19.
"The most important task of this government is to implement the decisions taken at the October 26 summit," Papadimos assured yesterday at the opening of a parliamentary debate, which will reach its peak tomorrow with the vote of confidence for the new government.
A package of 24 programmes to promote employment, reform the disciplinary law for civil servants and new measures against tax evasion are the first initiatives.
Nevertheless, Samara’s communication does not dispel the doubts about his stance: “We have committed to support the transitional government, but to nothing else.”
The Conservative leader took a step too far with his challenge to the EU and the IMF, the organism that must unlock the 8,000 million Athens urgently needs, and made it clear that he would not approve of a commitment to implement austerity measures.
But the European Commission, which is still irritated by the effects of the poker game with Papandreu's referendum, reaffirmed yesterday that its demand should not be shaken: economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties were not to sign "a clear written agreement as soon as possible".
The spokesman for the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the troika inspectors will be returning to Athens "very soon" to discuss with the new government "what is needed for the payment of the sixth section" amounting to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8,000 million, although there is not yet a final date.
The Greek knuckle still has threads for a while.
Queen Sofía: "These are instruments of progress and hope"
The Queen emphasized the "dominant" position of Spain in relation to this type of financing
Spain "has achieved a dominant position worldwide in the role of microfinance".
Queen Sofía of Spain recalled yesterday that Spain has become the second donor worldwide for this means of international cooperation in the last two decades, whose "being" is based on the fact that it is an "instrument for social progress, justice and the hope for a better future for all humanity based on trust in people".
The Queen yesterday inaugurated the fifth world summit on micro-credits in Valladolid. She was convinced that there was "no doubt" that this type of business would be "absolutely essential" for achieving the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations by the year 2015 and "in particular the goal of "the number of people living below the limit of a dollar's income".
Spain "continues to work" on expanding the network of beneficiaries "to the last corner of the world and it is carrying out this task responsibly," remarked the Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions that will emerge from the summit, which will last until Thursday, "are guaranteed the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women" as the main benefits of these.
"We have achieved many successes" and "are facing many challenges."
The microcredit summit is not only a forum for debates, but also a platform for launching "two fundamental goals".
The queen stated that it is aimed that by the end of 2015 175 million poor families should have access to these financial services and that ten million of these households will exceed the poverty line.
The concept of microcredit in Spain and the rest of the world goes back to the path initiated by Muhammad Yunus "years ago", which Queen Sofia judges as an "act of justice and recognition".
She described the father of this financial instrument as an “admirable idealist dedicated to the fight against poverty” and whose work she has known for 15 years when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to get to know the loan strategy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings in Ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006. "We have all been able to observe a continuous development," said the Queen, whose commitment to this project brought her yesterday the assessment as a "chief of the family" in Valladolid and as "a spokeswoman for the poor".
Finally, the Queen ended her lecture by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and to find solutions to the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Commandment"
Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is "an ethical imperative" for the entire democratic state.
In this sense, she stressed that it was a mistake to bind development aid at times of economic boom, because it was a "permanent commitment".
Jiménez felt that microcredit was a “serious and rigorous policy to eradicate poverty” and that the governments of the industrialized countries should now “more than ever” work according to solidarity criteria and should not allow solidarity to fall victim to the crisis.
For Spain, microfinance is one of the "most important forms of development aid".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, lamented "the success" of "marginalized" people, "who are always standing at closed doors" to lend "hope" and the Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the attendees in a city that "opens its gates, infected by the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the EU president on the basis of a general vote
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democrats (CDU) on Monday, November 14 in Leipzig ran for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and Chairman of the Christian Democratic Party, without real difficulties.
The future of Europe was not originally envisaged in the programme, but prevailed in the autumn, in particular to satisfy those activists who consider the government policy towards the Greeks today and possibly Italy tomorrow to be too lax.
The European Commission's presidential motion proposed by the Bureau was adopted almost unanimously.
Among 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovation, which lasted for several minutes and which was due to the intervention orders of Angela Merkel as well as Wolfgang Schäuble a few hours later, left no doubt on the part of the three finance ministers.
The main idea of the Chancellor – as well as the motion – bears the following slogan: the answer to the crisis is “not less, but more Europe”.
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because "nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro".
For the Chancellor, “the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe.”
This could be reflected in a modification of the Lisbon Treaty, which reinforces the control of the European Union, as regards the budgetary policies of the eurozone countries, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of a general vote "to give Europe a face".
However, this is definitely one of the motions approved by Congress, which Wolfgang Schäuble clearly supported.
Certainly, it is unlikely that the 47 will agree quickly on this revolution: Great Britain is opposed to it, and the leaders of the CDU believe they know that Nicolas Sarkozy shares the same view.
However, the milestone has been set.
Likewise, the overwhelming majority of the delegates rejected the proposal that each country should be weighted in the ECB’s Executive Board according to the weighting of the individual economies, which would obviously lead to a strengthening of Germany’s position.
The chancellor, who is concerned about calming the climate within her party, has therefore reinforced the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she has no longer tried to win her Congress at the expense of the "small" or troubled European countries, which would immediately criticize the arrogant Germany.
Insofar as the European proposal on the importance of the "German-French friendship" dedicates a paragraph, Angela Merkel does not call France on the plan.
At least not directly.
This reminds us that two centuries ago Leipzig was at the center of a bloody battle.
In fact, one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does the fraud represent in medical reports?
After the family benefits, UMP and the government are now dealing with the sickness reports.
Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux on Tuesday, November 15, to visit a family benefit fund and to present a speech on the topic of the fight against social fraud and economic dependence on the state, which has been recurring since 2007.
To accompany this attack, which is based on the desire to put the economy to the test, but on the other hand is no less a forerunner of an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on employee sickness reports.
First, with a budgetary objective: the government aims to introduce a fourth carence day before taking into account a sickness report for workers in the private sector.
In good German, this means that a sick employee would lose the salary of four days without the permission of the specific company, thus at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that, according to the daily newspaper "Les Echos" threatens to evoke anger, but would help to raise 280 million euros.
And that would be accompanied by another measure of rather symbolic character: granting the state officials an unpaid caring day in the case of illness (so far, unlike the three caring days in the private sector, there is no caring deadline for them).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority are also rekindling the issue of fraud, this time targeting the abuse associated with absence of work.
"Controls will be much more important and, in addition, they will have to be reimbursed if required," Xavier Betrand warned on Sunday, November 13, in front of the microphone of RTL.
As in other cases, the impact of this report on the reality of fraudulent acts in the field of sickness reports seems somewhat disproportionate.
This has in fact been the subject of continuous observation and political offensives since 2002, which have most often borne fruit.
The French are no longer sick more often than people elsewhere in Europe.
Let us first look at the national figures.
According to CNAM, more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>237 million daily allowances were paid in 2006.
According to the Economic Research and Documentation Institute of Health Care, daily allowances in 2008 accounted for 11.3 billion euros of 5% of health care expenditure.
This amount fell to 46% in terms of maternity leave and accidents at work and 54% in terms of sick leave, which is <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6.2 billion.
That means 2.5% of health care spending.
According to a study by the Alma Consulting Group, the French received an average of only 14.5 sick days compared to 17.8 days in 2009.
One average that covers up some differences: another, published in 2007 by Monster.com, the Career Planning Website, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French workers surveyed said they had not taken a single sick day.
Another study, this time covered by health insurance, clarifies that 37% of illness reports in 2010 were of shorter duration than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months, and 11% above.
Compared to their European neighbours, French workers are therefore no more prone to incapacity for work than elsewhere.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers from the French State Centre for Science Research (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001, the global absenteeism rate (justified by illness or otherwise) oscillated between 10% and 11% in France, compared with 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud in the reporting of illnesses represents a very small proportion in the case of undeclared work.
With respect to the fraud, only a weak extent is achieved here.
The strengthening of the legislation since 2002 means that there are systematic checks for disease reports that exceed 45 days.
In 2008, under 1.5 million checks, the CNAM found that 13% of the 285,000 short-term illness reports implemented, i.e. in 37,050 cases, were "unjustified or too long".
Among the systematically controlled cases of illness of more than 45 days duration, under 1.2 million 11% were "unadapted or unjustified" cases, i.e. 132,000.
In total, this means 169,000 "unjustified" cases on several million workers who have filed a sickness report.
A number that represents only a weak extent compared, for example, to that of undeclared work.
According to UMP MP Dominique Tian, author of a report on this issue published in July, this represents between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>9 billion and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 billion of tax losses per year, i.e. more than the total cost of daily compensation, and thus significantly more than the fraud in the latter.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adaptation plan
Greece needs a new adjustment program to intercept its economy.
This had been announced on Monday, 14 November by Prime Minister Lucas Papademos in front of Parliament, adding the fact that the one hundred days granted to his government by the Union were not enough to accomplish this task.
"In order to continue the efforts to strengthen the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme," the prime minister said in his first public speech at the opening of the debate on Parliament's vote of confidence on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Euro Summit on 27 October was the "principal task" of the new government, as the country's involvement within the eurozone was "at stake", he added.
Accordingly, M. Papademos has planned to reduce the country's government deficit "by the 9%" of gross domestic product from today to the end of the year, after this was 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right rejects the new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the head of the right wing, had given his approval on Monday to the measures already approved regarding an attempt to escape the debt crisis, but sent in advance that his party would not agree to an additional austerity measure.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a parliamentary meeting of his party New Democracy.
He had agreed to reduce the budget deficit and debt, as well as to fight waste, but was hostile to any policy that would prevent the economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, EU Commissioner responsible for economic and monetary affairs, who had prevented the IMF and the EU from releasing the necessary loan over <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8 billion without a written guarantee from all parties about their support for the planned measures, had replied by Antonio Samaras that his word would suffice and he would not sign anything under pressure from outside.
Euthanasia and accompanied death must be legalized, according to an expert panel
Canadians live in denial of death, according to a report from the Royal Society of Canada
The panel stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors were working together on pain-relieving treatment to provide the best pain-relieving remedies, even beyond cancer cases.
Canadian society is living in a refusal attitude towards death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually agree to talk to their doctor about conditions under which they would like to die and make arrangements for that purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an imposing report by the Royal Society of Canada involving six experts linked in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This body recommends the government to amend the Criminal Code in such a way as to allow accompanied suicide and euthanasia where this choice arises, in patients who are deemed to be able to make such a decision.
As a prelude, the experts cite a recently published survey by the independent society EIU, which had compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada ranks 10th in this regard, the study notes that “medical death care in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid to cut the issue of death.”
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians do not have access to painkillers, according to experts commissioned by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the majority of Canadians wanting to die at home, 68.6% of these eventually die in the hospital.
From a country-wide perspective, the rate of hospital deaths in Quebec is highest, with 86%.
On the delicate issue of euthanasia and accompanying suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that are contrary to the position of the federal government, which has already stated that it does not wish to make any amendments to the criminal code regarding euthanasia and accompanying suicide.
Now, however, according to the experts, who have also inspected all those countries whose approach has legalized or decriminalized euthanasia and accompanying suicide, there is no evidence that such decriminalization would attract abuses in their application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or accompanying suicide by incompetent or unwilling persons.
On the contrary, much more cases of such violations are encountered in countries where euthanasia and accompanying suicide are not legalized, as Jocelyn Downie, co-signatory of the report, confirmed yesterday in a teleconference.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
“Accompanied suicide is also practiced in Canada, although clearly illegal here,” explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians support euthanasia
Remember that according to a 2010 Angus-Reid survey, 85% of Canadians had already voted in favor of euthanasia because they believe that it allows people at the end of their lives to mitigate their suffering.
And 66% believe that the fact that euthanasia is legalized does not convey the message that the lives of elderly or disabled people are of less value.
With regard to those who have already committed an accompanying suicide, 41% of respondents believe that they should not be prosecuted.
As far as maintaining or stopping funds in patients is concerned, the situation is less clear, according to the authors of the report.
They also suggest in their list of recommendations that the Criminal Code should specify that the disposal of the funds for which a legally valid rejection was available should not be considered criminal.
The expert panel also calls for healthcare professionals to be trained in the task of respecting the end-of-life cessation of funds, without fear of criminal prosecution.
The panel stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked together on pain-relieving treatment to provide the best pain-relieving remedies, even beyond cancer cases.
Lastly, the panel calls for at least consideration of the pain relief or life-ending measures already widely used in the Canadian health care institutions, since they were not used to reduce physical pain, as well as euthanasia, and they relate to the same procedures.
Reservations of other experts
Some experts in the field of health care have already expressed reservations about the conclusions of the Royal Society of Canada’s expert report.
RA Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has described the attitude of the report-signing experts as "extreme", among other things, as they set no limits to the practice of euthanasia in patients in the final stages.
"This opens the doors to a situation in which anyone who is tired and older than 18 years of age is to ask another person to help him with his suicide," said RA Deschamps, who had reviewed a summary of the report yesterday.
RA Deschamps also stresses that the authors of the report seemed to place the individual’s own responsibility above all other values involved in the social fabric of society.
But now, he says, there are “guidelines and obligations in a society.”
Margaret Somerville, a health law specialist, has also expressed "strong opposition" to the conclusions of the report, which she titled as a "pro-euthanasia manifesto."
Margaret Somerville, herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, particularly doubts the reports regarding the non-existence of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and accompanying suicide are legalized, such as the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan Calls on President Assad to Resign
Damascus denounces a "conspiracy"
Syria is increasingly isolated
The partisans of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday before the authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Diplomatic pressure on Syria’s Bashar al-Assad, who is resisting it thanks to Russia’s support and rejects a “conspiracy” against the country, has intensified yesterday.
Two days before the Arab League excluded Syria, the European Union tightened its sanctions against Damascus, although Turkey and Jordan, the neighbouring countries of Syria, had taken a position in favour of President Assad’s resignation.
Yesterday, King Abdullah II of Jordan was the incumbent Arab prime minister who had called on President Bashar al-Assad to "resign his power in Syria", killing already about forty civilians and members of the government.
"If Bashar put his country's interest at heart, he would resign, but beyond that, he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era of political Syrian life," said the King of Jordan, neighbouring Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
Turkish diplomatic chief Ahmet Davutoglu, for his part, lamented that the Turkish mediation efforts directed at the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year had not been successful.
"Those in the Middle East who are not at peace with their people and cannot satisfy them must leave," he said, referring to Syria, the neighbouring country to which Turkey is taking a steadily harsher stance.
The United States, for its part, has welcomed the "tightening of the consensus against Assad and the machinations of the Syrian regime" following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and countries like Turkey have taken an increasingly sharp tone in the face of repression in Syria," said Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the government have been killed in the Dar'a region in southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH) announced.
Two other civilians, according to this NGO, were killed in "shoots and heavy bombings around Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs.
On the occasion of a press conference, Syrian Foreign Trade Minister Walid al-Muallim nevertheless felt that the country was "driven towards the end of the crisis".
By the way, he has reacted strongly to the Arab League’s decision to suspend Damascus from its duties, which he considers to be a “dangerous step”.
Syria “will not give in,” he added, asserting that “the plots forged against Syria will fail.”
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently investigating a "protection mechanism for civilians" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, the media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Trade Minister Alain Juppé had also spoken in favour of sending UN observers to protect civilians from the repressions of the regime that encapsulates him in his “paranoia”.
An extra-planned new assembly of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the plan for the outbreak of the crisis adopted on November 2, but in particular the controversial and likely withdrawal of military troops from the besieged cities and the release of detained protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has classified the Arab League's decision yesterday as "incorrect" to beware of advocating possible sanctions against Damascus, although China had already warned Syria to implement the crisis exit plan.
Italy
Monti urges markets to be patient and Italy to be willing to sacrifice
Mario Monti, the future Italian prime minister has demanded a little more time from the markets to form his staff and implement a program that demands "victims" to regain the creditworthiness lost during the last months of Berlusconi's government.
The former EU Commissioner had held a negotiation with the political parties yesterday before today's meeting of trade unions and employers.
It was his job to appoint a cabinet in parliament, made up relatively strictly of external technocrats.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with a number of victims," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the numerous smaller parliamentary groups participating in the talks, after meeting with the President-in-Office of the Council.
Gianfranco Fini, the president of the Chamber of Deputies, had, for his part, waited for Mario Monti to give parliament a vote of confidence by Friday to make sure that the new government has sufficient support.
The agreements will culminate in the presentation by M. Monti of a deletion list, which will undoubtedly range from a dozen ministers to the head of state Giorgio Napolitano.
M. Monti commented that yesterday’s nervousness of the stock market and bond markets demanded their time.
In "a democracy, there are certain deadlines" for preparing a government as well as a government program, he stressed, noting that it is "certain that markets will show themselves strong and understanding."
His appointment by the president was initially welcomed by the markets, but the unrest had intensified again, especially after an unexpected decline in industrial production in the eurozone in September.
The incumbent prime minister should establish a staff consisting predominantly of technocrats, although he had stressed that he would like to include "politicians" as well.
The new government should only exist until 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, he estimated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, the president of the Chamber of Deputies, the new government should receive Parliament's credibility by Friday.
M. Monti has committed himself, since the beginning of his function, to working with all urgency with the aim of making Italy a "renewed protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesman for EU Commissioner Olli Rehn had stressed that "our diagnosis to the Italian economy does not change even considering the new government".
The EU, which believes that Rome will not achieve its budgetary balancing target in 2013, despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has in particular requested new toughness measures.
Emma Marcegaglia, "Chief of the Chiefs" of Italy, who will meet with Monti on Tuesday, also insists on the need for economic stimulus, "because a country that has no growth at all can not respect the deficit figures".
M. Monti, known for his competence and independence as EU Commissioner (1994-2004), stands for a "change of era" of Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism"; the "professor" symbolises the "challenge of trustworthiness" as well as a "other Italy", according to the editorial authors.
The great unknown here is the longevity of his staff.
President Napolitano would like to prevent early elections, as Italy will now have to pay 200 billion euros in government bonds by April 2012.
Russian Scientist Helps Iranian Nuclear Energy Program
A Russian scientist, Vyacheslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop a nuclear detonator, an American NGO specializing in nuclear risks confirmed on Monday.
The Institute for Science and International Security ISIS based the findings on the recent report of the International Atomic Safety Agency AIEA as well as other documents from this UN agency to identify this scientist.
Last week, the AIEA expressed its "serious concern" about a "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear program.
According to an in-depth study of the AIEA documents by ISIS, Danilenko, born in 1934, had apparently worked at a Soviet military nuclear centre in Chelyabinsk (Ural) for over three decades since the beginning of the 1960s and was involved in the explosion-produced production of synthetic diamonds.
In 1989 or 1991, he was said to have left the center to start a company in Kiev that manufactures "nano-diamonds".
The economic difficulties of his company had led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Prior to his return to Russia, he then worked on an Iranian program from 1996 to 2002.
In its latest report, the AIEA mentioned "strong indications that the Iranian development" of a nuclear explosive system "was supported by the work of a foreign expert who was not only proficient in this technology, but also, as a member of the agency state, had worked his entire career beyond essential on this technology directly on the military nuclear energy program of his country of origin."
Anti-Islamic Crimes and Crimes Increased by 50%
Crimes against Muslims have increased by 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other racially or religiously motivated violent crimes have either decreased slightly or only increased slightly over the same period, according to FBI statistics published on Monday.
According to these data, the total number of violent crimes committed against Muslims has increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. by 49%, while a 13% increase in acts of violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes directed against Jews, and a global increase of 14% in anti-religious crimes and crimes have been recorded.
The total number of "hate-motivated crimes" has risen to 6,628 cases in a very weak fashion, including 47.3% due to racial differences and 20% due to religious differences of motivated crimes, the FBI said.
"After a weakening in 2009, it is worrying to see these crimes and crimes grow again," the human rights organization Human Rights First stressed. "The increase in anti-Islamic violence is particularly significant," the organization added in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First had long emphasized that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights," added Paul Legendre, a member of the organization.
“The U.S. government can and should do more to combat these assaults,” he added, assessing that this could be done with an improvement in the police attitude towards the “hate crimes.”
The "hate crime" in American federal law is a legacy from the epoch of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation had been passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence directed against race, colour, religion or ancestry, and now also involves crimes of sexual affiliation.
Twitter is changing the platform and is increasingly resembling Facebook
The microblogging website Twitter has introduced changes in the presentation of its platform on Monday to allow its users in particular to watch the activities of those who follow its entries, making the service once again similar to that of Facebook.
The new tab "Activity" and another "Name" enable better readable live tracking of the activities of other "Twitterers", the Internet users whose messages ("Tweets") you are tracking and who are tracking your messages.
This allows you to find out if they allow you to track their messages, if they subscribe to new posts, favor certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu offering had been tested before its general internet reach on Monday "in August with a small percentage of users," Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter was known for its little instinctive functioning, equipped with some esoteric-like wording (RT for referencing another person's contribution). followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre à l'aide d'un public plus large avec grand public plus Google compilement.
In the network, users debated this innovation over the Internet with the help of certain "tweets".
"This is useless, intrusive and too much like Facebook," writes <0x40>jemb123.
"The Activity feature will help me better track certain elements of my Flux Twitter," <0x40>dannykronstrom said.
Austrian
Entry of a "Golden Budget Rule" into the Constitution
The government of the large Social Democratic/Christian Democratic coalition, which is in power in Austria, decided on Tuesday to include a "golden budget rule" in the constitution to reduce public deficits and also avoid possible degradation by rating agencies in the top-bonity of Austria (AAA).
It was the Social-Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who very personally announced this decision of the Council of Ministers' outcome, although the public Austrian debt is at 74.6%, so far above the criterion of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty, but significantly below the level of debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's ability to pay had not fallen from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay an additional <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 billion in interest each year," argued Michael Spindelegger, vice chancellor and Christian-democratic foreign minister.
Austria is also making a demand from the Brussels summit of the eurozone member states on 26 October: the heads of state and government at the time had demanded the inclusion of the reduction of public deficits by the end of 2012, as well as a return to the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or by the adoption of an equivalent law.
The measures taken by the Austrian government to this end are similar to the "German model", since Germany had been the first European country to incorporate such a "rule" into the constitution.
By 2017, the structural budget deficit should be reduced by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, from 2017 onwards, the state’s structural budget deficit should not exceed the 0.35% limit of GDP, whereas regional states and municipalities should have balanced budgets.
The aim is to eliminate budgetary debt under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Agreement in the 2020/21 horizon.
Stronger Yen
Noda threatens new intervention in foreign exchange markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese government would intervene in foreign exchange markets again if the yen continued to rise.
"Should we detect excessive volatility" in the yen's exchange rate, "we will intervene just as we did last time," M. Noda explained in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen again accelerated close to the historic levels that the Japanese authorities had forced to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo had massively sold the yen against the dollar in order to lower the Japanese foreign exchange value, which is heading for a new record since 1945 against the dollar.
However, the yen has risen over it on a regular basis, doped by purchases by investors who see the yen as a “refuge value” in these uncertain times of global economic downturn and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar fell below 77 yen on Tuesday, the euro slipped under the symbolic latte of 105 yen near the levels that had triggered the last intervention.
Prior to the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar quoted around 120 yen, the euro more than 160 yen.
This reed fire of the Japanese motto harms the archipelago's exports, as it increases the cost of "Made in Japan" products and reduces the income value drawn by Japanese companies from abroad, as they exchange them in national currency.
"Japan is fighting for its reconstruction after the earthquake and tsunami on March 11, which devastated the Tohoku region," M. Noda stressed, fearing that this inflation of the yen could kill the weak upswing already in the germ.
With growth in the third quarter -1.5% compared to the previous quarter- for the first time this year thanks to the jumping export increases and the consumption of households "plombed" by the disaster, the third world power has regained traction.
However, the prime minister estimates that the inflation of the yen does not reflect "the economic foundations of Japan".
Finance Minister Jun Azumi, for his part, has called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy committee on Tuesday, to take all conceivable measures to defuse the yen.
Hirohide Yamaguchi, deputy governor of the institute, however, has notified that the BoJ has already taken "appropriate measures", stating that no additional currency easing is to be expected on Wednesday.
On the occasion of the last meeting at the end of October, the central bank had increased its government bond purchases by 5,000 billion yen (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>47 billion) to repay the 55,000 billion yen (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>519 billion) of cover it had spent on various purchases of financial instruments to flood the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
Interest rates are rising rapidly, stock exchanges are making retreats
The risk of infection from the debt crisis is constantly undermining European figures.
Despite the new heads of government in Greece and Italy and the best growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the weakened country continue to rise.
The stock exchanges, which are still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, are also drifting a little more into negative fields this Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, the CAC lost 1.4% at 10 a.m. and fell to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt fell by 0.4% and London by 0.1%.
“Due to the new tensions surrounding sovereign bond yields in the troubled eurozone, global equity markets are continuing to release some of their recent profits.
"The investors are nervous and too well aware of the risk of infection," Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, said in a statement.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange, which in turn suffers from the renewed fears of market participants regarding capacity in Europe that the debt crisis will continue, had closed with a bail of 0.7%.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has its eyes on Europe, and trade is moving on a limited variation corridor as long as investors have no evidence that the situation has stabilized," said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This resurgence of concerns about the future of the eurozone is damaging the single currency, which continues its downturn on Tuesday.
The euro has been at its lowest level for a month and a half.
At 10 a.m., the European currency was worth 1.3570 dollars, so it gave in by 0.4%.
According to the stockbrokers, it has declined after the CDU, the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, who assembled in Congress on Monday, approved a motion that specifically provides for the possibility for countries in difficulty to leave the eurozone without leaving the European Union at the same time.
The Italian and Spanish rates are well below the 6% limit.
Lending rates in Italy and Spain continue to be at very worrying levels.
This Tuesday morning, the return on Italian bonds to 10 years reached 6.85%, while that of Spanish titles matured to 6.2%.
These tensions of interest rates in the South, but also in France, continue to feed investors’ fears.
The future Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti demanded more time from the markets to restore the situation in Italy threatened by paralysis due to the debt burden.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for his part, confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October was “the main task” of his government.
Spain is in the visor of the markets, as on Sunday the parliamentary elections take place in the country.
The spread between the German and Spanish 10-year bonds has once again reached a new, historic high.
Expecting Eurozone growth figures
Statistically speaking, France recorded a household-based economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than the expected 0.3%.
However, the Federal Statistical Office INSEE had revised the bottom of the second quarter figures, down 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnating.
In fact, it is the fourth quarter that worries economic experts the most.
Germany, for its part, experienced growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first estimate of the entire eurozone is expected at 11 a.m., with the EU Commission warning of the risk of a recession.
Energy policy:
Facts should win over dogmas
If there is an issue that cannot be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or on the basis of emotions, this is certainly energy policy.
Availability and costs of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is reasonable to take an election meeting as the occasion to reflect on this issue and on the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bear fruit if it examines the overall economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinions on objective facts, rational data.
Although there are 7 billion people on this planet, demographic evolution is driving a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, and a huge proportion of the world’s population should not have to do without a vital element.
At the same time, it is necessary to mitigate the scarcity of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity continuously, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a topic that has disappeared from the ecological debate, in order to fight against climatic irregularities.
The Fukushima accident did not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany remains isolated in its decision to renounce nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which subjects its decision to the need to find a substitute source, nor in Switzerland, which intends to build only nuclear power plants of the last generation.
The UK, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name just a few countries, continue to pursue their projects with determination.
The United States, for its part, has decided after Fukushima to join another unit of its park by re-opening the Three Mile Island plant, which was shut down after the nuclear accident.
Even if the German model, which focuses on renewable energy sources, is sometimes set as an example, reality contradicts the discourse.
The election in Berlin will take the form of an increase in electricity prices, an increase in CO2 emissions from gas and coal-fired power plants, an increase in energy dependence, particularly on Russia, which is enhanced by the increased use of import gas.
The totality of these unpleasant effects will become noticeable within a few months.
The case of Denmark gives cause for reflection.
On the one hand, Denmark is the European leader in wind energy, from which it draws 30% of its electricity, on the other hand, it is one of the strongest users of coal and gas, used alternately with wind energy; as a result, its CO2 emissions and its electricity price are 65% and 50% higher each than the corresponding European average.
Thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill than our French households.
Given that the energy price plays a key role in the globalised economy in terms of competitiveness and stability of industry on a national level, French companies have an advantage because of the cheapest electricity available in Europe.
Any significant reduction in nuclear power would, therefore, result in a sharp increase in energy prices, making the noble statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defense of purchasing power an illusion.
Surveys showed that this is a price that the vast majority of French people are not willing to pay as much as it shows resistance to the principle of this energy source.
We realize that our country’s energy policy has enabled us to build an industry with 125.00 direct and 410,000 induced jobs.
Due to its strong export character, it brings a multitude of specialized small and medium-sized companies to international markets and makes them the creators of countless jobs.
If France decides to withdraw from nuclear power, most of these SMEs will fall victim to it, and the annual <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6 billion in investment goods and nuclear energy exports will shrink more and more.
Which electrician would commission an EPR designed to function for sixty years if the decline of its producer is pre-programmed?
In order to solve the energetic equation, one must admit that there is as much a work of the devil as there is a miraculous remedy for generating electricity.
The low-carbon solutions developed by Areva for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy testify to the complementarity of energy sources.
Maintaining the highest possible level of safety is an absolute imperative for nuclear power.
In France, we have a security authority that carries out uncompromising and transparent controls in existing plants such as the construction in Flamanville.
Their work teams, which have made a name for themselves due to their professionalism, are just too obsessed with the idea of safety.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents.
Only one, and in Three Mile Island, has entered under normal operating conditions, thus proceeding without consequences for humans and the environment.
In Chernobyl, the drama was sworn up by reactor construction and inexcusable human failure.
At Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was caused by two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude that caused the deaths of several tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn its lessons from this accident just as it did from the previous two.
As a result of this approach, as well as the cooperation of the security authorities of the French and German operators and designers of nuclear power plants, the EPR presents a draft that enables it to be resistant to such phenomena.
Since it is considered desirable among the electrical engineers to build a nuclear power plant, a construction halt in Flamanville would be a fabulous gift to the competition of Areva and EDF by giving them a free path to take on the leadership position in the inevitable nuclear power development.
It is inevitable and legitimate to look for the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and party maneuvers dominate a debate that equally determines the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from many angles - overloading of police, judicial and administrative bodies due to a policy subject to the numbers, compatibility of this policy with the status of a "country of human rights", as France had called itself.
Recently, the harassment of foreign students by the authorities had shaped the weekly newspapers, the Minister of the Interior had casually announced (see Libération of 23 May) that France "needed no talents, masons or waiters from abroad".
But this policy has rarely been analysed from an economic point of view.
There is widespread consensus on this issue between the right and the left.
From the right side, the tone was struck by Jacques Chirac, who had declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed, including over 2 million immigrant workers, should not pose a problem for a country", from the left side by Michel Rocard, who had stated in 1990 that France "cannot accommodate the entire poverty of the world".
The only difference is the degree of generosity.
The fear of the invasion of the national soil by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared in 2005 by both the right and the left.
The immigrants were perceived by both camps as a burden for the economy and French society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity that one is willing to admit to immigrants.
In his program, François Hollande confines himself to banalities that indicate that partnership development allows us to solve our "migration problems".
This notion of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may have an impact on the elections; however, it is economically costly.
As economic experts Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron remind us in a recent paper summarizing the latest findings on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 p.), there is a broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of immigrants’ jobs and the impact of immigrant migration on the population.
Restricting immigration would weaken growth and harm the labour market situation.
Fears about the influence of migrants are based on the notion that they threaten to substitute the domestic workers, especially the less qualified, by exerting pressure on their wages.
However, experience shows that immigrants are in fact much more complementary than local wage workers, as they focus on occupations in sectors that are technically unloaded in the workplace.
The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that irritate local wage workers, the more qualified among immigrants work in dynamic sectors where education is not aligned with the job offer.
Positive wage effect
Just as a surgeon would find it difficult to work in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, this complementarity between locals and migrants also has a positive effect on wages and the domestic labour market situation.
In this way, Giovanni Peri calculated that a 1% increase in the flood of immigrants would result in a co-related, long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of ideas brought in by immigrants is beneficial to economic growth (high proportion of naturalized immigrants among American Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also contribute net to social welfare systems, on average around 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The World Labour Organisation estimates, for example, that a person who immigrates to Germany at the age of 30 makes a net contribution (income minus expenditure) of around 150,000 euros to the public budget on average over his lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy wished to bring about the missing intersections "with the teeth" at the beginning of his mandate.
These said teeth, which were supposed to deter immigrants, however, achieved exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, now it remains to think through European democracy
Democracy is a valuable asset; it is also a delicate asset.
The European continent should be able to remember itself who, after its invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, had suffered the whole 20th century over the tragedies of the First World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Francos in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and the supreme in Greece.
Some would have thought it sufficient to exercise the right to vote, in the most direct way possible, to see democracy conquer its enemies once and for all.
It has been known since Napoleon that it was a characteristic of the mindset.
The universal suffrage, which is the necessary condition of democracy, is not a sufficient condition for this and can just as well become the "instrument of oppression" as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot put it then.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of powers, an education, enlightenment, economic and social community spirit, a jurisprudence.
The crisis in Europe that we are in is an economic crisis, but it is just as much, and above all, a political and democratic crisis.
The change of mind in the Greek true-false referendum would have had a double revealing character in this respect: on the one hand that of the need for a powerful return of politics, but on the other hand that of the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, its inappropriateness.
This ambivalence should be considered obsolete.
The truth is that the front lines of democratic struggle have shifted today, and the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, are no longer aiming in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain to push for a success of the national referendum, which was organised according to necessities and in the wrong order.
A free pass for the European sovereign or a leap with closed eyes into the void of nationalist retreat: a great choice for the citizen!
No, we want Hackebeil, but a collective task, fully justified, clarified and steady, an election and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - by the way, you don't know where to end the list - because there is only one crisis, and it is prevailing in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that succumbs to the dictates of markets and rating agencies, which suffers from its impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is humiliated at the international level.
One is concerned about transfers of sovereignty to Europe - it is the whole of Europe that is gradually losing its sovereignty, and thus each of the nations that are affiliated to it.
The urgency is to restore the leadership of the European project to the sovereignty of the people.
It is a question of whether Europeans can reduce the burden of their debt, free themselves from the markets and build a future through investment.
The exit from the crisis is conditional on decisions at European level that cannot be taken without total democratic legitimacy, without certainly ruining us.
After this proposal has been fought for a long time by Jacques Delors and the Socialists, everyone is now pushing European economic management to do so.
Agreed.
But imagine this without political integration and a stronger democracy - as it envisions the citizens - would be another folly and another cul-de-sac.
We need to take on a new stage in European construction.
In order to create the republic in France, it took the fact of "creating" Republicans.
The revolution of interests alone could not do enough here.
This instruction remains valid.
We need to build a more integrated Europe on an economic level.
This can only be achieved by creating a politically more democratic Europe, a truly European sovereignty of the people.

"Contactless" smart cards become a common good
The World Chip Card Fair opens its doors on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris in an optimistic stance.
According to Eurosmart, 2011 should actually end with an 11% increase in worldwide sales of microprocessor chips (EC cards, SIM card phone), with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most important segment is contactless technology, which allows payments in public transport or settlement of purchases by simply holding the card to a reader.
Compared to the 320 million sold a year earlier, 460 million contactless chip cards should be sold worldwide this year!
Their market share is expected to grow even further in 2012 (580 million expected units) and represent over 10% of the global chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe is gaining ground in terms of contactless payments after being behind the Asia-Pacific region for a long time.
Some 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are rather modest: only 400,000 contactless visa cards have been distributed.
Consumer markets, however, are making steam.
This year, Carrefour issued 2.5 million contactless pass MasterCards.
In order to move to a higher speed, it is now necessary that banks equip their customers with these cards.
"Two major French financial institutions have committed themselves to systematically handing out bank cards to their customers in the future, which are equipped with contactless chips," Gérard Nébouy, Director General of Visa Europe France, said in a statement.
Banks test payment via mobile phone
However, this is only a first step on the way to the payment method of the future: the mobile phone.
A very small percentage of devices have been equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology necessary to carry out these transactions.
"They've fallen into default".
"But they should at least experience a real upward trend next year."
"We expect to sell 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012," explains Marc Bertin, Chairman of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking the initiative.
Crédit Agricole had announced yesterday the start of a test run in Caen, which will run from December to next June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees will be equipped with a capsule that allows contactless payment.
The BPCE operates a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
Yesterday, Société Générale also announced that it was preparing to launch an offer that would enable its customers to make contactless payments via mobile phones.
Terrorist Front knows from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the relationship between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long suspicious relationship between the terrorist group al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seems to be confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel himself confirmed that Algiers had now "gained certainty".
"The way in which both organizations act and the relationships between the intelligence services indicate clear cooperation," he said.
Paris seems to be doing a similar analysis.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger last January has promoted interfaces.
The following day, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by supporters of the Aqmi, were reportedly killed at the same time as several of their kidnappers during an operation carried out by the French special forces.
French and Nigerian investigators say they have found several phone chips belonging to the terrorists in the rubble at the site.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of the guided telephone calls leads to several interlocutors stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two interlocutors: one leads to a Nigerian who had long been in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man who is considered to be close to the Aqmi and the sect.
"This is a progress, but one must undoubtedly wait for clearer evidence before talking about an operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem."
"It is, however, conceivable".
"It has been known for years that the sect receives financial and intellectual support from outsiders and that it is increasingly active," said Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo.
In recent months, these "support services" have become more and more obvious in their course, as have the speeches and modes of operation of Boko Harem, which now indicate the use of suicide bombers and the use of increasingly complex explosives bearing the same handwriting as those used by Aqmi.
Since then, the international community has been pressuring Abuja to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
In fact, the Nigerian authorities have long viewed the group as a community of Illuminati to whom no special attention needs to be paid.
Fast success
Founded in Maiduguri in 2002 in the vicinity of a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - meaning in Haoussa "Western education is a disgrace" - is pursuing the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the merger is experiencing rapid success.
It politicizes itself and demands strict observance of Sharia law, while its affiliated activists fight against the ungodly central government.
The activists are initially targeting churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists were particularly active with their intensified attacks on the commissariats.
However, the reaction on the part of Abuja is, as usual, indifferent.
The army surrounds the city, with 800 dead.
Mohammad Yusuf, who was taken prisoner, is killed in prison.
As a result, the sect becomes increasingly radical and leaves its strongholds in the north.
Last Christmas, she confessed to an assassination in Jos, which claimed 80 lives, then to another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram is blamed for a suicide attack that took place at the secured police headquarters in Abuja – the first of its kind.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations will become the priority international target.
The formation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which will lead from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, has since alarmed all security experts.
While the Aqmi has occupied Mali and Niger, the Somalis of al-Shabaab operate in Kenya, Boko Harem seems to be a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, on the occasion of a talk with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Harem and showed himself willing "to share all clues".
The World According to Republican Presidential Candidates
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry compete in simplification and ignorance regarding China, Iraq, and aid for Israel.
Can a crisis-weakened America lead a complex world with simple, if not simple, ideas?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidate like this, voters could almost get that impression.
For the past few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their supporters have repeatedly made their thunderous statements, as well as their statements regarding foreign policy, a traditional republican focus.
Over China, Iran, and Israeli aid – often not underpinned in any way – slogans fall.
Mitt Romney, the highest-ranking candidate for the nomination of the Grand Old Party, threatened to cite the Chinese at the WTO and accuse them of "currency manipulation" - the leading theme in an America that is at the forefront of the emigration of entire industries to Asia.
It was stupid if it was to imply the initiation of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former ambassador to China under Obama and the only candidate who seems to have a mature vision of foreign policy, has almost narrowed the air in terms of his gesture flattering the emotions.
He had called for a tangible but constructive exchange of views with Beijing (also Obama’s current stance).
But Huntsman is not being heard because he is stagnant in the depths of opinion polls.
Reagan's equality
Romney had also pledged military strikes against Iran should the sanctions to stop the nuclear program fail.
"If I am elected, I will stop Iran," he said.
"If Obama is re-elected, they get the bomb".
He also promised Israel increased military assistance and accused Obama of remaining indebted to this partner.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second-highest-placed candidate, in turn carries a shameful ignorance of the file.
Recently, he called for countering the Chinese military threat as Beijing "trying to develop a nuclear power" - and seemed to ignore the fact that China has been in possession of military nuclear weapons since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and demands military strikes against Iran, on his part, is willing to employ the American army in Mexico against drug cartels.
The 2009 Obama banned recourse to torture against suspected terrorists was also endorsed by Cain, Perry and Michele Bachmann.
One is far from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, a foreign policy heavyweight.
Reagan also had simple ideas and won the Cold War despite all this.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and had to pour water into his wine on the subject of anti-terror.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive talks with Iran, the hasty withdrawal of his “boys” from Iraq, his indecision in Libya, which also earned him the reputation of weakness.
This enmity, however, is not quite so casual.
The population is more likely to appreciate the positive balance of national security under Obama, which has eliminated Bin Laden.
Since Iraq, it has been wary of military interventions leading to paralysis.
And Obama is more appropriately surprised by arguing that America needs to be economically rebuilt in order to revive its leadership position.
Nord Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the seabed of the Baltic Sea and connects Western Europe directly to Russia, has been put into operation.
It will provide gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to celebrate this event with splendor and glory.
Over 500 invited guests, including four heads of state and government, attended the inauguration of the new gas transmission line Nord Stream, which connects Russia and Germany directly below sea level, on the Baltic Sea coast under orchestra sound and at the gourmet buffet on Tuesday.
German Chancellor Angelika Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte have symbolically jointly turned the wheel of the valve that transports Russian gas to the Western European network.
With the new gas pipeline, 27.5 billion cubic meters of additional Russian gas per year will be delivered to Western Europe through a first pipeline of 1,224 km of length connecting the St. Petersburg region with Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.
A second pipeline, allowing a total supply of 55 billion cubic meters of gas – the equivalent of French total consumption – is expected to be completed by the end of 2012.
And you already let the eventuality of the construction of a third line on its own track ring.
For Gazprom, the timely and precise completion of this enormous structure seems like a victory.
The project was highly controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
The Nord-Stream pipeline will enable direct gas delivery to Germany, while avoiding any route through third countries (Poland or Ukraine) by land.
For this reason, these two countries are losing some of their power: for them, it is now becoming more difficult to put pressure on Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
Warsaw, most engaged in the debate, was not shy away from comparing the Nord-Stream pipeline with a "new German-Soviet pact" in connection with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically extremely sensitive.
Western Europe has gained even greater security of supply by supporting this Russian project.
However, this is at the expense of defusing European energy, as the project has broken a gap between Western and Eastern Europeans.
In barely five years, Russia has succeeded in enforcing its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, Western countries, which have high gas consumption and whose gas reserves are declining.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us in an organic way," François Fillon confirmed at the inauguration of the gas pipeline, pointing out the extent to which the major gas contracts are also important from the political and economic side.
All this explains the broad smile of Gazprom’s managers, who are represented in Lubmin, regarding the gas supply line.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an outstanding technique.
The underwater pipe is made of steel with concrete sheathing, which is intended to protect it from ship anchorages.
It rests on the seabed, at about 200 m depth.
During their construction, minefields dating from World War II had to be avoided.
"About hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed for caution," said Jens Müller, a spokesman for Nord Stream.
In addition, strengthened measures had to be taken to protect the fauna and flora.
The line is a long line of metal, heavy like 242 Eiffel towers, which is interrupted over the entire length by nothing: neither by valves, nor maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned off the coast of Sweden, but the project managers distanced themselves from it, as the Swedes were not keen to see a Russian state company settle permanently at the level of their coasts.
"In the event of an accident, we close the gas passage in less than a minute," clarified Jens Müller.
In the event of a leak, the gas in the gas transmission line thus escapes into the air.
However, this case is considered unlikely by the designers, as the weld seams were estimated to have a leakage resistance per 100,000 years.
The state monitoring of the gas pipeline is ensured both by an underwater robot, which is controlled for external observation purposes from a seagoing ship, as well as by a device circulating inside the gas pipeline.
It has the shape of a cigar, measuring a meter in diameter, is inserted into the interior of the pipeline and moved through the gas pressure.
After three full days of moving through the line at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device provides the most accurate information on possible deformations of the metal upon arrival.
The gas pipeline was designed to function for fifty years without having to undergo the slightest repair.
The gas circulation is easily ensured by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the access point, 100 bar at the exit point.
Five companies have joined forces to realize this project.
However, the management remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
Furthermore, the German companies E. ON and BASF are affiliated here (each at 15.5%), as are the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (each at 9%).
These five companies have formed a business community called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
It is based in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased this company the entire capacity of its gas transport, on a renewable twenty-year contract.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, no matter how large the amount of gas that is actually transported," clarified Jens Müller.
The financing of the gas pipeline construction was backed by 30% of shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total labour costs for both pipelines should amount to 7.4 billion euros.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amounted to 240 million.
However, the minority shareholders are prepared to recover their expenses, as Gazprom bears the liability risk alone.
The gas pipeline reveals itself on a sandy, pine-wooded coastline near Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.
The 4.5 meter high valves form the gas outlet gate.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and other parameters of the incoming gas before it is transferred to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been supplied with one million cubic meters of Russian gas per passing hour.
At full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic meters per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a brand notebook.
Launched by an Italian company about fifteen years ago, Moleskine now wants to give writing a new style.
It has a flair of adventure, hours spent writing at candlelight.
Moleskine’s notebook is easily recognizable, with its black, rectangular cover, its rubber band, the eggshell-coloured sides, as aged over time.
However, the Moleskine notebook, as it is known today, was created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, which is based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a distinguished design notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then a specialist consultant for the company, is commissioned with the launch of the new product.
The notebook was inspired by an old-fashioned production technique, called Mole Skin, which refers to a cotton coat used, for example, for covering upholstery benches.
This type of notebook was in great demand among writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has revived an old and almost forgotten item that was seen as an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century," explains Maria Sebregondi, now a brand manager at Modo Modo.
Success comes.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26%, establishing sales of 12.7 million units.
This is far from the usual production of the first years, when only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine crosses the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to make a phantom image of the buyers, as the notebook is as enthusiastic as businessmen as well as students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultivated and open-minded customers.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees in its beginnings, now employs more than 100 people and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan and the other in New York.
The company distributes its notebooks in bookshops, on internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques in city centers and knows how to assert its identity.
“We have followed the spirit of the time and his new writing needs, which exists despite the boom of emails,” explained Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural characteristic is accompanied by the development of the company Moleskine: recently, the brand launched an exhibition called "Detour", in which architects and artists exhibited their own notebooks.
In August, the company also launched a leopard-patterned cover at the Locarno Film Festival.
Moleskine benefited from its success and this cultural zeitgeist and knew how to diversify its products: bags, calendars, fillers, computer cases... The brand has the full range of articles.
In autumn 2006, Modo Modo was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, and opened a new chapter in the history of Moleskine.
Why does the unemployment rate of disabled workers remain at such a high level?
Approximately 19% of people with disabilities are looking for a job.
Today begins the "15th Week of Work for the Disabled".
Despite a determined public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate of disabled people is always twice as high as the average: 19% against 9% of the total population.
Disheartening?
"No," stresses Éric Blanchet, Director General of the Adapt Association, which organizes the "Week of Work for the Disabled."
"The progress made within fifteen years is considerable."
At the time, the unemployment rate was not double, but three times higher.
"Nevertheless, there is still a great deal to do."
It must be said, however, that many obstacles continue to exist for disabled unemployed people before they get a job.
More often it affects the elderly: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% of them do not have a high school diploma and there are only 10,000 disabled people among the 2.3 million students with a higher education degree.
Finally, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% of the disabled versus 38% on average.
In short, there are so many criteria that make it difficult to re-enter work and that form the "core of the problem", says Christian Grapin, Director General of Tremplin, an association founded in 1992 that helps companies to recruit disabled workers.
So much for the factual brakes.
The unspoken remains, the attitudes that, although certain, are slowly evolving.
A study conducted in April by the association IMS-Entreprendre for the magazine La Cité stated that the managers surveyed had "a weak level of knowledge regarding disabled people" that was "overrepresented" by "persons in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually disadvantaged".
As a result, private enterprises with more than 20 employees still have a long way to go to achieve the employment target of 6% disabled workers set out in a 1987 law.
These latter figures, dating from 2008, refer to a quotient of 2.6%.
"We are now at around 3%," reports Pierre Blanc, Director General of Agefiph, the organization commissioned to collect contributions from companies that disregard this law.
Proof: The number of "paid" permanent establishments has decreased, as has the sum of the amounts paid between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which provides for increases in contributions, created a strong pressure on companies," Pierre Blanc said.
"But this improvement also expresses a real insight, especially among the large groups of companies."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of permanent establishments employ between 20 and 49 employees with disabilities, while companies with 100 to 199 employees employ 82%.
Hazard: "What a happiness"
Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens hadn’t hidden the pleasure of the friendship game before they faced the Blue Tuesdays (20:45).
It would have gone too far to claim that there was a secret agreement between them, but the picture speaks symbolic volumes.
Sitting side by side on the spectator stage of the Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard would have liked to have made peace.
Five months after the temperamental gesture of his attacking player against Turkey, the Belgian national coach had reaped nothing but praise for his person.
"I am very pleased with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian".
"I want to look ahead," the native Liller assures him.
As for the contrast between his representation in the club and the national team, "It's a unit that justifies everything."
"I'm in Lille all year round, which is not the case in Belgium."
"It's time for me to start."
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, brought about Friday night against Romania regarding the match against France to finally "gloss".
Without forsaking the note of "pleasure".
He has been leading the French national team since the age of seven, leading his victorious campaigns between 1998 and 2000.
“I have always been supported,” he said.
This inevitably contributes to reinforcing the "unique" character of this encounter even more.
So much in advance: "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there," he realizes.
"We just walked across the road."
"Being able to play against them means great luck!"
Leekens, for his part, sounded "pride" with kindness.
"The Pride of a Galamatch".
"Proud" also to confirm - in his capacity as"neighbors" - that France"has again become a very high-level team", and that little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc did a damn good job," he said enthusiastically.
Although Belgium will be missing in the next European championship, the technician sees himself sharing the plane with the Blues (the French national team) ... and heading to Brazil in 2014.
"We small Belgians are coming out big," he stressed.
"We're planning something, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You will notice this at the upcoming games". The game against France included.
Portugal is very confident
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento is looking forward with great optimism to the return game against Bosnia (22:00) this Tuesday in Lisbon.
At the end of the game, both teams were lacking in objectivity.
"At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is not the slightest hint of doubt that "La Selecçao", his national team, for which he is responsible since September 2010, will qualify for the European Championship 2012.
For Portugal, this means only 90 minutes of bliss.
But there is a match to play, and a opponent to serve, namely Bosnia.
Given the first game (0-0) on Friday in Zenica’s Hell, it seems obvious that the dice have not yet fallen.
Portugal clearly dominated the game for more than an hour, but the team was unable to print the important stamp that would have taken the pressure off it.
"This is a good result, but it carries some risk because we haven't scored an away goal."
At home, however, in their brightly shining Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to break through in front of an audience that might be just as hot on the table, even if the game was announced as "very tight," said the optimistic but clear-sighted Bento.
"We expect a very tight match, but we are completely convinced that we will be able to win the upper hand," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance to be in the 2012 European Championship," said Carlos Queiroz.
The draw on Friday in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score a goal and win.
A draw can already be enough for the Bosnians, who also need a goal.
"This is a good result, but it carries some risk because we haven't scored an away goal," Bento said.
"We will compete against a team that has high technical qualities and players with many individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese had the intention of putting maximum pressure on the Bosnians at the outset to "don't give them time to think."
A good idea, assuming that it will be put into practice this time.
