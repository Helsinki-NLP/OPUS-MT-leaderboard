Biker reacts lightning fast and prevents worse
On Friday evening, on the highway between Machtolsheim and Merklingen, a traffic accident occurred, in which a motorcyclist was only slightly injured thanks to his quick reaction.
Driver overlooks biker
A 44-year-old driver wanted to turn left on the Landesstraße 1230 in the direction of Machtolsheim with her VW coming from Merklingen at about 21.30.
She overlooked the 24-year-old motorcyclist coming from Nellingen.
Hand and foot brake levers fly away in the event of a collision
The biker was still trying to evade the car, but still roamed it at the rear of the vehicle.
As a result of the stray process, the hand and foot brake levers were torn off on the Suzuki and the driver was no longer able to brake off.
At the moment, he steered his motorcycle in the green steeps next to the road and let it roll out there without falling.
Biker suffers leg injury
Due to the collision with the car, the biker nevertheless suffered an injury to the leg and had to be treated in a clinic.
Mamming: Corona Mass Infection: 174 Harvest Helpers Infected
After a corona mass infection on a large vegetable farm in the Lower Bavarian Mamming, almost 500 people are quarantined and are no longer allowed to leave the plant.
A security service monitors the event.
A total of 174 harvesters were tested positive for the corona pathogen Sars-CoV-2 during the row examination, as the county office Dingolfing-Landau announced on Saturday evening.
"In order to avoid further spread, we must unfortunately take this step to protect the population," said Landrat Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Previously, seven employees had already been infected in the company - this was the reason for the series test.
The farm is a large vegetable farm that grows strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and beetroot - but the cucumbers only for jars.
Mamming is a rural community with more than 3,300 inhabitants not far from Dingolfing with its large BMW plant.
Bumeder called on citizens to remain calm: "According to our information, this is a closed circle of people."
On the farm, infected people were separated from uninfected employees, the site is now surrounded by a fence.
The Greens and the SPD gave co-responsibility to the state government.
The two opposition factions accused Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet of neglecting to control the shelters of seasonal workers.
"This can be bitterly avenged if such local infections happen and regional lockdowns have to be ordered," said Jürgen Mistol, the parliamentary director of the Greens.
"After the corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof-Schlachthof in mid-May, we already called for a special control program for farms with crop workers," said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
"In our view, it is precisely the hygiene conditions at the workplace and the living conditions that need to be strictly controlled.
That obviously didn't happen."
The outbreak came “with announcement.”
Aidenbachstraße Underground Station: Dangerous Dispute: 19-Year-Old Drops After Schubser
In a dispute between two youth groups at the Aidenbachstraße subway station, a 19-year-old fell through a pusher and slipped into the track bed.
On Friday there was a dispute between two youth groups at the subway station Aidenbachstraße around 4.15 p.m.
A passerby alerted the police, who approached with several stripes.
According to the first investigation, one Munich (17) pushed a 19-year-old to the ground.
The young man slipped over the platform edge and fell into the track bed.
People from the group of the 17-year-old helped the fallen man climb out of the track.
There was no danger of an incoming train.
As the police said, there were conflicts between the two people.
The 17-year-old escaped from the scene of the crime, but his personal details could be identified afterwards.
In the company of his father, he went to the police inspection 29.
The 17-year-old is being investigated for bodily injury.
Report: Seehofer urges longer storage of data
Data retention is currently suspended.
However, Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer is calling for an extension of the storage period.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
According to a media report, Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer (CSU) calls for an extended retention of data - instead of the planned ten weeks for half a year.
As the "Bild am Sonntag" reports, Seehofer asked Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht (SPD) in a letter for a quick change in the law.
Seehofer therefore wants to strengthen the measures against child abuse.
He thinks it makes sense to "take urgently needed adjustments to the law already now," the newspaper quotes from the letter.
The storage of data is currently suspended.
A decision of the Court of Justice is expected.
Seehofer, however, wants the amendments beforehand so that they could be applied immediately after a possible positive judgment, the report continues.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice told the newspaper that it would make sense to examine whether legal adjustments would be necessary if the courts had decided.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer had already voted together with the interior ministers of the countries in June for a retention of data.
NBA: Strip club annoys Clippers star Lou Williams
Excitement in the NBA!
Los Angeles Clippers basketball professional Lou Williams, 33, is said to have left the tournament quarter at Disney World in Orlando/Florida with permission for a funeral.
According to U.S. media reports, however, he still visited the strip club "Magic City" in Atlanta in the evening.
Williams, who is reported to have admitted the visit, according to ESPN reports, is back in Isloation, is tested daily for Covid-19.
His reason for visiting: Chicken Wings.
In February of last year, Sweet Lou, as he is called in the NBA, has already expressed his love for those very wings.
The American wrote, "Magic City and Blue Flame (another strip club in Atlanta, Anm. d. R.) have the best wings in the city."
NBA insider Shams Charania announced on Twitter on Sunday that the NBA Williams has ordered a 10-day quarantine.
With this, the Clippers star misses the first two official games after the test game phase.
In Disney World, the NBA wants to play the corona season.
Currently, the top 22 teams with training matches are preparing for the season finale, which starts in the night of Friday.
Söder expresses its views on the corona situation after mass infection
Munich - Health Minister Melanie Huml (CSU) has already announced a test initiative for large farms on Sunday.
The press conference will be live on our homepage.
The case in Mamming in the district of Dingolfing-Landau has terrified authorities and politics.
The large vegetable farm currently employs almost 500 harvesters from several countries, with more than a third infected with the coronavirus.
The farm is now quarantined and is closed with a construction fence.
No one is allowed to leave the premises, food is delivered.
The authorities are now offering free corona tests to some 3,300 residents of the municipality.
Since the harvest workers had little contact with the local population, the county council so far assumes that the infections have not spread beyond the farm.
"Bite of conscience": confession of the alleged Nantes firefighter
"My client has shown a cooperative spirit," lawyer Quentin Chabert told the newspaper.
The defendant added: "He regrets the deeds very much, the confession was a liberation for him."
"His mandate is plagued by remorse and very taken by the extent of destruction."
In the event of a conviction, the man is threatened with ten years imprisonment and a fine of 150,000 euros, according to the prosecutor.
The Gothic St. Peter and Paul Cathedral in Nantes had been severely damaged in a fire on Saturday last week.
The fire broke out in three far apart places in the church.
Laboratory investigations confirmed the suspicion of arson.
The suspect was arrested a few hours after the fire.
He was released after a day.
The man works as a volunteer for the Diocese of Nantes and was responsible for the closure of the cathedral on the eve of the fire.
Since there was no sign of a violent intrusion into the church, he quickly came into the eye of the investigators.
Discuss the abolition of the 50+1 rule
Former DFB president Reinhard Grindel has recommended to think about the abolition of the 50+1 rule.
"German football should at least discuss setting conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates completed facts," Grindel told Bild am Sonntag.
He stressed: "For the clubs that are most likely to become dangerous to Bayern and Dortmund, the 50+1 rules do not work anyway: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, one cannot circumvent the debate on whether it is not necessary to facilitate the involvement of investors by clubs that want to break into this phalanx".
However, he has doubts about whether there is a willingness in the German Football League to allow majority participations, which are prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50+1 rule.
"It remains a legal risk to draw investment fences around the business location of the Bundesliga in a European single market," Grindel said.
The former DFB chief sees the danger that "the attempts to ensure more competitive balance in the Bundesliga will ultimately only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but will not lead to more tension in the championship."
Even an equal distribution of TV money will not have a decisive effect.
FC Bayern is making a turnover of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million and RB Leipzig of 300 million.
The differences are immense among the first three clubs alone.
The other 15 clubs have an average budget of 130 million," said the 58-year-old.
Looking at the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
"Unfortunately, there have been people who noticed this mistake and stabbed the press instead of addressing me on it," Grindel said about the adoption of an expensive watch that had led to his resignation in April 2019.
“I’ve been very humanly busy.”
He received the gift worth about 11,000 euros from a Ukrainian official.
"I committed a compliance violation and it was right to draw the consequences from it," Grindel said.
“With the ominous watch gift, I was completely transparent and innocent.
A lot of people in the DFB knew about it.”
He never "made a hole out of the gift," the 58-year-old assured.
"This may be called naive, at least this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption."
"Black Lives Matter": Injured and a Dead
Protests against police violence in the United States have intensified again through Donald Trump’s use of federal police officers in several cities.
On Saturday, there were clashes between protesters and police officers in various cities.
Three people were injured in Louisville and 16 were arrested in Seattle.
In Austin, a person was killed by gunshots while a demonstration train was just crossing a crossroads.
Previously, there had been clashes in Portland during protests against racism and police violence.
The security forces, including federal police officials, used tear gas on Saturday night and violently dispersed protesters.
Hundreds, partly armed, protesters marched through Louisville, Kentucky, on Saturday, demanding that those responsible for Breonna Taylor’s death be held accountable.
The 26-year-old student was shot dead in a drug raid in her Louisville apartment in March.
The target of the raid was someone else who did not live there, and no drugs were found.
When a member of a group calling itself an armed alliance of black Americans fired on Saturday, three people were injured.
According to NBC, they were taken to the hospital.
None of them were in danger of death.
The police set up barricades because counter-demonstrators of a white militia had also formed.
There was no meeting between the two groups.
In Austin, Texas, a person was shot and killed during a Black Lives Matter demonstration.
Police said they had detained a suspect.
She has not yet provided any details of the circumstances of the act.
Mayor Steve Adler, according to the New York Times, said he was, like many in the city, "unconsolable and perplexed" about what had happened.
Protesters also clashed with police in Seattle on Saturday.
They set fire to construction vehicles in front of a youth detention centre, and police used blend grenades and pepper spray.
According to the Seattle Times, 16 people were arrested for resistance to police officers or physical assault.
In Oakland, California, a courthouse was set on fire.
A small group of protesters had broken down windows, shot down fireworks, and blinded police officers with lasers, Oakland police said late Saturday night.
The fire was quickly extinguished.
In Aurora, a suburb of Denver, Colorado, a car drove through a crowd demonstrating on a highway.
Police said one of the protesters fired a gun and at least one person was taken to the hospital.
In addition, windows were broken in a court there and a fire was set, police said.
Investigations have been initiated.
Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historical costumes defy the corona
Although the big sauce in the spa town was missing, visitors and performers enjoyed the Rakoczy flair of the alternative program.
It was unusual for visitors, performers and organizers: The Rakoczy weekend without Rakoczy festival.
But: Even if the big party mile in the city center was missing, the crowds and program highlights such as Saale, Rakoczy Ball or Festzug were burning, many came at their expense in the Corona-compliant alternative program.
"I think we have succeeded in spreading Rakoczy-Flair," says Kurdirektorin Sylvie Thormann.
The guests would have accepted it well.
In principle, one returns to the beginnings of the Rakoczy festival, and the historical aspects alone were the focus of the festival.
Pleasant atmosphere
Vesna Konhäuser has been visiting Bad Kissingen with her husband for more than 25 years.
This time in the Corona year.
The couple made themselves comfortable at the Luitpold Casino, watched the historical scenes while strolling and listened to Cuban live music at the casino restaurant.
"I also find it very pleasant," says Konhäuser.
She misses the crowds that otherwise belong to Rakoczy.
But it lacks the usual program highlights, especially Saale burns on Friday evening, as well as the historic festival and the final fireworks on Sunday evening.
"That's a pity.
The weather would have been great this year,” she says.
Rakoczy Riding Tournament to be held again
For the performers of the historical spa guests, the alternative program meant partly more work.
For example for Christina Gold, who participates in the festival in a normal year and can be seen there on the carriage of the Kurgarten café.
This year, she was walking in the city on Saturdays and Sundays in costume.
“It’s harder, otherwise it’s easier,” she says.
The equestrian club had less to do, even when individual riders were traveling in the park.
"We very much hope that the riding quadril can take place again next year," said Ulrike Waldhofen.
She announced that after several years of break in 2021, a Rakoczy riding tournament will take place again.
28 Corona cases at Spanish second-league Fuenlabrada
Spanish second-tier footballer CF Fuenlabrada is sliding deeper into the crisis due to a corona outbreak.
Since the newcomer from the vicinity of Madrid flew to the city of A Coruña on 20 July for a game despite the first corona cases, a deep blow follows the next.
By Sunday, 28 players or team members had been tested positive, one came to the hospital, the club said.
Fuenlabrada from the city of the same name southwest of Madrid had so far had the chance to reach the ascent playoffs.
Now even the descent into the B-group of the Second League is threatened.
The game against Deportivo La Coruña last Monday was cancelled at the last moment, the prosecutor's office is investigating for a possible offence against public health, the top sports authority CSD is considering the forced departure of the club.
The players as well as other team members sit in a quarantine hotel.
"Until the sixth day of quarantine, they have not received a fresh towel or gel," the sports newspaper wrote.
On photos, players could be seen hanging underwear and club clothes in their rooms in the hotel for drying after they apparently had to wash them themselves.
The bed linen was not changed for five days.
Another problem is the food.
Neither good nor sufficient," he wrote.
The club management, on the other hand, said they were happy with the hotel.
The club’s lawyer, Javier Tebas Llanas, denied the allegations of intentional endangerment of public health.
It has not violated the Corona rules set by the football association, stressed the son of the president of the Spanish Primera Division, Javier Tebas, as the news agency Europa Press and the sports newspaper "Marca" reported.
Prior to the departure, there were four infected people until July 19, but all of them were isolated and had not travelled with them.
Directly before the flight to A Coruña on Monday, all players and team members had been tested again.
When the team was already in A Coruña, five or six other team members of the Corona test were positive.
The game was cancelled 60 minutes before the start, Tebas Llanas said.
Police have to catch horses pulled out of steam
Two animals were on the road.
The police took her back to her owner.
On Sunday morning shortly before 6 a.m., a road user communicated two free-running horses on the feeder between the Donnersdorf/Steinsfeld estuary and the motorway junction Theres.
When the officials arrived, the horses were already back between the feeder and the village of Dampfach.
After the officials were able to win the trust of the horses shortly before steaming, they each had a rope carried in the patrol car.
Cycling professional Tony Martin: career continuation imaginable
Time trial specialist Tony Martin is thinking about a continuation of his career.
Frankfurt/Main - Seven-time world time trial champion Tony Martin can imagine continuing his cycling career.
"I'm just setting out the conditions with the team, how and in what form it could go on," the 35-year-old told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung.
Martin is currently employed by the Dutch team Jumbo-Visma and had considered ending his career after this year before the corona break.
Negotiations with his team are also about the number of race days, he said.
Or about other problems that would plague him as a family father, Martin said.
In the past, he had risen after a fall, and the first thought had been: "Quickly back on the bike.
Today, as a father of a little daughter, I think: What if?
The cycling professional admitted that there are certainly aspects with which he finds himself increasingly difficult.
"But it did me good to remember, based on the corona time, what I have in cycling and how much fun it is for me."
The time trial specialist returns to the competition at the Tour de l'Ain (August 5-9).

Kovac Tests with Monaco vs. Frankfurt
Frankfurt/Main (dpa) - Soccer coach Niko Kovac will soon see Eintracht Frankfurt again with his new club AS Monaco.
The eight-time French champion will be present at the Hessians, the former club of the Croatians, on August 1st at 6 p.m.
For the Bundesligisten, it is the first and only hard test before the Europa League replay against FC Basel (6 August).
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the meeting will be held without spectators.
“We are especially looking forward to this game.
It's always nice to come to Frankfurt and meet friends," Kovac explained.
This is an interesting test, the 48-year-old said.
Before moving to FC Bayern Munich, Kovac had trained the Hesse from 2016 to 2018 and led to victory in the DFB Cup.
"A top-class opponent like Monaco is a good test for us in terms of the game against Basel.
Like all Frankfurters, I look forward to seeing Niko Kovac again,” said Eintracht coach Adi Hütter.
The 50-year-old Austrian had succeeded the Croatian at the Eintracht.
In March, the Frankfurters lost the eighth-final match against Basel in their own stadium with a 0-3 loss.

Panzer horns in national park die from landslides
In Kaziranga National Park, several of the 120 tank horns died from landslides.
They are protected and considered at risk of extinction.
This year, the floods are particularly bad, which scientists attribute to climate change.
According to the United Nations, Bangladesh is one of the countries most affected by global warming.
New homes are empty

So far, few have moved in.
It's hard to get people to Cox's Bazar.
There is also enthusiasm in Grenezn.
Those who used to have a house, even though it was small and resembled a hut, often do not want to spend their lives in a large apartment block.
Many homes are vacant, but will soon be taken up by those who have lost their homes due to the floods.

Argentina rejects creditors’ counter-offer
The new demands could not be met, the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Buenos Aires announced on Saturday.
"This would not only be irresponsible, but also unfair," it said in a statement.
"While 50 percent of children in Argentina live in poverty, we cannot increase our creditors' short-term profits".
The debt of the second largest economy in South America is no longer sustainable under current conditions.
That is why Argentina is calling on its private creditors to renounce some of its claims of around $66 billion (about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>59 billion).
If there is no agreement, the country is again threatened with state bankruptcy.
It would be the ninth default in Argentine history.
Most recently, the lenders had demanded higher interest rates on government bonds and changes to some contractual clauses.
However, the Argentine government is holding on to its latest offer and is not prepared to make any further concessions.
Argentina is in a serious financial and economic crisis.
The inflation rate last year was more than 50 percent.
For the current year, experts expect economic power to decline by around ten percent.
At the end of May, Argentina had failed to pay interest claims amounting to $503 million and had thus slipped into a limited default.
Arrived professionally - not yet privately
"It's going super well" - this conclusion draws Dr. Stefanie Kramer after her first days at the notary in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything went very quickly: in mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she will succeed Lutz Feller at the notary office in Eggenfelden.
Already six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the doctoral lawyer took up work, the normal day-to-day business has long been on full swing.
"I still have to arrive in private," she explains in a conversation with the Rottaler Anzeiger and laughs.
Of course, the short lead-time was not enough to completely shift the food point from Regensburg to Eggenfelden, reports the native dingolfinger.
Currently, she and her husband, who works as a judge at the district court in Regensburg, are looking for a suitable apartment or house in the city.
At least her husband could still apply for short-term parental leave in order to be able to ensure the care of the two daughters (31<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 and 11<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 years old).
In order not to have to commute from Regensburg every day, she now also has an accommodation with her parents in Dingolfing, explains the 39-year-old.
Growing up in the neighbouring district, the city of Eggenfelden has of course long been a term for her.
During local visits with her family in the past months, she once again noted: "Eggenfelden is a really beautiful small town".
She was all the more pleased that she made the race in the selection process for the vacancy.
Her native Lower Bavaria also plays a central role in Dr. Stefanie Kramer’s professional career: after completing her law studies in Passau, she completed her referendum and the second state exam in Regensburg.
After several posts as notary assessor, among others in Rehau and Hof in Upper Franconia, Babenhausen in the Lower Allgäu and Regensburg - during this time she also "near" the doctorate in labour law - she took her first position as notary in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau in 2012.
In 2016, she went on parental leave, which eventually followed the move to Regensburg.
Since then, she has taken over representation services in various notary offices.
When the job in Eggenfelden was advertised because of the impending retirement of Lutz Feller, she saw the right time to fully re-enter her career, the 39-year-old explains.
The team of her predecessor, who will in future take over the holiday representation at the notary office, has completely taken over Dr. Stefanie Kramer - and has immediately prepared a praise for the team of the law firm: "It's going super well!"
The fact that she can rely on recorded processes here makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming relocation of the private food point.
In terms of kindergarten and nativity scenes, she has already made contact with a local institution.
And if everything works out as desired, she hopes to be able to pursue her hobby here too soon - and get to know the most beautiful jogging tracks of the Rottal valley.
BVB plans to start the league with a maximum of 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not be filled at the start of the season if fans return.
"Due to the distance regulation, which is mandatory to be observed, we are currently planning with 12,000 to 15,000 spectators," Borussia Dortmund's Managing Director Carsten Cramer told the "Tagesspiegel".
Normally, the arena in the district city holds a little more than 81,000 spectators at Bundesliga matches.
In the ghost games caused by the corona pandemic last season, the BVB had lost around four million euros per game.
Cramer, who is responsible for marketing, digitalization and internationalization at the BVB, hopes that, in addition to the normal spectator seats, some of the approximately 4,000 seats in the hospitality sector can be opened again: "Of course, it is a blow to the office if these revenues completely break away".
Given the ongoing corona crisis, everyone is currently “well advised to take a stable side length first.”
“If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people are short-term workers in Germany alone, then the need for entertainment is limited,” Cramer explained.
The Dortmund marketing chief praised the BVB professionals for their part-wage waiver, which is supposed to contribute to overcoming the crisis: "Of course, players know that their salary waiver has a different effect than if we put 100 people working in merchandising on short work".
Tiny Miracles: Early Start to Life with a Few Hundreds of Grams
Barely heavier than a packerl butter, only three tablespoons of blood in his entire body: that was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The baby is one of around 400 premature babies who are cared for annually at the Graz Children’s Hospital.
A quarter of them weigh less than 1,500 grams, a few - like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael - are extreme lightweights with not even a kilogram of birth weight.
They are so small and born so early that neither lungs, nor intestines, nor muscles are fully trained.
Their skin is sometimes so delicate that they could damage the electrodes of an ECG.
And they are so tiny that they sometimes wear doll clothes and mini-windows made specifically for them.
But not so small that they would not be in the voice - "and how," smiles Berndt Urlesberger.
"Even if, of course, they don't scream quite as loudly as big babies."
When the whiteboard becomes the stage
Despite Corona Theater in the classroom: The whiteboard as a stage experienced the 9th grades of the St. James High School in Abtsgmünd just before the holidays began.
Actress Julia Sylvester from the Theater of the city of Aalen presented the students with the production "Das Heimatkleid" - by video.
Subsequently, the students were able to chat via Skype with the actress and director Winfried Tobias about the play and the performance.
Born was the idea for the performance format from the current corona situation.
Teacher Teresa Nar was delighted with the enrichment of the lessons.
Although at the end all the participants agreed that the direct encounter in the theatre and stage room would offer additional stimuli, the potential for contact in the schools can also be seen in the theatre.
"If we continue to improve the technical framework, this could be an interesting addition to the game operation," said director Winfried Tobias.
First round drawn: TSV 1860 would meet Eintracht Frankfurt in the DFB-Pokal
Should the TSV 1860 qualify for the DFB-Pokal, the lions will face Eintracht Frankfurt in the first round.
This resulted in the draw on Sunday.
Munich - Sixty possible opponents in the first round of the DFB-Pokal are confirmed.
The Lions would face Eintracht Frankfurt in a successful qualification.
This was the result of the draw on Sunday evening in the ARD sports show.
Because the field of participants is not yet complete due to the corona pandemic, placeholders were used in the draw.
Due to the voluntary renunciation of semi-final opponent FC Memmingen, the TSV 1860 is already in the final of the Bavarian Toto Cup (4 or 5 September).
There the lions meet either the Würzburg Kickers or Viktoria Aschaffenburg.
If second-league forward Würzburg reached the final, Sixty would already be qualified for the first round of the DFB-Pokal.
Otherwise, the Giesinger would have to prevail in the final against Regionalligist Aschaffenburg.
The first round of the DFB-Pokal will take place between 11 and 14 September, a week before the start of the third league.
Olivia de Havilland, the legend of the film, has died
Oscar-winning film legend Olivia de Havilland has died.
She died on Sunday in Paris at the age of 104 of a natural death, her spokeswoman for the German press agency confirmed.
De Havilland was best known for her role as Melanie Hamilton in the southern epic "Von dem Winde gewecht" (1939).
Born to British parents in Tokyo, Olivia de Havilland moved to California as a toddler.
The Austrian theaterman Max Reinhardt discovered the 19-year-old in the role of Hermia of Shakespeare's "Summer Night's Dream".
The film studio Warner Brothers took her under contract for seven years and brought her out alongside Eroll Flynn.
Eight movies she made with the heartbreaker.
In 1946, she won her first Oscar in the lead role of "To Each His Own".
The film ran in Germany under the title "Mother Heart".
Three years later, the award for Best Actress came in William Wyler's "The Heiress".
Much recognition was also given to her as a neurotic eccentric in "The Dark Mirror" and "The Snake's Pit".
Daphne du Maurier proposed her in 1952 for the lead role in the filming of her novel "My cousin Rachel".
The play was a worldwide success.
With her longtime friend Bette Davis, she played in "Cradle Song for a Body".
From his marriage to the writer Marcus Goodrich (1946-1953) his son Benjamin was born.
In Paris, de Havilland married the journalist Pierre Paul Galante and had his daughter Gisèle with him.
This marriage also broke down.
Rumors of an affair with former British Prime Minister Edward Heath have never been confirmed.
"Road to Timmendorf": Beach volleyball: Thole/Wickler miss finale at comeback
World Cup seconds Julius Thole and Clemens Wickler missed the final at the beach volleyball tournament "Road to Timmendorf".
At the meeting of the top teams in Düsseldorf, they defeated their national team colleagues Nils Ehlers and Lars Flüggen in the semi-finals with 1:2 (17:21, 21:17, 19:21).
Thole/Wickler last played at the World Tour Final in Rome in September last year.
In the final game at the Rhine, their conquerors Ehlers/Flügen lost to the surprise team Lukas Pfretschner and his interim partner Steven van de Velde with 0:2 (17:21, 17:21).
In addition to the show tournament, three starting places for the German championships were played out at Timmendorfer Strand in early September: The tickets were secured by Armin Dollinger/Simon Kulzer, Manuel Harms/Richard Peemüller and Simon Pfretschner/Milan Sievers.
Kalbitz eject from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "feigenblatt"
The exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is from the point of view of the FDP only a "fig leaf" and does not change the character of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the far-right in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the tip of the iceberg of the radicals in the AfD," said FDP interior politician Benjamin Strasser to the news agency dpa in Berlin.
The Federal Arbitration Court of the AfD had confirmed on Saturday in Stuttgart after several hours of trial the exclusion of Kalbitz, which the Federal Board of Management had decided by a majority in May.
Kalbitz is the chairman of the AfD group in the Brandenburger Landtag.
"If the AfD were really about consistently removing right-wing extremists from its party, officials like Björn Höcke and his supporters would have been excluded long ago," Strasser said.
"There is no political will in the AfD, however, because right-wing extremism now belongs to the party".
Similarly, CSU General Secretary Markus Blume said: "The fact that Andreas Kalbitz now remains excluded says nothing and does not change anything," he told the "Welt am Sonntag".
"On the contrary, it speaks volumes of how many frenetic supporters a right-wing extremist still has in the middle of the AfD".
Blume expects that the AfD will again fall below five percent in elections in the future.
"The days of the AfD in parliaments are counted".
Kalbitz was one of the spokesmen of the officially dissolved "wing" around the Thuringian AfD state and faction chairman Björn Höcke; the constitutional protection classifies the straitening as "secured right-wing extremist endeavor".
In May, the AfD Federal Executive Board had thrown Kalbitz out of the party.
As a reason, he stated that Kalbitz had not indicated a previous membership in the now banned right-wing "Heimattreuen Deutsche Jugend" (HDJ) and among the Republicans when joining his party.
Kalbitz denies membership in the HDJ.
The chairman of the Left Group in the Brandenburg Landtag, Sebastian Walter, also stressed that the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court does not change the character of the AfD: "The wolf only ate chalk.
The AfD remains a far-right party, whether with or without Kalbitz".
Neither the Federal Party nor the right wing will be weakened by this decision.
"The maneuver of the Meuthen troop is perceptible.
One wants to avoid further observation by the constitutional protection and tries to get under the radar," said Walter.
"The AfD will not let go of the ghosts she called.
An expulsion does not change anything,” commented Brandenburg SPD General Secretary Erik Stohn on the decision in the Kalbitz case.
"Here the AfD-Landesverband and the faction held to their right-wing leader to this day".
The legal dispute over Kalbitz’s membership in the AfD will continue.
He announced on Saturday that he will now take civil action against the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court.
North Sea wind farms deliver 21% more electricity
The wind turbines on the German North Sea fed 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity into the grid in the first six months of the year.
This is a good 21 percent more than in the same period of the previous year, the network operator Tennet in Bayreuth said.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of the North Sea electricity to the mainland and the transmission through the German electricity grid.
The wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of Tennet’s network area, have fed a further 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
In total, the wind current from the North and Baltic Sea thus comes to 13.73 TWh, compared with a good 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The wind harvest at sea thus accounts for almost 19 percent of the total wind power in Germany, which is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms ensure higher generation capacities
In addition to the wind conditions, the increased contribution of offshore wind energy results from higher generation capacities, because new wind farms have entered the grid in the last 12 months.
If the 1,270 wind turbines in the North Sea were all running at full power at the same time, they could generate 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient for this; according to Tennet, it is 7.1 gigawatts.
By 2030, it is expected to rise to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea.
"In Germany and in the Netherlands, we will be investing 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore network connections by then," said Tennet CEO Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, even at sea, wind farms cannot exploit their capacity, but reach about 40 percent.
This year’s record day is January 2, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind turbines produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, which corresponds to three to four nuclear power plants.
This could provide electricity to nearly seven million households.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the gallery of the Gmünder Kunstverein.
This was almost a small anniversary celebration of the 130th anniversary.
Birthday of the Gmünder Kunstverein: After the corona break, the exhibition opening "Skirmish" with works by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold broke the usual frame.
Much more art lovers than usual followed the dialogue between the artist and the chairman of the art association, Professor Dr. Klaus Ripper.
The musical equivalent was provided by the band "Defenders of the Universe" on the southern Kornhausplatz.
To the north of the gallery the association "Sandtogether" was engaged.
Freital: Windbergfest cancelled due to corona
The Windberg Festival will not take place this year.
The city of Freital has cancelled the three-day festival scheduled for September.
In other years, more than 30,000 people had attended this city festival.
"We really did not make this decision easy and - aware of how difficult it is economically for the parties involved - hoped until the last minute," said Mayor Uwe Rumberg.
"But ultimately, we are here as organizers responsible for the health of many thousands of people".
If tens of thousands of people had flown to the festival grounds and the festival tent, minimum distances, hygiene regulations and contact tracking could not have been complied with in accordance with the current Corona Protection Regulation.
Or the restrictions would have been so strong that not much would have been left of a folk festival.
In addition, the organisational and monitoring effort would increase disproportionately.
Rumberg confided in next year.
Then the city of Freital celebrates its 100th anniversary with the Winterbergfest from 7 to 9 May 2021 and the Saxon Day from 10 to 12 September 2021.
Dressage Olympian Werth in Achleiten not to be beaten
Achleiten - The six-time Olympic champion Isabell Werth was the outstanding rider at the dressage tournament in the Austrian Achleiten.
The 51-year-old from Rheinberg won four starts this weekend.
After winning a Grand Prix with Ordinary Gold and Quantaz, she could not be beaten on Sunday in the Grand Prix Special and in the race.
At the 15-year-old mare Weihegold, Werth clearly won against Austrian Victoria Max-Theurer on Abegglen in the special on Sunday.
On Saturday, the Germans also lay clearly on Quantaz in front of their 34-year-old student Victoria Max-Theurer.
Werth's winning horse Quantaz belongs to Max-Theurer.
The most successful dressage rider in the world will establish the ten-year-old stallion in the Grand Prix.
For Quantaz, it was the first cure ever.
Already in the first tournament in Achleiten three weeks ago Werth had won all four important tests.
The last of the three international tournaments is scheduled for August 14-16.
More air traffic controllers in Worms
The Worms University of Applied Sciences goes further into the air: The "DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung" is donating a professorship for "Air Traffic Management".
A corresponding contract between the university and the DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was initially signed for three years and starts in 2021.
With the professorship, it is possible to enable the start of studies not only in the summer but also in the winter semester.
This means that twice as many students can be trained as before.
At the same time, the capacities of both the university and the air navigation academy of the DFS are used equally.
The DFS will advise the university on the establishment and appointment of the professorship.
Represented at the university since 2019
Since the summer semester 2019, the first students in the course of their training as air traffic controllers at Worms University of Applied Sciences are in the Air Traffic Management degree program.
Nine students have already started this year.
So far, the experiences of the DFS are very positive, the achievements of the students are excellent.
The combination of study and pilot training contributes significantly to further increasing the attractiveness of the piloting profession.
“In these times, funding is not easy for us economically.
However, we strongly expect air traffic to recover and grow again in the long term.
In order to continue to fulfil our legal mandate, we need highly qualified personnel,” says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, Chairman of the DFS, when signing the contract.
"For the DFS, the chair of the foundation is a future-proof investment that will provide air traffic controllers with a broad, cross-disciplinary knowledge base in the long term.
We therefore continue to cooperate well with the university and at the same time underpin our attractiveness as an employer."
Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of the Worms University of Applied Sciences, also underlines this: "The professorship of the foundation forms an important bridge between science and business.
With it, we would like to link up with the already existing cooperation with DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual bachelor’s degree program Air Traffic Management."
The confidence of the German air traffic controller was for the University of Worms both the motivation and the obligation to further develop its teaching and research competence in the future fields of air transport.
With the first foundation professorship for a dual course of study, the university could set very special highlights and innovative focuses for its students.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary at the Ministry of Science, Education and Culture, emphasizes: "The Worms University of Applied Sciences, with its focus on aviation, has a unique selling point in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Today's signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the profile of the university".
Rescue helicopter lands on the A 45
Around 30 minutes, the A 45 motorway was completely blocked on Saturday afternoon in the direction of Aschaffenburg, because after a traffic accident the rescue helicopter was in use.
A 76-year-old drove with a Ford at 12.40 in the exit Alzenau-Mitte in the curve straight and landed at the guardrail.
As a result of the impact, the front airbags triggered, the driver suffered slight injuries to the face and had to be taken to a hospital for treatment.
The injuries of the 72-year-old passenger were taken care of by the emergency doctor and the patient was subsequently flown into a hospital with the rescue helicopter.
However, police are currently assuming that there is no danger to life.
The damaged vehicle, which caused damage of about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2,000, had to be towed.
Heil wants to examine other industries according to meat industry
The corona crisis brought the conditions in parts of the meat industry to light once again.
Law tightening is imminent.
Are they right, and will they remain?
Federal Labour Minister Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to review other industries according to the now planned strict regulations against misconduct in the meat industry.
"We will look at industry by industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective industry if necessary," Heil told the Deutsche Presse-Agentur in Berlin.
Germany’s employers are already warning against restricting works contracts in general.
After the mass corona outbreak at the meat giant Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Cabinet wants to pass a law of salvation on this Wednesday.
Large-scale slaughterhouses are no longer allowed to employ third-party personnel for slaughtering, dismantling and meat processing.
For this purpose, the use of employment contracts and temporary workers is to be prohibited there.
Employer President Ingo Kramer said the dpa: "Finger away from a general restriction of work contracts and employee leaving, if you do not want to completely choke the economy".
Work contracts, for example, are the basis for the creation of value at the customer’s premises for wide areas of the craft, the construction industry and plant construction.
"The faults of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument".
Heil assured: "My goal is not to ban works contracts everywhere in the German economy".
Work contracts make sense.
"If an industrial company hires a tradesman to install a safety system, this is a normal work contract."
The German meat industry considers a ban on works contracts and temporary work unconstitutional in its industry alone.
It is unexplainable why in the future different labour law should apply to portioning and packaging of cheese than to sausages, according to a statement on the bill, as reported by the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Saturday).
In the event of a ban, the consumer price would rise by 10 to 20 percent per kilo and product.
Many Eastern European employees from work contract companies worked in the industry 16 hours a day, according to the results of an audit by the NRW Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
They often did not have a break.
Wages were retained for protective equipment or rent.
It was also noted that the situation in the housing of employees was often miserable.
Heil said that a relatively sharp law for the meat industry had already entered into force in 2017.
However, "tricky constructions" have circumvented these.
"Now needs to be thoroughly cleaned up".
The politician announced: "In the Occupational Safety and Health Act, which we want to pass in the Cabinet at the end of July, there are also measures that affect not only the meat sector - for example, higher inspection rates in Occupational Safety and Health or clear criteria for community accommodation".
The draft of the dpa includes amendments to the Act to safeguard workers’ rights in the meat industry as well as the Occupational Safety and Health Act.
Brandenburg’s consumer protection minister Ursula Nonnemacher (Greens) believes that more intensive controls are needed.
"I would like to see more controls in many supervisory areas: food controls, animal welfare, everything possible, including animal transport," Nonnemacher said on Sunday in the RBB broadcast "Brandenburg aktuell".
However, more personnel posts are also needed for more controls.
Three dead in ultralight plane crash in Germany
In the crash of an ultralight aircraft on an apartment building in Wesel in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, three people have died, according to the police.
A child was easily injured.
Two more people were rescued in the accident, a spokesman for the Wesel district control centre said.
A parachute was found at the scene, police said.
The "Rheinische Post" reported, citing eyewitnesses, that before the crash, the plane had collided with a hot air balloon.
The house is a single or two-family house.
Further details were initially not known.
Evacuation of Frankfurt Opera Square proceeded peacefully
A week after the riots in Frankfurt, the eviction of the Opera Square at night on Sunday was also peaceful.
Lastly, a few dozen people were still in the square, but left it at 1 a.m. before the curfew began.
The police have been in action since the early evening with numerous officials, a larger police force was seen throughout the city area.
For the first time this weekend from midnight onwards, there was a ban on entering the Opera Square, on which there had been riots a week ago.
Policemen had been attacked with bottles out of the crowd of celebrants.
At least five police officers were injured after police entry, several police vehicles damaged.
The night on Saturday was also quiet.
Car turns over: Young woman seriously injured in accident on federal road 83 near Hofgeismar
In an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme, a 21-year-old suffered serious injuries around 13.25 on Sunday.
She was taken to the Kassel Clinic.
With thermal imaging cameras, the fire department was looking for possible passengers.
According to police, the woman was on the road 83 in the direction of her place of residence Hümme, when her car came off the road for an unexplained reason and overturned several times.
In order to save the injured, the fire department had to cut open the roof of the car.
Since it was unclear if anyone else was in the vehicle, the adjacent cornfield was searched from the rotary ladder with a thermal imaging camera.
The drone staff from Warburg, which also works with thermal imaging cameras, had also been ordered for the search for persons.
However, the operatives did not find anyone between the tall corn plants.
The seriously injured person was taken by ambulance to the Kasseler Klinikum for further care.
Almost 50 firefighters from Hofgeismar, Hümme and Schöneberg were on site.
The road was closed for two hours due to the accident.
Juventus Turin Champions in Italy
Turin - After a redemptive goal from Cristiano Ronaldo, record champion Juventus Turin has secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in series.
The team around the five-time world footballer made the 36th Scudetto in club history perfect with a 2-0 (1-0) on Sunday night in the home game against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo scored 1-0 before the halftime.
With 83 points, Turin, who competed without last long injured ex-international player Sami Khedira, is no longer out of place two days before the end of the Serie A season.
The second-placed Inter Milan is seven points behind.
Juventus were harmless despite visual superiority in the first half, then Ronaldo hit after a free kick variant with the last action.
The 35-year-old took advantage of Miralem Pjanic from the penalty area limit directly with a flat shot (45.+7).
Against the now more offensive guests, Ronaldo was also involved in the 2-0, after his shot Federico Bernardeschi (67th) dusted off.
This ensured a glossy but decisive success.
The foul penalty shot at the latte in the 89th minute should have only Ronaldo himself with a view to the goal-hunters rating right.
"It's complicated to stay at ball height mentally and physically for 90 minutes.
The games are weird, and the momentum is changing very easily," coach Maurizio Sarri said after the 1:2 at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Above all, the mental exhaustion of his players is great, said the Juve coach.
Because of the defeat, the Turinians had not yet been able to make the championship perfect.
In the end, Juve had a calming lead at the top of the table due to the weakness of the competitors.
In the eleven games before the game on Sunday, the Sarri team had only five wins.
It is questionable whether Ronaldo will still be the scoring king.
While the Portuguese superstar has scored 31 goals so far, the former Dortmunder Ciro Immobile has already scored 34 goals in his account after his three-pack at the 5:1 (1:1) of the table fourth Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to the title win of FC Bayern.
The record in Italy is held by current Juve professional Gonzalo Higuaín.
The Argentinian scored 36 goals for SSC Naples in the 2015/2016 season.
In August, the "Old Lady" of Italian football is waiting for the next title opportunity.
Juventus is in the Champions League eighth-finals, but on August 7 against Olympique Lyon, however, has to make a 0:1 break in order to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next knockout round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would wait as opponents.
Baden-Württemberg: Over 250 illegal car races recorded
In spite of all the threats of penalties and court rulings, drivers continue to gas in countless illegal races on the Baden-Württemberg roads: Last year and the first four months of this year, the police in the southwest have already registered more than 250 illegal car races.
There are no comparable values for the years before, but the rushes are increasingly making the judicial authorities work: In the case of the prosecutors between Konstanz and Mannheim, a total of 155 investigations were conducted in 2018 for illegal races, a year later there were already 252 and in the current year until the beginning of June already 151.
The races were less about organized events, as the Interior Ministry’s response to a request from the Landtag SPD shows.
In most cases, the drivers spontaneously competed against each other or they took the flight from the police - this is also reported as an illegal race.
The drivers were mainly German men between the ages of 18 and 60.
113 fines - 15 times imprisonment
Only in comparatively few cases are the rasers caught and also asked for cash: According to the Ministry of the Interior, a total of 113 fines and 15 prison sentences have been imposed since 2018.
However, there is no indication that the number of illegal car races is actually increasing.
Rather, other drivers reacted more sensitively than before due to the numerous tragic accidents and trials of past years, and indicated more often, a ministry spokesman said.
Highway 8 is particularly popular with speeders. Again and again motorists slow down traffic to make space and use the free route for a race.
Last August, a dozen drivers were caught near Kirchheim under Teck, three months earlier there were even 18 drivers on the A8 at Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular "racing track"
On the A81, the police register even more races than on any other federal highway.
There, a speed limit is used to try to slow down the ratchet on the particularly affected section between narrow and geisingen.
The mostly high-priced and upbeat sports and luxury cars often have Swiss license plates, because the drivers are avoiding the lawn to Germany because of the high penalties for too fast driving and car racing in the neighboring country.
For the SPD, the speed limit must not be reduced to a few routes: "With a general speed limit of 130 km/h, we would overcome this problem on motorways," says Martin Rivoir, the traffic experts of the SPD parliamentary group.
"The inhibition threshold for racers would be significantly higher if you were not legally on the road here and there with 200 kilometers per hour and more."
Rivoir thinks less about education or image campaigns: "Whoever in such a way transcends all rules and risks not only his own life, but also the lives of other road users, can hardly be reached with reason".
ADAC calls for stronger police intervention
This, on the other hand, is not enough for ADAC: "We assume that speeders will not be discouraged from speed limits," says Holger Bach, Head of the Transport and Environment Department at ADAC Württemberg.
It calls for additional and tougher controls on the affected routes.
It is not uncommon for the high-touring force to become more painful and serious: Since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people died in the races nationwide, two of them uninvolved in a nighttime crash in Stuttgart’s city centre and one in Gerlingen.
There, two young men were reported to have delivered themselves a car race in November.
One of the vehicles came off the road, bounced against a garden wall and lay on the side, the 18-year-old passenger died.
Twenty-one more people were injured in the races of the past two years.
However, according to Interior Minister Thomas Strobl, harsher penalties are not necessary: "Legislative action is needed to sanction illegal motor vehicle races more severely, is not seen," says the paper of the Interior Ministry.
Blue light from July 23rd: Thirsty burglar steals drinks from snacks
Rohrdorf: A man broke into a snack in Rohrdorf (Calw district) on Thursday and stole drinks and cash.
A witness heard noises in the valley road around 3:40 a.m. and ran towards the snack.
There he noticed a man serving himself at the refrigerator with drinks and then left the snack through a previously opened entrance door.
The perpetrator fled to the meadows behind the snack.
According to police, the burglar also used a cash register and stole cash in the low three-digit range.
The suspect is described as follows: He is about 1.75 to 1.80 meters tall and of strong stature.
In fact, he wore a black hooded sweater, black pants and light shoes.
The police are taking further witnesses.
Ackermann sprints to victory on final stage at Sibiu Tour
Cycling professional Pascal Ackermann has won his second day on the final stage of the 10th Sibiu Tour.
The 26-year-old Palatine from Team Bora-hansgrohe made it through the 109-kilometer stretch with start and finish in Hermannstadt in the mass sprint, after winning a stage on Saturday.
It was the season three and four wins for Ackermann.
His Austrian teammate Gregor Mühlberger won the overall standings.
The 26-year-old had sovereignly decided on the mountain time trial in the morning and thus took over the top in the ranking.
Only 104 drivers left for the final stage in the evening.
No less than 18 starters had fallen victim to the time limit in the mountain time trial.
"I'm really happy to start the season with a win," Ackermann said after his success on Saturday.
"The sprint was really hectic," the 26-year-old said.
300 meters ahead of the finish, he just put on his sprint, "and it also worked perfectly."
According to the rules of the UCI, a corona test was carried out on all race participants and their companions six days before the start of the race.
During the entire tour, drivers and caregivers were separated from the organization team and the media in isolated hygiene bubbles.
Viewers at the start and finish were not allowed.
Guidance Centre gave instructions for lay animation
Düsseldorf - Tragic accident on Sunday afternoon in Düsseldorf-Garath.
In a multi-family house, a child (4) suddenly lay lifeless in the water while bathing.
Firefighters said the emergency call came in just before 1:00 p.m.
"A guiding officer immediately gave instructions for lay reanimation," a fire department spokesman told BILD.
The incoming rescuers took over the resuscitation measures a little later.
The child, who was in danger of death, was transported to the university clinic under resuscitation.
Why it crashed is unclear.
The police routinely investigated the incident.
The fire department spokesman: "We assume a tragic accident in the apartment."
Nuremberg: Unauthorized tuning meeting - police intervene, 700 vehicles and around 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and occasionally over 1,000 people took part in a "tuning meeting" on Saturday night in the parking lot of a furniture store.
The police implemented their announcement to intensify control of such events.
A major tuning meeting took place on Saturday evening (25 July 2020) in Nuremberg-Südstadt.
Hundreds of vehicles were involved.
According to police Mittelfranken, an increased vehicle traffic in the area of a large parking lot in the Ingolstädter Straße was detected by the Nuremberg traffic police at about 22.30.
The police then carried out a number of vehicle inspections.
Only recently had the police announced to step up action against so-called autoposers.
Illegal tuning meeting in Nuremberg: only a small part of the "scene"
The officials numbered among the top 700 vehicles and about 1,100 people, the police accounts.
Of these, however, only a small part of those present could be attributed to the "autoposer" and tuning scene.
Apparently, most of the scene responded to the police’s appeal.
On the basis of the vehicles and passengers present on site, it was to be assumed that these were predominantly spectators.
In addition, the vast majority of those present adhered to the current infection protection regulations, in particular the observance of the minimum distance and the wearing of a mouth-nose protection.
The on-site checks were completed at around 1:00 a.m.
All in all, the officials found in 10 vehicles such structural changes that the operating permit had expired.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.
No car racing
There were no illegal car races.
"The Central Franconian Police Bureau will continue to keep an eye on what is happening and will continue to carry out enhanced control measures, including in connection with the arrival of viewers," it said.
News5 spoke to Jürgen Schrödinger from the towing company involved: "They all have beautiful rims, we can't scratch them," says Schrödinger.
For this purpose, special tapes would be used.
Also because the cars are wider, the company must be careful not to make any damage.
"The young people are supposed to get their cars back unharmed."
Employment agency figures: 900 suspected abuses in short-term work
Berlin - The Federal Employment Agency (BA) is investigating around 900 suspected cases of abuse of short-time worker allowances.
"This is extremely little in more than 880,000 companies that have reported short-term work," said Daniel Terzenbach, the executive director responsible for the operational business, to the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung".
When, at the beginning of the corona crisis, many companies suddenly applied for short-term work, BA had to react quickly.
Usually, the exam takes up to three weeks.
“We didn’t have that much time in this hot time.
The more we will look at the final accounts.
I'm sure there will be more to come.
We are not na<0xC3><0xAF>ve and have a long breath."
Indications of abuse often come from the affected employees or unions.
In addition, the BA uses analysis software to detect patterns of abuse.
According to Terzenbach, the BA is preparing for a possible insolvency surge in the autumn.
Will there be more insolvencies than last year?
The assessments differ, but we are preparing ourselves for the case and are already training our employees in the employment agencies for processing applications for insolvency money".
The numbers are still inconspicuous, Terzenbach said.
World Heritage in Potsdam: Party in the New Garden dissolved
Potsdam - On Friday evening, about 40 young people celebrated a party in the New Garden.
The gathering was dissolved at 8.48 p.m. by the district drivers of the Stiftung Preußische Schlösser und Gärten (SPSG), the foundation announced on PNN request.
The young people left the park.
On Saturday evening, some young people would have played rugby in the New Garden.
The meadow was cleared by area drivers, said SPSG spokesman Frank Kallensee on Sunday.
Again and again there are illegal celebrations in the parks
In the parks of the foundation, there are always accumulations where the distance and hygiene rules of the COVID-19 regulation are not complied with.
At the end of June there was a celebration with about 300 people in the park Babelsberg, a week later about 150 people celebrated in the New Garden.
Even without the Corona Regulation, the parks will be closed in the dark.
Storage in the meadows is prohibited according to the parking regulations, there are only a few exceptions.
The foundation has been complaining for a long time about the fact that visitors would leave more and more garbage and destroy protected biotopes.
In Berlin, illegal park parties have, meanwhile, reached a different dimension.
In the Hasenheide in the district of Neukölln, 5000 people celebrated an illegal techno party on Sunday night.
The event was cancelled by the police.
Austria: Mass tests after corona outbreak in tourist resort
With hundreds of tests, authorities have responded to a corona outbreak in the popular Upper Austrian tourist resort of St. Wolfgang.
The number of confirmed cases rose to 48, as the state authorities in Linz announced.
More than 100 results were still outstanding in the evening.
Accordingly, many of the infected young interns are in tourism companies, but at least one holiday guest has also been tested positive.
Residents, guests and tourism staff were asked to stay in their accommodations on Saturday evening.
The deadline was set at 11 p.m.
"There are cancellations and cancellations there and there" of bookings, said the head of the tourism association Wolfgangsee, Hans Wieser, the dpa.
Some of the guests also left early.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist resort in Upper Austria, with more than 400,000 overnight stays last year.
In a normal season, around a third of the guests are German.
On Friday, the first infections became publicly known.
The head of the district authority, Alois Lanz, on Saturday defended the behavior of the interns who had celebrated in several venues and could have contracted infection there.
"We all liked to do that in our youth," he told the radio station <0xC3><0x96>1.
However, two bars were closed on Friday to prevent further infections.
The tourism association launched an information campaign to raise awareness among young employees about the dangers of COVID-19.
As of Saturday, hundreds of employees, holidaymakers and locals have been tested.
In addition, all guests who were in St. Wolfgang from 15 July were contacted.
The outbreak evokes memories of the Austrian ski and party resort Ischgl in Tyrol, which was a center of the coronavirus spread throughout Europe at the beginning of the pandemic.
In total, more than 1,500 people are currently infected with the virus in Austria.
The main focuses of the new infections are Vienna and Upper Austria.
Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualify for Champions League
London (dpa) - English football record champion Manchester United returns to the Champions League after a year's absence.
The Red Devils secured the third place in the table on the last day of the Premier League match by a 2-0 (0-0) success against direct competitor Leicester City.
The Foxes now have to content themselves with the Europa League, because FC Chelsea still passed by and qualified for the king class as fourth.
In the fight against the descent, Aston Villa was allowed to cheer.
Manchester United took the lead by a penalty kick from Bruno Fernandes (71st minute).
After a red card for Leicester City in the replay, Jesse Lingard (90.+8) scored the end goal.
Chelsea, in the Champions League eighth-final opponent of FC Bayern, won in parallel with 2-0 (2-0) against the Wolverhampton Wanderers thanks to Mason Mount (45.+1) and Olivier Giroud (45.+4).
"That means a lot to me," said coach Frank Lampard, who is also in the final of the FA Cup against Arsenal in his first season as Chelsea coach.
Chelsea's victory against Wolverhampton also benefited Tottenham Hotspur, who with a lean 1:1 (1:0) at Crystal Palace still passed the Wolves and finished sixth in the Europa League.
Aston Villa decided the distance duel with FC Watford and AFC Bournemouth for themselves, but had to shake for a long time at West Ham United for the class holdout.
The late lead of Jack Grealish (84th) immediately outperformed Andrei Jarmolenko (85th).
That 1:1 (0:0) was enough, however, because Watford lost 2:3 (1:3) to Arsenal.
The club, which scored three coaches in the season, declines after five years in the first league.
Just like Bournemouth, who could not save himself by a 3:1 (2:1) at FC Everton.
In the end, one point was missing.
FC Liverpool, which has been the English champion since the end of June, secured a club record with a 3:1 (1:1) victory at Newcastle United.
99 counts are the highest score the Reds have ever scored in a football season.
Coach Jürgen Klopp and his team narrowly missed the scoring record in English football.
The top mark is Manchester City with 100 points in the 2017/18 season.
Following the Newcastle lead in the first minute, Virgil van Dijk (38th), Divock Origi (59th) and Sadio Mané (89th) made the game on Sunday for Liverpool.
"For this wonderful club, it was an extraordinary season," said goalkeeper van Dijk after the game, "that should encourage us to defend the title.
It's going to be hard."
At the end of the day, the Premier League bosses will be happy.
Due to the coronavirus crisis, football operations in England were interrupted from March 13 to June 17.
In the meantime, even a premature termination or a holding of the remaining games on neutral ground was discussed.
Eventually, however, the season ended without any special events - but as in Germany without spectators in the stadiums.
Arrests and violence in protests against Netanyahu
The protests in Israel against Prime Minister Netanyahu are becoming more and more violent.
During the night there were violent clashes.
Israeli police have taken violent action against participants in a demonstration against the right-wing conservative leader Benjamin Netanyahu in the night to Sunday in Jerusalem.
Twelve people have been arrested for participating in riots, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said.
Among other things, the police used water guns to dissolve the rally.
According to media reports on Saturday evening, around 6,000 people gathered near Netanyahu’s office.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu’s handling of the corona crisis.
The protesters beat drums, blew horns and called for Netanyahu to resign.
Participants of a counter-demonstration that supported Netanyahu were also arrested, the news site "ynet" reported.
People also demonstrated in many other places in Israel, including in front of the head of government’s private villa in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
A man was arrested, according to police reports, near Tel Aviv on suspicion of spraying pepper spray from a moving car on protesters on the roadside.
Another man was arrested after a knife attack on a protester in the south of the country.
The protester was slightly injured in the throat.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, there have been several demonstrations against Netanyahu.
The rallies accompany the corruption process against the head of government.
Netanyahu has also been criticized for his handling of the corona crisis.
Among other things, he is subjected to rapid easing and a lack of preparation for a second corona wave.
The corona crisis has made the economy of the country difficult.
The unemployment rate last year was more than 20 percent.
The number of new infections with the coronavirus in Israel recently rose to ever-new record levels.
Accident at Ahlen (NRW) - Transporter crashes on car - nine injured - Ruhrgebiet - Bild.de
Ahlen - A collision on Saturday afternoon on the B58 near Ahlen called for nine mildly injured.
A driver was traveling with her two children (3, 5) towards Beckum.
The police said: "Probably she had suddenly slowed down because she wanted to turn around."
The driver of a Mercedes-transporter who drove behind her must have seen this too late.
He slammed on the back of the car.
In the accident, three passengers in the car and six in the van were slightly injured.
Several ambulances took her to a nearby hospital.
North Korea decommissions border city after corona case
North Korea has so far seen its own measures to fight off the coronavirus as a "brilliant success".
For the first time, the country has reported a suspicion.
Because of a first official corona case in the country, North Korea has completely locked up a major city for fear of a disaster.
Despite the strictest epidemiological defence measures in the past six months, "the malignant virus may have been introduced into the country," state media reported.
For the region around the border town of Kaesong, the state of emergency was imposed.
The Communist leadership issued the highest level of alarm.
Should the suspected case be confirmed, it would be the first official case of infection with Sars-CoV-2 in the isolated country.
North Korea has not registered a single infection so far and described its defensive measures as a "brilliant success".
The information was questioned abroad.
The symptoms of the disease were reportedly detected by an "outlier" who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on July 19.
The person departed to South Korea three years ago and has now returned across the border.
For the border crossing within the four kilometers wide and mostly still mined military buffer zone, there was initially no confirmation from South Korea.
South Korea’s military, however, acknowledged the possibility of illegal border crossing to North Korea, according to reports by the national news agency Yonhap.
Investigations were carried out on some people.
North Korea called an emergency meeting of the Labour Party Politburo, chaired by Kim Jong Un, on Saturday due to the suspected case.
The "dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive disaster."
Kim ordered as a precautionary measure on Friday to “completely block Kaesong and isolate every district and region from others.”
The person concerned, as well as all people in Kaesong who had been in contact with her, were placed under quarantine.
The central military commission of the party is therefore to investigate the "outfall" as well as the behavior of the responsible military unit and, if necessary, to impose harsh punishment.
It is estimated that about 300,000 people live in Kaesong.
Tension ahead of Council meeting: City-East and noise protection still ahead of big summer break to be discussed
"In addition to environmental issues, the board members will also vote on the development plan for the large-scale inner-city development project East," it is said rather casually in the middle part of the municipal press release at the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, July 28, at 4.30 p.m. in the Great Hall of the CongressCentre Pforzheim.
In particular, the valuation of the eastern city is, however, controversial until the end.
The majority for this is scarce, most recently in individual committees even rejecting depending on the presence.
An appeal from the economy (construction, real estate, trade and IT), the project developed out of citizenship and then by administration and municipal council to now fail after almost ten years of preparation, project opponent Reinhard Klein criticized as "extra-parliamentary opposition", "unwittingly", "speculation", "defamation" and "conscious falsehoods".
"Everyone thinks they know better," says Klein, who has been a member of the municipal council for a year as the only representative of the Pforzheim citizens' list.
In fact, after reading the treaties, he was in this position: "I know what I'm talking about."
The exit will come cheaper the city, the Technical Town Hall is contrary to the statements of the city administration after subsidies, whose existence Klein is convinced to renovate for 8.5 million euros.
The city will develop quite differently from what is predicted in the town hall and on the part of the proponents from the economy.
Shaping the city by its own strength and not an investor: that was his plan B. One day after Klein, the FDP/FW/UB/LED faction, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
It essentially also provides for the renovation of the Technical Town Hall, the maintenance of the Schlossberg, the rental of the ex-Thale for administrative areas and a smaller-sized inner city remodel, ideally with local carriers.
Environmental issues play a central role
In addition, environmental issues in particular will play a central role.
Among other things, the municipal council will vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the Pforzheimer population from health-related noise pollution caused by road traffic, including often time reductions.
In a press release, the local Verkehrsclub Deutschland welcomes the widespread introduction of Tempo 30. However, the political leaders in the city are not innocent of the fact that this has to happen because they have only contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus the noise due to neglect of scheduled bus services with thinned bars and due to little commitment to bicycle traffic.
The municipal council also votes on the participation of the city of the energy and climate protection agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
It is also on the agenda of the accession to the climate pact of the state of Baden-Württemberg, the re-establishment of parental allowances in the municipal day care facilities and the application for admission to the federal smart city funding.
Citizens are welcome, but must heed corona protection measures.
Tim Zimmermann starts the new season with a lot of delay
With almost half a year of delay, Tim Zimmermann starts his premiere season in the ADAC GT Masters on July 31.
Before the league of super sports cars can start regular operation, the first test drives were now pending.
For Zimmermann, it was primarily about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3.
The corona crisis has long prevented Tim Zimmermann from taking on his first mission in the new Lamborghini Huracan from Grasser Racing.
Under special hygiene conditions, this was now possible.
The 23-year-old Langenargen made his first laps on the Lausitzring and was able to get used to his premiere in the GT3 car.
“There are already a few things that are different from the pre-season Porsche,” Zimmermann says.
"With the ABS, for example, you have to go differently in the curves.
But it really was a lot of fun."
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite his only 25 years of experience in GT sports, the Dutchman has been able to help his new team-mate in many things.
"I'm not a beginner in motorsport, but every new series brings new challenges," Zimmermann said.
"Steijn and I understand each other dazzlingly and we have also made tremendous progress from session to session at the Lausitzring".
It is precisely there – at the Lausitzring – that the GT Masters will also hold its first race.
Starting July 31, the 33 super sports cars will race through the Lusatia.
Zimmermann, who is one of 15 series newcomers, knows the route.
In 2015 he was last a guest at the Motodrom.
"It worked quickly and I had to get used to the track," says Zimmermann, who starts for the Friedrichshafen racing community Graf Zeppelin.
"The Lausitzring has a lot of fast passes that you have to hit optimally to be fast".
How fast Zimmermann really is then, it turns out in two weeks.
"Of course, the teams play a little bit of poker in the tests," he says.
"In the end, however, we are very satisfied and look forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring."
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a densely crowded calendar.
Seven races are scheduled until the beginning of November.
Currently, no spectators will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
In mid-August at the Nürburgring, former Formula 1 pilot Niko Hülkenberg will take on the GT steering wheel.
British Transport Minister Coldly Caught by Quarantine Decision
The UK government’s decision to quarantine Spain vacationers for two weeks after their return has, according to press reports, caught the country’s Minister of Transport cold.
Grant Shapps is currently on vacation in Spain, while his colleagues at home decided on the measure on Saturday.
Due to the rising corona numbers in Spain, the cabinet in London removed the country from the list of countries from which entry without quarantine is possible.
The new regulation will apply from today, Sunday, so Shapps will also have to be quarantined after his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures on returnees.
But the regulation applies to those who are just on the deadline holiday, only from Saturday, August 1, and was not introduced overnight.
Spain, by the way, is still considered one of the "safe countries" for which no quarantine is required in Austria.
"Numerous ministers may have known in advance that there is a possibility that a quarantine will be imposed on vacationers in Spain," Labour MP Diane Abbot said in a statement.
"But apparently no one has bothered to tell Grant Shapps".
Almost a month after the end of the corona crisis in Spain and the expiry of the strict curfew, the number of infections in the country is rising again.
Virologists, above all, blame nightlife for its renewed spread.
Spain is one of the UK’s favourite holiday destinations.
The UK government is currently discouraging unnecessary travel to the Spanish mainland, with the exception of the Canary Islands and Balearic Islands, which are particularly popular with British holidaymakers.
To date, more than 272,000 infections with the novel coronavirus have been registered in Spain and more than 28,000 have died.
Russia: Navy Day: Putin Announces Hypersonic Weapons for Warships
Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced on the day of the Navy in his country to equip the warships with state-of-the-art hypersonic weapons.
With these unique weapons in the world, the combat capabilities of the Russian naval forces would be expanded, Putin said on Sunday in St. Petersburg at the central naval parade.
The Ministry of Defence also informed the agency Interfax about successful tests of the navy-built hypersonic missile Zirkon.
The hypersonic weapons have a multiple of the sound speed of around 343 meters per second.
They are considered weapons of the future.
Underwater tropedeo continues to be built
It will also be built on the atomically equipped Poseidon underwater torpedo, it was said.
The planned seed drone is planned to destroy coastal targets.
The president, who also drove a military boat himself, said that 40 new ships would be put into service at the individual fleet associations of the largest country on earth this year alone.
Russia has such a large coastal area as no other country in the world.
For 300 years, the Navy has been reliably protecting Russia, Putin said on the day celebrated by sailors nationwide.
In many other Russian coastal towns, the naval forces also celebrated the Day of the Navy with parades.
In Syria, where Russia is fighting alongside Bashar al-Assad, the military demonstrated strength at a show of arms in the Mediterranean port of Tartu.
Ammunition was also fired there.
A video released by the Ministry of Defence showed not only warships, including a submarine, but also combat helicopters and jets.
Hurricane "Hanna" hits Texas: help made harder due to coronavirus
Washington - The first hurricane of this year's season across the Atlantic has landed in Texas.
Life-threatening floods, strong winds and heavy rains were now threatening parts of the U.S. state, the National Hurricane Center told the U.S. climate agency NOAA on Sunday night.
Governor Greg Abbott declared a state of emergency for many districts.
The Texas corona pandemic is making the work of the helpers more difficult, Abbott said, according to U.S. media.
Evacuated Called for Caution
"Every hurricane is a huge challenge," Abbott said, according to the Houston Chronicle newspaper.
Referring to the cyclone in Texas, he added, "This challenge is complicated and is exacerbated even more considering it's sweeping through an area that's the state's most heavily affected by Covid-19."
According to the Johns Hopkins University, around 5,000 people have died in Texas alone as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.
Abbott called for caution from people who had to leave their homes.
They should not disregard practices “to which we have become accustomed,” such as wearing masks, the governor said, according to CBS.
It is important that everyone stays away.
In some places, hotel rooms have also been provided.
In addition, emergency shelters should be tested for corona.
Damage was initially reported only from the coastal town of Port Mansfield.
Storm warning revoked
With wind speeds of up to 150 kilometers per hour, "Hanna" was hit on land on the island of Padre Island just off the Texas coast, according to authorities.
The tropical storm had previously been upgraded to a hurricane of the lowest level one.
For the coastal section from Port Mansfield to Sargent, a storm surge warning had first been issued and later withdrawn.
Authorities expected a weakening as "Hanna" moves further into the interior and heads for northeastern Mexico.
"Douglas" moves to Hawaii
In the Pacific, Hurricane "Douglas" was heading towards Hawaii on Sunday night with wind speeds of around 150 kilometers per hour.
The hurricane center, however, expected it to weaken further.
According to the forecast, it will be near the largest islands of Hawaii on Sunday (local time) - then as a storm just below the hurricane threshold.
Over the Atlantic this year, according to a May forecast, NOAA anticipated an above-average active hurricane season.
From June to the end of November, up to ten hurricanes are expected, of which up to six could be very strong hurricanes, the agency said.
On average, there are six hurricanes a year across the Atlantic, three of which evolve into storms of great force.
Given the climate data available and the higher water temperature in the Atlantic and Caribbean, the likelihood of a normal season is only 30 percent, and that of an under-average even ten percent, it was said at the time.
US President Donald Trump tweeted that his government is closely watching the storms and is in contact with the affected states.
Four goals dismissed: video assistant "punished" Sassuolo
Sassuolos Filip Djuricic was dismissed two goals
Naples - Four goals scored, four goals discarded: Sassuolo Calcio experienced a raven-black evening at 0:2 (0:1) at the SSC Naples in the Italian Serie A football league - and was really mad at the referee's video assistant.
"A festival not given goals for Sassuolo.
Never before has the VAR acted so hard against a team," commented the "Corriere dello Sport".
Host Naples had gone in the lead through a goal from defender Elseid Hisaj in the 8th minute, in the 32nd minute Filip Djuricic first cheered the equalization.
The Video Assistant Referee (VAR) took back the shot due to an offside position.
Five minutes later, Djuricic kicked the ball into the net again – the VAR intervened again.
The goals of attackers Francesco Caputo (50th) and Domenico Berardi (61st) also took back the referee team according to the VAR.
In the replay, Allan made the 2-0 finish for Naples and the bitter evening for Sassuolo perfect.
"The VAR is worse for Sassuolo than a radar trap on the road and punishes Sassuolo like no team before.
The new technology sets records," writes the "Gazzetta dello Sport".
FC Bayern Munich: Pavard injured
Munich (dpa) - The start to the hot preparation phase for the Champions League began for double winner FC Bayern with a setback.
Hansi Flick, who recovered "somewhat well" after a short break and a few training days, has to consider how he can rebuild his successful defense after the injury to world champion Benjamin Pavard.
The Frenchman, who is behind captain Manuel Neuer and midfielder Joshua Kimmich to show the third-most minutes of play, suffered a ribbon injury at the left foot root and threatens to be missing in decisive royal-class duels.
In Munich’s smut weather, the right-hand defender canceled a training game and was driven off the pitch with a golf map.
How long the unrestricted regular player has to pause in the fight for the title is open.
The 24-year-old can hope for the final tournament starting on 12 August in Lisbon, where he will play in the eighth-final rematch against Chelsea on 8 August.
However, the Bayern do not want to be stopped by the mishap from Sunday's training.
In his personal triple formula, Flick named the three attributes he wants to see from his stars on the way to Portugal’s capital.
Quality, intensity and concentration are to be demonstrated by his victorious title collectors in the ideally 28 days following until the King's Class Final on August 23.
"We have mastered the compulsory tasks with championship and trophy simply excellent.
Now we have to do something special," Flick said.
Until the Munichers can deal with the final tournament and before a training camp in the Algarve concretely, but for the first time, the eighth-final duty is against FC Chelsea.
After the 3-0 in the first game before the Corona break, the Londoners should not be in the home arena as in the lost "Finale dahoam" 2012 again to Bayern's nightmare.
“We have to go through the door first.
We want to win, create good conditions and build trust with a good game," Flick said.
A match test is scheduled for Friday against Olympique Marseille.
With a long speech, Flick had sworn his stars, who had 13 days off after the double, on a one-time August.
He welcomed 31 players on Säbener Straße, including Leroy Sané, who first met all new colleagues on the pitch after his transfer from Manchester City.
"Leroy, like all the new ones, has done well," Flick reported.
But instead of talking about the new season, when Sané & Co. is no longer allowed to only train, Flick much preferred to talk about the current title project of the German series champion.
After days of individual and small-group training, team strength training is now being trained for the Londoners, who are in the playing rhythm unlike the Flick ensemble.
After that, Munich could face FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi in the quarter-finals, while Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin are potential opponents in the semi-finals.
A way to the final in Lisbon "is not quite that easy", stressed the head coach, who from Tuesday can rely on the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training.
World Cup record scorers Klose and Flick know about so many common tournament preparations, which is particularly important in the 0-to-100 tuning.
With his current team, working is "a pleasure," Flick praised.
The "focus on winning" is an impressive feature of his team.
The tournament with nine teams was also ambitious on Sunday.
All of the performers were present, including the migratory Thiago and defender David Alaba, whose stay is not guaranteed beyond the king-class season.
Formula One Needs a Special Rule to Choose its World Champion
Since it is not possible to drive on the required number of continents, the FIA must improvise in order to award the World Cup titles.
All American races were cancelled.
The race calendar is becoming more and more concrete
The race calendar of the current Formula 1 season continues to take shape.
In addition to the ten confirmed Grand Prix, three more racetracks were added during the week.
In October, the Nürburgring will be held in Germany and Portimão, Portugal.
On November 1, Lewis Hamilton and Co. compete for World Championship points at the Italian traditional race track in Imola.
This means that the 2020 race calendar includes 13 races at the current level.
“We are delighted to continue to make great progress in completing our plans for the 2020 season,” said Formula One boss Chase Carey.
In total, 15 to 18 races in the king class of motorsport will be held in this exceptional season.
Formula 1 wants to finish their season in Asia.
The final race calendar will be fixed and published in the coming weeks.
Before the official races in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in December, according to media reports, there could still be appearances in Vietnam and Malaysia at the end of November.
Rules require races on three continents
Formula 1 regulations require at least races on three continents to be awarded the World Championship.
Even if, as currently planned, only two continents will be driven, there will be a world champion.
By means of a special rule, the FIA wants to award the titles citing "exceptional circumstances" due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The traditional start of the season in Australia in March had to be cancelled in the short term due to the impending corona crisis.
A return to the continent this year is not an issue.
In addition, Formula 1 will not be a guest in America this year.
Refusal in Brazil faces criticism
Due to the tense corona situation, the races will not take place in Canada, the US, Mexico and Brazil.
“We’re looking forward to being back with them next season,” Carey said.
The cancellation of the Americas race met with criticism, especially in Brazil: "The cancellation came as no surprise for us, but we cannot accept the reasons for it," said Tamas Rohonyi, promoter of the Grand Prix in São Paulo.
Infection rates in the São Paulo area are significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
The concerns of some teams about not wanting to drive in Brazil would also not justify a rejection.
Be prepared for the required security measures.
Greta Thunberg: A bad look at Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest on Stephen Colbert’s well-known Latennight show via video switch and revealed in an interview what she had in mind when she met Donald Trump.
Climate kivist Greta Thunberg was a guest on a popular US latenight show via video.
Among other things, she talked about her struggle against the world’s powerful.
The teenager also spoke about her famous “evil look” at her meeting with Donald Trump.
New York City - Over the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has drawn attention with her tireless commitment to the "Fridays For Future" movement.
Now she spoke in a well-known Latennight show about her plans for the future as well as her meeting with US President Donald Trump at the UN climate summit last year.
Latenight presenter Stephen Colbert welcomed 17-year-old Thunberg in your show on Tuesday and conducted a lengthy interview with the Swede.
She spoke not only about her fight against climate change, but also about her conflict with the world’s powers.
"There are some things that surprised me," she said.
"How far people go to divert the focus from the climate crisis," she said.
"Everything from organized hate campaigns to threats just because a group of children go to the streets," she said.
Heads of state and leading politicians who mock or even try to silence them on social media find them "funny" as they show the reactions "because they have no other answer to it".
It became particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was addressed to a well-known scene in which she threw a bitterly evil look at US President Trump.
At the 2019 UN climate summit in New York, for which the actress was sailing across the Atlantic, her expressive gaze was captured by the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the internet.
The short clip created a GIF, an animated image that eventually became one of the most commonly used images for Trump opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old think about the U.S. president at that moment?
To Stephen Colbert's relatively open question, she replied briefly and dryly: "To be honest, I don't think that needs any further explanation."
The experienced satirist Colbert had probably not expected the striking answer and disappeared briefly laughingly from the picture.
With her "How dare you?" speech on the principles of climate protection, she was remembered by many at the climate conference.
Ex-Dortmunder Immobile with three-pack for Lazio Rome
Ciro Immobile is now on par with Bayern’s Robert Lewandowski in the race for Europe’s Golden Shoe.
Former Dortmunder Ciro Immobile still has the best chance of becoming the goalkeeper king in the Italian football championship.
The former BVB professional contributed three goals in the 5:1 (1:1) victory of Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona, including two converted penalties in the replays of both halves.
This means that the 30-year-old from the table fourth two season games before the end now 34 season goals in his account - as many as Robert Lewandowski from FC Bayern Munich scored in the past Bundesliga season.
In Italy Cristiano Ronaldo followed with 30 goals so far, the Portuguese superstar met with the top rider in the evening at Sampdoria Genoa.
Fleetwood-Mac co-founder Peter Green has died
His life was like a rollercoaster ride: after a rapid ascent with Fleetwood Mac, it went steep downhill and then slowly back up.
Blues rock guitarist Peter Green has died at the age of 73.
Genius guitarist, drug junkie, cult fan: co-founder of the band Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, has died.
He died peacefully in his sleep at the age of 73, family members said in an official statement on Saturday that another statement would be announced for the next few days.
Top musicians such as Peter Frampton praised Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional response of a "monumental loss" for all former and current members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
The drummer Fleetwood and the guitarist Green had founded the band in London in 1967, until today his dreamy instrumental hit "Albatross" is unforgettable.
The musician's life ("The End Of The Game", "In The Skies") resembled a roller coaster ride.
With Fleetwood Mac, Green experienced a rapid rise - the band celebrated their greatest successes but then without him.
Among other things, there was a dispute because Green wanted to donate all of the group’s profits to charitable causes.
He began to appear in wide robes and with a large crucifix.
Mental problems have also played a role.
Already three years after its founding, Green left the band in 1970.
This was followed by a social decline.
The blues rock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, as biographers reported.
For a long time, Green was treated in psychiatry.
During most of the 1970s, the musician disappeared from the scene.
He was said to have lived on the streets, worked as a cemetery gardener, and spent some time in an Israeli kibbutz.
Green was born in 1946 to a Jewish working-class family in the Bethnal Green district of London.
From a young age, he was enthusiastic about US blues musicians such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
At the age of eleven, he learned the first guitar grips.
At the age of 15, the teenager began playing professional guitar and five years later got the chance to stand on stage as lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners.
Shortly afterwards, he was hired as a replacement for his idol Eric Clapton by the Bluesbreakers.
In the middle of the blues boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967 with his Bluesbreakers colleagues Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song "Albatross", composed by Green, gave the group the first number-one hit in the winter of 1968/69 and catapulted them to the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid rise soon showed his dark sides: Green did not tolerate the media buzz, his experiments with the drug LSD became increasingly extreme.
Life between music and addiction, he later commented in an interview: "The worst thing that has happened to me in life is the drugs - the best thing was to land a number one hit."
Towards the end of the decade, Green was surprisingly successful in 1979 with an album inspired by religious themes.
Fleetwood Mac, meanwhile, floated on a wave of success without him in a new formation.
Their 1977 album "Rumours" sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Despite several small solo successes, Green did not make a major comeback until 1996, when he re-started with a group of friends musicians.
The British Daily Telegraph spoke of a rock star who had returned to Earth.
Free of Drugs, Green released several albums with the Peter Green Splinter Group until the band disbanded in 2004.
For music experts, he was a blues legend during his lifetime – and with his gentle sound, one of the most influential guitarists of the past decades.
