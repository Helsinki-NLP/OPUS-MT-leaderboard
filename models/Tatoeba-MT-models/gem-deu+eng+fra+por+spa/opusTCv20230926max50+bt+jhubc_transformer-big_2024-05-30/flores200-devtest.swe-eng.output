It not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widespread, but also provides details that fossils often cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
The researchers say this animal’s plumage was chestnut brown on the top, with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the development of feathers in birds.
Since the dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, so-called coil, but have other feather characteristics – beams and beams – the scientists concluded that the coil was likely a later evolutionary evolution than these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers indicates that they were not used for flying but instead for temperature control or for display. The researchers suggested that the specimen shows an adult feather costume and not chicken down, even if the tail comes from a young dinosaur.
The researchers suggested that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult plumage and not young down.

With the help of brightness and rotation, the star's rossby number is determined, which has to do with plasma flows.
The lower the rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic inversions.

The work was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect that the team was looking for would be caused by forces reminiscent of tides in the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts attraction on Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The researchers were able to establish that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter does.
This theory says that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located in a kind of halo, and is made up of lots of tiny particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the extremely drug-resistant form of tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
"In an interview, he said the new variant was ""very disturbing and alarming because of the very high mortality level.""
Some patients may have been infected by the bacteria in the hospital, believes Dr. Moll, of which at least two were hospital staff.
During the year, an infected person can transmit the infection to between 10 and 15 close contacts.
On the other hand, it seems that the proportion of XDR-TB in the entire group of people with tuberculosis is still low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people infected at any given time in South Africa.

They are cooler than the surrounding surface of the day and warmer at night.
"Their thermal behavior is not as stable as large caves on Earth that often maintain a relatively constant temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that these are deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Surveys (USGS) team for astrogeology and at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and put a pre-printed sheet of paper with their chosen candidate in an envelope.
After officials have verified the identity of the voter, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the ballot paper.
French electoral legislation codifies the approach rather strictly.
Since 1988, the ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes at the start of the vote and that no envelopes are added except those duly counted from the eligible voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness each part of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers who are under extensive supervision, following specific procedures.

The accused are named as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki announced that the accused were present at the court with their faces covered.
Although three people were in the house when the car collided with it, none of them were injured.
The driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while the emergency services cut off the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrook Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged in the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court for murdering her son.
She is in custody pending prosecution and trial, but all eyewitness evidence can become useless because her image has been published on a large scale.
This is common elsewhere in the UK but Scottish law works differently and courts have considered the publication of photos as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University notes that ""journalists choose a dangerous line if they publish pictures etc. of suspects."""
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for prosecution, has informed journalists that no further comments will be made before prosecution.
According to the leak, the document deals with the border dispute, where the Palestinians want the borders to be based on them before the 1967 Six-Day War.
Other subjects reported include the future of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel requests ten years of constant military presence in the valley after an agreement has been signed, while the PA only agrees to leave such a presence for five years.
Hunters in the complementary pest control trial would be closely monitored by the park keepers, when the trial was observed and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, volunteers were recruited, under the Sporting Shooters Association hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Interim Director of Park Conservation and Culture at the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting mission received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members yesterday.
It is Martelly's fifth provisional election council in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former provisional electoral council as part of a package of measures to bring the country closer to new elections.
The Commission was Martelly’s response to the widespread protests against the regime that started in October.
The partially violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which have been due since 2011.
There have been reports of about 60 cases of misconstructed iPods overheating, causing a total of six fires and inflicting four people mild burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Commerce and Industry (Meti) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the units.
METI announced last week that Apple had informed of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "slight."
The ministry responded by calling Apple’s postponement of the report “very regrettable.”
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Rescue Service office said there were no injuries reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also announced that there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman has held tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as did the Philippine photographers.
The photographers later switched places with an elderly lady because she was in need of toilet visits. Mendoza was shot down.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began examining premature births during his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was given, it would accelerate the lung maturity of the fetus.
"Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two 'black boxes' on Wednesday."
Criminal colleagues also paid tribute to Luna.
"Tommy Dreamer said ""Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first boss. Luna died during the night with two moons. Pretty unique just like her. Strong woman."""
Dustin ""Goldust"" Runnels said in a comment that ""Luna was as big a freak as I ... maybe even bigger ... loves her and will miss her ... hopefully she's feeling better where she is now.""
Of the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, the number who opposed Australia’s becoming a republic had grown by 8% since 2008.
Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the campaign in the 2010 federal election that she believed that Australia should become a republic after Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of the participants in the survey share this view, that Queen Elizabeth II will be Australia’s last monarch.
At the extremes of the survey, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist would have swam the 100 m and 200 freestyle as well as three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his inconvenience, there have been doubts about his fitness.
He has not been able to take the medications needed to overcome his pain as they are banned in the competition.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, has discovered the largest known prime to date, on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery with different hardware and software at the beginning of February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water resources on Earth, along with organic matter, which can form proteins and sustain life.
Since comets collided with Earth a long time ago, scientists hope to understand how planets formed, especially how Earth formed.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and signed a bill last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
"He referred to the rumors as 'political bullshit and bullshit'."
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would mean flying shorter distances, saving millions of litres of fuel each year, and reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology unlike older ground radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No extra transport is put in, and trains over ground will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride stations are not available at ground level.
The fear of a lack of means of transport opened up the possibility that the match would have to be played behind closed doors without the team’s supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported on the formation of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process is believed to have taken much longer due to breeding between the endemic Darwin finch, Geospiza forte, and the immigrant Española finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be pulled to thin wire that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
"It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted images in books called ""enlightened manuscripts"".
This is called the pH value of a chemical. You can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
The juice from the cabbage changes shade depending on how acidic or alkaline (alkaline) the chemical is.
The PH value is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (because hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, then form them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel funny and form a kind of shell.
The towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet with flush in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman society, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women stayed together.
When you call someone hundreds of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and reflects it back down almost immediately.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts a little of our light and field of vision.
It takes a giant rocket of more than 30 meters to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing that the wheel has brought is to give us much easier and faster transport methods.
It has given us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Among them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antilopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including loose pet cats) that eat a much larger amount of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, a special job for every cat that keeps it away from rivalry with others.
Lions are the most social cats, and live in large groups called flocks.
Herds consist of one to three related adult males along with as many as thirty females and cubs.
The females are often closely related; a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lejob acts much like flocks of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also very lethal for their prey.
As a versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (but not good), swim, jump long distances and pull with five times the strength of a strong human being.
The tiger is part of the same group (the genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones who can roar.
The tiger's roaring is not like the lion's roaring, but more like a sentence of murmuring, screaming words.
Ozelotes like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ozelote hunts are much smaller than it itself.
Scientists believe that ozelots follow and find animals to eat (prey) through the smell, sniffing on the ground where they found themselves.
They can see very well in the dark with dark vision and also move very sneaky. Ocelots chase their prey by melting into their surroundings and then throwing themselves over the prey.
When a small group of living creatures (a small stock) is separated from the main stock from which they originate (for example, if they move across a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily get back), they often end up in a different environment than the one they used to be in.
This new environment has different resources and other competitors, so to be a strong competitor, the new population needs different features or adaptations than they needed before.
The indigenous population has not changed at all, they still need the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, they begin to look smaller and smaller like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans emit (that is, exhale).
Plants produce food using sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses out of plants and make our clothes out of plants. Much of the food we eat is plants. Without the plants, the animals cannot survive.
The Mosasaurus was at the top of the food chain during its time, so it had nothing to fear, except other Mosasaurs.
The long jaws were obsessed with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the palate, which meant there was no chance of escaping from anything that crossed its path.
We do not know for sure, but it may have had a split tongue; its diet included turtles, large fish, other mossaurs, and it may even have been cannibal.
It also attacked everything that came into the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex was no match for it.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their fair share of strange or unusual festivities such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a kind of rodent called hazel.
Another difference was that while the poor people and the woman ate their food while sitting in chairs, the rich men liked to have banquets together where they could lie half on the side while they ate their meals.
Ancient Roman meals may not have contained food that came to Europe from America or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, nor tomatoes, cocoa, or potatoes, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which was considered the home of the god.
People brought offerings to the gods and the priests tried to appease the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary to which only the priests had access.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziqqurater, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family took place outside.
Women cooked in the yard; shops were only open counters facing the street. Stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests, so wood was very precious.
In the Nordic fairy tales, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland as a punishment for murder, and that when he travelled west he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Although each country was Scandinavian, there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you’ve seen the movie National Treasure, you might think there’s a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although there is something on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
"On the back of the Declaration of Independence were written the words ""Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776"". The text appears at the bottom of the document, upside down."
No one knows for sure who wrote it, but we know that the large parchment (with dimensions of 75.6 cm x 62.2 cm) was rolled up for storage early in its existence.
So it is likely that the text was written there only as a label.
The landings on Day D and the subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
"It was ruled by the Vichy French, French people who agreed with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them."
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, the Americans and the free French forces had liberated southern France and turned against Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a significant large group of people living and working together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning citizens, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, which also somehow defines the size of society.
City-states are the forerunners of nations; a civilised culture means the transfer of knowledge between generations, a lingering cultural footprint and a fair spread.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical traces, and are not recognized as real civilizations.
During the American War of Independence, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government—with Congress as the sole component—according to the Confederate Articles.
Congress lacked all the power to impose taxes and, since there was no national executive power or judiciary, it fell on the authorities of the States, which were often uncooperative, to implement all its decisions.
It also had no authority to abolish tax laws and customs duties between states.
The articles required unanimous approval from all states before they could be added and the states attached so little weight to the central government that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football, along with the German football team, is the world's second most successful team and was champion of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller skate hockey and Formula 1.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
With its many islands, Japan is often considered an archipelago in a geographical sense.
Taiwan’s history dates back to the 15th century when European sailors who passed by registered the island’s name as Ilha Formosa, which means beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company founded a base in southwest Taiwan and initiated a transformation of the original grain production and hired Chinese workers to work on the rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas, and in 1885 Taiwan was declared a province by the Qing Empire.
After the defeat of 1895 in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Shimonoseki Conference, granting sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which then ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, Intihuatana, the Sun Temple and the Temple with the three windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they looked like in the original.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common format for still images in the world is 35 mm, which was the predominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still manufactured today, but more importantly is its aspect ratio inherited from the formats of photo sensors in digital cameras.
The 35-mm format is, somewhat confusing, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The page ratio in this format (divide by twelve to achieve the simplest whole-digit relationship) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (such as APS formats) correspond to this aspect ratio or are close to it.
The highly abused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamics while keeping a certain order in an image.
It is argued that the best placement for the subject is where the lines that divide the image into thirds meet vertically and horizontally (see the example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was examined.
For over a thousand years the Christian religion had united European states in spite of their differences in language and customs.
Its omnipresent power affected everyone from king to common man.
One of the main teachings of Christianity says that wealth should be used to mitigate suffering and poverty and that the money of the Church is for that very purpose.
The central power of the Church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money caused many to question whether this principle was fulfilled.
Shortly after the conflict broke out, Britain began a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective in cutting off necessary military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated widely accepted international law as codified in most international agreements over the past two hundred years.
Britain mined international waters to prevent all ships from crossing entire areas of the sea, making it dangerous even for neutral ships.
With a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unlimited underwater warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitude was pacifism and isolation in most residents and countries.
After seeing the horrors and cruelties of the wars during World War I, countries wanted to avoid such a situation recurring in the future.
Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 to work at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four cents in his pocket, a poetry book and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of distinguishing different periods of time; each stage of China’s history, or each family in power, was a distinct dynasty.
The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms, which took place between the 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, violent warfare was often waged between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest times in the history of ancient China when thousands of people died in battle to sit in the highest chair of the Grand Palace in Xi'an.
There were many social and political effects such as the use of the meter system, a transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not a single ruler.
Furthermore, the professions were opened up to all applicant men, allowing the most ambitious and successful to achieve success.
The same goes for the military, as rank in the army was now based on caliber rather than on class.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed people from the working class in other countries to make a revolution.
"Muhammad was deeply interested in subjects beyond his everyday life. He often used to visit a cave that became known as ""Hira"" on the ""Noor"" mountain (light) to contemplate."
The cave itself, which survived the passage of time, gives a very clear picture of Mohammed’s spiritual inclinations.
The cave, located on one of the mountain peaks north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find even if you know it exists. Inside the cave, there's total isolation.
Nothing can be seen except the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from the inside of the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only of the seven wonders that still exist today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Cheops Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor dead pharaohs.
"The Giza Plateau, or ""Giza Necropolis"" in the Valley of Death of Egypt contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several smaller tomb monuments, several temples, and the Great Sphinx."
The Cheops Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
"The "up-line" marker looks like a V and the "down-line" marker looks like a bracket or a square without a bottom side."
Up means you should start at the tip and push the string upwards, and down means you should start at the frog (where your hand holds the string) and pull the string downwards.
An upstretch usually generates a softer sound, while a downstretch is stronger and more resolute.
You are welcome to draw your own markings, but keep in mind that the printed line markings are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced back to Paris on 6 October 1789 from Versailles by a bunch of market women.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd screaming and shouting threats to the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep their carriage windows wide open.
On one occasion, one of the participants in the mob swung his head from an imperial guard killed at Versailles, in front of the terrified queen.
The war expenses for the conquest of the Philippines by American imperialism were paid by the Philippine people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover most of the cost and interest on bonds in the name of the Philippine government through the Wall Street banks.
Of course, the great gains resulting from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The period when events took place is often called the High Middle Ages period of European history during the 11th to 14th centuries.
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Old Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which formally ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses many different ideas in practice, from the fact that technology drives development or the technological imperative of the strict notion that human destiny is driven by a fundamental logic related to the laws of nature and how they are manifested in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have two general ideas in common: that technology development itself follows a path that is largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has ""effects"" on societies that are original, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that the motorized car inevitably leads to the construction of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically sustainable for just a small amount of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass ownership of cars also leads to a higher incidence of accidents on the road, leading to the invention of new technologies in healthcare to repair damaged bodies.
Romance contained a major element of determinism originating from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of romance, geography shaped individuals and over time customs and culture related to this geography arose, and these, which harmonized with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began to circulate around 400 AD and continued until about 1100 AD.
Its influence diminished during the 14th century mainly due to the fact that crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices valued higher than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 12th and 14th centuries.
In the beginning, clothing was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
However, due to the slow communication routes, styles in the West could lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the time as a result of the Crusades was that people began to use buttons to attach clothes.
Self-sufficient farming is farming that is carried out for the production of enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Self-contained agriculture is a simple, often organic, system that uses stored seeds from the ecoregion combined with rotational farming or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
Historically, most farmers operated self-sufficient farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel overlooked by society and let them find their identity.
Subcultures may be distinct due to members' age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender.
The characteristics that determine a subculture that is distinct may be of linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual or geographical nature, or it may be a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their belonging through a distinct and symbolic style choice, which includes fashion, manners and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to look at the few unfortunate cases of children who, by neglect, accident or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults during their growing up.
"Such children are called 'wild'. Some wild children have been enclosed by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child was due to the parents' rejection of a child's serious intellectual or physical disabilities."
Wild children may have experienced serious abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fleeing.
Others are said to have been reared by animals; some are said to have lived in the wilderness on their own.
When the wild child is raised entirely by non-human animals, it exhibits behaviors (within physical boundaries) almost entirely identical to the specific care animal, such as its fear of or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, support education goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but a support for individuals who learn something new, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of support, but it’s also the little gem-man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual support is internalized into the software and is meant to question, guide and explain methods that may have been too challenging for the learner to cope on their own.
Children are placed in foster homes for many different reasons, from neglect to abuse and even blackmail.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not fostering, caring or educational, but it happens.
We believe that the foster care system is a safe zone for these children.
Our family home system will provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable healthcare.
Foster homes are there to offer all the necessities that were missing in the home they previously came from.
The Internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive character traits of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of user theory.
"For example, ""learning"" and ""socialization"" are proposed as important motives for Internet use (James et al., 1995)."
"Also, ""personal engagement"" and ""continuous relationships"" were identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they examined audience reactions to websites."
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial expressions that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can determine whether a person is lying by interpreting microexpressions correctly.
"Oliver Sacks, in his paper, "The President's Speech," showed how people who can't understand speech because of brain damage can still judge honesty correctly."
He even claims that we share such knowledge in interpreting human behavior with animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two areas of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of pronounced variation.
Segregation and recombination shovel variations back and forth between the two poles for each new generation.
Out on the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans to satisfy its need for amino acids from the plants available.
In addition, a lack of this has serious consequences; inhibited growth, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been proteins found in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
In comparison, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest, but also offers high-quality proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
“After all, we shouldn’t be surprised if our own ancestors solved their ‘protein problem’ in much the same way chimpanzees in the savannah do today.”
Sleep interruptions are the process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep shortly thereafter (10–60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that brings you closer to consciousness without fully awakening you.
If you usually turn off the clock in your sleep, you can set it at the other end of the room, so that you have to get out of bed and turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known fluid driver) before sleep, making one have to get up and pee.
The amount of inner peace a person has correlates opposite to the amount of tension in their body and soul.
The lower the tension, the more positive the present life force. Each person has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has expanded with the path of love within the Mahayana and many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the all-encompassing way of love.
With kundalini yoga, the kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The yoga of God is central to Tibetan meditation. Through the visualization of various gods, the energy channels are purified, the chakras activated and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, leading to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. When the war ended, the differences in system, process and culture led to the collapse of the countries' cooperation.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would be physically fought by contract armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defences had already been broken and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, having invaded the eastern regions of Poland and at the same time violated the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
By far the most effective way to transport large quantities of people and goods across the seas is to use ships to transport goods.
The job of the fleets has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and goods, while interfering with the enemy's ability to move people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples was the North Atlantic Campaign during World War II. The Americans tried to move troops and materials across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, mainly with the help of submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain in the same way as the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes had them for milk, fur, meat and skin.
Domestic goats were usually kept in shelters that wandered on hills or other pastures, often picked by shepherds who were many times children or young people, similar to the more famous shepherd. These methods of grazing are still used today.
Tramways for wagons were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although carriageways consisted only of parallel wooden planks, the horses that dragged them allowed them to achieve higher speeds and to carry greater loads than on the slightly coarser roads of the time.
Grinders were introduced quite early to keep the grooves in place. However, it was gradually realized that the grooves would be more effective if they had a layer of iron at the top.
This became a practice, but the iron tore more on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. The first iron rails were introduced in 1767.
The first known mode of transport was hiking, people started walking upright two million years ago when Homo Erectus (meaning the upright man) saw the light of day.
Their predecessor, Australopithecus, did not have the habit of walking upright.
Bipedal specializations have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs already seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can engage in the environmental movement, and we can also become activists to reduce the future suffering to some extent.
This is in many cases as symptomatic treatment. But if we do not want just a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problems and deactivate them.
It appears with all clarity that the world has changed much because of the scientific and technological advances of humanity, and the problems have been exacerbated by overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humanity.
After it had been adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlap's printing house a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap broadsides."
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon on the farm at Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who had it read to his troops in New York on 9 July; a copy reached London on 10 August.
The 25 of Dunlap's broadsides that are known to still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The handwritten original has not been preserved.
Many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and still exist today. We call them birds.
Many people do not think of them as dinosaurs, because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things in birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1 and these numbers are called binary numbers - or bits to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning is not always immediately noticeable. Symptoms such as vomiting are too common for an immediate diagnosis to be made.
The best sign of poisoning can be an open jar of medicine or toxic household chemicals.
See the label for specific first aid instructions for that specific poison.
The term beetle is used in the formal sense by entomologists for this group of insects.
This term derives from ancient kinship with wall lice, insects that are sharply adapted to parasitize on humans.
Both predatory beetles and mosquitoes are residents, adapted to live in its host's nest or home.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to have MS than men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their interest, or in the best interests of their children, to raise a child.
These couples may choose to establish an adoption plan for their child.
During an adoption, the biological parents give up their rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method is guiding in almost all research.
However, it is not alone. To experiment, where an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, to ask questions and make observations, also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible written in Latin.
Aristotle's view of all scientific issues, including psychology, was accepted.
As knowledge of Greek diminished, the Western world found itself cut off from its Greek roots in philosophy and science.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend largely on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms that are not just reactions to external periodic signals have been documented in most living creatures, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
A biological clock is a self-propelled oscillator that repeats its cycle for a period even in the absence of external influence.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the main indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to plant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments that marked either the DNA of the substance with a radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the substance with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic material and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in reproductive cells can be inherited to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas with the purpose of experiencing the landscape, including its flora and fauna.
Examples of activities on site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching as well as visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing and learning more about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small rural towns in cars to go to their jobs and are passed by others whose destination for work is the place they just left.
In this dynamic shuttle service, everyone is somehow interconnected with, and supports, a transport system based on private cars.
Science now shows that this massive carbon economy has displaced the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human development for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, similar complaints about water quality or bridges are rarely heard.
Why do transport systems generate so many complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more basic happening?
Traffic flow is the study of how individual drivers and vehicles move between two points and how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows because pre-workouts cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
As is well, drivers tend to behave fairly consistently; thus, traffic tends to flow fairly consistently and can be presented in broad mathematical terms.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships have been established between three main variables: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These conditions are helpful in the planning, design and operation of facilities along the roads.
The insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly helped them to avoid the enemy more easily and to find food and partners more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along the body.
This gives them more small spaces where they can hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can’t fold their wings are dragonflies and day-liners.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system was moving around the sun.
Some people thought he was right but many believed the opposite; that the solar system was moving around the earth, including the sun (and also the other stars).
This seems reasonable, because it doesn’t feel like the earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the world’s most water-rich and second-longest river, and its water flow is more than 8 times the size of the second-largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, 9 km wide in some places.
20% of the water that flows into the oceans from the earth’s rivers comes from the Amazon.
The main stream of the Amazon is 6,387 km. It gets its water, and thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the stone pyramid construction continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids in Giza's size and construction technique were never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the new kingdom were astonished by the monuments of their predecessors, which at that time were well over a thousand years old.
Vatican City has about 800 inhabitants, the smallest independent country in the world and the lowest number of inhabitants.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and in official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
Humans have known basic chemical substances such as gold, silver and copper since ancient times, as these can be discovered in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle had a theory that everything consisted of one or more of a total of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four phases of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he had theories that they are switching to new substances to create what we see.
Alloys are a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that there are many different elements in the periodic table.
Substances such as calcium and potassium are counted as metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic substances such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them can fit in the point at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a faithful companion for many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, when newer writing methods have been developed, the pencil has gained lower status and fewer uses.
Today, people write messages on computer screens, and never need to get close to a pencil sharpener.
You can only wonder what happens to the keyboard when something new arrives.
The fission bomb is based on the principle that energy is required to produce a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Just like rolling a heavy wagon up a hill, splitting the core again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei and there is little need for them to decompose.
The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the left side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the lunar oceans and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more maria on the nearby side because the crust is thinner there, which made it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories revolve around finding out what gets people going or what appeals to them.
The theories claim that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they grow up.
These theories look at what makes some people want what they want and what in their environment it is that makes them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow’s need hierarchy and Herzberg’s two-factor theory.
"Generally speaking, two behaviors can appear when managers begin to lead their former peers. At one end of the spectrum, the manager tries to remain ""one of the gang""."
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, performing disciplinary actions, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities and keeping people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, you turn into an unrecognizable person who feels that he or she has to change everything that the team has done and make it their own.
After all, the leader is the ultimate responsible for whether the team succeeds or fails.
This behavior often results in gaps between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams maintain the same high standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members tend to act as a point of contact for the physical group.
They often have more to say about than conventional team members as different time zones can influence when their teams can meet and this may not be understood by management locally.
“The presence of a truly ‘invisible team’ (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.”
"The invisible team" is the management team to which all members report. The invisible team sets the standards for each member."
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organization? One goal of starting to use organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in an organization’s functional departments, creativity and ingenuity can thrive.
Therefore, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that meets the customer’s needs.
Before an organization can innovate, leadership must create an innovation culture as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the continuum approach as a method used to support organizations in achieving a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological information provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. Therefore, it makes the area of research narrower and much more accurate.
The correlation between brain disorders and behavior supports researchers in their research.
It has long been known that various brain injuries, trauma, diseases and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and examine brain structures and processes that we have not seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our mind.
Although AI is strongly associated with science fiction, it is a very important branch of computer science that involves machine behavior, learning, and intelligence.
Research in AI is about getting machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of this include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, and also recognition of handwriting, voice and face.
Such things have become separate disciplines, focusing on offering solutions to real-world problems.
The AI system is now widely used in economics, medicine, technology and the military, and has been built into several home computers and video game software applications.
Field studies are a major part of the teaching in each class. Often the teacher wants to take the students to places where there are no buses.
The technology offers solutions with virtual study visits. Students can look at museum objects, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art sitting with their class.
Sharing a study trip virtually is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students from Bennet school in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capital; the website is remade every year, but previous versions may be left online as a clipboard.
Blogs can also help improve student writing. Students often start their blog experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of readers improves this in general.
Since students are often the most critical readers, the blogger tries to write better to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging "forces students to become more aware of the outside world". The requirement to satisfy readers' interest stimulates students to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand learning far beyond the traditional school day.
"Adequate use of blogs ""can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to internet material, students can define their positions in relation to what others have written, as well as account for their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada’s charming bilingual capital and offers a range of galleries and museums that showcase Canada’s present and past.
Further south is Niagara Falls and in the north is Muskoka’s beautiful, unspoilt nature.
All this and more distinguishes Ontario with what outsiders consider to be the quintessential of Canada.
Large areas further north are very sparsely populated, and some are near uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: There are more African-Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent of its own in terms of fauna.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or belong to France, and are known as luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs also introduced Islam to the areas, which had a major impact in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century after the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama rounded the Cape of Good Hope and thus found the sea route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered to the north by the Sahel and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also good to wear a ring (not just one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can result in what they would consider harassment, and it is not uncommon for someone to follow you, grab your arm, etc.
Be firm when you say no to men and don’t be afraid to stand on you (cultural differences don’t make it okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 11th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenidians as a strategic port named Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name of Casa Branca. only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the town of Daru l-Badya which was renamed Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as tagine, ceramics, leather products, water pipes and a whole range of scrambles, but it’s all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the far east near the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially in the central parts.
Goma is fairly safe, but if you want to visit outside of Goma, you should investigate what it looks like with the fighting in the northern Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano along with some of the cheapest tracks of mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around in Goma. The normal (local) price for the short trip is about 500 Congolese francs.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic, distant places.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, but its reputation makes it a tourist destination, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the World Heritage List due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the major stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS program Wonders of the African world.
The city stands in stark contrast to the other cities in the country, with an atmosphere that is Arabic rather than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and extends along the border of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, while the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which houses different wildlife.
It is one of the largest attractions in South Africa and it is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all other South African national parks, the park charges daily conservation and admission fees.
It can also be beneficial to buy a Wild Card, which either gives access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and is the place that many tourists regard as the main focus.
The successive buildings that make up Hong Kong’s silhouette have been likened to a glittering bar chart enhanced by the waters of Victoria’s harbour.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to Kowloon’s lakeside opposite.
The vast majority of the settlements on Hong Kong Island are tightly packed on the former seabed along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonists took over, so if you’re looking for evidence of the area’s colonial past, this is a great place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km into Bangladesh and the Indian interior from the coast.
Sundarbans has been adopted on the UNESCO World Heritage List. The part of the forest located on Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just mangrove swamps —they contain some of the last remaining sites of the great jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
Sundarban covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about a third consists of wetlands.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife reserve, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 axis deer in the area.
Buses depart from the district bus station (over the river) all day, but most, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang, run between 6.30 and 7.30.
Since buses between the districts are often full, it is a good advice to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and stable.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a cable bridge that crosses the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise 83 meters up, it is 378 meters long and has two corridors that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical free height under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs stations are expected to be ready.
Guaraní was the most important indigenous group that inhabited present-day eastern Paraguay and lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was populated by other groups of native tribes such as Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived as hunters, collectors and fishermen.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called "India's giant province", was born as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and groups of the indigenous people.
The Spaniards began the period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its native character and identity.
Argentina is well known for its polo teams and players being among the best in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo courts in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For tournament news and where to buy tickets for polo matches, please contact Asociacion Argentina de polo.
The official Falkland currency is the Falkland Pound (FKP) whose value corresponds to the value of a British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
GBP is generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and within Stanley it is often possible to pay by credit card and USD.
Credit cards will probably not be accepted on the remote islands, but UK and US currencies may be accepted; contact the owners in advance to determine what is an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone; during the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common
Winter can be deceptively cold: the temperature rarely drops below zero, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer says.
"There are no special 'rainy' and 'dry' seasons: the rainfall remains roughly the same throughout the year."
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, you should stay at least 100 meters from bears and wolves and 25 meters from all other wild animals!
No matter how docile they look, bison oxen, moose, candace deer, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they did not keep adequate distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Also, keep in mind that odors attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking food that smells and keep the camp clean.
The capital city of Samoa is Apia, located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been Samoa’s official capital since 1959.
The port was the scene of a notorious deadlock in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk, except one British cruiser, nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the independence campaign organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the assassination of the supreme chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches due to Auckland's location between two ports. The most popular beaches are divided into three areas.
North Shore's beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches where it is safe to swim, and on most Maori myrtle offers shade.
Tamaki Drive’s beaches are located on Waitemata Harbour, in the exclusive suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes well-visited family beaches with a good selection of shops located on the beach. Swimming is safe.
"The main local beer is ""Number one"", which is not any complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called ""Manta"".
There are many French wines, but the New Zealand and Australian wines might do the trip better.
The local drinking water is completely safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you are worried.
"For Australians, the idea of "flat white" coffee is unknown. A ""short black"" is ""espresso"", cappuccino has a pile of cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk."
The hot chocolate milk meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
There are many trips to the reef all year round and damage due to any of these causes on the reef is rare.
Nevertheless, take the advice of the authorities, obey all signs and be very attentive to safety warnings.
Cub jellyfish occur near beaches and near estuaries from October to April north of 1770. They can sometimes also be found at other times.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and would swim away.
The main habitat of the saltwater crocodile is in the estuaries north of Rockhampton, so they usually do not live in the sea.
Booking in advance provides the traveller with security and a guarantee that they will have somewhere to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but it may be possible to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies often offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, and even packages combining flights and hotels.
They can also reserve your booking for you if you need time to reconsider the offer or obtain additional documents required for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, all changes and requests should go through the travel agent first, and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of music festival visitors decide to camp on site, and most visitors see it as an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to where things are happening, you need to arrive early to get a campsite close to the music.
Remember that even though the music performances on the main stage have ended, parts of the festival may continue to play music until late into the night.
Some festivals have special campsites for families with young children.
If you are crossing the North Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, as walking through ice causes really horrible sounds for those most affected.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (see terms and conditions).
Casinos usually do everything they can to get guests to spend as much time and money as possible. There are often no windows or clocks, and the exits are often hard to find.
They usually have special offers of food, drink and entertainment to keep guests in good spirits and make them stay in the premises.
Some establishments offer alcoholic beverages for free. But intoxication worsens judgment, and all good players know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone who is going to drive at high latitudes or over mountain passes should be aware that snow, ice and temperatures below freezing point may occur.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is low and you can’t drive the same way as on bare asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall in a very short time for you to get stuck.
Visibility may also be limited by snowfall or snowfall or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues almost uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the largest tourism industry in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to trips across the country to see the amazing African wildlife, especially on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars and with standard equipment it is possible to see them well.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you can see them better with binoculars.
"Walking safari (also called "bush walk" and "hiking safari") consists of hiking either for a few hours or for several days."
The Paralympics will run from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations around Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to host two Summer Olympics, as it hosted the 1964 Games.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the launch was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
The cancellation policies due to the coronavirus look different, but by the end of March, most will not reach as far as July 2020, when the Olympic Games should have started.
It is expected that most tickets to events will cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with a typical ticket price around 7,000 yen.
Ironing moist clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board that can be borrowed, even if it is not in the room.
If no iron is available, or if you do not want to wear socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if one is available at hand.
Be cautious and do not let the fabric get too hot (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burning).
There are different sets to clean water on, and some are more effective against specific hazards.
In some areas it is enough to boil the water for one minute, in others it takes several minutes.
Filters can vary in efficiency, and if you are unsure then you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from an established company.
Travelers may encounter pests they are not familiar with from their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or in the worst case allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force, are usually not classified as pests.
Tax-free shopping is the possibility to buy goods without tax or other surcharges in certain places.
Travelers on their way to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable sum, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The route between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, which often runs through isolated jungle terrain.
If you’re not used to driving on country roads, drive wisely: steep slopes, narrow lanes and narrow curves are common.
Set speed limits are noticeably lower than in previous and subsequent sections - usually 56-64 km/h (35-40 mph) - and that they are followed is even more important than otherwise.
Strangely enough, mobile coverage is much better here than along many other routes, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are really good, and in Bavaria they are quite powerful and varied, similar to those from the neighbour in the south, Austria.
Pastry with fruit is common, with apples baked in pastries all year round, as well as cherries and plums during the summer.
Many German pastries also have almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Popular cakes often go particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small but powerful pastries, you can try what, depending on the region, is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with either meat or vegetables.
"A curry can be either ""dry"" or ""humid"" depending on the amount of liquid."
In northern India and the inland regions of Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry dishes; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a collective name that includes a wide variety of regional cuisine spread across the country.
However, if used without a definite word, the term tends to mean the food that originally came from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine, now available throughout the archipelago, offers an array of simply spiced dishes, where the flavorings most commonly used by the Javanese are peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are support for the rider's feet that hang down on both sides of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider but can pose a safety risk as the rider’s feet can get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown by a horse but is stuck with one foot in the ladder, he can be dragged if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.
First, most riders have heeled boots and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
Then some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety rods that ensure that a ladder bar is released from the saddle if it is pulled back by a rider falling off.
The Cochamó Valley, Chile’s top destination for climbing, is known as South America’s Yosemite, and has a number of large granite cliffs and walls.
Climbers from all corners of the world are constantly creating new routes among the countless mountain walls.
Skiing, which includes skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports where you glide down a snowy landscape with skis or a snowboard tied to your feet.
Skiing is an activity that attracts many enthusiasts, sometimes called "ski lovers", who plan the entire holiday trip around skiing in a particular area.
The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings depicting skiers are dated as far back as 5,000 BC!
Skiing as a sport has been around since at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: this activity is also called backcountry skiing, hiking or skiing.
It is related to but usually does not involve alpine skiing or mountaineering, the latter being performed in steep terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as on a similar hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you’ll be able to handle a little more distance than when walking – but you’ll rarely get up to speeds like cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack in prepared tracks.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small, but with many independent countries; under normal circumstances, travelling through several countries would mean having to go through visa applications and passport controls on several occasions.
However, the Schengen area acts somewhat like a country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can generally cross borders without undergoing passport checks again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa in each Schengen member state separately, saving you both time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what manufactured items are antiques. Some tax agencies define goods older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limits may be shorter in, for example, North America than in Europe.
Craft products can be defined as antiques, although they are not as old as similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood among the Sami people and the culture surrounding trade is important for many with other occupations as well.
Even historically, however, not all Sami people have been involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry, but lived from fishing, hunting and the like and used the reindeer mostly as migratory animals.
Today, many Sami people work in modern industries. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the area of the Sami people.
Although often used, especially among non-Romanesque, the word "Gypsy" is often considered offensive because of its associations with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about Romani people.
If the country you are visiting becomes subject to a travel restriction, your travel health insurance or your cancellation protection may be affected.
You may also wish to consult governments other than your own, but their advice is designed for their own residents.
For example, for American citizens in the Middle East, there may be different circumstances compared to Europeans or Arabs.
A travel advice is just a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The image presented is often quick, general and simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Extreme weather is the general term for all hazardous weather phenomena with the potential to cause injury, serious social disturbance or the loss of human life.
Difficult weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different variants of them, which can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy rainfall and wildfire are types and consequences of extreme weather, as well as thunderstorms, tornadoes, skyscrapers and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include fierce snowstorms, thunderstorms, ice storms and sandstorms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of the risk of harsh weather affecting their area, as it can affect their travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that can be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
"A search on the Internet for ""hostile environmental education"" will probably give the address of a local business."
A course usually goes through all the issues mentioned here in much more detail, usually with practical exercises.
A course normally lasts between 2-5 days and includes role-playing, very first aid and sometimes weapons training.
There are plenty of books on how to survive in the wilderness, while books about war zones are rare.
Travelers planning gender-correcting surgery abroad must ensure that they hold valid documents for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without a specified gender (X) or documents that are updated to match a desired name or gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to accept these documents varies just as much.
Security check searches have also become much more intrusive in the post-11 September 2001 period.
Transgender people who have not undergone surgery should not expect to be able to pass through the X-ray inspection with integrity and dignity.
Rip currents are the returning flow of waves breaking off at the shore, often at a reef or similar.
The topology underwater allows the reflux to be concentrated into a few deeper parts, and strong currents leading to deep water can be formed there.
Most deaths occur as a result of exhaustion after trying to swim back countercurrently, which may be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, it’s no more difficult than normal to swim back.
Try to aim somewhere where you don’t get stuck again or, depending on your skills and whether you’ve been spotted, wait to be saved.
The return shock comes earlier than the culture shock (there is not as much of a honeymoon phase), lasts longer and can be more serious.
Travelers who have had an easy time adapting to new cultures sometimes find it difficult to re-adapt to their original culture.
Upon your return from living abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and lost some of the habits of your home culture.
When you first traveled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, because of the knowledge that travelers in a new country have to adapt.
People may not expect that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning home.
The Pyramids sound and light show is one of the most interesting things for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the performance begins.
Usually you always hear the sounds of tourists and sellers. The sound and light story is just like a fairytale book.
The background is the Sphinx, which tells a long story.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids, and the various pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries, and they have the most bases, sixteen of which will be active by 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island with the community of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception where the flooded crater of an active volcano forms a spectacular natural harbour.
Ellsworth's land is the region south of the peninsula, and borders the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula merge here with the plateau and then reappear to form the 360-kilometre Ellsworth mountain range, which is split by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or Sentinel Range has Antarctica's highest mountain, the Vinson Massif, with a highest peak at 4,892 m in Mount Vinson.
In remote locations without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone generally does not replace a mobile phone, because you have to be outdoors with a clear line of sight to the satellite to be able to make a call.
The service is often used by ships, including pleasure boats, as well as expeditions in need of remote data and voices.
Your local telecom operator should be able to provide you with more information on how to connect to this service.
Traveling and learning is an increasingly popular option for those planning a free year.
This is especially popular among recent graduates, which allows them to take a year off before university without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a sabbatical course abroad can actually increase your chances of entering higher education in your home country.
Usually a fee is charged for registering on these educational programs.
Finland is very boat-friendly. The land of the thousand lakes also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the archipelagos.
In the archipelago and the lakes, you do not necessarily need a yacht.
Although the archipelagos and the largest lakes are really big enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak can offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with a boat on every seventh or eighth person.
This is matched by Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the figure is one in forty).
Most of the specifically Baltic cruises include a longer stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for a couple of full days while returning to and sleeping on the ship at night.
If you only land with ship excursions, you do not need a separate visa (from 2009).
Some cruises include the German capital Berlin in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not close to the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Travelling by air can be a frightening experience for people, regardless of age and background, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It is nothing to be ashamed of: it is no different from the personal fear and aversion to other things that very many people have.
Understanding how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can help some people overcome a fear that is caused by discomfort in the face of the unknown or by lack of control.
Courier companies are well paid to deliver things quickly. Often, time is very important when it comes to business documents, merchandise or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, the larger companies have their own aircraft, but for other routes and smaller companies there was a problem.
If they have sent things by air freight, on some routes it may have taken several days to go through unloading and customs.
The only way to get it faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airlines rules do not allow you to send baggage without a passenger, and this is where you get into the picture.
The obvious way to fly in first class or business class is to cash out a whole lot of money for the privilege (or even better, let your business do it for you).
However, this does not come at a cheap price: as a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy price for business and eleven times for first class!
In general, it makes no sense to even look for discounts for business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
The airlines are well aware that there is a certain core group of travelers who are willing to pay well for the privilege of traveling somewhere quickly and comfortably. The companies also charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chi<0xC5><0x9F>in<0xC4><0x83>u. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is common.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any of the member states of the United Nations.
Economic relations have been reestablished between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
<0xC4><0xB0>zmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of around 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transport hub.
The city, which in historical times was called Smyrna, is today a modern, developed city and a lively commercial center located at a huge harbour surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, buildings with glass facades and modern shopping malls are mixed with traditional red tiled roofs, the 18th-century market and ancient mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere that is more like Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers a view of the nearby island of Eysturoy, and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery there are interesting marble statues of pigeons over some of the tombs.
It is worth wandering around half an hour in the captivating village.
Within reach of the north is the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which became famous among foreigners after a shimmering account of its grandeur by Lord Byron.
Scotturb bus 403 runs regularly to Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
In the north, also visit the stunning Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, a place world famous for the revelations of Mary.
Remember that you are actually visiting a mass grave site and a place that has an almost incalculable significance for a significant portion of the world’s population.
There are still many men and women still alive who survived their time here, and many more who had loved ones who were murdered or worked to death here; Jews as well as non-Jews.
Use the site with the great dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Don't joke about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not vandalize the site by painting or scraping graffiti on structures.
Barcelona's official languages are Catalan and Spanish. Approximately half prefer to speak Catalan, an overwhelming majority understand it, and virtually everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only in Catalan, as by law it is the primary official language.
However, Spanish is also used in many places in public transport and other institutions.
Common messages in the subway are made only in Catalan, but unplanned interference is announced by an automated system in a variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude and arrogant.
"Although this is often just a false stereotype, the best way to cope in Paris is still to behave in the best way and behave like someone who is ""bien élevé"" (well-educated). That will make it much easier to get around."
The brusque exterior of the Parisians will quickly disappear if you show yourself from your polite side.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is infested with dense forests, the main seedling of beech, fir and pine, and has a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a strikingly large species richness, due to the extent of microclimate, different soils and varying height differences.
The area is also home to an extreme diversity of animal and bird species.
Rare animal species such as European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat and jackal are found there, along with many more common species
When visiting the monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover their knees, and also have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries give shawls to women who have not prepared themselves in advance, but if you bring your own, especially one with bright colors, you get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
According to the same logic, men must dress in pants that cover their knees.
This can also be borrowed from the warehouse at the entrance but those garments are not washed after every person so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all applies to men!
Majorcan food, like that in similar areas around the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil throughout.
A simple, popular dinner, especially during the summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato, and optional available accessories such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as Sie for the pronoun ni, are written in capital letters, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important method of distinguishing between certain verbs and objects.
According to some, it also makes it easier to read, although the need to find out if a verb or adjective is in noun form makes writing a bit more complicated.
The pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written
The letters to watch out for are c and g, as their pronunciation varies on the basis of the following vowels.
Also, make sure to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means dear, while carro means carriage.
Persian has relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this basic grammar book can help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and understand sentences better.
It will of course be easier for you to learn Portuguese if you already know a Romance language.
But people who know a little Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that it does not need to be studied separately.
Pre-modern observatories are usually outdated today and remain as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution during their heyday was not the kind of problem they are today, they are usually found in cities or on university campuses, easier to reach than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote locations with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Hanami, or the view of the cherry blossom, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China where plum flowers were used.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom feasts were held by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants look best in their natural environment, so try to resist the temptation to remove "only one" specimen.
"If you visit an arranged garden, and you pick a ""specimen"" it will also get you thrown out, without discussion."
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to stay and very easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything after arrival.
“But with its location in the ‘high tropics’ just a few degrees north of the equator, you have to deal with both heat (always) and strong sunshine (when the sky is clear, more rarely).”
There are also a small number of buses going north to Hebron, the traditional cemetery where the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives rest.
Make sure the bus that you are thinking of taking goes to Hebron, and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good starting point to base a vacation around.
For example, visit castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley or take a boat trip to interesting cities on the Danube or a trip along the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the weekend traditions have also been taken up by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night awake at some open space to see the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold a Passover Mass on Saturday night during the Easter weekend. At midnight, the congregation then sets out to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here by either swimming, flying or floating.
Due to the long distance from the continent, mammals could not cross, and therefore the giant tortoise became the primary grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since humans came to the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctica in winter, you will experience polar nights, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to see the northern lights, as the sky is dark more or less around the clock.
Because the areas are sparsely populated, and light pollution is therefore often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the starry sky.
The Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners may be accustomed to.
Costume is the normal business dress, and colleagues address each other by last name or by job title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, where the emphasis is placed on the joint efforts rather than highlighting the achievements of individuals.
Workers often have to get the approval of their superiors for all decisions they make and are expected to follow the instructions of their superiors without hesitation.
