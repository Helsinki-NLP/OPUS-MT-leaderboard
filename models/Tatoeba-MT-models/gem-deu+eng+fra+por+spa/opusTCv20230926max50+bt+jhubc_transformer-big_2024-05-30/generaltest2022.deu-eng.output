The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the goods....
I am #PRS_ORG# major customer and so it is no problem for me.
Just need a number or instruction what I should include in the package so that it can be tracked by you as a return.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>.
Today it costs $179.
I honestly find that very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and re-order for the better price or is there another way to get credit?
I also believe that children should not be forced to assume a parental role for their younger siblings.
However, I think it is also good for big siblings to take care of the little ones in moderation.
Let's take a look, let's help, let's bring the bottle, etc.
In this way, they learn responsibility, help in the family and are involved.
As long as they can still be enough children, I see no problem.
If your K1 is busy on its own for a short period of time and it is OK for it, that’s good.
You can best judge for yourself if this is suitable for your children.
It is not that he should wrap K2 and accompany him for hours when he falls asleep.
Legally, it’s probably questionable.
Perhaps that’s why the psychologist’s statement comes.
Because if something should actually happen like a fire, collapse, earthquake, alien invasion, etc. it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take is, of course, your discretion ;)
Please help me find the title of a book.
I remember reading a crime / thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the whole story, but I don't want to think of the title altogether anymore maybe someone here knows...
The story was about fear and treating it.
At the beginning of the story, a pet caregiver commits suicide by pouring himself food and going into the enclosure with his predators.
The case is taken over by a commissioner who, after brief investigation to his therapist, runs a clinic where he treats anxiety patients.
The Commissioner has a little niece who also has a fear (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is asked anonymously before each suicide to go to the site of the suicide and document and put the photos on the internet.
In any case, it turns out that this therapist operates a kind of underground therapy group where the patient is transplanted a chip that suppresses an anxiety center in the brain and ultimately allows the patients to face their anxiety in the most extreme way.
(One woman jumps out of the window another drives herself with intent to death)
This is called “the fight” in the book.
In the end, there is a big showdown at the clinic that had to do with a fire.
That’s the rough plot I’m pretty sure the book in the original was written by a French author/author.
If this story is known to anyone or even if someone can tell me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
I don't have the password for the Wi-Fi.
I need to contact my husband first.
But it may take a while.
What steps do I have to take afterwards?
Is it possible to get the price difference back?
Child, 4 years, Splitter under the thumbnail
Child, four years, has wooden splinters under the thumbnail (outside) over the entire length.
I tried to pull him with a tweezer.
Very hard to grasp.
It didn't work and it hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No more chance.
Tomorrow we go to the doctor.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
Due to the combination of digital decoder and sound module on a printed circuit board, we achieve dimensions of only 30mm x15.5mm and can therefore be installed in almost any locomotive of track widths H0 and 0.
LokSound 5 decoders are offered with all common interfaces and always come with a 11x15mm large "sugar cube" speaker as well as sound capsule kit.
Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a true multi-protocol decoder.
He has mastered the DCC data format as well as Motorola<0xC2><0xAE>, Selectrix<0xC2><0xAE> and M4.
In the DCC format, 14 to 128 driving steps are as natural as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus<0xC2><0xAE>, the decoders log in to a suitable digital center fully automatically.
It masters all DCC programming modes and thanks to RailCom<0xC2><0xAE>, the CV values can be read out on the main track with matching centrals.
For centrals that can only program the CVs of 1-255 exist auxiliary registers.
Motorola<0xC2><0xAE> users benefit from up to 28 speeds at 255 addresses.
Three additional Motorola<0xC2><0xAE> addresses allow the triggering of 16 functions.
A built-in programming mode also enables reprogramming with the venerable Control Unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows automatic login to mfx<0xC2><0xAE>-compatible control centers.
The LokSound 5 Decoder detects the Märklin<0xC2><0xAE> brake tracks as well as the ZIMO<0xC2><0xAE> HLU brake commands or the Lenz<0xC2><0xAE> ABC system.
Braking with DCC brake blocks or with DC voltage is also possible.
In addition, it also stops with a Selectrix<0xC2><0xAE> brake diode.
An ABC commuter train automatic allows automatic commuting between two stations.
The LokSound 5 decoder can be used on analog direct and alternating current paths.
After my voucher is no longer extended due to a complaint that has not arrived with me, I will renew my order in the value of approx.
Remove #NUMBER#<0xE2><0x82><0xAC> from my shopping cart and order elsewhere, where the customer friendliness is higher and I don't have to tap my fingers to achieve nothing at all!!

Omikron: Johnson Wants to Promote Rejuvenation
New omikron cases are getting politics and science in the UK.
By New Year, all qualifying adults in England should therefore receive a vaccine offer.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to advance even faster than previously targeted in the corona upheavals in the face of rapidly rising omikron numbers.
Every adult in England should be given the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year if at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson told his compatriots in a pre-recorded video message on Sunday evening.
So far, the target date was at the end of January.
The UK government will provide additional support to accelerate vaccination campaigns in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland as well.
Faced with the Omikron variant, one faces an emergency, which is why vaccination protection needs to be strengthened urgently, Johnson said.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third dose of vaccine.
"Let's get boosted now!" said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1,239 more omikron cases were registered in the UK, bringing the total number to 3,137.
Compared to the previous day, this was a tremendous increase of 65 percent. dpa
Will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price upon collection?
I am in favor of everyone introducing themselves with pronouns
I sent you an application.
Today I received an invitation to an interview by email.
I want to reply to the email.
But unfortunately the name is not a "Peter", but a slightly more complicated name.
I have Googled him and depending on where he/she has a cultural background it is either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can someone please help me?
** I am a foreigner and do not want to step on an official.
Conclusion: everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books.
4 of them.
Only the one I bought today can't
Obviously, the chair had an unseen shortcoming in the sale.
How else can such a padding damage occur after 9 months?
First tried on the #PRS_ORG#.
But it has been working since ca.
14 days no more.
That’s why I always bought the last books through the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8.
However, there were no more.
Now they are available again and I want you to please add 2 chairs to the order and bill me that.
[CW] The feeling when I can't help.
Content Warning: I’m going to write something in detail about domestic violence here.
I just need to write something about my soul.
I (21) am more likely to come into contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons.
A topic that really nags at me and unfortunately happens far too often is that many victims can’t be helped or think we couldn’t help them.
It is clear to me that we cannot do everything and that it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than if I can’t do anything in such situations.
I see the bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in private conversation, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing, I can’t reach everyone.
I don’t know what the reason is, maybe it’s fear of revenge, fear of leaving the usual social environment, fear of snatching the children out of it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, partly even very close to the tears, is that everyone is worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don’t just have to accept violence.
Often I wish I could help in any case... I know I can’t.
But it never gets easier.
Please, always remember that you are worth living without violence, which is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What is the series worth to "League of Legends"?

Basketball Bundesliga: Derby debacle of the MHP giant Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim
At least the younger John Patrick was trusted.
Nothing again: For the second time in less than three months, the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the match, Ludwigsburg coach John Patrick had said with a look back at the trophy defeat at Hakro Merlins Crailsheim at the beginning of October: "We still have some anger in our stomachs".
However, after the match, it did not go down - but increased again in view of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.
Even more than the naked result disappointed the way the show was performed.
A statistic that expresses the whole dilemma should be mentioned: The three-way quota was just 13 percent, 4 hits (all from young Johannes Patrick) in 31 attempts - still questions?
John Patrick responded, "We weren't focused enough after the win at Tenerife and haven't implemented what we've trained."
To move the ball.
His response to Sebastian Gleim was quite different: "To win a great game for the second time against Ludwigsburg," said the lucky coach.
"It felt like before 10,000 people".
On Saturday, only 750 visitors were admitted to the Hohenlohe Arena, but they came at their expense.
Not least also because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who marked 22 points and steered the game of his team.
"The best game maker I've ever trained," Gleim praised.
While in Patrick’s team even the performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed on the whole line.
Only in the last quarter (22:15), the giants prevented a total debacle and came up to eight points after already 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon scored 12 points.
Fortunately, there is not much time left to hate.
Already on Wednesday (7 pm) the giants receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, before then also in Ludwigsburg a maximum of 750 spectators.
We used to have a different email address, but I changed it.

Max Raabe is 59 years old.
He is able to inspire his audience with reinterpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
He is currently on the road with the program "Good day, dear happiness" - if he is allowed to perform.
Actually, Max Raabe would have wanted to celebrate his birthday this Sunday on the stage in Leipzig.
But that doesn't turn into anything.
The planned concert has been relocated to May 2022 - "on official instruction" to curb the corona virus.
Other of his concerts scheduled for the Advent season also have to happen, as it is said on the website of the singer, who now turns 59, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January onwards, the artists want to catch up on their deadlines already postponed in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe sang a lot as a teenager.
In Berlin he studied opera singing, in 1986 he founded the Palast Orchester together with fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established itself with its repertoire of percussionists and chansons in the style of Comedian Harmonists.
He has been awarded many awards.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) - just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013) - reached second place on the charts.
He made it out of the niche into the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, the blonde hair strictly combed back and cared for etiquette, Max Raabe can no longer be thought away from the current German-speaking music landscape.
With the program "Good day, dear luck" he has been on tour since 2020. dpa

Federal Minister of Construction Klara Geywitz: Expropriation does not create a new apartment
The new Federal Minister of Construction Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing corporations, as was demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
"With an expropriation, not a single new apartment is created, only the ownership structure changes," Geywitz said in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants certainty that their rent will remain affordable over the next few years.
A colourful mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives or housing companies is the best protection against monopoly formation.
In Berlin, the coalition of the SPD, the Greens and the Left Party wants to set up an expert commission on how to deal with the result of the referendum.
But if the situation does not relax, Geywitz did not rule out talks with the FDP in the traffic lights coalition about further tightening of the rent law.
The coalition agreement provides for a lease price braking until 2029, a limitation of lease increases in tense housing markets and the expansion of the lease level.
I will speak with the Minister of Justice to implement this as soon as possible.
If the rental market still does not relax, "we will talk with the coalition partners about further steps", stressed the SPD politician.
Hello, I wanted to order something and after a few days I noticed that I forgot the last step in the payment.

This is an absolute insolence
At least 100 dead in Kentucky tornadoes
In a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes have passed through the United States.
In Kentucky alone, there could be more than 100 deaths.
The pictures from there are reminiscent of a war zone.
During the night of Saturday, several tornadoes in the United States have caused serious devastation and possibly killed up to a hundred people.
The storms leave a roughly 320-kilometre-long trail of devastation, especially in the state of Kentucky.
His governor, Andy Beshear, said after a visit to the disaster area, wherever the tornado went through, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just go away.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is possible at all.
In Kentucky alone, he estimates up to a hundred deaths, with official figures rising every hour.
Hello, I just saw that she is showcase #NAME# sold out.
That's a pity.
Is it still being produced?
Or is it completely removed from the range?
Is it possible to order this display case in another country?
Until when do you report?
If delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I have to cancel the order!
I understand that, only can I order the blanket now and have it delivered to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I had returned an article or submitted a return via the contact form and wanted to ask if it arrived or was processed, as I have not yet received a confirmation.
Companies pay vaccine premiums and change ads
While the federal government continues to reject the proposals for a vaccination premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and offer their employees cash premiums for the vaccination.
Thus, they are in line with the social partners <0xC3><0x96>GB and Wirtschaftskammer, who today demanded financial incentives for vaccination.
The transformation of advertising slogans into vaccine calls - following a German model - should also increase the willingness to receive corona vaccines.
He's moved to a company he's been slandering.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year.
He obviously did not sew himself in his old place and was looking for something else.
You can do that, too.
And that he didn't like you at the time: well, it doesn't matter.
He didn’t like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please accept the cancellation.
This will be legally relevant.
I'll do a screenshot.

Help with your first campaign
Boron to greet!
I’m currently leading the adventure Over the Greifenpass for a group of 4 friends and want to seamlessly lead my heroes into a campaign written specifically for the players.
We play DSA 5.
The big arc is made, the villains and their motivations are written, the individual acts are invented and now I am writing the entry-level adventure and stumble on my own feet already at the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes should bring a carriage with grain from Gratenfels to a small village near Lake Thuran.
It is there that the further action is to develop.
A few miles from the village, a group of goblins is stalked by the heroes and ambushed them.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to solve the confrontation in different ways: persuasion, action, threats, early detection of the danger, whatever comes to the player.
Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 with spears, 6 armed with bows and sabres
When not noticed, the Goblins lurking up the hero in a hollow path and flanking to each three left and right arches arms me the vehicle, while two with spears stop the vehicle.
If it comes to the fight and the heroes are subjected, I have two solutions
The heroes are all found unconscious and then healed by the son of the village school, a half-elf.
The cart is gone, of course.
If a defeat is inevitable, this half-elf intervenes with two of his servants and comes to the aid of the hero in battle.
The cart is still there, everything great.
How appropriate do you think Deus ex Machina of Solution 2?
Is the Encounter too much as an entry into the adventure?
The group of Goblins will play a decisive role later, so it is not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: Wow, I didn’t expect so many answers, especially not so many great suggestions and tips.
I’m sure I’ll keep many of your ideas in mind and now I have more confidence in my narratives.
I disassembled the lamp again.
And put together again.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I'd like to send them back anyway.
If you can then have the receipts come, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.

I'm excited about Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, over the season the quality on the German Sky has decreased more and more, so I want to take a little breath with this post.
First of all, today in the middle of the F2 race, transmission was cancelled to have F1 pre-reporting begin on time.
Although due to the delayed start and the start accident, the schedule was far behind the schedule, but you could still have shown the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!).
However, it seems that for legal reasons, F1 has priority and therefore has to limit everything else, so that Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Still stupid, especially since Sky UK has finished the race.
Nevertheless, a small praise: commentator Olivier Zwartyes has well accompanied the difficult situation surrounding the serious accident.
Then in F1 there was once again rule ignorance by commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that you can change the tyres under a red flag.
Although this situation already existed in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, they both came to the conclusion that Verstappen could change the tyres only when there were corresponding radio calls to Hamilton on the subject.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators immediately knew that Verstappen had this option.
I think that such basic rules should simply be known when commenting on F1 on a pay-TV channel.
It is also not the first puzzle guess, which is now possible or prescribed by rules, both simply have constant uncertainties in the subject of rules.
Generally, I don’t like the artificial commentary style of Roos, but admit that it’s a matter of taste.
But I seriously like even Heiko Wasser from RTL better.
In addition, there are constant nonsense, which make both seem unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from (also unsuspecting) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
Especially the latter brings a lot of unrest into the comment, which he apparently does not take seriously.
Last but not least, the advertising simply prevails at Sky, in the run-up, Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising, as you can listen to F1TV since only the German soundtrack has to come out without comment right after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
Also, these two channels make less advertising in the trainings than Sky, and that as free TV channels.
While one has to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, this alone does not let me overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of Sky Sport F1’s program is also very poor and full of repetitions.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-speaking channel to broadcast F1.
Unironically, RTL does a better job except for advertising in the four races that they are still allowed to broadcast.
So in any case, the grand F1 season is far less fun than it would be possible with a reasonable channel.
I would be interested in your opinion.
On the here: #PRS_ORG# pendant lamp, brass and multicolored glass x 1
Hello, I have an item that should be delivered last week and which is still not delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and so far nothing.
The first lady told me it will be shipped on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she will check and send an email and she has never answered.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of them has already shown a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole on the front part of the stool).
I'm asking for your support.
Fan pumps are excellent for supplying an aquarium with additional oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via air lifts.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us.
Look at the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the performance in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can run entire systems with them.
If you own a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outputs are suitable so that you can connect multiple outlets.
The MK series has one, two or four outputs, depending on the model of the fan pump, but can also be used to accentuate the aquarium, for example with an air curtain (you can find in our shop) or with a decor that converts the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure chest, shell or the like to name.
The MK-series has a special, sound-insulated design and thus ensures low operating noise.
Installation is very simple.
The fan pump is connected by means of an air hose 4/6 mm to an outflower or the like ... and it can start right away.
The fan pump should be the same, or higher, as the water level and should be mounted outside.
If the fan pump is lower than the water level, a check valve should be placed in between.
Simply cut through the air hose and place the valve in between.
This would prevent once water from running backwards, the water running out of the basin through the pump...
Should the fan pump be installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture, like other air pumps.
The pumps of the MK series are pure power packs that use little energy
Even if we specify here in ebay the processing time with 3 days, it is packed daily and the parcels are also picked up daily here.
If everything goes well on the way, it goes very fast.
We just want to prevent a little, so that no one is discouraged, just because it took a little longer once.
It would be that not everyone has an understanding of the entire staff who also work in the freight forwarding industry... of course, no Corona stops here.
Please do not rate badly just because the delivery is delayed, this is solely due to the parcel services.
Of course, you like to rebuke these services, even if we say at the moment...they have a damn hard time
This is also very different regionally.
Don’t be angry with anyone, stay healthy and we all hope there will be better times again.
How long does it take to order yellow with and without armrests?
Can you also order your legs in light?
Amazon Founder Bezo Sends Astronaut Daughter and Moderator to Space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV presenter and four other passengers have taken a short trip to space.
They were transported on Saturday by the New Shepard rocket system of the company Blue Origin by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The departing and landing of the 10-minute flight took place in the west of the U.S. state of Texas.
Under shining blue skies, Bezos himself welcomed the newly selected astronauts after their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue spacesuit as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers gradually climbed out and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were on the road for ten minutes and 13 seconds, reaching an altitude of 107 kilometers.
74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of NASA astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998), after whom Blue Origin's missile system is named, and 50-year-old TV presenter Michael Strahan were honorary guests of the company, the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, and investor Evan La Dick's son, technology subsidiary.
Blue Origin didn’t say how much they each paid for their ticket.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father's mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard and do everything himself.
She just flew along, the 74-year-old said with a laugh.
Michael Strahan was also very enthusiastic.
He would like to return to space soon, the moderator said.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers
The New Shepard missile system is largely automated.
The capsule separated from the rocket during the flight reached a height of about 100 kilometers above Earth, at times with zero gravity, before the reusable object braked by large parachutes landed again.
The International Aviation Federation and many other experts regard 100 kilometers above Earth as a border to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third manned all-out trip from Blue Origin: The first in July, Amazon founder Bezos was himself on board, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former U.S. pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
On the second in October, 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world-famous with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", as well as former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries, and deputy chief executive of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of advancing the business of space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the good of humanity and without regard to climate.

Someone who works in biochemistry or studied biochemistry
I am currently studying biochemistry in the first semester and find the subject in itself quite exciting and even standing in the lab does not bother me (already have the inorganic chemistry internship behind me).
Of course, I also informed myself about career prospects before studying, but I also thought at the time that I would definitely want to study until the doctorate.
At the moment, however, I have doubts, especially concerning my career prospects.
On the one hand (Studycheck etc) you hear great job opportunities again and again and the job is totally sought, on the other hand you hear again and again from unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid jobs.
So I would be really interested:
1) What are you currently working on?
2) Are you satisfied with your job/salary?
3) What did you study/ what did you do?
4) Would you do it all over again?
Thank you for your replies!
I am currently really unsure and may be considering cancelling my studies in 2022 and making an apprenticeship as a specialist computer scientist.
If you have any experience, I would love to write :)
Extra stress before holidays & holiday weekends
This topic came up to me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax.
That's why it's only now a post on it.
Not only before big holidays, like the Christmas holidays, there is a lot of stress in the company.
It looks like there's one before the holidays plus bridge days.
It was like this: last week was the Ascension Day, which we in Switzerland call the "Ascension".
On Friday, the vast majority of people and businesses make a bridge day, which is therefore semi-official.
So last week there was a long 4-day weekend in the house.
So what happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
Loud e-mails, which absolutely had to leave before the driveway, order here order there, all *necessarily* before the long weekend.
Because... yes because?
Because "next week then" sounds like so much time and it shouldn't be?
Or is it because people want to earn as much in a shorter week as in a normal one?
Not only was I then stressed on Wednesday, but also powerfully annoyed.
What is this self-sacrifice about holidays?
Why do we still have holidays if we are not allowed to treat ourselves properly?!
Of course, the stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all so self-confident.
My question is simple: are we the only ones like that, the Swiss?
Is this our Reformed-Evangelical way?
Do you know that in the North?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian home - but has no gifts yet.
"The beauty, even if there should be no snow in Erfurt, then you simply go to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will tune in to the feast by baking and crafting cookies with her son.
"I love that," said Catterfeld.
Until the contemplative days, however, she still has a lot to do: "For the first time I don't have any gifts yet, I finally have to get started".
NEKTON-Bio supports the smooth running of the mouse and the regeneration of plumage.
NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 <0xCE><0xBC>g biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny plumage.
The majority of feathers damage occurring in bird husbandry is solely due to nutritional defects.
Since the plumage consists of protein-containing substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein feeding of the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of an impeccable plumage.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily food must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
The majority of animal losses occurring during mice are due to a lack or unbalanced protein intake and/or insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavourable ratio of amino acids in most plant feeds is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
No further vitamin preparation should be administered during the use of NEKTON-Bio.
NEKTON-Bio is cold water soluble and can easily be administered via drinking water or soft food.
Thank you, I found it

DDR-Handarbeitsmodell Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the locomotive was designed in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of the model railway ME Heft 11/1968, used with play tracks and defective parts see photos, function well, The series E 95 is a heavy freight train electric locomotive of the German
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and we have been working on it.
In 1924, the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft commissioned AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that would be able to transport 2,200-tonne coal trains and 530-tonne passenger trains at 45 km/h travel speed on this route.
The maximum speed required was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG decided on the delivery as a 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with tatzlager drive AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which received the operating numbers E 95 01–06.
All of them survived the Second World War and subsequently found themselves on the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives entered the Soviet Union as repair goods.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
In the Dessau Reich Railway Improvement Works, the reworkability of all six locomotives was determined.
[4] When the demand for locomotives for heavy freight train services grew as the central German network was reelectricated, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were reworked in 1959, with the remaining machines serving as spare parts dispensers.
In this case, the E 04, E 44 and E 94, which are present in larger quantities, were first preferably constructed.
It was only when it was foreseen in the case of the E 94 that the work-up number could not be increased further that the E 95 became the focus of the work-up.
[4] Initially, the locomotives were stationed in the Leipzig-Waren railway station.
They arrived at the railway company Halle P in 1960.
They were mostly used in a separate circulation plan before coal trains from the Geiseltal towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
The complex control of the locomotives proved problematic with increasing age.
Thus, it often happened that shooters stuck during shifting operations.
Then the sideman who was constantly on this locomotive with hammer and wooden wedge had to loosen the shooter again during the ride.
Damage to the driving engines occurred frequently and resulted in months of failures on the locomotive.
[5] Since there were enough new-build locomotives at the end of the 1960s and a significant expansion of the electrical operation was not planned at the time, the Reichsbahn was able to dispense with old locomotives and most of the splitter types, so that the E 95 was decommissioned.
They added that the Deutsche Reichsbahn only wanted to occupy electric locomotives one-man, which would have caused a problem in train operation due to the aforementioned difficulties with the machines and the visibility conditions of the driver's cab.
[5] After E 95 02 and E 95 03 were discontinued in mid-1969, they were followed by E 95 01, which resigned on 5 October 1970.
The proposed new designation 255 001 was thus never used.
With the exception of the E 95 02, all locomotives were dismantled.
The E 95 02 was installed as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a switch heating system at Halle Central Station.
It took some time before the managers at the Reichsbahn could be convinced that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the first external work on the locomotive began with the aim of being able to present it at a vehicle show at the RAW Dessau.
[5] Since then, it has belonged to the Dresden Transport Museum as an inoperable museum locomotive.
In 1986, the internal completion of the locomotive took place.
In the DB Museum Halle (Saale), the locomotive is supervised by museums.
Since 1995, employees of the Traditional Community Bw Halle P have been working on the operational refurbishment of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time at an exhibition in the Museums-Bw Arnstadt with new internal and external paintwork, with the transformers being inspected and five driving engines operational.
-The locomotives were in use until 1945 on the Silesian mountain railway and the branching side tracks, where they proved themselves due to their reliable drive and low maintenance effort.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig to the Central German network.
The main area of operation was initially Silesia.
Handcrafted model H0 in OVP, function good, optical rework on the locomotive is necessary in own work, dusted, with game tracks, cellar smell!!!, very rare handwork model, very small edition - the kit may also come from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging may have labels and storage traces.
Yes, the F-parts are
I got a bed from you.
However, there were problems with one part.
The central beam is held by two feet.. unfortunately these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What do we do now?
I can't build the bed.
The middle beam is held by two feet, these are unfortunately faulty produced.
The central beam does not fit into the provided holder.
So I'm getting new ones.
When will they be released?
No flats.
These are, according to the assembly instructions, the right of the shape, they were just too narrow
But it doesn't matter.
The main thing they fulfill their purpose
With me they are not flat
Could I have these sent to you?
Hello #NAME#, can I explain the problem again?
House fire with two easily injured and high damage
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage has occurred in the six-digit euro area, police said on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the adjacent residential building in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district).
Two residents were reportedly taken to the hospital on Sunday with mild smoke poisoning.
The exact cause of the fire was not known at first, but the police did not assume an intentional fire.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigation.
But it will come much later
And I have to pay shipping costs again
To mitigate fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccine photo
U<0xC4><0x9F>ur <0xC5><0x9E>ahin posted a photo of his first vaccination in early 2021 on the social network "LinkedIn"
Biontech CEO U<0xC4><0x9F>ur <0xC5><0x9E>ahin had not yet publicly commented on his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur published a photo showing his corona vaccine.
A friend’s illness caused him to do so, <0xC5><0x9E>ahin said.
The CEO and co-founder of Mainz company Biontech, U<0xC4><0x9F>ur <0xC5><0x9E>ahin, has released a photo showing how he receives a vaccination against the coronavirus.
There was false information on social media that I was allegedly not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I received 3 doses of the Biontech Pfizer vaccine," <0xC5><0x9E>ahin wrote in a post on the network "LinkedIn" on Friday.
"For a few months, friends have been pushing me to post a photo of me on which I am being vaccinated to counteract these false rumors."
So far, he has rejected this because the communication should not revolve around himself.
But a call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened when I learned that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is fighting a serious Covid-19 disease and has been hanging on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, <0xC5><0x9E>ahin wrote.
He did not ask for the reasons.
"However, the most common cause seems to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and mistrust".
Fear is hard to fight with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
An interview with Deutsche Welle is circulating on the Internet, in which U<0xC4><0x9F>ur <0xC5><0x9E>ahin says he was not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"I am currently not legally allowed to get the vaccine myself," <0xC5><0x9E>ahin said at the time.
There is a priority in Germany in the vaccination of the vaccine.
In the meantime, the prioritization has long been abolished - and the Biontech CEO, according to his own data, has been vaccinated three times.
Fire in substation: tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the lights went out on Friday evening: no more electricity and, in many cases, probably no heating.
A fire paralyzed a substation.
After a fire with serious damage in a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg-Kreis in North Rhine-Westphalia have had to live without electricity for around 24 hours.
The fire caused 41,000 affected residents in several municipalities to turn out the lights on Friday evening.
The utility Westnetz reported that numerous emergency power units had been in operation on Saturday until the large-scale failure could finally be completely fixed in the late evening.
Firefighters and helpers of the THW provided support in the municipalities.
Authorities offered care places in schools and called for neighbourhood assistance.
The caretaker thanked those affected for their patience and the helpers for their dedication.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant constraints.
We also thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire brigades and the THW for their tireless deployment," said Florian Witt, Head of the Primary Technology Department, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take a few more days, as the Westnetz technicians were initially only able to provisionally re-commission some lines, he explained.
According to company information, a technical defect led to the fire.
Electricity flows again
According to Westnetz, the fire that broke out on Friday at around 7.15 p.m. has severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear at the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation.
This requires extensive cleaning and repair work.
In parallel, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level was created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is restored.
Since Saturday at 6 p.m., more than 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth had electricity again.
A further 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually connected from 21:30.
Since 11:15 p.m., the last people affected by the failure have also had electricity.
More than 80 technicians from Westnetz and partner companies were employed.
The authorities had also called for neighbourhood assistance after the construction of an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon.
"It is important now that citizens care for elderly or single people in their neighbourhood and communicate with local fire brigade houses if help is needed," said County Councillor Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When installing and operating emergency power units, the focus was primarily on the residents of elderly homes.
In addition, according to authorities, temporary care places have been set up in schools for those people who were unable to provide for themselves or who need power-dependent medical devices or who need medical care.
Good morning, boys.
Unfortunately, the blanket is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy them from you and pay in Euros?
It is the day blanket #PRS_ORG# in blue-green.
I hope you have a nice day too and please stay healthy <0xE2><0x99><0xA1>
But I can't mount the frame on the table top.
It is custom #NAME#.
Of these, there are 3 statements.
We wanted those with table tops diameter of #NUMBER#
we got 155cm diameter.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I can’t push them into each other and therefore shorten them.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise, I would have to send it back, otherwise it is not suitable for the purpose.
I would love to receive feedback
yes it is really easier!
Then let's do it like this!
will you send me the return receipt by email?
The repair is now complete.
I had tried this before the chat.
However, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG# before the purchase.
Should I do this now?
I find such a low credit almost outrageous.
We do not agree with this
Nordic combination: Combiner Riiber wins

I have to work in the meantime!
To make the paint application even and clean, you should clean the components with a little soapy water from dust, grease and fingerprints, rinse with clear water and dry it off.
Before applying the brush to the model for the first time with a new color, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the later no longer visible inside of the components or on a yogurt cup.
The first line on the component
Draw the brush evenly next to the line.
A slight overlap of the ink layers later ensures a uniform surface area.
Avoid swiping back and forth with the brush.
This creates unrealistic surfaces.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colors.
Otherwise, the dark ones could shine through later.
Metal tones and metallic colors come to the end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, it can lead to unpleasant metal veils if they mix with normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you rebuild them.
The models achieve a true-to-original appearance through the decals or decals.
From emblems on aircraft to ship names to trims and license plates on car models: the decals give the model the finishing touch.
Apply the decals in the correct order as long as the components are still easily accessible.
An aircraft cockpit can be easily glued before it is installed in the hull.
Even more important than the right tool such as scissors, tweezers and toothpicks are time, patience and a calm hand.
Cut out each necessary decal individually and set it up for you.
Decals are also called water slides because you briefly moisten their back with water until the carrier paper becomes dark due to the wetness.
Then you just slide the picture a little bit off the paper and place the piece in the appropriate place on the model (which you have also wetted before).
While holding the decal on the model with a tool, pull the carrier paper sideways.
Caution: Always check to see if the image sits properly before you slide it completely off the paper so that it does not stick to your finger, wrinkle or even tear.
Suck out excess water with a household towel.
Attention not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only open a book briefly, as soon as I look for something else then I no longer read the book and have to unsubscribe and log in and reload the book and look for the place where I have read.
I have already communicated with you on Saturday.
Will I receive it by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp arrived at me in 3 individual packages
ok anyway thank you!
I will buy somewhere else as soon as the money is back.
Will I get it back without any problems?
Pregnancy treatment at PKV / What is an "insurance case"?
Hello together,
we were in fertility treatment for some time, now when it comes to billing with the PKV, it suddenly crosses the line.
In the order:
We had applied for the fertility treatment in advance with the PKV and got the pledge for 3 trials.
The experiments were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to successful pregnancy and childbirth and was billed with the PKV.
Some time later, we tried to have a second child, and did 2 ( unsuccessful) attempts, but did not yet count them with the PKV.
We again applied for the costs at the PKV and were granted 3 further trials.
After a few more trials (we did more trials than promised, logically calculating the most expensive with the PKV) we submitted the invoices to the PKV and got the nasty surprise: instead of 5 trials (2+3) the PKV wants to reimburse only 3 trials.
The reason: With pregnancy/birth the remaining 2 attempts of the first pledge expire.
The second wish to have children is a new insurance case.
According to the AGB, however, "The insurance case begins with the treatment, it ends when the need for treatment no longer exists."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who has the right here, the PKV (only 3 attempts are refunded) or we (there are 5 attempts to refund)?
* Should the PKV have had to point out to us in the promises that with one birth the further attempts expire?
* Is the wish for a second child really a new insurance case?
Infertility (caused by closed fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts would give your opinion here.
Thank you so much for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how best to reach them again?
All right, all right.
We will not order anything from them anymore.
If they add up the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they have obviously lost good customer.
You are welcome to pass this on to your manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday, my colleague told me that the repayment was induced and now you tell me that I have to send the thing back first.
I can't wait for the commode to come to me completely disturbed.
Please see in the screenshot what the author wrote.
It says clearly that the repayment has been initiated and I still have not received a repayment via #PRS_ORG#
You can tell your manager that you have now lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment via his account.
We're not going to do that anymore.
No, the defect only occurred after a few months.
An office chair must withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they can't sell it as an office chair.
Regardless, the warranty is valid for 24 months.
No, it is not possible for me to get another type of packaging.
I will be able to dismantle the cabinet and make it available to the transport company.
Hello, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are advertised with additional stools to be purchased, but we cannot find these with you.
Can they help?
Topic of the Week: The Best Low Budget Movies
What a low-budget movie is exactly, for that there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
Wikipedia has the following to say about it:
A low-budget film or low-budget movie is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
On the net you can find plenty of lists of low-budget movies, such as Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting people in this category?
What attracts you to it?
And what do you not like at all?
I am a very good customer of you, have already furnished 2 apartments complete with your furniture.
Wanted to ask for the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended once again, is it now also reliable?
Thank you!
With kind regards
If there is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position...I will soon give up again because it just doesn't work here.
Hello.
"Half victory" against Belarus linked to high costs for the EU
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can announce a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
However, the costs are very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at Belarus' border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not solved the confrontation in a sustainable way, explained the researcher of the Berliner Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik (SWP).
This state of swiftness - Belarus does not give up, but the EU feels itself to be a winner - will probably go on for a while.
Dealing with people at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong said.
There is apparently an “increasing normalization of pushbacks” by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole is not resolutely opposed, it is at the expense of fundamental rights.
At the same time, this development weakens cohesion in the Union.
"It seems that it cannot prevail if a Member State sets itself in the head to do its thing," as currently Poland, which does not even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex access to the border.
In addition, the EU is paying another price for its policy at the border with Belarus, Bossong said: A principle agreement on asylum policy will be made more difficult because the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Another attempt at crossing the border
According to the Polish border guard, in the meantime, migrants have again tried to reach Polish territory via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested on Sunday night and brought back to the border, a spokeswoman for the authorities said on Sunday.
Polish officials were stoned in the incident near the village of Czeremsza by the migrants.
According to reports, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be given medical care by a military doctor.
In total, the border guard recorded 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries like Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or tried to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko as the ruler in Minsk of having attracted them with the prospect of entering the EU.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania closed off border sections.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines bringing migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU Commissioners traveled to people’s countries of origin to prevent departures there.
The most effective element of the EU response is the pressure on the airlines, Bossong said.
"The EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with harsh bandages and extraterritorial sanctions."
Minsk must also take into account domestic costs.
The Belarusian society is probably not prepared for the security apparatus to regularly sweep thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 final
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen has committed two violations of the rules during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After Abu Dhabi's controversial Formula 1 final, Mercedes has filed an appeal.
The Silver Arrows suspect two rule breaks in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to an alleged violation by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last Safety Car phase, when he was alleged to have irregularly overtaken.
A second complaint was filed against the rating at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes-Vision, the protocol was not complied with.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and had reached his first Formula One title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase in which the Dutchman had overtaken cars driving in front of him.
I'll check it out.
I'll talk to the bank and report back to you

Judith Hermann read from her novel "Daheim"
As part of the reading series "LiteraTour Nord", author Judith Hermann read on Friday in the sold-out Blue Note from her current novel "Daheim" and also acted as a moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house on the coast and listens sensitively to the nightly sounds at her front door.
I submitted the contact form for returning an item yesterday, but did not receive an email confirmation or similar.
My question would be whether my question has been received.
Not everyone has the time for your stupid chat and misdelivered cheap goods from China.
Your mistake that you fix and not all of our budget.
Contact Mrs. #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day
We had chatted yesterday and agreed that I or my wife #NAME# will receive an email with a 60 Euro voucher, a re-order of the #PRS_ORG# bedside table and a return label.
This e-mail has not yet arrived.
The package still wants to bring to #PRS_ORG# today.
Please contact me
With kind regards

Sorry, but just because he says he's not an anti-Semite doesn't mean nothing.
It’s like an aficionado says he has nothing against foreigners.
Both of you will not admit it.
But colleagues are constantly reproducing any anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself, you should just let it go completely.
Wow, you’re not as serious as my friend.
Anyone who seriously questions evolution is simply completely lost.
Because of me, a god started it all.
But once you’re a creationist, you have to believe that the earth is 10,000 years old and science is just tapping nonsense.
And with that, you're a science enemy and don't take any more seriously as a colleague
To get an optimal field of vision, the magnifying glass should be approached as close to the eye as possible.
The specially designed aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows you to use the magnifying glass practically without registering and color errors down to the edge zone.
Lupes are often marked with magnification indications.
However, this information only applies to precisely defined conditions, which rarely correspond to the conditions of use.
In order to make the best use of your magnifying glass, we ask you to follow the instructions in the table "Technical data" (See instructions for use in the packaging).
Light reflexes are created on the lens surfaces of all optical devices, including impact magnifiers.
An anti-reflective coating significantly reduces these reflections.
When the optimum conditions of use - magnifying glass close to the eye - are observed, reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
Further information can be found in the accompanying instructions for use (available in German and English).

Tannenverkauf in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz women choose the Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced so many curious situations during the sale of fir trees.
On one occasion, a man is said to have gone home without his partner, because both could not agree.
Each year, he plants well over 2,000 plants.
The 56-year-old has already experienced such a curious situation.
That always makes the pre-Christmas season fun, he says.
What about the voucher??
Otherwise I'm gone as a customer?!
After all, I received a defective delivery and now paid the full price for it.
Then I will evaluate it accordingly!
We do not need to discuss the better court here, but there is some similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating spit.
Both have their names.
In German, an equivalent would perhaps be something like the "Dreher", which by far does not sound so tasty.
Problems with fiber + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I now have problems building a stable Wifi network.
Previously I had a DSL 50 Mbit port and used Devolo DLan, which received and broadcasted 50 Mbit flawlessly except for a few failures.
The new fiber optic connector sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and these also arrive at the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox.
However, on the other DLan module, which the Wifi sends, the full 500 no longer arrives, but the further I remove myself in the house with the module, the less arrives (i.e. use a socket, which is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
As a result, the Internet is now even slower than before (<0x5C><0x7E>45 Mbit) with the new fiber-optic connection on the first floor.
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but here too there were similarly large losses.
Could someone explain to me why so much internet speed is "lost" with fiberglass over the power line?
Is LAN really the solution?
It would be extremely expensive to lay LAN cables in the house.
I am really desperate, which is why I have created an extra account here.
That is why I would be all the more delighted to receive an answer.
When it is time to change the current account
Whoever thought that now would be calm at the checking accounts, is mistaken.
While many banks have used the autumn to use all sorts of tricks to get their customers to confirm the fee increases of the past, the free amounts for negative interest rates are also falling further.
Deutsche Bank, for example, was long regarded as relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she has just halved the free amount and even quartered for the daily allowance.
In a first step, the limit was lowered only for customers of the Group’s Postbank division – to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50,000 in current and investment accounts and to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>25,000 for daily cash accounts.
Meanwhile, however, these lower free amounts apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesperson confirmed on request.
Not only for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements with existing customers".
Commerzbank had already dropped to a limit of 50,000 euros, which is still valid, just like ING Deutschland.
The direct bank DKB, which is particularly popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the free amounts in two stages, initially to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
After all, more than 100 banks now have a free amount of 25,000 euros or less, according to figures from the internet portal Verivox.
Sparda-Bank Berlin has also arrived at <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> 25,000: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centers, which in the first instance before the Regional Court of Berlin have even gotten right against this regulation.
Banks are already debating whether institutions should make provisions - in the event that even the top authorities declare the negative interest rates in principle inadmissible and have to pay back many millions to bank customers.

Jennifer Aniston employs a whole beauty army
She is now officially at the forefront of Hollywood.
But their life is like a mountain and a valley.
Jennifer Aniston, 52, has been voted the most influential woman of the year by The Hollywood Reporter.
For them, who made a fuss in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of their series "The Morning Show", this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers takes care of their appearance.
After all, according to Aniston, she treats herself to a chip a day (yes, rightly read: a SINGLE chip from the bag).
The fact that the hearts of both male and female fans are flown to her is actually a miracle.
Maybe it's because she's just unlucky with luck - and still looking for great love.
And removed the baby wish from the list.
She was always asked when she would become a mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked this have no idea what’s going on with me personally, medically, why I can’t.
It was really hurtful.
Hopefully success and fame will also make you happy.
Unworthy end of a career: Räikkönen has to give up
Kimi Räikkönen’s farewell from Formula 1 was even quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat off his forehead.
That's it.
After a driving error and a slight tyre touch, Räikkönen had to park his Alfa Romeo at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after less than half the race distance.
It was his 349th and final Grand Prix, the "Iceman" finishing his career in the motorsport king class.
His wife Minttu and their two children also traveled to the United Arab Emirates for farewell.
Räikkönen's biggest success was winning the 2007 World Championships in Ferrari.
He made 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from the pole and came to the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich wins 60th World Cup - Nolte wins in the two-bob - Sport
The brand of Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bobsleigh pilot.
"I figured it out once, I had to win nine and a half wins per season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who scored two successes in two days at the races in Winterberg.
First, on Saturday, he deterred Johannes Lochner’s attack by five hundredths, driving from rank three to one.
Then he changed the material setting somewhat and drove out a bigger lead with 0.30 seconds on Sunday.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he won the title in front of the British Brad Hall.
Third was the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We took greater risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also entered his 22nd victory in series.
Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner, who drives for Stuttgart, finished second this time in fifth place.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished eighth in the first race in fourth place.
"If I knew what he does differently, I would do it the same way," Lochner said.
Nolte with home win - Podium for Jamanka
Laura Nolte won her third season in the Zweierbob.
After reaching only fourth place in the Monobob the previous day, she rushed to the World Cup victory on Sunday in the German triple victory with driver Deborah Levi.
Two-bob Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thuringia came in second with Germany’s fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to her Olympic qualifier, she posted her first podium this winter.
Wiesbadener Kim Kalicki finished third with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was supercool, first podium place in the World Cup, I am superhappy that Mariama will take me.
I am super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt, stressing: "It is not only pushing, but there is also a lot to do around it."
Jamanka was a little annoyed about the not entirely flawless rides, but said, "It's going in the right direction."
I already had the blanket in my shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What do you want me to do?
I just did not receive it and therefore could not redeem why I finally asked for it.
Because of Corona, I had completely different problems last year and never had time for it.
And now he said it was over, which made me very angry.
Look in the chat it was about the Asare bench.
I would like to return it and then order again, as it is just reduced :)
Why is the shipment only started on 16.3.?
There was nothing on your website about such a long delivery time
No until I tap on it comes an extra field with the message
She was taken from her colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today
I also sent you pictures of the wrong goods.
But we still want the shelf module, just a new undamaged
And don't cancel the entire order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello dear great girls and girls and women,
I have a few things I just want to write and maybe this one - or others - will work out.
I am 24, have kPTBS, a full-time student and a dog mom - aside from the fact that my dog doesn't scream or go to kindergarten, he's actually 1 to 1 my child.
My friend (since 6Y together) is ill, has had a 2nd degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I still have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was beautiful.
I helped him in the shower (because hand is in the dressing wg burning).
He is also cold and we currently see less (1-2x week) which makes me very concerned with my needs for affection and love.
My dog child just has stomach pain, I cooked for him and now he is lying in his cuddly blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was there with the heat lamp and caressing for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she's just gone for a month.
Now we have some housework, which we split up.
But even cooking is a lot of work for me right now...
My PTSD disease is quite well adjusted right now, I am halfway well treated and get along.
Not good, but I'm getting along and I'm almost symptom-free.
My university is demanding a lot (for me), tomorrow at 15h I have a written test for which I haven’t done anything yet and the day after tomorrow anatomy class for which I should at least prepare something.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes next is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no more room.
So my week goes like this: Only until the day after tomorrow, then it’s weekend.
But then the whole thing goes on?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the start of the holidays.
Just until the weekend.
Just until...
And so it continues forever.
I think I’m just so stressed that I need these mental clues, otherwise I’ll pack that ned.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic," but otherwise I can't do it...
Do you feel the same way?
Honestly, I'm infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
I am truly grateful, I cannot put it in words.
I don’t know if I would have survived my kptbs.
I think this also has a lot to do with mental load of women and that is why I thought that I certainly find suffering companions here...
I wish you a relaxing evening, the week is almost over!
I got my order today unfortunately the whole other color plus surface is scratched and table leg has imprint.
On the first delivery, the color was exactly the same as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we are going to change the table now, will I get another color or what?
The cancellation email was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
Twice, by the way.
But it was not confirmed.
I found at school that many religious teachers don’t believe in God and it’s just another subject for them, like math or geography.
For me, this was always a bit strange, perhaps because I was raised as a Christian and I always believed in it.
How do you feel about it?
Maybe you can also talk about colleagues with different attitudes.
Basically, I understand the difference between private and professional and it makes sense to separate.
There is also a curriculum, etc.
But it would also be weird to have a physics teacher who does not believe in the theory of relativity.
What makes you want to teach religion if you don’t believe it?
Culture or something?
I hope the question is not too private.
Can't it be changed or not?I like to write in English that I understand well too
It's been a long time now, so I'd give up.
All right, thank you.
I expect a response soon, no later than the beginning of next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Movie search Help please
Hello dear people,
I'm looking for a movie from my childhood (I'm 24).
I think it was a movie for young people.
In the film, there are two time axes (or parallel worlds).
On the one hand, the modern (real world).
Second, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not quite sure).
Since I can’t describe it in more detail in the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to that of the soldiers from the curse of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths cross and an action arises.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm in order to be able to live himself, I mean.
The crossing, I believe, is also the tomb of the soldier.
In the end, the two soldiers fight each other.
If that tells you anything, I am grateful for every response.
Our little one only slept on her stomach from week one.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Just relax.
Such a child can endure much more than you think.
Make sure everything is right around you, no cuddly animals, go in and look more often, but no minutes of surveillance.
That's driving you insane!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Achso and ours had no sleeping bag, but always had a blanket.
Watch your child when he sleeps.
Does it turn its head to the side?
Can it stand up from the belly?
Or is it with the face in front directly in the mattress?
You can infer from that if everything is okay.
We all grew up too and when my husband was born, it was kind of like putting the kids on their belly to sleep.
In addition, we are already "regular customer" with you and have already bought a lot of items
But why do you offer me only $20?
Hello, I have already written with a colleague of yours yesterday and so far no feedback.
It's about my wardrobe, which arrived the day before yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit in the closet.
Please contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is currently not to be used.
To be perfectly clear.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be held.
I also had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It is simply that the politics of this channel is now under all shit.
Almost every format is sponsored (okay), but then still go on a big begging tour at the same time.
It has been said that you are an "independent" Internet channel.
Arno: “You don’t want to be a running littoral column.”
What are you now?
An 0815 advertising station trying to bring his BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then there's Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
This is true for everyone, except for Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they can continue to offend people.
A Krogman who completely lacks empathy and at the expense of the action with the exploded rented rooms tries to make ashes.
How are you supposed to find all this good?
Great if you like it, I find it awful.
I ask for a call back, because my delivered wooden table was delivered defective.
Body breakage due to damaged delivery of #PRS_ORG#.
Whether as a comforter in case of abdominal pain or just for cuddling – my little warmth friend can be used in a variety of ways.
Cherry kernel pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing heat applications, since cherry kernels can absorb heat very well and release heat in doses again.
The removable inner cushion can be easily heated in the microwave or oven.
The soft cover makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even if they are not feeling so well at times.
The cherry core cushion with cover is suitable as a heat pad exclusively for the following areas of application:
Before heating the pillow, check for untypical odors, stains or burns and discard immediately if present.
Please remove the inner pillow for heating beforehand from the cover!
Heat in the microwave at a maximum of 300 watts for a maximum of 2 minutes (please note the manufacturer of the microwave!)
Immediately after heating, distribute the heat evenly in the pillow by shaking!
Subsequently, place the inner cushion in the cover.
During the first warm-ups, there may be slight moisture formation on the surface, but it disappears with repeated applications.
Be sure to follow the warming instructions given, as longer periods or higher energy outputs can lead to damage (danger of flammability and combustion!).
Before heating the cushion in the microwave, check that heating of grain products is allowed in the manufacturer's instructions for use.
After the heated inner cushion has been put back into the cover, please check the temperature of the cushion for baby suitability (max. 43 °C) on your arm bend!
Do not use the pillow for acute and chronic, inflammatory or febrile diseases, circulatory problems, fresh hematomas, bruises and open wounds, as well as for people with reduced sensation of pain.
If you have skin, heart, veins, diabetes, or a pregnancy, please consult a doctor before use.
If seams have opened and loose seeds spill out, dispose of the product and the loose seeds immediately and inaccessible to children.
If the product is used in babies under 1 year of age, the temperature of the child should be checked regularly during use to avoid overheating!
All serious incidents involving the product shall be reported to the manufacturer and to the competent authority of the country where the user is established.
The cover is removable and can be washed in the machine at 30 °C.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt after Hinserie Second - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 may dream of returning to the Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working from the table basement.
For Ingolstadt, it is also not under the third coach.

Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer charged by my power supply.
I bought this about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought the power supply alone was enough for operation.
Failure indicator, the battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts despite plugged-in power supply.
Then I expanded the battery, but nothing is done here.
Do you have any ideas?
A new battery is ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in mains operation?
Is there anything else broken?
Thank you for your help!
I want the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book this?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
I don't know how high the seat is...
Often on tour and still a lot of equipment?
With the Everyday V2 Backpack by Peak Design no problem!
20 liters of capacity also swallow larger photo equipment without any problems, which can be safely stored using the padded FlexFold dividers.
And whatever else you need in everyday objects, thanks to practical access points in the individually configurable interior, remains well organized and separable from the photo equipment.
With the "update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series presents itself in a new look.
With the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing access to photo equipment in seconds.
This works with two possibilities: Once conventional via the lid flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch closure system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection, which has already proven itself with the messenger bags.
In the closure flap there is a metal closure hook with matching anchor beams on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has considered different "filling levels": there are 4 anchor beams, riveted in a stable manner, into which the closure hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is fully loaded, just take the top bar, it is more likely to be empty, a deeper one.
Flap closure and hooks are also magnetic.
This way, the backpack can also be reliably closed without snapping the hook.
The second option also fundamentally differentiates the Everyday Backpack from other, photo backpacks: In addition to the lid flap, there is also a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest drawback of traditional backpacks with access from above - you don't have to dig through the contents anymore!
At the same time, this clever detail greatly increases the everyday suitability of the backpack: if you bring not only your photo equipment, but also everyday objects or luggage.
In the Everyday Backpack, you can configure the interior individually (more on this below) and store both easily separately from each other - and also access it independently through the two lateral openings.
You can also pull the backpack from the right side in front of the body, for example, to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while the everyday things stay safe in the left backpack half and do not get in between.
Comfortable, easy-to-adjust carrying straps help with this.
And since the outer cover of the backpack is also made entirely of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the content remains dry even if it is to go to Scotland in autumn.
Unfortunately, I am waiting in vain for the email from their support.
#NAME# sent me an email yesterday from confirmation for commissioning the

Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. when will the item be delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I received a completely different lamp than I ordered.
Please call me
If you extend the voucher to me, I will place a larger order right away, but after all, I kept the damaged piece of furniture and did not send it back.
And that the past year went differently than I thought I could not guess and just could not redeem it in time and clarify it.
But I have the damage as a customer and I do not accept that.
Rotinger brake discs are designed to meet the demands of the dynamic driver, who appreciates the reliability and safety of braking even in difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are made of casting and then machined mechanically (drilled and cut).
All tuned discs are produced in short series according to individual technical characteristics, which are peculiar to certain discs and patterns.
Based on the individual technical drawing, a special production program is created, which is based on the characteristics of the original assembly with the balancing of the disk.
The tuned discs produced in this way ensure high comfort and braking efficiency.
Additionally created openings increase the effectiveness of cooling the disc, with the cuts improving the cleaning of the brake discs and brake pads.
The aesthetic properties of our tuned windows underline the character of every car by its attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man at the southern fork of the American River discovered shining chunks in the water.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news spread quickly, triggering the so-called 'California Gold Rush' of '49.
Thousands came from near and far, making Coloma one of the fastest growing and thriving cities in the country.
Areas were set up, tents were set up, and saloons and hotels were built almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country’s wealth.
For many it was called "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or bankruptcy)!
In this game you are a pioneer who seeks wealth in the West and wants to make a name for himself.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, gather horses and build businesses.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding river courses and adjacent areas.
You’re not alone – the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to outperform your pioneer colleagues so as not to go bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many ways to win.
You simultaneously choose your actions, have to house with your resources and build a tableau that is working more and more for you (so-called "Engine Building").
The buildings on your Tableau allow you to become more efficient, get additional actions or turn rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can use fine customizations to create your own style of play.
Coloma plays over a three-year period from 1848 (the year when the gold was discovered in Coloma), over 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year when California gained official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly and simultaneously select a location on the schedule where they can perform actions.
After that, their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers in the appropriate locations.
If a site has the most pioneers, it gets a lock!
This deactivates one half of the site - thus reducing the possible actions there.
Then the players take turns performing actions such as winning resources, moving cars, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening shops, and positioning gunmen.
When all the actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The promoter turns to a new location at the beginning of each round, thus changing the available promotions.
This continues until the advertiser has moved five times, i.e., has covered each location once and the year ends.
There is a shootout in which players must defend Coloma from a raid of angry bandits.
If players have contributed enough gun heroes and are numbered above the bandits, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they receive less rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shootout, then the final score takes place.
The player with the most win points wins!

"Why children aren't tyrants" Documentary, ARD Media Library
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentary appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I watched it right away.
>Children psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a welcome guest in talk shows and gives lectures throughout Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008), he sparked a heated educational debate.
Former patients and guardians are now making serious accusations against him.
Be careful, the film is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
We parents and other responsible persons must never, never, ever go for power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child space for his development and to make the framework for the child as large as it makes sense and possible in the situation.
Brrr, it still shakes me.
Holetschek: Countries discuss abolition of mandatory testing for triple vaccines
The health ministers of the countries want to decide at their next meeting on a nationwide abolition of the test obligation for triple vaccines.
"We countries need to quickly clarify whether and when for three times vaccinated the test obligation can be waived," Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Ministers Conference, told the "Bild am Sonntag".
The elimination of 2G plus for triple vaccines is "not only medically meaningful, but also provides an additional vaccine incentive," Holetschek said.
Federal Minister of Health Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has pledged that "he will make a proposal to the Conference of Health Ministers on next Tuesday".
So I want to send the lamp back
What's the best way to do that?
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me?
I can no longer make a purchase via my #PRS_ORG#.
Oops, there was an error.
Purchasing can be done via the #PRS_ORG# page on your computer.
I have updated my account details.
What could this be?
What you describe is called *awareness*, i.e. sensory perceptions under general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of about 1 to 1000.
It is most common to hear sounds/voices, less often to see images, and most rarely to perceive pain.
Relevant for this topic: C-sections are surgeries that are accompanied by an increased rate of awareness, since a very deep anesthesia is avoided to protect the child until the navel is removed.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during anesthesia interview.
Certain anesthesia procedures such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Dear everyone, this comment from me describes Awareness correctly, but **u/Nitemarex **by definition had none.
I read your comment wrong.
The chair is defective.
The $20 doesn’t help either.
These are statutory warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be to take back the defective chair.
In addition to the legal obligation, this is also standard in the field of eCommerce.
Please check again if you at least take back the defective chair.
We then sell the second chair privately.
We also lose a lot of money.
I have already sent you an email that you have not answered.
Again the question.
In the order and on the invoice it is stated that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The freight forwarder is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
They told me that they only deliver on the doorstep - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I have to cancel the order as I do not know any person who can carry the heavy furniture to the first floor.
Am I not being called?
I had formulated a question
Theatre historian Günther Rühle died at the age of 97
He has established himself as a theatre critic and as a director.
Later he wrote a monumental theatrical story.
Günther Rühle died on Friday at the age of 97.
There is a new book on the table, freshly printed: "An old man gets older".
The shocking diary of a slow departure from the world led by the theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading comes the news that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book is, “I’m here to testify to my life’s gratitude.”
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are europalets, standardized wooden pallets, which are mainly used as cargo carriers in the European area.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL
According to Statistics Austria, more than ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
Production value was well over 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported to Austria annually is not charged
New York wins MLS championship for the first time
New York City FC have won the title in Major League Soccer for the first time.
After the 1:1 in the regular season against host Portland Timbers, the team from the Eastern Conference decided the final in the penalty shootout with 4:2.
In the Eastern Conference final, New York had won against Philadelphia Union, the team of German Kai Wagner.
Roulade Tips & Tricks
I had a lot of great tips here a week ago for the perfect goulash.
This was for Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!
So thanks again for that :)
Now I've come to the taste and want to cook roulades for the first time on New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow I'll set up a cattle fund for it.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I do not have an oven, but just a large pot.
What's the next step?
What about the books and how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is not so good anymore, but I get it
<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>#################################################################
I was already informed by e-mail on 18.01. that the refund was made.
But to this day, I have not received the money.
Please check there.
Where there are Christmas roasts in Lübeck
For many people, goose or duck is one of the Christmas days such as the fir tree and the gifts.
You haven't gotten any poultry yet?
Now the time is running out.
We will tell you where you can get a Christmas roast in Lübeck.
The "drive" of a tube end stage contributes significantly to the heat and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
The VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controls allow you to set the desired level and the level of distortion of your sounds.
In addition, the VT+ series amplifiers offer a unique POWER LEVEL controller, which allows you to reduce the sound level without changing anything about the "gain" and distortion.
The POWER LEVEL controller can even be used to make a power reserve when things are rudely loud.
Thanks to POWER LEVEL controllers, the full potential of the VT+ series can be exploited in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal applied here is processed with a box simulation, so that you get an eminently "acoustic" sound impression even when using a headphone or when recording directly.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX jack, so you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuner.
If you additionally use a VFS5 footbutton, you can also conveniently access the sounds by foot, turn the effect blocks on/off and tap the tempo of the compatible effects.
This is essential for live use.
With its new power packs, VOX takes another step into the future!
I had seen it that way with others.
Is it possible to send the lamp back?
Because it hangs too low for over a dining table?
So I'd like to send her back.
Can you help me with this?
What about the chest of drawers?
Will we receive an update on the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
If you can't, I'd be happy with a discount or voucher.
I may find a buyer for the furniture.
Only over 1,000 euros for goods that I do not need is then a bit much.
I have just received my delivery and would have liked to know if screws were provided as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the provided hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time has not been worth it
Is there a premium customer status with you?
Iran Sees Progress in Nuclear Agreement Negotiations
According to Iranian officials, progress has been made in the negotiations for a revival of the international nuclear agreement.
"Both sides are on the verge of agreeing on the issues that should be on the agenda," Iran's chief negotiator, Ali Bagheri, told Irna news agency on Sunday.
This is a "positive and important development", because at the beginning there was not even a consensus on the issues to be negotiated.
The agreement aims to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks on the revival of the agreement had continued after almost a week of interruption.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, Great Britain, China, France and Russia are taking part in the negotiations.
A US delegation is also present in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now federal state with highest corona incidence
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence in Germany.
As the only federal state, the value is above the 1000 mark.
Thuringia is the only state that has been above the 1,000 mark during the coronavirus on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute stated the seven-day value with 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had always shown the highest incidence in Germany, this figure was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had dropped slightly, but had also been above the value of 1,000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 other deaths related to an infection were reported within a day.
200 severely infected with COVID-19 were treated in intensive care hospitals on Sunday.
Reporting delays may occur on weekends.
In addition, the health offices have been overloaded for weeks and are hardly lagging behind with the acquisition of new cases.
That's what I understand.
Since the delivery is only at the beginning of March, it may be possible until then.
I have to print it out and stick it on the package and deliver it to the post office, right?
I don't have to click/declare/complete anything else here?
That is exactly what I want to avoid, which is why I am writing to you.
I would like to accept the return at my own expense.
8 euro return fee is in my opinion a rudeness.
It's time for change
###MBundestag greeted me, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary room in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
Why the post here?
If you look at the activity in the last months of MBundesdag you can find one thing: it is not existing.
We have come into a winter rigour and have extended the summer hole to a few months.
#Where is the problem?
Yeah, what was it about?
For the most part, this should be simply related to the dissatisfaction with how some things have gone here and how we are in general.
In the last few days, the impression has increased that many people here still really have a problem with MBundesdag.
What we need to change
At this point, the community around MBundesdag is asked who wants to keep it alive.
The impulse came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in the last few days and has found a, simply put, shard pile.
After some writing back and forth, several people from the community have found themselves wanting to rebuild the project.
However, I would also like to expressly call on everyone to participate, only so that this project can continue to exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a discord server, on which we can exchange and work out concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Objectives:
* How should the MBundesdag work in the future?
* What existing orders need to be changed / adjusted / removed?
* How should we act outside in the future?
* How to recruit new members?
How do we create a fair electoral system?
I’m pretty sure I’ve forgotten a lot, but that’s not bad, so we’ve got the Discord at the end.
If you want and have time, come to Discord, work with us and let us decide democratically about the future.
I have ordered a lampshade from you that is still to be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big / bulky for this and not suitable for my taste.
I have already ordered a different suspension from you.
I put it together and then noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope this is returned and I have a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: the blanket #PRS_ORG#, is it also available in oversize, so in 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee that the faulty cabinet will be picked up promptly.
And I ask you to arrange that now.
I do not have a suitable packaging, but I will remove the cabinet for collection as far as possible - you have to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how this can then work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me by phone at any time to arrange a pick-up date.
Is there a manual for the installation?
How long would I have time to get it or decide to return it?
How do you answer the question why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague who I like.
She herself has lived vegetarian for a while, nowadays she probably rarely eats meat.
I was also a vegetarian for a few years.
When asked if I always wanted to be vegan, and vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I honestly answered without much thought.
And that I thought for a long time that as a vegetarian I would support animal welfare, but at some point I reflected and understood that in the end I also support animal cruelty.
That’s why I decided to become vegan.
At that moment I had the impression that displeasure came up on her side, she then defended vegetarianism and told her to know where her meat came from and to reduce animal suffering as a vegetarian.
Now I wonder if my answer was too “plump”?
How do you answer the question?
Feel that as a vegan, you are quickly put in a corner and conflict arises without you putting it on.
It greets a harmony-loving vegan (;
It is clearly not an exception according to <0xC2><0xA7> 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not exempt you from the legal requirements for distance sales.
I am not on the assigned date when #PRS_ORG# picks up my return on site.
Since I can’t be there because of a funeral, this can’t be changed.
Can I please be assigned an alternative pick-up date?

Lahnsteiner Wehr equipped for water rescue: <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> 45,000 grant from the land
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Interior Minister Roger Lewentz in the Lahnstein City Hall handed over a grant notice amounting to 45,000 euros for the new vehicle water rescue of the Lahnstein Volunteer Fire Department to Mayor Peter Labonte.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security.
I am delighted that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate supports us in this,” says Lahnstein’s Mayor Peter Labonte.
The unit wagon is used by the divers' squad Lahnstein, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Over and underwater, they perform tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, one expects permanently increasing stakes: The boom of hotel shipping on the Rhine and Mosel as well as the further increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure river contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
I followed her recommendations but have synced, removed and reloaded the app NOTHING has worked.
I am a bit frustrated because the whole action has taken me a lot of time and now hope for help.
Okay, that's it.
I would like to order 3 items from the collection of #PRS_ORG# for June.
Can I enter an appointment in the ordering process?

First of all, thank you for standing up for the whole thing here, I have also spent almost a decade in government service in a similar activity, that is, we were also armoured in the executive, I don’t want to go into that further!
The question of right and left always seems to me to be very simplified.
In principle, however, it should be said that, of course, the public servant comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum rather than from the revolutionary left, that should actually be clear to everyone.
That of course also in the special uniform and armor bearer people to the right of conservative magic should also be clear to everyone, that these people then of course can tell hard to deal with the lived reality is of course also clear, because you have of course besides the average white, meanwhile many Germans with migration background, women and also homosexuals (and by that I mean I can not put the exaggerated feminine clichérulen even, because there are less in the normal to you.
But even if it sounds weird in my experience, these marginal groups also represent a conservative stance, that is, they are proud of Germany and feel less drawn by exaggerated left-wing politics, even if this policy supposedly works for them or thinks it has to do them well, they simply want to be treated quite normally.
Back to the right, since of course police and armed forces are also a cross section of society, you will also find extreme right there, but that they can openly express their opinion there or even openly forge any state-threatening plans is completely exaggerated and annoys me.
Of course, it happens that even police officers and soldiers who were often in foreign deployment often start to flat-rate because of negative experiences and also sometimes say things that are controversial to politically incorrect.
It also happens that right-wing fellows meet at times who engage in a lively exchange of thoughts.
Nevertheless, in my opinion, this is well combated and also counteracted with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so entangled internationally and that is good in my opinion that we could not afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks at all!
Yes, what I do not understand, I ordered the other basket on the German side as well.
Why would this come from England?
When I ordered it was not sold out.
I ordered it in November.
But it was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order
It is still about my order, which is no longer available.
I've chatted with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, you could still deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# Euro in black to Germany or this basket is also available somewhere in Germany.
I always find only you as a partner company.
but at the top of the edge of the wooden part are two deep notches that were filled with something yellow
and on the mirror itself is a small scratch
Ordinary by child?
Hello, I (w32) have been busy with one thing for a while.
I am very disciplined and organized at work, (I am self-employed, very little free time), but all my life I get it more bad than right to keep my household permanently clean and tidy.
There are always phases in which everything stays, and then and when it grabs me and I clean up and clean up.
But it’s never really like “someone could come to visit spontaneously”.
My husband is (unfortunately) not better either, although it bothers me somewhere but mostly loses household simply against work and discontent.
The kitchen is still the most regularly cleaned as we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to become more decent with child?
We don't have one yet, but we're working on it and this question has been preoccupied with me for a while.
Because for me I have no incentive, it just doesn't bother me so much, as long as no visit comes and e.g. always fresh clothes are there and the kitchen can be used.
Do you have a greater incentive with a child or do you stay sloppy?
I look forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, high-quality and anatomically preformed cut, offers maximum comfort, a perfect fit and thus allows for almost unrestricted freedom of movement.
Preforming with special, further embossing on the joints for improved freedom of movement (on arm and squats)
For the Focea Comfort 4, the Flex System 2 more than doubled the area covered by the Flex System to further increase comfort.
Seamless stretch panels on the joints reduce friction (axles, arms and squats)
High-quality preforms in the lower back area and in the step ensure a tight, perfect fit.
Elaskin 8.8 stretch panel in the lumbar area increases flexibility around the back zip, thereby improving comfort, especially when bending and mounting and applying equipment to the surface.
The Free Flex Zone located around the shoulders and back guarantees increased flexibility when moving the arms and back.
Fireskin is a warming, water-repellent material with a special surface structure that offers a high degree of cold protection.
Positioned on the chest, it brings heat to a sensitive area of the body.
Seamless, thin (-2 mm) sealing on the face on the hood increases comfort, sealing and durability (separate hood)
Soft zone located in the collar improves the sealing with a finely adjustable width adjustment by a flexible, gentle Velcro closure, which does not adhere to the lamination or to the seams
Double zippered cuffs on the arm and ankle joints combine a flippable inner cuff with a soft, laminated neoprene outer cuff
45° notch at the end of the inner cuff for increased elasticity and resilience when tightening.
Long zipper at the neck with an elaskin reinforcement, for an anatomical cut with increased comfort on the overall without hood
Long G-Lock P back zipper (overall without hood) with metal slider and integrated water dam system for improved sealing (Beuchat patent)
Zippers on arms and legs
Neoprene reinforcements at all ends of the zippers to prevent tearing if excessive force is applied.
Neoprene panels flush glued with external and internal overlap
Edges of the outer cuffs lined for greater resilience
Edges of the inner cuffs notched for increased flexibility
The original Beuchat system was designed to fix the computer in its place, especially during deep dives (the system is compatible with all common wrist computers)
Career in social work - as someone with a self-uncertain personality disorder?
I have been training in the field of software development and have now been trained for about a year.
Unfortunately, however, I increasingly realize that this profession is not the right one for me, which is why I have been considering starting again and studying social work for a long time.
The problem: I have a self-uncertain (or anxiously avoiding) personality disorder.
That roughly means that I have no self-esteem and am therefore shy.
I have no problem with talking to people on a factual level, but I find it very difficult to have loose conversations and I have been told many times that I seem inaccessible (though I think that has already gotten better).
Can I become a social worker?
I do not want to work as a street worker or in an open youth meeting, but rather in addiction counseling or family assistance, for example.
However, I do not know if the concrete everyday work is really the way I imagine it, and it is difficult to find something on the Internet.
The <0xC3><0x84>VPS already leads to problems in my job (for me, emotionally), because it pulls me down every time there is something to complain about in my code ("already the simplest things jacked up") and it is difficult for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should now really know how to do it myself" / "I keep him off work with my stupid questions etc."
I will probably have the problems in every profession but I wanted to mention it at the time.
Did you get the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation for that either.
I'm waiting for an appointment for pickup
What do you mean by return please!
If I have downloaded a book to the #PRS_ORG#, the message comes Your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book
Are there any problems?
I was chatting with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my closet.
The protein (protein) absorbed by the feed breaks down the bird in its gastrointestinal tract into the individual protein building materials (amino acids) and in turn builds up its own proteins from these, which it also needs for the formation of feathers.
The formation of feathers in the nestling and the regeneration of feathers in the mowing bird are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high stress for the overall organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio should not be administered during breeding, otherwise there may be disturbances in the breeding process.
Following this curative administration of NEKTON-Bio, NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparation) should be switched back to daily vitamin supply.

1 g of NEKTON organic to 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft food.
It is recommended to prepare only as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change water/feed daily.
A coated measuring spoon (inside) corresponds to 1 g of NEKTON organic.
In case of severe feather damage, double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio may be administered at the beginning until the feather regeneration approach is visible.
Afterwards, the normal dose is taken until the regeneration of the feathers is complete.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry without sunlight, between 15°C and 25°C.
Please apologize, but the chair will be sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair be broken after 9 months?
Warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
This is really very poor service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to inform you that my order has arrived damaged and pictures have been attached.
Did you receive this e-mail?
Declaration of a municipal employee in contradiction to the Statute
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be felled on our property.
So, I'm going to put a trap on the community.
An employee writes to me that the cutting of fruit trees and therefore also the walnut is not part of the statute.
However, the walnut is explicitly stated in the statute as a tree to be protected.
Can I rely on the employee’s statement or not?
On the one hand, I have to be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statute is clear.
Thank you for your replies
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I have not received a message
Well, I still have a sofo without use.
Could you offer me a discount or a voucher?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I believe that, only the question is yes, if I can pay in euros and have the blanket delivered to Germany
Can you check that?
Expedited news: Heavy traffic accident at Selb
Recently, a serious traffic accident occurred on St 2179 between the Selb-Nord and Plößberg interchange.
As the police are currently informed by the press alert (14:03 a.m.), a car has come into opposite traffic when overtaking.
There are wounded.
Ah, okay, I understand.
Well, then thank you again for making it so easy!
Advice and ideas for further professional life
For the first time, Merry Christmas to you!
My Christmas is unfortunately moderately good, because my dear head is just disintegrating everything you can disintegrate.
Before I start here, in short, I need advice and best of all from people who somehow know my situation -- so from you.
I'm just doing the ref as a cross-starter.
Originally, I studied something different and also worked there in one area (to stay at least a little anonymous, I don’t mention anything more precise here).
It was all too boring for me and I was looking for alternatives that could be more fun.
At some point I ended up at the apprenticeship and I was sure that it was - even though the framework conditions are significantly more inflexible than in my previous profession, but I didn't care.
I have now arrived at the third "I google other job listings".
And it's only been six months.
In the paintings before that, I always decided to continue and at least finish the ref, after that I can still turn around.
But right now I'm absolutely done.
I had so little free time last month that I was completely exhausted.
Now it’s vacation, but there’s still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the ref, I always thought I was stress resistant, but my weekend was also my weekend and my workout was my workout.
I was free.
And the stress at work didn’t matter at the moment.
Now the family celebration is too much stress for me.
And then there are those rigid structures that also annoy me.
Basically, it’s fun and from the outside, the ref also runs well in terms of feedback and so on.
But I’m completely exhausted and wonder how much stress my body can endure before it completely tightens – if it’s not already doing it.
I wonder if I would like to have this for the rest of my working life - especially when I read some of your contributions here - or should I not go back to the old area, where I was valued, where I could take my free time when I needed it, and the work was somehow boring, but was adequately paid for and together in a team that has worked out as a single fighter.
But then I wonder if in a year I haven’t gotten back to the same place as I am now and I’m dissatisfied.
You see, it’s all kind of confused, but maybe you, as an outsider advice or ideas, have come out of this situation that I’m completely done and almost at the slightest thought of crying about it.
I’m not going to make decisions so emotionally right now, that probably doesn’t lead to anything good.
But maybe your views help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for the first time.
Thank you for reading and apologize for the weeping undertone of me.
I hope my situation has at least become a little clear.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series by VOX has steadily evolved, which has led to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly replicates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we introduce a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to VET (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of the components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers await with an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
These amplifiers also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because these simply get the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system from which the natural resonances only burst.
With VOX’s “Tone Room” software, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound the way you’ve always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has since been refined several times to meet newly added sound requirements, which in 2010 led to a performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics and more and decisively improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed so that all guitarists looking for maximum sound diversity will find here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a bold sound, a nuanced playback of playing dynamics and string stops, as well as a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the power stage is the main determinant of the tube character of an amplifier, and based on this finding developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology.
Equipped with a 12AX7 tube, the Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier perfectly reflects the behavior, subtle nuances, and tonal characteristics of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic lose to Clippers
The defeat series of the Orlando Magic in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but victory against the Los Angeles Clippers is not enough.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven counts from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104:106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually adjustable and foldable Velcro dividers, it is completely adapted to the needs of your photo equipment and is therefore suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-frame SLR cameras.
What ultimately fits in the backpack, of course, depends on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible fitting would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and a plug-in flash.
Larger DSLM cameras like the different models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still leave room for more lenses.
In addition, you can store a lot of accessories.
And if you have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-Series) you can use the backpack for your equipment and for photography stuff.
Drone pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, because the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcano eruption on La Palma: probably the longest in history
In the almost three months since the eruption, the lava flows on the Canary Islands have caused major damage.
Is there an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the history of the Spanish Canary Islands since Sunday.
So far, the eruption of Tehuya volcano in 1585 was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa with 84 days.
There are no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still-unnamed volcano in Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in recent days, but volcanologists have not dared to predict when it could end.
The indicators indicate a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the president of the island council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to the state television channel RTVE.
Damage in millions
In the nearly three months since the eruption began, the more than 1,000 degrees hot lava has destroyed nearly 2,900 residential and other buildings, RTVE reported.
Almost 1,200 hectares were covered by a metre-thick layer of lava.
This corresponds to nearly 1,700 football fields.
More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Off the coast, cold lava created two new headlands with a total size of about 50 hectares.
It was particularly affected by the banana cultivation, which is extremely important for the island, of which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly and which was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, further areas severely damaged, the newspaper "El País" wrote.
Christmas and the Gifts
Christmas is upon us and the children in particular will be eagerly awaiting the heavenly feast.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension something seductive in itself.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still hold our increasingly divided society together.
It is all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of gifting, so that the gesture of gifting, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-building "societal contract of natural peoples", can escape the rigid routine and be revived in the context of this tradition.
How Nicholas Became the Child of Christ
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who linked the Christmas days closely with the gifting.
In the past, gifts were given in one way or another.
The background of this still popular custom is that as bishop of Myra, St. Nicholas secretly threw three women gold into their windows in one night to spare them another life in sin.
From this unconventional way of giving gifts came the popular custom in Germany to fill the boots with gifts, especially for children.
Protestants stumbled upon this custom because they reject mediators between God and man as "holy worship."
For these reasons, they keep themselves against the institution.
Martin Luther made the child of Christ out of St. Nicholas and thus established a new line of tradition.
The focus of the gift shifted to Christmas Eve.
However, since most Protestants no longer see such detailed questions so closely, it only annoys few that the custom of St. Nicholas is still an integral part of the pre-Christmas season, similar to the Martin custom with Martinssingen and the Martins Parade.
Today, in boots at the door and under the Christmas tree, from socks to coveted luxury watches, you can find everything your heart desires.
Diversity of Traditions in Christian Countries
Sources attest to a tradition of giving since the 13th century on the day of St. Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of gifting was postponed to Christmas Eve.
In all Christian countries, however, there is a cheerful cuddling mumble over the question of who brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the respective region, whether the Christmas Child appears on Christmas Eve or the Santa Claus, who is in principle a kind of Santa Claus, to which some peculiarities have been assigned over time.
These include, for example, his white beard, which has little in common with the rather strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh, which is pulled by reindeer and the preference of the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, St. Nicholas remains the central figure on Christmas.
In Spain, the Holy Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the Child Jesus.
In Scandinavia, mythical creatures sometimes bring the gifts, while in Russia it brought Father Frost to some fame.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull his sleigh as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation in the course of the Hussite wars, the Christ Child is responsible for the handover of the gifts.

Police shoot suspected bank robbers near the Royal Palace
Near London's Kensington Palace, an armed man was shot dead by police on Saturday.
Police said callers reported a man who went into a bank and a bookmaker's shop with a gun.
The man fled, according to authorities, in a vehicle that could be stopped a little later by officials.
Shots were fired and the man was hit.
He was declared dead at the scene.
The police did not come from a terrorist background.
Several embassies are located in the area around Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and the three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which ones?

The decorative luminaire fits harmoniously into any bed, garden area or rock garden.
The luminaire is simply set up and can be anchored in the ground with 2 earth spikes.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Leuchtdauer max. 10 hrs.
- The robust plastic version can be used outdoors all year round.
In the Hollywood spectacle, it is mostly threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow in colour inside.
Smart Stone, on the other hand, is quite harmless: the sun alone ensures that this solar lamp shines fascinatingly – either in white or colored light (in the same six different shades).
The edgeless, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: like a naturally shaped large pebble, this modern light object presents itself by day.
Its organic curves fit into any natural environment – whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stone bed.
He also does well in the vicinity of larger pebbles and foundlings, where he is able to assert himself thanks to his size.
You can save yourself big preliminary work: As a solar lamp, "Smart Stone" does not need a supply line or batteries.
Place the “lighter” in any place that is lit by the sun during the day.
Two ground spikes provided provide a firm hold when needed.
The matt-white plastic case itself is robust and weatherproof.
Its solar module discreetly hides »Smart Stone« inside, along with its battery and two LEDs – one for white, the other for colored light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the case.
In the twilight, Smart Stone starts to glow automatically; in which colour you decide: six attractive light colours are available to you – besides daylight white.
After all, the switch-off also takes place automatically as soon as the battery charge level has dropped to a predetermined minimum or it turns bright again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts from scratch the next day.
I've done this several times, it doesn't work.
Too bad I would have liked to continue ordering from you, but if the voucher is not charged to me, then I will no longer order from principle.

Pill problem
Hello dear ladies,
I hope I do everything right here, after a year reddit is actually my first post.
About my problem: I started taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had so incredibly bad pain during the period and shit PMS before the period.
Now I would like to let that go again, because I already have to take enough medications due to chronic diseases that I cannot choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
At my last roughly two-year break, I had gotten explosive pimples from 0 to 100 and these everywhere.
So superficial, but this puts a lot of stress on me and I didn't feel comfortable.
During the two-year break, the whole thing never really normalized.
Maybe someone has some tips to avoid this this time.
My cosmetics are already perfume-free and without noise, but maybe there is something that someone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, the gynecologist did not take me so seriously and the dermatologist appointment is still coming.
Thank you to everyone who read the novel!
My dear skin is such a thing.
Had pre-bupertary bad neurodermatitis, then a time of rest, then large-scale nodules and the acne theme.
I also tried all kinds of nutrition in the course of chr. disease and stayed stuck on ner sugar, milk and meat-poor mixed foods, because nothing else really worked well.
It may also be good that Hormonell is just the worm in it, but if you like me everywhere construction site you want to rather not go looking for what else goes wrong.
I already had everything her colleague Semina o. <0xC3><0x84>.
Written and now I have lost the conversation and do not know what was answered to my request.
I always have to work in the meantime and on the phone and suddenly everything was gone...
What to check, if the money were there, I would have seen it
Please check my bank details, maybe there was something wrong
But in general, it is large.

110-kV earth cable to be rebuilt in 2022
The approval for the installation of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is final.
The government of Lower Bavaria’s decision to establish the plan paves the way for construction, which is scheduled to begin in 2022.
This was now announced by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven-kilometre-long earth cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable is connected to an overhead mast near the village of Edermanning near Reut.

Ref: Schedule lessons (EK)
Hello ladies and gentlemen,
I’ve been in the ref since summer, teaching is fun for me, but I still have big problems planning my lessons in geography time-efficiently.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well equipped, so in principle I can only use the board, the school book and an OHP as a medium.
In school I can only copy s/w free of charge (which is annoying for geography).
I just need a lot of time to plan my classes.
For example, we are currently doing the topic of geofactors and I actually stand by myself every hour.
In principle, the methods always repeat themselves, but on the other hand, I do not want to invest too much time for simple lessons (I also need them for UBs, etc.).
When planning, I always start from the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build this (mostly I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school does not have).
We have the book Terra and with most of the tasks in the book I am rather dissatisfied.
Hence also the worksheets.
Maybe a geography teacher can help me time-efficiently work with the book.
I'd be delighted.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already decided for a new one at #PRS_ORG# but I would like to process the return as soon as possible.
The trade is afraid because of the 2G regulation around the Christmas business.
In most shops, only who is vaccinated or healed is allowed.
The trade considers this unnecessary and complains of sales drops.
He also has a possible solution.
From the perspective of the German Trade Association (HDE), the 2G regulations are ruining the important Christmas business for retailers.
In the case of business with items of non-daily demand, sales drops are to be complained about, criticized HDE chief executive Stefan Genth.
According to a recent HDE survey of 1,100 traders, more than 70 percent of companies looked negatively at the rest of the year.
A lot of people have already written off the Christmas business.
"What should actually be the positive highlight of the year is now often a hole without a bottom," Genth said.
Merchants with 2G access restrictions lost almost a third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.
It only works well in the food retail as well as in the online sector.
The association demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
Purchasing with mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, the chief executive said.
“2G shopping doesn’t bring us any further in the fight against the pandemic,” he said.
The current regulations discouraged customers and required high personnel deployment.
The ribbon regulation had to be approved nationwide, he demanded.
According to this, each customer would only have to be checked once on 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all stores on that day with the received ribbon.
In addition, in retail - as already in public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested) - sample controls should be sufficient.
The real estate group Deutsche Euroshop, which specializes in shopping malls, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
Without 2G, frequencies were more than 75 percent of the pre-Corona level, and sales were around 90 percent.
These figures will now certainly fall in the midst of such an important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner of the "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high staff and administrative effort, the centers are trying to find solutions and get approved.
This includes the so-called ribbon solution, in which "the visitors, for example, at a central location in the center, provide their 2G proof once and then - equipped with a bracelet similar to a club hotel - can enter all shops undisturbed". dpa
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and on the frame is also an error that was tried to be laminated with a yellow filler.
That doesn't look good.
I would like to return the mirror and have already wrapped it back in the package and glued it.
What should I do for the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high color reproduction.
A modern microprocessor with exceptional possibilities ensures the color temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and store the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in flash memory.
A special feature of the controller, it is simple and intuitive to use.
The luminaire generates a very soft light stream of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The radiant angle of 120 degrees, which allows you to illuminate large areas at a relatively small distance, is excellent.
Incidentally, also in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work on both the film set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows remote control of the luminaire in television studios or when the luminaire is mounted in hard-to-reach places.
At the back of the luminaire is the control panel, it consists of buttons and a luminous display.
The display displays the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
There is also the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included)
The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To perform the settings of the individual settings on the storage locations, simply press one of the storage buttons and finish.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when it is switched off, so that when the lamp is switched on again, the known situation is again - Very convenient for studio work when, for example, the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with battery one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality results from the possibility of operation with cheap NP-F batteries.
These are often already owned by photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can use existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set if the batteries have enough power - it is a battery tester equal to built-in - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two display displays (the left battery top display, the right on the lower display).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously power the headlight via the supplied power supply.
The design of the headlight is very simple.
You have a 16mm sleeve as a connection, so you can directly to your photo stand.
The inclination can be reliably adjusted by means of fasteners on both sides.
It has been taken care that the mechanical components are also extremely high quality and are therefore also designed for durability and hard use.
In addition, a tilt joint is included.
Great is that a bag is also included in the delivery.
This way, you can safely transport or store the luminaire with all the accessories you may still want to buy without any problems.
Too bad I got it and it's too small :(
"Party we wanted to throw away": Frankfurt celebrates against Leverkusen after a bad comeback
What a spectacular response from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last two times in series victorious Hesse were supposedly on their way to the next Bundesliga bankruptcy.
But then the SGE turned up, within a good hour shot the frustration of a thorough start of the season from the soul and won furios with 5:2. "It's madness what the boys did today," coach Oliver Glasner at DAZN cheered and exclaimed a "package of praise, to every single person who was involved".
At first, it looked like a new damper for the Frankfurters, who now rank nine, were still behind their expectations.
Patrik Schick had put the Leverkuseners in the lead with 2:0.
What happened then also impressed the SGE-trainer.
"How the players came back and showed a fantastic performance," Glasner continued.
I am incredibly happy with the performance we have shown and, of course, with the result.
Defensive player Christopher Lenz, who was able to stand back on the pitch for the first time since the fourth day of the match and his overcome muscle injury, also emphasized the morality of his teammates.
"I think our mentality is incredibly big," said the 27-year-old, delighted with a look at the result especially for the viewers.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
However, Glasner now wants to keep the focus on the upcoming tasks, but also sees himself well positioned with regard to the personnel situation.
It’s extraordinary that we’ve all got players fit in December, that all players are physically in a top constitution.
It is top work in our medical department, but also the players live highly professional.
Now they want to "go forward step by step and remain modest" and carry out the tasks "at this level" until the turn of the year.
Next on Wednesday, in the course of the English week, an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30, Sky) is on the agenda.
Gradually I get the mail that my package is coming back to you due to an error on my part.
I tried to call at #PRS_ORG# and have it redirected, no chance.
Can it be shipped directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money is returned and place the order again?
Unfortunately for me, that would mean that I will not order again because it has already taken a very long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Women's handball damper ahead of quarter-finals against Spain
After the humiliation against Denmark, Germany’s handball women crawled from the parquet with their heads hanging and empty eyes.
At the end of the main round of the World Cup, the DHB selection at 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers received a harsh defeat and must now run against host Spain in the quarter-finals.
"We were much too anxious and had too much respect for the opponent," said Bundestrainer Henk Groener.
Against Spain, we have to act differently.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points as second behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a pity we couldn't take the flow with us.
This was a bad game of all that we have to delete," said Captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for the semi-finals, against the 2019 World Cup second, a significant increase must be made next Tuesday in order to keep the delicate dream of the first medal since 2007 alive.
Best German pitcher in a duel with three-time Olympic champion Denmark was back room player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We just weren't there - neither in attack, nor in defense," rear-room player Xenia Smits admitted, demanding: "We have to look forward quickly now."
Not from the front to the back
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not up to the level with the kick-off.
Mistakes and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a quick 0:4 gap after seven minutes.
Only Torfrau Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and prevented worse with a few parades.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a quick match.
However, the expected initial ignition was not.
Against the aggressive cover of the Danes, the German women could hardly put themselves into the scene - and if so, they mostly failed at the strong Althea Reinhardt in the gate of the Scandinavian women.
So the game at 3:10 had started after 20 minutes early, especially since rear-room player Mia Zschocke also saw red a little later due to a hard foul on her opponent.
In the quarter-finals, however, she is allowed to participate again.
Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB selection get a little better into the game and until the break at least five goals.
The already quiet hope of a catch-up after the change was gone after seven minutes at 9:19.
Again, the Groener defenders sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-off opponent, who is one of the medal candidates in the final round.
As a result, the German team was no longer able to achieve an increase in performance and went off the pitch as a clear loser.
Day 6: Family traditions during the Christmas season
As part of the Reddit Advent calendar, we have caught up with St. Nicholas Day and take it as an occasion to dedicate ourselves to family traditions in the pre-Christmas season, Advent, St. Nicholas, Christmas Eve and the Christmas holidays.
How was it in your home back then?
How about your partner?
Do you want to pass on your traditions to your children?
What is most beautiful for the children?
Cleaning the boots?
Biscuits?
Tree decoration?
Is it music?
Is Santa Claus coming, or is the gift from Grandma and Grandpa?
No matter how you do it, everyone is arguing and around Christmas making the effort to have it as nice as possible as a family.
Whether these are solid traditions, or even something different every year: tell us how it went or went in your family!

The title exists, I work as a vaccine doctor in mobile vaccine teams, in which (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is vaccinated, especially in nursing homes.
Since these are soon to be completed to a large extent, it goes on in vaccine centers for me afterwards.
I like to answer questions without a time limit on the organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, as long as these are not related to one personally (e.g. "I take drug X, this is compatible with the vaccination..").
In my area of responsibility falls the education for the vaccination, the indication position (person is entitled to a vaccination according to the corona vaccine regulations and no reasons that speak against it), the medical documentation and, if necessary, the emergency care in case of allergic reactions (I never happened before).
Vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, e.g. medical professionals.
In vaccine teams, however, we often do not have any, but "only" (for God's sake no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the preparation of vaccines, but they cannot (cannot?) carry out vaccinations, so that I also carry out most of the vaccinations myself.
Severe "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the solution
What is a “Hudler”?
With this dialect word, sent in by an Amberger, the BR-TV-show "Wir in Bayern" has caused intense reflection.
But unlike on many previous days, the term in the series "Host mi?" this time remained undisturbed by the callers.
No, it wasn't a "people who are nervous."
And neither does anyone “who has to go all the way fast.”
That, people heard from the TV presenter, was completely wrong.
On which the man from Amberg communicated the solution and thus probably caused astonishment among many upper Palatines.
"The screamer," the spectators learned, "is a rag with which someone wipes out the furnace."
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been interviewed by Bavarian TV as an expert for years, confirmed this.
With the remark that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, derived somehow from the rather well-known word "holder".
This closed an educational gap - probably also for many who have lived in the Amberg area for a long time.
I haven’t been able to buy books in two weeks.
oops - something went wrong - try again later. oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have rebooted the #PRS_ORG# gel#PRS_ORG#n, connected to the PC, synchronized and repaired it.

Tyre choice for the road bike - really that break-proof?
This morning I woke up full of action because I wanted to work out at least a little to prepare for my bike tour next week.
Said, done and I started with my road bike, which I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40km were also really nice - but then what happened in such a city center (this time: Thank you Krefeld!) lurking.
Glass splinters on the track.
Zack, loud sizzling and my rear tyre definitely didn’t want to take part in the rest of the track anymore.
Since I had no real opportunity to get a replacement coat and hose due to the day of the week, I had to turn around again with halfway bad mood and take the first train home.
It wasn’t that bad in terms of mood, maybe it’s better if I practice the tyre change again before the bike tour.
Now I have a question and hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long distance over several days ahead of me, I would be extremely reluctant to get this problem more often.
Now it was really not bad, since also the old tires from the previous owner (very nice old man, the day I picked up the bike came to 2 pm to tear off 120km!) and who had already described them as suboptimal, because he has been driving with them for several years.
But when I think that I still have to make a tire change when driving after 80-90kms, then I think I'm really in a bad mood :D
Now I got into a conversation with an elderly man at the platform, who wondered why I didn’t have the Marathon Plus tyres; these are supposed to be impeccable.
Now, of course, the whole thing sounds very tempting.
But are they really so unstoppable?
I don't want to spend 40 <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>/tyres now, only to be disappointed.
I also wonder: I’m currently on the road bike I think 25x622.
There are also (apparently?) Marathon Plus tyres, but the majority are already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you recommend me on a road bike in general to other tyres?
The Schwalbe page seems to be my absolute! Lay knowledge rather recommends the Durano DD?
Thank you in advance for the help and dear greetings!
Car throws at tree: driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old had hit a central island on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten with his car for an unexplained reason and then hit the opposite lane, the police said.
There was a frontal collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old’s car was then hurled against a tree and the man was clamped in the car.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old passenger were seriously injured in the accident and taken to surrounding hospitals.

After the release of our new high-end broadband B 100- 6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would get offspring again.
SOLO 15 is called the new sprout and visually reminds of the large models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, in this construction proposal, a matchingly designed foot is directly included to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the conditions at home.
In principle, the SOLO 15 is very suitable for people in whom the maximum volume plays a rather subordinate role, but to achieve an exceptionally high level.
A 10 cm loudspeaker is simply unable to produce sound pressure levels almost unfiltered.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, she appears remarkably mature and extremely impressive and accurate for her size.
Tonal the SOLO 15 was tuned with a slight high-pitched rise.
This is generally common in broadbands in order to optimize the bundling that increases sharply too high frequencies.
The SOLO 15 is precisely oriented to the listening area and impresses with its very clear and subtle sound.
Slightly rotated to the outside, the high-pitched area can be reduced and the sound image can be made warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the positioning of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is sharp and astonishingly precise.
The reference suspected extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100-6 OHM ensure a fine dynamics that his likes.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but also extends it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all of our kits, it is advisable to think about the final look of the speaker at the beginning, in order to plan corresponding changes in construction.
If you want to veneer the housings, for example, the lowering of the speaker must be adjusted accordingly, since the veneer applies material again.
After all the plates have been cut (e.g. in the DIY store), you should first drill an 8 mm hole into the bottom plate at the appropriate place, in order to be able to carry out the cable there without any problems.
With the help of an upper milling cutter, the speaker opening in the front now follows, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be used flush later.
At the rear, this opening should be provided with a 45° bevel in order to make the opening area of the speaker chassis as large as possible.
The four screwing points of the B 100-6 OHM are interrupted in the chamfer, as shown in the picture "Detail chamfer".
After that, you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
The back wall, the lid, the front and the bottom are now glued onto them.
The three reinforcements should also be used and glued.
The reinforcements themselves can vary in material thickness if necessary, for example if you want to use finished strips from the hardware store instead of producing them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second side is attached.
Then follow all the plates of the foot, i.e. the two sides, as well as the front.
The mounting of the openings of the bass reflex tube, as well as the connection terminal on the rear wall, is facilitated by means of a suitable perforated circular saw or a forester drill.
A round cutter is then used to round all the edges of the actual box.
The top of the base plate can also be rounded.
Subsequently, the base plate is firmly glued to the base of the housing and additionally screwed with long wooden screws.
This is followed by the recording and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drill bits) of the screwing points of the loudspeaker chassis and the connection terminal.
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (sucking / blowing out), start laying the cable.
The easiest way to achieve this is through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the rear wall.
The entire uncut cable is pushed piece by piece through the 8 mm hole into the foot to the terminal opening and let it stand out there about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the case, you guide the cable to the speaker opening and let it hang out loosely there as well.
In the following, the crossover is prepared and used.
The design plan of the frequency switch, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be taken from the following document:
If the crossover is installed and the connection terminal is screwed, the 8 mm cable opening inside the box is sealed, which is not yet completely closed.
Thanks to the 35 mm BASSREFLEX opening and with some skill, you can drop hot glue on the opening and close it.
The sealing can be checked accordingly by opening the B 100-6 OHM and using a small lamp.
Now follows the damping according to the description.
Subsequently, the B 100-6 OHM is connected and screwed with the corresponding screws.
The polarity plays an important role in this, so that the plus line (marked cable) must be soldered to the plus pole of the loudspeaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is shortened to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and plugged in.
For damping, a mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and distributed loosely in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept free.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered at the beginning of June?
Hello to all of you,
> Finally we can announce that we will host the OSCAST again this year!
> Unfortunately, for known reasons, it is not possible to get more than four people into the studio, which has meant a higher planning effort and explains the short term of the announcement.
BUT: There will be at least three people per switch, so we will be following the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But hey, it’s still a pandemic – yet we’ll do everything we can to accompany the Oscars as entertainingly as possible.
> It will start around 0:30.
Get some cold drinks, plan good food and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
