DFB CEO Grindel sees no basis for <0xC3><0x96>zil comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for a return of Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil to the national team.
“It’s a question that depends, of course, on getting into a conversation, talking to him about why he seems to have felt one or the other as stated in his statement,” Grindel told Bild.
Despite months of debate over the photos of <0xC3><0x96>zil with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the resignation of 92-time national player <0xC3><0x96>zil.
"I would have been happy if Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil had continued to play for Germany.
I also assumed at some point that it would be," Grindel said.
The 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July and also justified this with the fact that Grindel had not defended him against racist hostilities during the World Cup.
The DFB chief repeated his criticism of <0xC3><0x96>zil that he was not ready for a conversation with Bundestrainer Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn't want to build pressure, but he knows it from football so that if "you leave a team or change a club, you talk about it with your coach and I find it a pity that this conversation hasn't come about so far."
Linz: Garden hut in Schrebergartensiedlung burned
At 2.13 p.m., the professional fire department in Linz was alerted to a fire in the Angererhofweg.
Because a high-voltage line leads directly over the Schrebergarten settlement, danger was in default.
The professional fire brigade moved out and found the hut on arrival in full fire.
The roof had to be practically completely removed and fire debris removed to the strictly necessary extent.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had plugged a battery for the store at noon.
This could possibly be the cause of the fire.
In any case, according to the fire department, the charger was in the area with the greatest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire must still be determined - as well as the cause of the fire.
However, it may be considerable, because the owner had many collectibles in his garden hut.
Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on open road
What just drove Lindsay Lohan to this extremely strange action?
She apparently wanted to take the children away from an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") has herself streamed live as she apparently wants to take the children away from a family in Moscow.
This is reported by the US portal "TMZ" and publishes a partial recording of the stream.
"Kissed to Happiness" by Lindsay Lohan
In the clip you can see Lohan getting out of a car and going to a possibly homeless family, which she wants to have identified as a refugee family from Syria.
When the family runs away from the actress, Lohan pursues the parents and their children.
He accused adults of trafficking in children.
There is no evidence for all of this in the clip.
"The whole world is seeing this right now," Lohan can be heard in the video as she continues to follow the family along the street.
Apparently she is trying to separate the children from their parents.
At some point, however, the apparently angry mother seems to be enough.
It looks like she's turning around and Lohan's missing a slap in the ear.
In tears, the actress then asserts how shocked she is - and she holds her cheek.
What led Lohan to this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "Mascot" on the asteroid
The “Hayabusa2” probe was launched in Japan in December 2014.
It is said to be so close to the asteroid Ryugu that it can suck up material from its surface and bring it to Earth.
The lander "Mascot" will remain on Ryugu.
Abroad ticker: number of dead on Sulawesi rises to more than 400
After the 7.5 magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 420 people have died.
The number of victims could increase even further.
The rescue teams have not yet penetrated into the ravaged areas cut off from the outside world.
Elon Musk Resigns as Tesla Supervisory Board Chairman
In the beginning there was a tweet.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk caused stock market unrest in early August when he announced a withdrawal of the electric car maker.
The U.S. Stock Exchange Commission sued him for fraud, but now both have agreed.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and the Tesla CEO is retiring from the Supervisory Board, but he can remain chairman of the board.
Congress of the British Conservatives
Strongly guarded - the party congress of the Tories
Birmingham becomes the stage of a power struggle.
The party congress is supposed to be about foreign policy, trade issues and development policy, but the four-day conference is overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit hardliners, at the forefront of former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson.
Referendum on a new state name
The foreign ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing over these names for years.
Now they have agreed.
The state of Macedonia is to be called North Macedonia in the future and on this Sunday the population votes - if it is all right?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populist Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("The Not") - meant Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood in the country is divided.
Thousands took to the streets in several cities to protest against right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump of Brazil" gives himself as an anti-system candidate and is thus at the forefront of the polls.
His strongest rival is Fernando Haddad of the Left Labour Party.
Audi: "Dieselgate" workup takes longer than planned
"The Diesel Taskforce still exists," said Peter Mertens, chief development officer, to the industry magazine "Automobilwoche".
In December 2017, Rupert Stadler, the detained and retired Audi CEO, announced that the task force would soon be dissolved.
“In the first quarter of 2018, all engine/transmission combinations are expected to be tested,” he said at the time.
Mertens now said: "At the beginning of July, we achieved an important milestone in working out the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analysis of our VTDI engines.
The task force was founded in September 2015 following the discovery of the diesel scandal at the Audi mother Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the carmaker had made “grave organizational changes” so that such a scandal would never occur again.
The VW Supervisory Board postponed a decision on Stadler’s future on Friday and will continue to discuss this Tuesday.
The investigating authorities accuse the Audi CEO of having authorized the sale of diesel cars with incorrect exhaust values after the emission scams became known.
He knew about the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
Currently, Bram Schot, Chief Sales Officer, heads the company as Chief Executive Officer.
Due to the change to the new exhaust gas and consumption test standard WLTP, there are production failures at Audi, said Schot of the "Heilbronn voice".
Basically, he sees a declining demand for sedans such as the Audi models A6, A7 and A8, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment itself is difficult," he said.
Schot relies on electromobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi electric car, there were already 15,000 reservations.
Grindel strives for re-election - Lahm to join the DFB-Präsidium
Mainz (dpa) - Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the <0xC3><0x96>zil affair, Reinhard Grindel wants to run for the office as DFB president again next year.
"I'm doing my job and trying to do it as well as I can," Grindel said as a guest on Sunday morning at the ZDF's "Current Sports Studio".
You have to try again and again to get re-elected, I will.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
In his own words, the head of the association would find it "strange" if he did not "have the desire to work on the future project" after the award for the European Football Championship 2024.
Grindel has been head of the association since April 2016 as the successor to Wolfgang Niersbach, who was overthrown over the summer fairytale affair.
In autumn 2016, he was elected for a first full term of three years.
The next vote will take place at the DFB-Bundestag on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, the future head organizer of the European Championships, Philipp Lahm, will be working in the DFB-Präsidium.
"I would be delighted if my colleagues in the Bureau agree that he will continue to advise in the Bureau in this role and then, of course, will be cordially invited to provide his experience on sporting issues," Grindel said.
He did not want to take part in speculation as to whether Lahm could be his successor as DFB boss.
As a consequence of the affair about the photos of Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that in the future a national player without a migration background should become the integration ambassador of the DFB.
Currently, this office is held by the Brazilian-born Cacau and Celia Sasic, the latter having family roots in Cameroon.
“If someone without a migrant background clearly affects society and football and says, ‘the issue is important, we have to take care of it,’ that would also be an initiative to provide a better foundation for our clubs on the ground, where integration must work,” Grindel said.
Properly lose weight with a semi-smart scale
I have had a new toy for four weeks.
A scale that not only measures my weight, but also the body fat percentage.
It can also show muscle and bone mass.
The body mass index also calculates the thing, but it's more for the sausage.
Doesn't he say anything about whether I replaced fat with muscle?
Basketball-Bundesliga: A clear start for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin has started with a clear victory in the new season of the Basketball Bundesliga.
Against Science City Jena, the vice-champion easily won with 112:55 (52:31) and offered a convincing game over 40 minutes.
Rokas Giedraitis was the top scorer of the dominant Berliner with 20 points.
The international player Johannes Thiemann (18 counts) from Ludwigsburg also showed an appealing performance in front of 9113 spectators during his mandatory game debut.
Ex-Champion Brose Bamberg won in the mandatory game debut of coach Ainars Bagatskis with 84:80 (39:37) at s.Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was the best pitcher with 24 points.
Würzburg-Profi Gabriel Olaseni scored 14 points.
Last year’s playoff semi-finalist MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg defeated the Fraport Skyliners from Frankfurt with 83:76 (41:34).
New national player Karim Jallow was with 24 points the most reliable shooter on the team of coach John Patrick.
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg started the new season with a clear success.
At Basketball Löwen Braunschweig there was a clear 100:64 (48:30) and the first two points.
The new gamemaker Will Cummings outperformed the Oldenburgers with 25 counters.
The Braunschweig, where NBA star Dennis Schröder has been the majority owner since the start of the season, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26:1 run of the baskets quickly ensured clear conditions.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an had previously met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his three-day state visit.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an called on the German government to extradite supporters of the Gülen movement living in Germany and take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens no matter where they live.
We will not allow sympathizers of the PKK or the Gülen movement to shake our citizens and harm the German-Turkish friendship," he said.
For the opening of the Ditib mosque, the Cologne city centre had been partially closed.
Several thousand police officers were deployed, including snipers.
The Islam Association Ditib is criticized for being regarded as an extended arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music Against Poverty: Stars, Buhrufe and Horror Seconds
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have joined forces at a concert in New York’s Central Park to promote greater engagement in the fight against poverty and disease.
"Engage wherever you can," Mendes said at the festival in the night to Sunday in front of around 60,000 spectators.
Thank you for coming here, it's a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with fringes and golden microphone.
I’m nervous, I’m sweating, but it’s okay because I’m here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid organizations, also appeared on stage at the multi-hour spectacle.
In the meantime, however, there was a moment of horror when many spectators thought the sound of a falling metal barrier was shot, got scared and tried to flee.
Shortly after, panic arose, people ran into confusion.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, the organizer Hugh Evans said.
The New York police and musician Chris Martin then calmed the people from the stage.
“No one is trying to hurt anyone,” Martin said.
You're all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available free of charge on the Internet as every year.
Anyone who wanted to get one had to read and disseminate texts, photos and videos on the Internet about the global fight against poverty and disease.
For the numerous musicians and actors, there was cheering and applause from the audience - but buhrufe for Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
He, along with his Democratic colleague Chris Coons, spoke on the stage for more equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake had ruled on the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a judge at the Supreme Court, thus pounding many women in the head.
At least three women have made allegations of abuse, including attempted rape against Kavanaugh, which Kavanaugh denies.
Flake called for an FBI investigation into the allegations after he was confronted in an elevator by two women who reportedly experienced sexual assault themselves on their way to the committee meeting.
"You can also come together with me in an elevator at any time," Flake said to the crowd at the concert in New York.
Freedom of the press: German government defends eviction of journalist
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert has defended the expulsion of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an.
In the chancellery, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had worn a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for Journalists" and had gone into the first row.
The T-shirt was not the problem, said Seibert to the picture on Sunday.
It was a disturbance in the course of the press conference.
As a result of the action of the journalist, there was a strong unrest, which was unacceptable.
He then ordered the guards to take the man out.
Seibert said that it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellery.
This is true regardless of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
In Turkey, many journalists are in prison.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage or support or membership in prohibited parties or the Fethullah Gulda movement.
The Turkish leadership blames the movement for the failed coup attempt on July 15, 2016.
Some of the accused journalists face several decades of imprisonment.
Even foreign journalists are not sure of the Turkish authorities: It was not until the beginning of September that Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested.
Recently, the cases of detained journalists Me<0xC5><0x9F>ale Tolu and Deniz Yücel caused a stir.
Although they were released and were able to return to Germany, trials are still ongoing in Turkey against the two.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him as fresh and good-looking: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look twice: yes, that’s really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The NDR-produced talk show "Inas Nacht" is known for cheerful conversations at the counter of the Hamburg harbour pub "Schellfischposten".
Moderator Ina Müller meets her guests with some beer, some wine or even high-percentage drinks to relax the mood and tongues.
Not a few celebrities also drink courage for the mandatory singing entries.
On Friday, another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time: The actor Florian David Fitz known from films such as "Men's Hearts", "Terror - Your Judgement" or "The Horniest Day".
However, the Munich trip to the far north was not good at all.
On Saturday he posted a selfie - his face is completely crumpled on it, his eyes just two small slits.
The bed selfie shows a completely drained Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick, he's just got a powerful hangover.
Addressed to his fans, he posted some - probably not quite serious - insights that he has now gained: "Rule one: NEVER go to Ina's night.
Rule two: Never drink the black sow.
And Spritz.
And the round egg liqueur, which Ina throws at half past three, also leaves out.
Alcohol consumption is really written in the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans immediately posted a few tips to combat the aftermath.
They ranged from instant broth, fish buns or - probably the most effective - headache tablets.
Others simply amused themselves at the sight of the normally attractive movie star.
How Ina Müller survived the nightly soup is not yet known.
Since she has been moderating the TV fun at the counter since 2007, however, the 53-year-old seems to be significantly more tried and tested...
A beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa is struggling with vandalism and mischief
The entrance to the 36-kilometre-long railway cycle path in Red Riding Hood Country in Treysa is difficult to find and wasted.
Recipes against the rampant vandalism are being sought, but solutions hardly emerge.
Shards, cigarette tipping, garbage and garbage, demolished garbage bins and now dismantled signposts - this is how the entrance with seating group to the bike path on the Haaße hill in Treysa has been presented for a long time.
For the showcase object Railway Cycle Path in the Red Riding Hood Land a more than glamorous sight.
The topic has been a concern for members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt but also for others for a long time, according to the cycling traffic officer of the city of Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem had already been addressed in the Cycling Advisory Council.
There is no solution so far.
The proposals ranged from the relocation of the seating group to the regular emptying of the waste containers and cleaning of the areas at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the order of the hour - regardless of possible further activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that he also brought the issue to the local advisory board.
Not only the garbage drives cyclists and local residents around - the seating group is a regular meeting place for celebrations on weekends.
Not only is it often noisy, but it is also destroyed in the layings: posts torn from the ground, trash cans demolished, signs bent over, seats smeared.
Volunteers had already cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
The actions, however, are only the proverbial drop on the hot stone.
You are annoyed that the resting place on the bike path in Treysa is a meeting place for soda.
"Along the entire cycle path, the focus here is clearly on the Haaße hill," confirms the Cycling Commissioner, who is now also concerned about the new cycling site in Ziegenhain, which will be opened today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it will be really expensive".
Another idea is a video surveillance on the hill: "Maybe that sets the threshold significantly higher to violate common property.
This would, however, presuppose that a police patrol would pass by soon.
Basically, Wüstenhagen wants a development of the Haaße hill.
It needs to be made more attractive.
In fact, one can be very satisfied with the frequency of the cycle path so far.
Tourist marketing is still expandable.
Our bike path is of very high quality compared to other in Germany," said the ADFC members.
As an extremely critical point of danger, ADFC member Susanne Klippert appreciates the situation in the Asheröder Straße in Treysa.
There is no turning lane on the Haaße hill.
In the case of busy traffic, it may happen that cyclists have to wait in the middle of the road between the two sides of the traffic flow," she explains.
This is not a problem for athletic drivers, but it is a problem for older drivers and especially for children.
Music contest at the Kulturbahnhof: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and collaborative.
"D a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the district offensive Hiltrup, in the "Music Contest for big and small, young and experienced musicians".
A contest "with winks in the sympathetic Hiltruper family", as Karl Franke formulated.
In fact, it was soon a family gathering with coffee and cake from the volunteers of the Kulturbahnhof.
Seven formations took place, from the one-man band to the large ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Imhig, a long-lived Albachener finally, the nine of the "Hilttruper Sternfarben", three members and three generations of the families Trenkamp and Claus, an ensemble of children and Lussland.
This contest, District Mayor Joachim Schmidt explained, was a novelty.
We have not seen this in other parts of the city.
What did the writers see themselves connected to?
The Hiltruper See and the Marktallee were mentioned particularly frequently at the places.
Rolf Ihmig named the alley "Kö von Hiltrup" in his beater-like song.
The cultural station was also honored.
Again and again it was about experiencing each other in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke revived the short renovation breaks with short interviews with the artists or hints on their work.
Humberg learned that he actually studied chemistry, but now also teaches guitar.
Franke knew about the sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann that he had recently performed in Ludwigshafen - at a major event of BASF with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic, meanwhile, has placed all sorts of on Youtube.
"It's not about winning," Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper gastronomy.
There was something special for the favourites of the jury - so that others can also hear their songs.
A whole CD can be recorded by Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Ihmig with his Hiltrup beat, which impressed Franke especially with his musicality, and the "Lummerland pack": "a very nice performance" with ten children and two teachers of guitar and cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like all of them, the children performed again at the finals - and even sounded "very good" without electronic support, as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, catchyness of the melody and recognizable value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller from the Westphalian School of Music, Andreas Klomfass from the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Wirtschaftsverbund, as well as Jan Kaven, chairman of the district offensive.
The district offensive had launched the event on the occasion of its ten-year existence.
She valued the event as a complete success.
Everyone was "very satisfied" and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very full cultural station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams that sit opposite each other.
For each page there is a screen, in it four cards with keywords, which you can not decipher - the old trick with the red foil - until you have put them in.
This ensures that the other side cannot read anything even by mistake.
For example, the maps read from left to right: "1st Renaissance.
2nd window.
3rd cube.
4. Fest".
These are the terms that need to be encrypted from now on.
This is because we are not supposed to guess the terms, but the codes.
Alternately, one player per team is the encryptor.
He gets a code card that might say "3.4.2.".
In "Decrypto" you should guess not the terms behind the secret film, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case: to describe the terms "cube", "fixed" and "window" in this order and in this example, so that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team does not; this is what wins the game if he manages to crack the code twice.
So the encryptor writes and reads aloud: "Throw" for the dice, "Lose" as opposed to Fest; here, of course, something like "Party" would be possible and "Prague" because he has watched in school and knows the window fall there.
This is how it goes round by round, team by team.
You do not know the terms of the opposite side - but it can be better matched with every indication that the encryptor gives there.
As mysterious as possible, but not too twisted, the rewrites should be, otherwise you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
Unfortunately, the most cryptic thing about "Decrypto" is the rule book.
The players will probably have to study it for quite a long time and in detail until they can finally play.
The explanation video at decrypto.info on the web makes it easier.
But once you get started, you will be intrigued by how much emotion there is in this inconspicuous game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not quite as conclusive as its predecessor and genre-prime "codenames", which also puts an agent theme on a game few words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And who is only about guessing and not about winning points, can also easily invent a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows police Hitler greetings and harasses guests in the pub
A 48-year-old man employed the police inspection Kulmbach in the night from Saturday to Sunday equally double.
First he showed the Hitler greeting in the Upper City to a passing police patrol, then later he also noticed in the Upper City in a pub when he was harassing other guests.
After he failed to comply with the police's place assignment, he had to spend the night at the Kulmbach Police Inspectorate in the detention cell.
In the sober state, he must then also be held criminally accountable for the use of license plates of unconstitutional organizations.
Betriebswerk Pressig was home to the Schubloks
The railway plant in Pressig was the hub in the Frankenwald for decades.
In 1991, a piece of railway history ended.
"When buffers pounded at buffers, it was heard in a very pressing way," recalls Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the station.
That didn't bother anyone.
The brakes were also squeaking and the wagons were crackling.
It was pure railroad.
Statements that symbolically stand for Dinkel’s home Pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was a place so shaped by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the steep ramp mountain route to the north, which after an ascent of about 220 meters has its vertex in Steinbach am Wald.
To cope with this, train and shovel blocks were needed in the past, which had their home in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian Landtag approved the construction of a railway workshop with 21 locomotives, apprenticeship workshop, traineeship and railway mastery.
"Heartpiece was the turntable that had a diameter of 18 meters after a conversion in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, railroad historian and professional railroader for 47 years.
The Pressig Railway Company (BW), which was placed under the control of Bamberg in 1968, also operated locomotives for the tributary lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben.
On July 15, 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported on a staff of 160 men; 13 steam and eight elloks were stationed in Pressig at the time.
The electrification of the line in 1939 already minimized the need for train and draw blocks.
From 1977, they were only used on freight trains.
By 1991, there were at least 10,000 weighings per month.
Parts of the plant were demolished in 1982, the rest in 1991.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that you have not envisaged a better use of the site, also in terms of freight transport".
On Pentecost 1989, the Nuremberg Railway Directorate celebrated a pompous station festival in Pressig on the anniversary of "50 years of electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld".
"There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here," Georg Dinkel recalls.
A little later the off.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were withdrawn, the Rangierbahnhof Pressig was history.
"The rangers and shoemakers did the most difficult work in train traffic," Dinkel recalls.
Any mistake would have had fatal consequences.
Why the station Pressig-Rothenkirchen led to the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many other historical and current images can be found here in the infrankenPlus article.
Notch with kick-off success at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round of the tennis tournament in Beijing, just like Julia Görges.
Kerber won the China Open 6:2, 6:2 against the Frenchwoman Kristina Mladenovic.
Next opponent of the world ranking third is either Julia Putinzeva from Kazakhstan or the Spanish Carla Suárez Navarro.
Siegemund led 6:3, 4:2 against Darya Kassatkina, when the Russian placed at number 13.
The Swallow is now dealing with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
As part of the series "Art and Pleasure", a special exhibition was opened at the weekend in Mittelehrenbach.
With great relief, registered organizers and visitors watched the ideal weather when the Special Vernissage "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the outdoor area of the property Dahlmann-Schmidt, Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the umbrella of the tourism association "Runds ums Walberla" as part of the series "Kunst und Genuss".
It opened its doors in the 15th year.
A large number of visitors showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 copies of 20 artists can now be visited in Mittelehrenbach.
Hausherr Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to the opening of the vernissage.
He himself has been there since the first hour.
Like Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as the main organizer and artist alike.
Something surprising, but Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, however, he placed his task in tried-and-tested, young hands with good prospects for the future.
In the past, both have already actively participated in the selection of the artists and contributed to the design of flyers.
Once again this year, on the occasion of Kunst & Genuss, there will be a 70-cent special stamp designed by them, available at every art station.
This year's poster "Betzen austanzen", designed by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased for eight euros.
Hahn was delighted with the high approval of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg could be won for the musical framing.
As you walk through the spacious garden, the visitor quickly realizes that the title "Windspiel-Performance" formally challenges artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it playfully.
There are works of art made of metal or ceramic, often with colored accents.
Already at the entrance of the property awaits the visitor on the right side of the "Glücksbaum" by artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree stump, brightened in color, playfully provided with 20 windwheels, 24 horseshoes and 24 aluminum tubes as a sound piece.
With the sun shining through the bushwork in the background, the object looks fairy-tale and invites you to linger.
From Eckental comes Barbara Waschneck, who prefers to dedicate herself in three-dimensional letters to the event 15 years K&G.
There are many parts moving in the wind.
Halfway through, Siegrid Frey from Eckental exhibited her work "The Wind the Heavenly Child".
And at the end of the area, Volker Hahn shows his colorful fantasy structures made of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The theme "Windspiel-Performance" for strolling through the versatile art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited until 31 December 2018.
50 Years of MGV 68 Albachten: Singer Celebrates 50th Birthday
1968 - that was the time of protest and the student movement.
And the Alchemists also made air of their displeasure at that time.
At least five of them.
They did not want to accept the fact that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cäcilia" there should be no more singing life in the district.
In the meantime, it has become a legend: At a bench in the tin bush they lifted the MGV 68 albatross from the baptism.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated in the "House of Encounter".
"It's going to be full today," President Jürgen Holstiege suspected, and he should be right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albachener singers.
Especially for the anniversary, they had revived the foundation festival.
For years it was a tradition, then there was a break.
Just in time for the 50th anniversary, the traditional festival was back.
An elegant ball it was asked for festive clothes had been previously.
The guests did not sit in rows as usual in the "house of encounter", but cozy at tables.
In the meantime, movement was needed: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln put on the controls and prayed on the dance floor.
It is an honor that the singers of the MGV 68 Albachten had their own voices.
Suitable for the occasion were cheerful songs.
He said, “A day as beautiful as it is today.”
Fitting with the exquisite grape juice that many had in front of them, there was the "Rüdesheimer Wein".
In reference to another cool drink, "Humulus lupulus" sounded, which is the Latin term for "hope".
Once again, the choir leadership of Richard Homann was sovereign, who is one of the five who were in the tin bush at the time.
"It's just fun to sing under his direction," Holstiege said, "he has such an easy way, it's a masterpiece he does." By the way, this time, not only men presented themselves singing.
The women's choir "Hohes C" was also a guest, whose repertoire mainly includes evergreens from the 20s to the 60s.
Finally, there was poetry.
Singer Theo Weber had sat at the desk until three in the morning to create his own rhymes.
And Andreas Winterhoff also presented well-sounding poetry.
There was also a big tombola.
The proceeds will be used to fund the children of the Albatros Youth Center a visit to the All-Weather Zoo.

Volleyball: 3rd League Women: USC II wins high-class derby against BW Aasee
The Ascendant marches.
Three games, three wins - the reserve of USC Münster under the patronage of Axel Büring is quite right in League three.
No trace of shyness or frack sauces, the independents do their thing.
And that at 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against city competitor BW Aasee really good.
"That wasn't crystal clear, but we've already left an impression," says the fairly satisfied coach.
BWA coach Kai Annacker immediately agreed: "This is a defeat that we can live with very well.
We are not dissatisfied." On the contrary.
In the evening at a subsequent birthday party of Ronja de Boer, the mood was good, the game cut off.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical deception.
In the third set, the guests had a set ball.
"If they bring it to the finish line, a game like this can tilt," Büring knows from years of experience.
Eventually, the USC, with its routine forces, cleared everything up and brought the full yield to the goal.
"We are all aware of who is on the other side in such a derby.
That doesn't break our neck.
I've seen really good volleyball phase by phase," Annacker did not have a 0:3 problem - and immediately moved on to the agenda.
Where the journey for the independents is going does not seem to be foreseen after just three game days.
“It’s just too early for that,” says Axel Büring.
Only in one he feels confirmed: “The 3rd league has an incredibly good level.
This is not nearly comparable to regional league volleyball, but they do not want to look downwards in the fourth league.
If the vest is not dirty in the next few weeks, they have to look up.
However, an initial balance can only be drawn after ten, eleven games.
On Saturday we go to Emlichheim.
Aasee will take place in Essen on October 14.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the "Dreamship" Heide Keller became a star.
Now she speaks openly that the series may have had a complicity in her marriage-out with Hans von Borsody.
Her role as the chief hostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the "dream ship" made Heide Keller famous, but on January 1, 2018 she disembarked forever.
The series that made her a star could be partly responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with whom she was married for ten years.
“That could have been a reason.
Because I grew up with this work, traveled around the world alone with a suitcase and many of my admired colleagues perceived me on an equal footing," says Keller in a conversation with the "Bild am Sonntag".
At first, she was only "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that changed with the "dream ship".
Because now the journalists only called to Heide Keller.
"Whether he liked it so much, I don't know."
She believes it is possible that her husband at the time might have been quite jealous, but "as many men, Hans also shunned conversations about problems and feelings".
Keller has always tried to be the only one for Hans von Borsody and he didn’t want to know my fears, my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I have misplaced myself," as she explains further.
She has always felt “not good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman who I never really was, even though I sometimes seemed naughty and brave on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever.”
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller once again said yes, "although I was afraid that things might go wrong a second time."
The day before the civil wedding, I was sitting in the cloakroom crying and wanted to cancel everything.
Borsody's marriage also failed.
Why didn’t they ever work out with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller had imagined the love at the time "as in the movie.
Unfortunately, this vision is not suitable for everyday use.
I approached love far too naively."
The nightbird, who regularly explores the nightlife of the city in the NZZ resort of Zurich, has dared to attend the ZFF opening party this time.
Our falter is not a moth, but still a little shy of light.
And the glare in which a green carpet is dipped in the six-layered place dazzles him overwhelmingly.
But it’s still a film festival, where more or less famous people want to sunbathe in the spotlight.
So he drizzles over the square on this late Thursday night to relax in the "Aquaclean toilet oasis".
This is the name of the public toilet system sponsored by a large sanitary company, which celebrates its premiere at the festival: The need facility on the ground floor of a new pavilion is making a lot of effort to create a luxurious ambience.
On this evening, however, it stinks in the men's oasis for some reason to the sky.
So get out of here, over to the other side of the street: Invited guests, who have just entertained the opening film "Green Book" at the best level in the cinema next door, celebrate the start of the festival with a party in the three-storey department store.
Its name fits perfectly with this film festival: It is well known that the works shown come from all over the world.
What you don’t have to think of when you write an article about this festival, so that you don’t fall into sneaky advertising for its 190 partner companies.
The falter ties up a ribbon around the probes, which has given him a good fairy, and two bully doorkeepers actually wave him in generously.
Inside, the invited people push themselves, they dance long after midnight to live music or let themselves be presumed by DJ rhythms, to which they scream at each other, and flush down with Cüpli exquisite snacks.
In the delicatessen shop in the basement, oysters are waiting for sipping mouths, next door the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut, a chocolate fountain bursting.
And the hammer is: All the sales shelves full of exclusive products have not been cleared for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without major losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The falcon studies the sign at the escalator: "Wear a long dress, please be careful on the escalator".
If these are two separate instructions, he has missed out on the dress code.
But it's more of a conditional construction, and it certainly saved lives.
In the household goods department upstairs, the poultryman tilts an espresso-cooked cocktail called "Golden Eye", matching the festival award.
The price for the best drink is not necessarily given to this mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself.
And George Clooney, who has been promoting the brand for years, is not here that evening either.
But there, between local celebrity, cash desk and kitchen items, passes a face that seems familiar to the observer: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
His main character may not be far away.
And really: Viggo Mortensen, soon to be sixty, walks through the crowd almost like a choir boy.
It's not squatted, it's not squatted, it's squirmed at most.
Especially for this restraint, like to be misunderstood as a compression, international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with cumbia dances
Coach and former football star Diego Maradona is delighted with the victory of his team.
Argentina's football legend Diego Maradona seems to have settled well in his new home Mexico.
After a 2-0 win by his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced to cumbia rhythms with a player in the cabin, as seen in a video released on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a team member, Maradona dances in a yellow jersey, cheered by the players.
The Mexican second league champion defeated the Leones Negros on Saturday by 2:0.
After the game, Maradona called in a TV camera "Always with my boys, always".
The 57-year-old has been training the Mexican club since the beginning of September.
Handball: Verbandsliga 1: ASV Send to last-minute bankruptcy "destroyed on the ground"
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball league ASV Send, could hardly believe it: "So a bitter defeat". His defenders were "destroyed" after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) - bankruptcy - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday evening at LIT Germania 2.
As in Steinhagen, as against Hullhorst, they had not played badly over a long period of time, the transmitters.
Only the initial phase "we have completely slept," the ASV coach annoyed himself.
The owners quickly led with 8:1, even the early break that Bieletzki had taken did not bear fruit at first.
"But then suddenly a shudder went through the team," Bieletzki summarized the second quarter.
At the break, the draw was only two more goals.
Above all, Sending's best, Marius Hintze, hit once in a while in the phase.
After the change, it became even better from the visitor’s point of view.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst was eliminated at 15:15, after which the relay changer performed almost consistently.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still a seemingly reassuring three hits (29:26).
What then?
Let the impartial take action.
Bieletzki usually avoids finding fault with others.
But: The 120-second time penalty that Steffen Mühlhoff received "was a joke".
LIT had a good laugh and hit four more times until the end - while the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The boys fought great, stood well against seven men in the back and repeatedly threw on the empty gate.
Only they can buy little for the compliments.
"Now there must be a damn victory," Bieletzki said.
ASV gates: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Hüging (1).
Bavaria: Woman missing for 30 years - police dig for body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of an 18-year-old from Naila, the police search for the woman's remains.
On Saturday, police dug up a road near Marxgrün.
For this purpose, the road surface and several layers underneath were removed, as police and prosecutors jointly announced.
According to new findings, the missing person may have been buried not far from their home at the time.
The woman has disappeared since November 4, 1986.
The investigators did not rule out a crime at the time.
Since last year, the Criminal Police Court has been working together with the prosecutor’s office, according to the information, once again intensively on the case.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Heritage Protection Agency, the investigators encountered an abnormality under the road near Marxgrün by means of a ground radar.
With the help of a dog trained on the smell of human bones, the officials limited the place to a few meters.
The results of the excavations should be announced during the afternoon.
The hacker attack on millions of Facebook users shows the dangers lurking on the net.

In addition, security updates, such as for Windows, should be installed quickly, and it does not harm to equip computers with anti-virus protection.
Elon Musk, founder of electric car manufacturer Tesla, has escaped his threatening resignation as head of the billion-dollar company.
He and the SEC filed an out-of-court lawsuit over misleading Twitter messages in which Musk could have lost permission to run listed companies.
As part of the deal, Musk and Tesla will pay $20 million each, and Musk will resign the chairmanship for three years, a position comparable to that of the German Supervisory Board.
The Chief Executive Officer may remain against it.
In the comparison, which still has to be confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla admitted wrongdoing.
The SEC had sued the world-renowned manager before the U.S. Federal Court of Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, who also heads the space company SpaceX, is the public face of loss-writing electric car pioneers, now valued at more than $50 billion on the stock exchange.
Musk is not to blame.
Musk said he had done nothing wrong and was sad and disappointed with the complaint.
He has always acted in the interests of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk had written to his more than 22 million Twitter followers that he might take the company off the stock exchange, paying $420 per share, the financing is secure.
Tesla was valued at $72 billion.
Later, Musk rowed back: Tesla remains on the stock exchange.
After the agreement, Tesla will now have to find an external chairman, hire two independent board members, and also set up a committee to oversee Musk’s communications.

Record champion Manchester United is sliding deeper into the crisis after the worst start of the season since 1989.
The team of controversial coach José Mourinho lost to West Ham United earning 1:3 (0:2) and remains only in the table midfield with ten points after seven match days.
Pressure on Mourinho will continue to grow before the Champions League match against FC Valencia on Tuesday.
Former Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno came to his first Premier League deployment after an injury to Petr Cech.

The dance expert has become known through the RTL show "Let's Dance".
After 13 years of marriage, Joachim Llambi (54) and his wife Ilona (45) are now separated.
The "Bild am Sonntag" (Bezhalinhalt) reports on the separation of the well-known moderator and dance expert, citing Llambi's lawyer.

Polls: 46 percent do not want Merkel as chancellor by 2021
After the quarrels of the past few weeks, the GroKo has received several survey lows.
The SPD falls behind the AfD in a survey - Angela Merkel is seen critically.
Berlin - The AfD has overtaken the SPD for the first time in the Emnid Sunday trend for the Bild am Sonntag nationwide.
In the weekly survey of the opinion research institute, the AfD increases by a counter to 17 percent, the SPD gives a point compared to the previous week and lands at 16 percent.
The CDU and CSU also lose a counter and only reach 27 percent.
This is the lowest value so far for the Union in the Sunday trend.
The Greens reach 15 percent, the Left 11 percent and the FDP 10 percent.
If the federal elections were held on Sunday, the ruling parties SPD, CDU and CSU would get only 43 percent of the votes, according to Emnid.
This means that the great coalition has lost the majority in the Sunday question at all major research institutes, with the exception of Allensbach.
The ruling parties consistently get 43 to 45 percent of the vote (Allensbach: 51 percent).
In the 2017 federal election, they received 53.4 percent.
The bandwidth of the other parties is also large: the AfD, the second-strongest party in several polls, comes to 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens achieve a vote share of 12.5 to 17 percent.
The left is on average at 10 percent, the FDP at 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such surveys have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent up and down, depending on the percentage of votes.
But the support for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has also declined significantly since the 2017 federal elections.
Currently, only 48 percent of citizens think that Merkel is the right person in the chancellery, as the Emnid survey on behalf of BamS revealed.
According to the survey, only one in two (50 percent) currently wishes for the large coalition to hold the next regular federal election in three years, while 41 percent are in favour of a new election.
In a further survey published on Saturday, Merkel’s popularity had also been markedly diminished.
The Germans are also divided on whether Merkel should run for the CDU presidency again in December.
According to Emnid, 47 percent are in favour, while 44 percent are against.
According to the report, 64 per cent of EU supporters want a candidate, 35 per cent do not.
Exhibit at Aldi: Reduced price for happiness in love
Is Aldi going to be Tinder 2.0?
Whoever says that in times of Tinder there are no more romantic acquaintance stories - he should talk about turkey meat at Aldi.
In times of digital "fast food dating" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket as a place to get to know the great love radiates almost an anachronistic romance.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced turkey meat, boxer shorts bargains at the voluptuous table or the favorite pudding is doubtless still a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere swipe to the right.
The app Tinder has a reputation for being less a contact, but rather a slippery exchange.
We have dared the test: how do women react if they don’t talk about the hot stuff in the first message for a long time?
Here is the amazing result.
It has regular Hollywood love story potential when love luck precedes an out-of-the-eye-lost-and-recovery plot.
If the guy then also comes to his loved ones at the email address bio-putenfleisch<0x40>gmx.de, then that sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and consorts - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
So it is the author of this ad in an unknown Aldi store that she will certainly wish that she will find her dream man, with whom she has conversed briefly about the "30 percent reduced organic beef".
For believing in the magic of analog learning, she definitely deserved her happy ending à la Hollywood.
Billerbeck: 500 lids for a life without paralysis
Since the beginning of the new school year, the Ludgeri School has participated in the action "Lids against polio - 500 lids for a life without paralysis".
Polio is the abbreviation for poliomyelitis, an infectious disease caused by polioviruses.
The disease, referred to in German as paediatric paralysis, leads from paralysis to death.
In Germany, polio is considered to be eradicated, but there are still three countries worldwide where the disease occurs.
The cause of poliomyelitis, the polioviruses, can so far only be controlled by vaccinations, according to a press release.
Soccer: Reus and Zorc call for peace for idols
Leverkusen (dpa) - BVB sports director Michael Zorc and captain Marco Reus have called for an end to Mario Götze's public discussion on form and fitness.
"We should stop worrying about Mario.
That doesn't do the boy any good.
And that doesn't do us any good," said the idol-friend Reus after the 4:2 victory in Leverkusen at the TV channel Sky.
Zorc had already stressed before the game.
For him personally, this is not an easy situation.
Football: Eberl: No hurry in contract talks with Hecking
Mönchengladbach (dpa) - Manager Max Eberl of the football Bundesliga Borussia Mönchengladbach sees no haste in a possible contract extension with coach Dieter Hecking.
We haven't even talked about a contract yet.
There is no fixed date when we will do this.
"But there will certainly be the moment when we sit down and talk," Eberl said on Sunday evening on the TV channel Sky.
Football: Bezirksliga: VfL Wolbeck vs. SC Altenrheine
There were moments in this still young season when Alois Fetsch went to court with his own.
Wortkarg gave himself, the coach of the football district league VfL Wolbeck, first withdrew (innerly) to reflect on the lack of willingness to perform on the green.
All history.
In the meantime, it is again running around the Brandhoveweg.
The 1:1 match against SC Altenrheine on Sunday, in the past season only very thinly scrapped past the ascent.
Yes, I am very pleased with the performance.
"We made the rooms tight and put pressure on the ball.
That could be seen," Fetsch praised his boys and searched for each individual after the game to simply say "thank you" for so much resistance against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to make a system change after 26 minutes.
After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him came Luca Rehberg - it went from the 4-4-2 almost seamlessly into a 4-2-3-1 in which Niklas Thewes was waiting for balls in the front.
Wolbeck had significantly more game shares in the first section.
And chances.
But Frerichs before his exit (17th), the substituted Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the lead.
Almost it would have avenged itself when the SCA in minute 41 twice in person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer hit dangerously in front of the Wolbecker box - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his discipline.
After the break, the VfL took full control.
Thewes from 18 metres narrowly failed.
Schroer also came too late after 58 minutes at a Thewes re-entry.
With the replacement of Miles Geske, Fetsch once again missed a fresh cell cure on the left side.
When Altenrheine's Chris Naberbäumer fell in the 70th minute Robin Westhues, there was an indirect free kick for the pitchers 18 meters in front of the guest house.
The foulman himself stepped in and demonstrated his danger at standards.
Westhues" Thing with the right slap slammed in the bottom left from the shooter's point of view - 1:0 (71st).
Twenty minutes left, which should be damn long.
And then that: VfL captain Florian Quabeck unluckily flew the leather to his hand in the penalty area in the 80th minute.
Referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79th).
Wolbeck had to survive a few minutes in the final phase before Geske scored the victory in the 87th minute out of twelve meters.
It might have been too much of a good thing.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75th Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26th L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66th Geske) - Thewes

Eintracht Frankfurt wins 4-1 against Hannover 96
Starting position: Four points after five match days - that was not enough for coach Adi Hütter.
Against Hannover 96, Eintracht Frankfurt finally wanted to ensure the first home win.
Stürmer Ante Rebic, who was in the starting eleven for the first time after an injury, should help with this.
Midfielder Luca Torró was also there after a pubic leg injury and should with his header strength prevent the SGE from receiving further goals according to standards.

Helicopter crashed in Kottingbrunn
At the landing, there was an accident at the airfield.
The four occupants were slightly injured.
Around 2 pm there was a drama on Sunday at the airport in Kottingbrunn.
There was turbulence when a helicopter landed, as the police confirmed to oe24.
The heli was caught by a gust of wind, slammed on the ground and came to a halt laterally.
Immediately police, rescue and fire brigade were notified.
With a large squad, the emergency forces arrived at the scene of the accident.
The <0xC3><0x96>AMTC emergency helicopter was also called for caution.
Inmates only slightly injured
Fortunately, everything turned out to be largely harmless.
There is only one property damage.
The four occupants were only slightly injured and were able to return home independently.
The exact circumstances of the accident have not yet been clarified and are subject to investigation.
According to fire spokesman Franz Resperger, there was a small fire, which could be quickly extinguished.
Allbright Foundation report: Women remain a rarity in corporate boards
As a result, only 8 percent of the boards of directors were female on the 1st of September, according to the report "Die Macht der Monokultur", which will be officially presented by the Allbright Foundation this Monday and was submitted to the German Press Agency in advance.
"Companies will have to take a different approach, otherwise international competitors will pass by them," said Wiebke Ankersen, CEO of the foundation.
In the US, UK or Sweden, purely male-occupied leadership teams - with a few exceptions - are no longer conceivable.
The backlog makes the German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and future-oriented.
It is a different corporate culture.
The slight increase in the proportion of women among the German stock exchange companies is also due solely to positive impulses among the companies of the index of medium-sized values (MDax).
According to Allbright, only 6.8 percent of the board members are female.
In the previous year, however, the value was still at 3.8 percent.
In the 30 Dax companies - pioneers in recent years - the proportion of women stagnated.
Most recently, 26 women worked on the boards.
"I'm sure the Dax companies will recruit more consistent women again next year - in their own interest," Ankersen said.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement had signalled that they would not continue to undertake to increase the share of "zero percent" so far.
A different picture emerges from the Supervisory Boards: As of 1 September, the proportion of women there was 30.5 percent - 45 women more and 68 men less than a year ago.
“If we recruited as many women for the boards of directors each year, we would have reached a share of 40 percent by 2023,” the report says.
Some even make messy: Luxury cars: Which manufacturer earns the most per car?
Ferrari deserves the best.
The Italians earn <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>280,000 with every Ferrari sold and make <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>69,000 operating profit.
Big cars, big profits: this slogan still applies today - in most cases.
Who among the noble providers makes the most profit per car.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do luxury manufacturers collect per car they sell?
This question has been addressed by "Autopapst" and economics professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
Ferrari made 69,000 euros of operating profit in the first half of the year with every car sold - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only comes to around 800 euros, Tesla and Bentley even put a lot on it for every car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are good in the race with prices from an average of 33,000 to 38.000 euros per car and around 3,000 euros profit before interest and taxes EBIT.

For the 60th time, the association organizes the wine festivals, which from now on rise every Saturday in October in the large festival tent at Rehweiler Straße.
At the start of the anniversary, the managers moved under the sounds of the Spielmannszug from Wiesenbronn through the place to the festival square.
In the already crowded festival tent, the chairman of the tourism association, Wolfgang Starz, mayor Jürgen Schulz and wine princess Lisa Kursawe welcomed the guests. "60 years of doing something like this - this is a madness for a small town with 800 inhabitants.
You can be proud of that," Starz thanked all the helpers.
Later, Princess Lisa II came symbolically from the stage with the guests.
"It's nice that so many people have found their way to Abtswind." Later "Die Troglauer" created a mood.
On Sunday, which also celebrated Abtswinder Kirchweih, the association had set the drink prices on the occasion of the anniversary in the afternoon as 60 years ago.
A feast evening for the 60th wine festival takes place on Friday, October 5, in the guest's house, before going into the second round a day later in the festival tent.
In Bonn: Notarztauto kraft in Taxi
An emergency car is heavily damaged next to a road.
In the collision of the emergency vehicle with a taxi, a 27-year-old passenger was fatally injured.
When emergency doctors are called, they should help - best save lives.
Such a rescue trip in Bonn took a deadly end for a 26-year-old.
Bonn - In Bonn, a 26-year-old pedestrian has been fatally injured in the collision of an emergency car with a taxi.
The taxi driver, the emergency doctor and their driver were seriously injured, police said.
The 46-year-old driver of the emergency car had crossed a red traffic light with blue light and Martinshorn on Saturday afternoon.
He then encountered a crossroads with the taxi that drove at Green.
After the collision, the doctor's car hurled against a traffic light pole and a tree.
He caught the passerby who died at the scene of the accident.
Emergency car driver and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the emergency car were severely injured in their vehicles and had to be freed by emergency forces.
The 29-year-old emergency doctor, who was also seriously injured, was able to free herself, but she could no longer help the pedestrian.
Another called emergency doctor tried this - but without success.
The three seriously injured were taken to hospitals.
The police, in close coordination with the Bonn prosecutor’s office, are investigating who is to blame for the accident.
Manchester United loses again, Mourinho feels uncomfortable
After the embarrassing Aus in the League Cup, Manchester United now also loses in the 7th round of the Premier League.
West Ham United faced ManU 1:3. The way of the defeat is still to be said.
The scene was emblematic in the 74th minute, when the recovered Marko Arnautovic scored the 3:1 for West Ham; just three minutes after Marcus Rashford allegedly led the Red Devils back into the game.
As they suspected an offside at the pass of Mark Nobel, all Manchester defenders stopped, leaving Arnautovic all the time to shoot the ball past the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative highlight of a previously insufficient performance over long distances.
At the moment, the mood is very different with United city rival Manchester City.
The Citizens, trained by Mourinho’s great rival Pep Guardiola, came against Brighton & Hove Albion to an undisclosed 2–0 victory.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke the defensive bar of the outsider for the first time for the home team.
After a good hour and a double pass with the former goalkeeper, Sergio Agüero ensured the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus also the jump to the top of the table.
Liverpool No Longer Leader
Three days after the 1-2 defeat in the League Cup, Xherdan Shaqiri won 1-1 against Chelsea with Liverpool in the Premier League.
Eden Hazard was the best man among the Londoners.
The 27-year-old’s goal in the 25th minute remained the only goal of the game until the final stages.
Shaqiri, who came to the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, narrowly missed the match after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge did better in the 89th minute with his Schlenzer.
So after the Reds started the week with a flawless record, Chelsea could not be beaten for the second time.
First, the Londoners eliminated the team of Jürgen Klopp in the Cup, by the draw in the league, the Blues Liverpool now also fell from the top of the table.
Like City, the two London City clubs Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) celebrated 2-0 wins.
However, the Gunners fans, who played through Granit Xhaka, had to wait until the 81st minute for a success report against the surprise team from the county of Hertfordshire.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defender Craig Cathcart unluckily kicked Alex Iwobi into his own goal, only two minutes later Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil made the decision with his third season goal.
Arsenal passed Watford for the fifth consecutive victory and is newly immediately behind the big rival Tottenham in 5th place. A strong impression continues to leave riser Wolverhampton under his Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
The Wolves remained undefeated in the league for the fifth consecutive time in the 2-0 against Southampton and finished in 8th place.
VW Core Brand Missing: Paris Motor Show in Sign of Diesel Debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years in alternation with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially not an issue and yet ubiquitous: The diesel scandal and the struggle for driving bans and retrofits should not let go of the German car companies even at the industry meeting in Paris.
At the 2018 Motor Show, they will show their innovations in the French capital from next week along with the competition from all over the world.
The diesel does not play a big role anymore.
However, the possible exchange and retrofit offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are still to be negotiated with the government in Berlin until then, should still be an important topic at least behind the glossy scenes of the trade fair booths.
A big name is missing in Paris: The Volkswagen Group is with Audi, Porsche and other subsidiaries, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are there and have their first purely electric models with them: the e-tron of the Ingolstädter is scheduled to be launched at the end of the year, the EQC of the Stuttgarter 2019.
Both were officially presented.
BMW’s iNext is scheduled to launch in 2021.
At the heart of Paris is the new 3rd.
In total, more than 250 exhibitors are represented this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to automotive companies, motorcycle manufacturers as well as numerous mobility service and software providers are also present in their own halls.
The trade fair, which celebrates its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years in alternation with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, more than a million visitors came.
The earthquake and tsunami killed at least 380 people on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
There are also more than 500 injured.
The island was shaken by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first quake had a magnitude of 5.9, the second had a magnitude of 7.4.
Communications and transport connections have been damaged, there has been enormous material damage.
After the earthquake, the tsunami broke over the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu, hundreds had gathered at the beach for a feast.
It is feared that the number of victims will continue to rise significantly.
So far, the numbers have only come from Palu.
However, many other communities are also affected - along the west coast of Sulawesi.
About 150 bikers celebrate service in Werdohl
Motorcycle pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne on Sunday celebrated the final service for motorcyclists in the Peace Church in Eveking with a team of helpers.
Werdohl - The square in front of the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the final service for the bikers was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and therefore responsible for the pastoral interests of the PS-strong two-wheelers.
Between April and September, the traditional motorcycle service (MoGo) always takes place on the last Sunday of a month at Haus Nordhelle.
Bikers traditionally celebrate the end of the season in the Peace Church in Eveking.
Around 150 bikers gathered there on Sunday to celebrate anything but an ordinary service.
As early as 10 a.m., the bolids were lined up in front of the entrance portal of the church.
At first, the biker early mornings were on the program and it was allowed to be strengthened with coffee and cake or even with a hearty curry sausage.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were also present.
The sermon was given during the biker service of Pastor Dirk Grzegorek.
The musical background was provided by the singer-songwriter Valerie Lill.
"Although the bikers prefer the blues rock, Valerie Lill strikes rather poetic-quiet tones," says Rev. Frank Schröder.
This was certainly a novelty in the history of motorcycle worship yesterday.
Füchtorfer Heimatverein celebrates big party: After the apple comes the milk
Borish was also active on the actual day of action.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg was also very interested.
He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated to his astonished spectators step by step the process from ripe apple to apple juice.
From time to time Hartmann-Niemerg left the children the field and let them fill the apples in the big funnel.
With a little muscle strength, the apples became a finely crushed mass.
Not many of the children were able to imagine how it would turn into a tasty drink.
But they were also able to look at this important work step on this late Friday afternoon.
Packed in moulds and wrapped in nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the apple pieces, which looked a bit like chopped apples, layer by layer.
Thanks to some technical support, the last step was no longer so difficult.
The freshly squeezed juice gradually ran into a large vessel.
But the Füchtorfer farmer also had already pre-filled specialties.
So he opened his "treasure box" and presented the newest feather whites to older visitors.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Füchtorf" was correspondingly high.
In a cosy atmosphere, the parents came into conversation, while the children were not only able to follow the process of apple pressing, but also discovered the built-up bouncing castle for themselves.
Active members of the Füchtorf camaraderie of former soldiers also participated in the festival and invited to entertaining games at some stations.
Also next year, the home club will offer an action day.
Then, however, Gregor Krützkamp emphasized, the home in the heart of the asparagus village will not be the place of the event.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious because of the theme: After all, it will then go around the milk.
1:4 against Frankfurt: Hannover with fourth season breakdown: "Fucking situation"
Frankfurt/Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat in a row, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed Hannover 96 professionals around him and gave them courage.
However, there was not much positive to be seen before at the 1:4 (0:2) of the final table at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a shitty situation, but you have to get out of there as a team," said 96-football professional Pirmin Schwegler and pushed further: "This is of course disappointing, because you always take a lot of action."
The further unsuccessful Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86th) joined, are at the bottom with two counters and are in their current constitution a candidate for descent.
Led by the outstanding Ante Rebic, Frankfurt celebrated the first home win of the season.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45th+1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59th) and Luka Jovic (89th) scored the goals in front of 46,300 spectators for the DFB Cup winner who, after the successful general test for the Europa League match against Lazio Rome, advanced by seven points into the midfield of the table.
Croatian vice-world champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive action of the Hesse in his start-up eleven debut and was never able to get a grip on Hanover’s defense.
The striker, long beaten after the World Cup, showed with his pace and assertiveness why he is so valuable for harmony.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, borrowed from FC Liverpool, stood for the first time in the initial formation of the Frankfurters, which started swiftly.
Lucas Torró's (17th) header, which was faked on the goal net, was the first to bring danger.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in a promising position at the last moment by the 96 defense around Brazilian Felipe, replacing short-term out-of-date Kevin Wimmer (back).
The leadership for the homeowners fell almost inevitably and totally deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball into the penalty area after a defensive corner, Haller extended by head in front of the goal, where Ndicka only needed to hold his foot.
It was the first Bundesliga goal for the defensive player coming in the summer from the French second league player AJ Auxerre.
And Frankfurt went on before the break.
This time Haller matched his storm partner Rebic, who skilfully refueled himself and left 96-goal keeper Michael Esser no chance.
In the halftime, Hanover coach Breitenreiter responded to the weak idea of his eleven and brought in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt two new offensive forces.
The Lower Saxons played a bit more boldly forward, but their ideas remained out until just before the end, when the follow-up hit was still successful.
The Hessians were much more efficient.
After a short hour, Rebic started a solo and then placed across to De Guzmán, who only had to push the ball into the empty goal.
The rest was only show running for the Frankfurters against overwhelmed guests, Jovic also met one minute before the end.
Morlaixplatz becomes a party mile
Despite the cool temperatures, there was a good mood at the Oktoberfest in the city center.
The Mayor of Munich, Dieter Reiter, made it in front of millions of people at the opening of the 185.
Münchener Wies'n last week with two punches.
Geisingen: Geisinger Christians celebrate Holy Cross Festival
The Geising Catholics celebrate the Holy Cross on 14 September or on the Sunday after.
The feast service takes place in the city church, then there is a procession to the Holy Cross church with the final blessing.
The Church of the Holy Cross is home to the shot Christ, who is from the Thirty Years' War and is said to have been shot by a Swedish soldier.
From the gunshot wound, blood flowed.
This resulted in a great pilgrimage to the shot Christ, which also led to the construction of the Church of the Holy Cross.
It is still not finished, only the altar room stands, the missing long house is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, Pastor Adolf Buhl reminds us that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
The service was poorly attended despite the importance for the Geisinger parish.
After the service, the procession to the Church of the Holy Cross took place and with the final blessing the ecclesiastical part of the Feast of the Cross ended.
For many years, the Catholic church choir has been inviting to the Catholic parish for the secular part of the feast.
The choir members provided the visitors with hearty food as well as a large selection of cakes and adapted to the weather, farm ice cream.
In the afternoon, the parish community offered guided tours around the city church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed the visitors on behalf of the parish community about the damage to the facade, roof, sandstone works and windows as well as the upcoming construction measures, which will continue until next year.
After the scaffolding has been standing for some time, the damages could be determined more precisely and the individual tenders prepared more concretely.
It is certain that the renovation will be more expensive than planned, because the damage already existing a few years ago has increased, but more has also been determined, which was only made possible by the in-eye inspection by means of scaffolding.
The plinth plaster work has been completed, natural stone works are to be started before the winter and it is still hoped to be able to complete well half of these work this year.
Inauguration: New residence in the Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
The Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens a new residential home for people with disabilities on Münsterblickstraße.
That in the Münsterblickstraße "a very special house" will now be handed over to his destiny - all those present agreed on the date of the inauguration.
After all, the twelve wheelchair users so far, who have already lived in the living quarters of the Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller for some time, rely on the special architecture of the new building.
Wider corridors, corridors and doors, larger rooms and accessible access for all areas, architect Rudolf Bader has taken into account in his concept.
The first plans began about eight years ago, when the former US Army officer's building was put to the test for the residents with Handycap: "The house had come in the years and no longer contemporary in the equipment," Bader explained in retrospect.
In 2016, the excavators arrived to demolish the house.
The new building should be designed as friendly and bright as possible so that the residents can feel comfortable in it, according to the architect.
Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens new residence
Around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4.6 million was invested in the new building.
The Free State contributed 2.4 million euros, the district of Swabia 450000 euros.
According to architect Bader, the construction work has remained within the planned framework - both temporally and financially.
He was also thanked for this by the managing director of Lebenshilfe, Jürgen Heinz.
The balance between a barrier-free and simultaneously fire-proof construction was not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many specifications, which gave the inhabitants the freedom to move without outside help.
Gertrud Kreutmayer, head of the social administration of the district of Swabia, said: "The house is oriented to the special needs of its residents, who need tools to be mobile".
The housing and functionality were well combined, Kreutmayer said.
And further: "The property in this situation is a real luck, because it can no longer be acquired in today's situation".
In total, the new residence on Münsterblickstraße offers space for 30 people with disabilities on almost 1500 square meters, which are divided into three residential groups.
Heinz is proud of the eleven full-time employees, all of whom are employed according to tariff.
Germany: Schwesig complains about differences between East and West
Before the Day of Unity, the deputy SPD Federal Chairman Manuela Schwesig has appealed to all his compatriots not to accept the disadvantage of East Germans.
There are differences that hurt after almost 30 years of unity.
We must not be satisfied with these differences," the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern told the "Tagesspiegel am Sonntag".
The goal must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germans, on average, worked longer than the people in West Germany, but received 15 percent less salary.
"I can't explain this to anyone almost 30 years after German unity," Schwesig said.
North Korea: Is This Cute Dog Ending the Korean Conflict?
The one-year-old Pungsan hunting dog is supposed to smooth the waves between the two Koreas.
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pyongyang gave South Korean President Moon Jae two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs as a gift.
As Moon’s office announced on Sunday, the two about a year old dogs reached their recipient on Thursday.
They passed the border town of Panmunjom along with three kilograms of dog food to "facilitate the habituation" of the animals.
The dogs with the thick white fur, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They are part of the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The North announced the gift of friendship at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un in mid-September in Pyongyang.
Both countries also agreed to compete together in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and to apply together for the 2032 Olympic Games.
In the course of the mutual rapprochement, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test facility for rocket drives.
Austria’s moving history in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
To commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated for almost ten months, numerous new books have been published, which usually answer this question in a retrospective of the past hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and director-general of the Austrian State Archives, puts it quite differently in the magnificent "Bilderbuch" Austria, which will be published on October 1.
A new week, a new opportunity for the government
Back to non-profit work - this is the unofficial motto for the working week of the Great Coalition that begins today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech, in which the chancellor and her ministers from the CDU, SPD and also from the CSU did not lastly summon the "return to professional work" in a mantra-like manner.
This may have led some artisans, doctors, cashiers and other working citizens in this country to the legitimate question of what is actually the difference between work and non-profit work, but be it so.
When the Federal Government is now ready to dedicate itself again to its mission - to governing - it should not be prevented from doing so now with conceptual debates.
Whether Union and SPD can actually achieve something together after the provocations and embarrassment of the last weeks, will probably already be shown on Monday.
In the evening, the heads of the ruling parties meet for the coalition committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to call this round regularly to defuse conflicts early; a lesson from all the disputes.
But first of all, with the diesel retrofits and the skilled workers immigration law, conflict-laden topics are once again on the agenda.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants to let the car companies get away with exchange premiums, SPD and CDU see the manufacturers in the obligation to technical retrofit older diesel.
While the diesel crisis has marked an approximation over the weekend, Union and SPD are still far from each other in terms of the planned immigration law.
The SPD calls for a stay perspective for rejected asylum seekers who are working or taking an education.
The Union is strictly opposed to the "change of track" from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will be disputes among the coalition partners again - and how should it be different?
Not Gleich und Gleich has joined forces with GroKo, but three partners with sometimes very different social views and priorities.
Controversy is good.
Without a quarrel, a society characterised by such diverse, sometimes conflicting interests will not progress.
In order to be constructive, however, disputes must not again be inflamed for partisan tactical reasons on the question of being or not being.
It’s still about politics, not theater.
Union and SPD should argue - but always with the life reality of the people in mind.
What is feasible and beneficial for many?
With this key question, both the diesel and the lane change question can be clarified pragmatically - and thus regain confidence.
This is the main reason why the People’s Parties must now fight.
Pilz checks working hours at Hartinger
The Minister in sight
Is the Minister of Labour in violation of the current employment law?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look at this.
"Really day and night" their legists had worked on the social security reform, reported an exuberant social minister at the presentation of the same two weeks ago.
The statement by Beate Hartinger-Klein (FP<0xC3><0x96>) surprises Liste-Milz-Mandatarin Daniela Holzinger - she now brings the matter to Parliament via inquiry.
She expects that "the minister would only express her enthusiasm for the deployment of her team and in no way announce violations of applicable service law in front of running cameras."
Nevertheless, she now has questions in order to "absolve Har tinger of any suspicion".
Police tore up a street in search of woman's body
Marxgrün - Long time the police did not want to comment on this.
Now there is a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning on the state road between Naila and Bad Steben is digging.
The route is closed in the Marxgrün area until Monday.
It was assumed that the investigators had previously used an archaeology dog.
The dog, specially trained for the smell of old human bones, was finally able to narrow the relevant spot to a few meters together with his guide in repeated use.
In addition, a soil anomaly was discovered in the area of the said section of the road together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the highest Bavarian heritage protection authority.
For more than a year, the prosecutor’s office and the criminal police court have been working on the case.
Again and again, a cycle path at Marxgrün was closed and examined with sonar devices, because the investigators suspect that here in the course of the new construction of the state road 30 years ago Heike's body could have been obscured.
Colour powders and eggs: Barcelona riots ahead of Catalonia’s anniversary
On Monday, Catalonia’s controversial independence referendum will be held for the first time.
But there are riots beforehand.
The separatists have not forgotten the police operation of autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum on 1 October 2017, clashes between separatists and the police have occurred in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked with paint powder by the supporters of independence, among other things, as they tried to prevent them from approaching a demonstration of the National Police and the Civil Guard.
Approximately 3,000 police officers from the Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil units wanted to pay tribute to their colleagues who participated in last year’s illegal referendum in the polling stations.
At the time, there was also violence in the attempt to prevent citizens from voting.
The Catalan police would have formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of the separatists and the central-state security forces separate, Spanish media reported.
Some of the 6,000 separatists attempted to break through the police chain by force, throwing in paint bags and eggs, among other things.
Six people were arrested, 24 others were slightly injured, authorities said.
Monday marks the first anniversary of the independence referendum.
Following the vote and a subsequent decision to split the wealthy region of Spain, the central government in Madrid had placed Catalonia under coercive administration in autumn 2017.
The then regional president Carles Puigdemont fled into exile in Belgium.
Other politicians also set off abroad.
Several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement, however, remain in U-detention.
In December, new elections were held in the region.
After the new Catalan government took office in May, the compulsory administration was terminated.
But the new regional president Quim Torra also insists on the "right to self-determination" of the Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Assembled confusion: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen split goallessly
Red-white Ahlen continues to step on the spot.
Also at FC Gütersloh it was only enough to a 0-0 draw.
The final light and the third last were revealed in front of 438 spectators at the Heidewald Stadium as assembled perplexity.
The first half was very manageable from the entertainment factor.
Therefore, those who would rather get a beer or a bratwurst could do so without worry.
There was no danger of missing a chance, because there were practically none.
First shot after half an hour
Gütersloh's Nick Flock was responsible for the first (harmless) goal of the entire game in the 28th minute.
The best - and in principle only real - opportunity had the Ahleners when Cihan Yilmaz FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westergerling forced a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the penalty area boundary.
Even more harmless were the hosts.
Their most effective action was an early change.
Stürmer Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury, Sinan Aygün came for him.
After the change, both teams decided to do something about the growing boredom.
In the 48th minute Sebastian Mützel aimed from 18 meters just above the housing and after an hour the Gütersloher also appeared offensively for the first time.
After a ball conquest by Matthäus Wieckowicz it was fixed.
Nick Flock (62th) crowned the swiftly recital about Sinan Aygün with a loose shot in the arms of RWA goalkeeper Bernd Schipmann.
In addition, they scored a header from Wieckowicz (66th) after a corner ball from ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA interim coach Angelo Daut responded, first bringing Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60th) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70th).
It worked - nothing.
The Ahleners did not achieve anything more than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative.
It was only in the 91st minute that Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but neither did he.
Angelo Daut then tried to erase the positive: "I like that we played to zero", but unfortunately the zero was also at the front.
"We weren't as dangerous this time as against wooden wickets, even though our opponent didn't want to play here," said RW Ahlens interim coach.
Offensively, "everything was a bit" against a team "that just wanted to defend.
At least I didn't feel like we could get a goal," Daut said.
To his disappointment, however, the spectator did not feel like his team could score a goal.
The idea was too poor for that.
Reckenfelder Harvest Thanksgiving Market: Fortunately there are enough Kreimers
Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder Table Publishing Office, for whom these donations are intended, are delighted.
The volunteers assure: "These donations also remain in Reckenfeld".
At the opening, the sky appeared bright blue, but the square was still a bit empty, but that should change over the course of the day.
Because: "Here it is so nicely sociable, that's why we are here today," said one visitor.
The organizer of the Franz Josef Holthaus festival welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit with a decent pinch of humor.
For the couple Brockmann, who were actually supposed to be weighed against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer jumped in in the short term.
Verena (Ferdi Kreimer’s daughter) is ill.
There are enough Kreimers.
And the "replacement" couldn't help but entertain in between musically the ever-increasing visitors.
This was so well received that at a later hour some folk songs were sung along.
"It's great," said Marcel Kreimer.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to place the opening date this time in his schedule.
He is delighted with the many actives with their stands, including mostly clubs.
"Actually, there shouldn't be such a thing as a table," he thanked the men's choir for the action.
Andreas Hajek praised the efforts of all who were in service at the booths and also included the other festivals that took place in September and the "clean up" action.
Our garden town gives itself a colorful coat of paint - here's something.
Then the Mayan wreath was taken by Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help of the fire department and taken to the winter quarter.
At many booths, work was done for the physical well-being.
From sweet to hearty was everything to have.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only lived in Reckenfeld for a year, became creative with his decoy saw.
Veneer work, beer lid with rectangular motifs and much more he had on offer.
Three beekeepers offered a speciality: "Reckenfelder Honig", brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter.
The latter has a specialty with it.
Honey cake in a glass, of course with honey from my own production.
Then the little Elsa had to access again and again, so good tasted the cake.
It is the sociability that allowed the visitors to linger for a long time until the evening hours, even without a stage program that does not exist at the autumn festival.
Lubrication with local political message: No successful advertising for skate equipment
In Lengerich, unknowns have hardly promoted the construction of a skate facility in a conducive way.
In several places, there are corresponding lubrications, says Jürgen Kohne from the city administration at the request of the WN.
In at least one case, a criminal complaint has been filed with the police for property damage.
In large letters, the three words "Skatepark für Lengerich!" appear on signs at the Gempt Hall and at the Old Town Hall, among others.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that already after the professional selection fair on 19 September, a corresponding lettering on the advertising sign on the staircase to the Gempt bistro had been discovered.
Since the short message was apparently left "only" with an edding, it could have been removed without any problems.
"A few days later, however, it was there again, this time sprayed on," said Rottmann.
It assumes that the corresponding advertising sign needs to be replaced.
A special note is given to this particular case by the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are also mentioned on the table.
If the skate facility is built, its realization should also be made possible by sponsors.
There are already commitments, explains Jörg Hesselmann from the municipal department of school, sport and culture, without giving a name.
It is possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the smeared board.
For years, local politics and administration have been dealing with the topic of skateboarding.
After the old fiber optic clinic had been dismantled, the search for an alternative location began after some time.
Finally, the Council voted in favour of the fire station.
However, this intention was not implemented - too many factors apparently spoke against a construction at this point.
At the end of June there was a turnaround.
The members of the Main and Finance Committee now voted unanimously for the Gutenberg School site.
Jürgen Kohne says about the state of affairs that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning.
The last word is the City Council.
He expects a decision this year so that a positive vote in 2019 could be built.
Air traffic control bottlenecks are getting worse
After the European air traffic chaos in the summer, German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement next year.
“This year we have had wind, 2019 we will have strong wind and then the storm will come,” said Matthias Maas, head of the air traffic control union, the German press agency before the aviation summit on 5 October in Hamburg.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight failures is the long-known staff shortage in European air traffic control, for which there is no quick solution.
"Airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but training new pilots takes four to five years," the trade unionist said.
Europe-wide, the market for ready-trained pilots is swept away.
In the centre of Karlsruhe alone, around a hundred people were missing to monitor the upper German airspace.
Maas again criticized the fact that various air transport unions were not invited to the summit.
In the Hanseatic city, representatives of the federal government, the states, air traffic control, airlines and airports will meet on Friday to address the causes of the delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work congestion and overtime, that will not go without us," said the head of the GdF, which has many members at the German air traffic control agency.
Maas once again blamed the EU Commission for the Lotsen misery.
Traffic forecasts for the current regulatory period up to 2019 were far too low.
The resulting cost targets and personnel savings in national air traffic controls are now fully penetrating the operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Minister of Transport Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to work in Brussels for regulations that "do not further restrict air traffic control".
Currently, the EU targets would be aligned by 2024 and further tightening is to be feared.
The EU is subject to constant lobby pressure from the airlines.
"Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are now harvesting exactly what they have sown in recent years," Maas said.
He hopes that the high delay costs for the airlines will lead to a rethink.
The GdF will only contribute to improving the situation if the German air traffic control (DFS) offers a "consistent training and future pact", Maas said.
The so far announced admission of 120 pilotage students annually over the next five years is just enough to compensate for the age-related exits.
The necessary staffing is not yet connected with this.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board votes for Group restructuring
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously in favour of the plans to rebuild the Group.
According to the will of Thyssenkrupp interim chief Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed CEO at the meeting on Sunday, the crisis-ridden group will be split into two independent companies.
Both companies will be based in Essen and listed on the stock exchange.
There should be no additional staff cuts beyond the already known cuts in the administration.
After two resignations, the control body counts only eight heads on the capital side.
Ten representatives of the workers face this.
However, the final decision is expected to be taken by a Annual General Meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG will include, among other things, the 50% stake in the merged steel business with Indian partner Tata.
In the second company, Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, the business is to be bundled with elevators and supplies.
Barcelona: Violence at demonstrations by policemen and Catalan independence advocates.
At two simultaneous demonstrations of Spanish policemen and Catalan independence advocates in Barcelona, there have been violent clashes with numerous injured.
According to the city administration, about 3,000 police officers from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as about 6,000 supporters of independence.
The Catalan police have tried to keep the two demonstrations from each other.
According to the forces, however, independence advocates repeatedly tried to break through the security barrier.
They attacked the officers with paint and shotguns.
Rangelies were also reported between the participants of the various demonstrations.
According to rescue personnel, 24 people were injured.
Police said there were six arrests.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
With their demonstration, the police wanted to pay tribute to the colleagues who took action almost exactly a year ago against the independence referendum banned by the Spanish central government in Catalonia.
At the same time, they demanded better salaries.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil feel it is unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn significantly more than they do.
The protesters saw it as a provocation that the Spanish police were demonstrating in Barcelona.
"Why did they come here to protest?" asked 55-year-old Catalan protester Manel Perez to AFP.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they throttled us a year ago.
A 31-year-old police officer from the Balearic Islands, who only wanted to give his name with Daniel, denied the accusation.
"Of course we want to support our comrades who did only their duty last year: defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we are doing it in Barcelona because this is a big European city and there is more echo here.
He and his colleagues, however, "did not come to provoke," the policeman assured.
Broke Allowed Access to Personal Data of British Ministers
A security vulnerability in a mobile app has resulted in the personal data of ministers and MPs of the conservative British Tory party being temporarily accessible to everyone on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unknowns after the breakdown became known a day before the Tory Party Congress in Birmingham.
Two people clamped on B217
On Sunday morning, the police in Hanover reported a serious traffic accident on Bundesstraße 217, Hamelner Chaussee, at the local exit of Wettbergen in the direction of Ronnenberg.
Two people were killed when they drove their car against a tree.
The car is currently on fire.
The operatives are on site.

Football: Juve coach praises after top game: Ronaldo's best game
The Portuguese star striker had "played the best game together with the half-hour of Valencia on this evening," praised Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri after the record champion's 3:1 (1:1) victory against the SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensively purchased star was the decisive man in the important game against the persecutor, even without his own goal.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and is doing well," Allegri said.
Even though we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first goal – and from that moment on we have grown.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three goal goals, Juve turned the game after the early draw by the hit of Dries Mertens (10th minute) and depended on the worst persecutor for the time being.
The goaltender picked up by Real Madrid initially put on former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, who took the lead with a double pack (26th/49th).
And Ronaldo also did the preliminary work for the hit of defense chief Leonardo Bonucci (76th), who just had to push in just before the goal line.
"He gives a lot of templates," the coach praised.
But of course Allegri also wants to see goals from the attacker, who is the record goalkeeper in both the Champions League and the Portuguese national team.
"We need to get even better at serving him," the coach demanded.
Best Juve goaltender is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three in the account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, Juventus seems to be becoming even more overwhelming.
Seven wins in seven games is the flawless series in Serie A. With 21 points, the champion of the past seven years already has six counters ahead of Naples.
Carlo Ancelotti, former coach of the Bayer team, won the second place in the standings against Turin.
But at the latest after the relegation of the already warned Mario Rui (58th) the top game was decided.
The Portuguese had to face Paulo Dybala in yellow-red after being too hard on the pitch.
"We played well against a good Naples," commented the Turin coach.
Emre Can was also allowed to feel addressed.
The German national team has won Juve.
The professional who came from FC Liverpool was in use in all seven league matches.
The midfielder also played in the Champions League match against Valencia, which Allegri said with the "half hour": Ronaldo flew off the pitch at the 2-0 victory of the Turiner and is blocked for the home game on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West has changed his name.
With a particularly quirky appearance, rapper Kanye West has attracted attention on the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" on the weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume caused frowns and question marks among the spectators.
The 41-year-old also announced a name change on time for the release of his new album.
Henceforth, we can only call him "Ye", according to the musician.
"The creature formerly known as Kanye West," he tweeted in response to the late singer Prince, who dropped his stage name.
The pseudonym is not news.
Already the tenth album was released under this name.
In an interview with the radio station KRRL, the artist explained that "Ye" has a religious meaning for him.
“I think ‘Ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means ‘you’,” the rapper said.
Football: Kreisliga A1 Münster: Finally!
Got it!
Hoetmars coach Averhage made no mistake about his disappointment.
It was a weak game today.
The opponent was simply more gripping, we almost never confronted him with problems." Accordingly, the list of Hoetmar's shooting possibilities is thin.
Sometimes two goals in 90 minutes, so games can rarely be made positive.
A1: SC Hoetmar faces SG Sendenhorst with 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
Also the SG had only two options in the first pass, but the first used Maik Krause from an acute angle to the early lead (7th).
In the 43rd minute Steffen could have raised Uphus, but after great preliminary work by Krause he detached free standing.
The hosts only had a double chance when Moritz Höne initially failed at goalkeeper Jos Schuhmacher and in the aftermath Jan Blome also found his champion in the sendhorster Keeper.
After the break, the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49th), Julian Turl (61st) and Heinz Linnemann (69th) all awarded.
Niklas Eilmann was also unable to use a meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved on the goal line with his hand and saw red for it - for the guests (75th).
Only when Nils Berheide kicked the ball over the line was the game decided (81st).
"We had criticized ourselves harshly before, that was then different today than in the last few weeks," was the conclusion of Florian Kraus.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77th Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90th Leibig), Turl.
Goals: 0:1 Krause (7th), 0:2 Berheide (81st).
Red Card: Kortenjann (75th/Hoetmar).
Football: Kreisliga A2 Münster: Spectacular football in Albachten: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3:4
"I don't know what to think of it," he said.
"We don't have access to them at all", he allegedly meant the wing pliers with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but probably also all the other green-white who noticed with collective offensive urge.
He could still laugh: "A dirty victory," he said, blinking cheeky and pulling away from then His players, on the other hand, were relieved to note that they had pulled out of the affair with three points.
Notice, after a duel of two teams, one of which, albatross, plays for the championship and the other, Albersloh, fights for the classholding.
With understandably mixed feelings, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back at the 90 minutes behind him.
"This was by far our best season performance," he says.
"How we get back after the 0-2, how we hold against one of the league's top teams over the entire season, that was really phenomenal."
It is all the more bitter that you now have to go home with empty hands.
Top goaltender Lars Zymner led the hosts with his 12th goal of the season (24th).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this goal.
He placed the 2:0 on the left side for Fabian Fröhning (39th).
We knew that, but you can’t take a player like that out completely.
"That was insane, what he did," Lewandowski relentlessly acknowledged the quality of the opponent.
Shortly before the change of sides, his own eleven managed to equalize: McGill’s free kick from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia goalkeeper Hinkerohe into the long turn (45th).
After the change of sides, it was McGill again who scored the equalization (59th).
Then it went back and forth.
It was a crisp, action-packed game.
Nübel shocked Albachten again (64th), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann (69th).
Despite overnumbering, Albersloh was no longer able to counter the last Concordia hit (80th).
We need to focus on Wednesday.
“The game against the sheepdogs, that’s what we have to win now,” Lewandowski said.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, strawbucker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87th Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87th Bareksai).
Goals: 1:0 Zymner (24th), 2:0 Fröhning (39th), 2:1 McGill (45th), 2:2 McGill (59th), 3:2 Nübel (64th), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69th), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80th).
Yellow-Red: Atalan (74th/Albachten).
Football: TSV Straßberg wins point against Primus
There has been no winner in the Landesliga duel between TSV Straßberg and FV Biberach.

Media: The entire presidium of Dynamo Dresden resigned
According to media reports, the entire presidium of Dynamo Dresden has resigned.
Several media outlets agreed on a joint letter from the Saxon Board this evening.
There was no confirmation of the association at first.
The reason for the withdrawal should be internal power struggles at the former Bundesliga.
Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of Pomp
I'm glad he's gone again.
There are few state guests whose departure in Germany provides as much relief as those of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
For three days, the Turkish president was a guest in Berlin and Cologne, and many had thought that he should not have been invited.
Evangelische Akademie Tutzing: Celebrity guests and new offers
The Evangelische Akademie Tutzing offers about 80 meetings by the middle of next year.
Meanwhile, France’s President Emmanuel Macron has signalled that he wants to pick up the tolerance price personally in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, the term of office was too short: as Federal President, he was not in Tutzing’s Evangelical Academy.
But before and after, Wulff was a guest there.
Udo Hahn, Academy Director, took him into account when he proudly said: "All the Federal Presidents and Federal Chancellors were already with us." The fact that celebrities repeatedly appeared at the Academy at Schloss Tutzing, but was also an issue during the presentation of the annual program.
At the end of October, Liedermacher Konstantin Wecker participates in a conference on spiritual experience from a philosophical perspective, on September 29, the writer Frido Mann is at a conference about his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Meanwhile, France’s President Emmanuel Macron has also pledged: He wants to receive the “tolerance prize” awarded to him by the Academy personally in Tutzing, which in another category also receives television presenter Dunja Hayali (we reported).
The approximately 80 meetings by mid-2019 have it in them.
"The pension is not safe!" is stated in a conference title.
"SOS at Europe's borders" - this is how the Academy describes the "risk and deadly route across the Mediterranean".
"And to a meeting on Syria: "barbarism without limit".
Weapons deals, destruction, torture, death - the war mocks any humane idea".
The spectrum ranges from structural racism in society to the scissors between the poor and the rich to the radical change of work through digitization.
Academy Director Hahn was convinced: "A free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together to look for solutions or at least for partial solutions".
At a meeting at 200.
Karl Marx’s birthday soon awaits one more visitor to the direction of capitalism-criticism, the other more a tendency “from the left to the middle”.
What about neutrality?
"We are 100 percent a daughter of the Evangelical State Church," said study leader Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, "so we are not 100 percent neutral."
Musical cabaret: Gender understanding with heart - Wolbeck - Westfälische Nachrichten
"Suitable for both adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the Hall of the Christuskirche in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret atheist, Teubner developed gender understanding, not only with humour and warmth of heart for the (feeling) woman and the (feeling) man and whatever else there might be, but also with music.
She used the mini guitar and also mastered her violin.
Ben Süverkrüp was sitting on the wing.
He is on the one hand the male sparring partner, who sometimes also speaks up to the end of the sentence, on the other hand a true pianist: So congenially harmoniously accompanies Süverkrüp Teubner that some may have wished for a solo.
There were, too, Beethoven and Chopin, but differently, namely, the way it fits the evening’s thread.
There, Teubner had brought into play a paradox: the satisfaction of the man comes when he has a partner, but does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, is of no use.
The piano solo now demonstrates the same: What would have emerged from Mozart’s composition if “the Nannerl” had opened the door unexpectedly?
So Süverkrüp glides across in improvisations, from Bach's "O Kopf voller Blut und Wunden" into the "Song of Death", and from Mozart's G minor symphony into a playful dance.
There was great applause and "Bravo" from the full room.
Blumen presented Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the association, to the Chansonette.
However, Chairman Heidemarie Markenbeck was unable to take an additional gratitude.
She had the idea to treat the duo to one in Wolbeck in addition to performing in Stuttgart and Frankfurt.

Bruchsal.
After a bus accident on the A5 in Baden-Württemberg, the police have slightly corrected the number of victims down.
Ten passengers instead of fifteen were injured.
All of them have since been released from the hospital.
The French bus driver had stayed in the hospital for one night for observation.
He will be released during the day, a police spokesman said.
The cause of the bus accident at Bruchsal is still unclear.
On Saturday morning, the long-distance bus crashed unrestrictedly frontally against a guardrail.
Handball: Women's National League: Ahlener SG keeps the white vest barely against TV Wattenscheid
The Ahlen women had problems with third-league player Carolin Stallmann, who alone marked ten goals.
"Actually, I was happy with the defense, only one player scored too many goals.
We haven’t been able to control them,” said ASG coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more annoyed by the many odds.
The focus in the finish made his team miss this time.
As a result, the ASG lagged behind almost to the end, lay behind at break 11:12 and later with 15:18 (45.).
It was only towards the end that the broader bank of hostesses became decisively noticeable.
In addition, Aydogdu placed back room Merle Klement on the left, who then made "extremely clever the decisive gates" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Buschkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pump, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5/3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3rd League Women: Top performance of the BSV Ostbevern in the top game at the VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the volleyball players of the BSV Ostbevern have once again established themselves in the top group of the 3rd League West.
At the second-league descent VC Allbau Essen, the blue-and-white won with 3:1.
“It was a big step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz to play in the top third of the league.
We have now worked this out," coach Dominik Münch was delighted after an almost impeccable performance of his team at the fallen leader of the table.
The first pass was dominated by the guests almost at will.
Over 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12 he went to the deputy champion of the previous year at 25:15.
Food has assumed in the two bar, but has not come into play.
We used them well.
Our opponent hit with a high risk, but also produced a lot of tickets.
In the second sentence, the BSV already led with 12:8. "Food has switched the acceptance to three bars.
We couldn't keep up the pressure.
Food has sucked up, and we have let ourselves in a little bit," Münch continued.
At 18:17 for the first time the volleyball players from the Ruhr area had the nose ahead.
Although Ostbevern refused four more set balls at 19:24, the fifth attempt found its goal.
"The game was now a class better," said the head coach to the rising level.
Maike Rüdingloh and Wiebke Silge contributed significantly to the fact that the BSV turned the hand in the third section from 14:16 to 25:21.
Münch: "We played consistently and quietly."
About 7:3 and 15:13, the Blue-and-White came through four with 25:22 on their side.
Vera Horstmann was chosen as the most valuable player, but Maren Flachmeier had also caught an excellent day.
BSV women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish Community: Mosque Opening as a Missed Opportunity
The Turkish Community in Germany (TGD) has criticized the way in which Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan inaugurated the great Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
"The mosque opening in Cologne has left a shard in the German-Turkish relationship that can only be tediously assembled," said the chairman of the TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, to the editorial network Germany.
Both the Turkish and German sides had missed the chance for a common, conciliatory appearance.
"Instead of side by side with German top politicians to underline the Muslims' belonging to Germany, Erdogan has used the date for his purposes," Sofuoglu lamented.
The large-scale exclusion of the German public has "reaffirmed many reservations."
Home club Nottuln: Offer has already established
After the long summer break, it’s finally Folktreff time again.
On October 18 (Thursday) at 7.30 p.m., the Nottuln home club is already hosting its fifth Nottuln Folktreff in the fireplace room of the Alte Amtmannei.
It’s been almost a year since we performed a folk meet for the first time.
In the meantime, this event has become an integral part of the musical event calendar in Nottuln," says Hanns Moormann, Chairman of the Nottuln Home Association.
I would not have thought that our folk meeting blew up in Nottuln eta so quickly.
Whether stormy Friederike in January or heatwave in July, the fireplace room of the office was always full.
"The programme at the next Folktreff is, as always, a colourful mix of German folk, hiking and sailor songs, folk songs, evergreens and old hits," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who invites friends musicians to Nottuln.
For the first folktreff "birthday" Klaus Spellmeyer has promised with his accordion.
For many years he was a member of "Gaitling", a group from the neighbouring district of Steinfurt, who played music with German lyrics.
Now he's on the road with an Irish folk band.
The creators of the Folktreff will gladly remember the last event in the summer, when Christoph Schulz from Folktreff Emsdetten with his international version of the song "Frogs in the Night" thrilled the listeners and sent them home with an earworm.
"We expect many cheerful guests to spend a sociable and humorous evening once again," the home club's invitation reads.
Anyone who plays an instrument and wants to be actively involved is invited to participate.
Since the coveted seats are always occupied quickly, it is advisable to be there early enough.
The Folktreff starts at 7:30 p.m., but admission is already at 7 p.m.
China approves proposed merger of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all open questions must be resolved by October 24.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair are taking another step forward on their way to becoming the world’s largest industrial gas group.
The Chinese competition authority has approved the proposed merger, Linde said on Sunday.
This means that the multi-billion-dollar merger is still subject to approvals in South Korea and – as the biggest hurdle – in the United States.
Recently, according to an insider, the chances of obtaining consent had improved there because Linde promised to sell additional parts of the company.
For legal reasons, all open questions must be clarified by October 24 in order for the merger to succeed.
From pure fruit cultivation to ecology
A gala in the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle celebrated the 125th anniversary of the Association for Horticulture and Land Care.
On September 29, 1893, a fruit show at the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus set the last impulse for the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landespflege Kulmbach, and exactly 125 years later, on Saturday evening, he celebrated a great anniversary in the Kulmbacher Stadthalle.
Of course, he was called differently at the time: as "Bezirksobstbauverein Kulmbach Stadt und Land" he was raised from baptism by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893.
The purpose of the fruit-growing association was also different from today's work - it was actually purely about fruit-growing, no one thought about flowers and horticulture at the time.
"At that time, in the era of the Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites," said Günter Dippold.
Fruit trees were to be lined with long-distance roads, so-called industrial gardens were built at schools.
Fruit cultivation is still the task of the 55 horticultural associations in the district of Kulmbach, which comprise almost 7,000 members.
However, the spectrum is far from exhausted.
Natural horticulture, organic plant protection, village embellishment and nutrition play an equally important role as the transmission of knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.
The members of the Hutschdorf Youth Group "Toupies" showed on stage how diverse the tasks of a horticultural association are.
"Youth work is urgently needed, especially in the digital age," said district chairman Günter Reif, and OB Henry Schramm also stressed the importance of experiences in nature for life.
The chestnut collection was a huge thing for us children, I doubt that you can collect a similar amount of joy with Smartphone & Co.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with Landrat Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"Where they should stand, the district association decides," added Landrat Söllner, highlighting the special importance of horticultural associations for the villages.
The Circular Association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green spaces in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the county also left no doubt about it.
He guided the many visitors with a picture lecture through the long history of the district association and reported, among other things, on the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
In the past, everything came from the garden, for the winter it was dashed in.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the farm garden had transformed into an ornamental and residential garden.
"Nature has survived, it was already there before us and we have to align ourselves with it," the fruit and nut tree expert argued.
That is why the horticultural associations are encouraged not to let go, so that our homeland remains beautiful and worth living.
This also includes welcoming the new citizens in our clubs, added the president of the Bavarian State Association, Wolfram Vaitl.
"We have to stop the blatant decline in insects, we owe it to our children and grandchildren," Günter Reif concluded the successful act, which was solemnly framed by the tower winds of the music club Thurnau.

Nafta talks: Canada’s foreign minister resigns UN speech
Mexico’s government wants clarity on Nafta: they are giving both trade partners an ultimatum for an agreement.
Canada’s foreign minister now gives absolute priority to the trade agreement – and postpones her speech before the United Nations.
Due to the time constraints on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the United States and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has postponed her speech at the UN General Debate in New York.
Instead of speaking on Saturday, the minister will speak before the United Nations General Assembly on Monday, her spokesman Adam Austen said.
In the meantime, she is focusing on the renegotiation of NAFTA.
Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said on Friday that the negotiators of Canada and the United States would have 48 hours to agree if Canada were to actually join the trade agreement already made between his country and the United States.
In August, the United States and Mexico agreed on a recast of the Nafta regional free trade agreement.
US President Donald Trump indicated that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
Talks about a new edition have been going on for over a year.
By Sunday evening (local time) they are now to be completed, Trump’s administration wants to submit the agreement to the U.S. Senate before October 1.
In the event of a failure of the negotiations, Mexico's designated president Andres Manuel López Obrador had announced on Friday that he would seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against Presidential candidate Bolsonaro
Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, injured in a knife attack, has left the hospital.
The far-right ex-military wanted to fly to Río de Janeiro, where he lives, according to a report from the daily "O Globo".
After his dismissal, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will perform publicly in the South American country in the last week before the presidential election.
The politician had been attacked on open streets in early September during an election campaign event in southern Brazil.
Meanwhile, thousands of people took to the streets in several Brazilian cities to protest against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "Der nicht") had mainly called women's associations to protest against the ex-military.
Also on social networks, the associations mobilized against Bolsonaro’s racist and misogynistic statements.
Thousands of protesters were expected in São Paulo.
In the capital, Brasilia, the protests mixed with a rally of the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers’ Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He took the place of former President Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to 12 years in prison for corruption and is therefore not allowed to run for office.
The presidential election in Brazil is on October 7.
As a former mayor of the million-dollar city of São Paulo, Haddad was far behind the far-right candidate Bolsonaro in polls so far.
The "Trump of Brazil" has long been involved in politics, but has recently presented itself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates reach the absolute majority in the first round, there will be a by-election on October 28.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not emerge successfully from this – no matter who he is running against.
Bolsonaro is known for his rallying against homosexuals and blacks and glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
Again and again he shocks with verbal derailments.
Another time he said the supporters of Lula’s left-wing workers’ party should be shot.
Europe wins back Ryder Cup title
Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines - Just an hour from Disneyland, European golfers have written another Ryder Cup fairy tale just outside Paris.
Captain Thomas Björn’s team of outsiders dethroned the favored title defender USA around a toothless Tiger Woods in front of more than 150,000 spectators during the three days at Le Golf National with great blows and outstanding team spirit.
After a long illness, Danish rock legend died
Danish rock icon Kim Larsen has died.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen said on Larsen's website.
On his deathbed, Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children.
The musician had been in treatment for prostate cancer since the beginning of the year.
Larsen had become acquainted with the band Gasolin', which was hugely successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Her songs were influenced by international music stars such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the band's dissolution in 1978, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold about three million records in Denmark.
His album "Midt om natten" from 1983 is the best-selling album in Denmark to this day.
Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen praised Larsen on Sunday in a statement as a "street boy" who was "against everything, but in all hearts."
The head of government also recalled that the monarchy opponent Larsen had appeared in 2010 on the 70th birthday of the Danish Queen Margrethe II.
Rock night in the shoe factory: volume at compressed-air hammer level
"Here we stand, take the bone saw and ignite a concert evening with the power of a tiger. Only the band names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" suggest such a retelling of the rocky live music experience on Saturday evening in the hall of the Bürgerzentrum Schuhfabrik: hard rock purely by three other bands friends.
After the soundcheck and just before the concert starts, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
There is no trace of lamp fever.
Afterwards, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in conjunction with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - with their bands, the around 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night are visibly enthusiastic.
Even the quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows how to convince with the latest, unknown pieces from their own pen and the upcoming CD.
In front of the stage, the band dances during the performance to the harmonious and forceful interaction of the band.
Although "Zugabe"-Calls cannot be overheard, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leaves the stage to the trio "Here We Stand".
That hard rock is not the same as hard rock is demonstrated by guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bass and drummer Kai Hölscher with their alternative, sometimes reminiscent of classic rock of the 1970s sounds.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers" "Here We Stand" is in addition to the guitar rock also a synthesizer is used.
Not only the eager, almost ballad-like "Take Me Home" impresses by the change of melodic passages to the guitar-heavy rock riffs of the multi-layered songs.
However, the quartet "The Ignition" from Tönnishäuschen has gained a special reputation since it was founded in 2005.
Full of agility, the band presents their hard rock on Saturday.
The fact that "The Ignition" has a special stage experience with her performances in front of a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the tour in China from 2017 - is obvious and unmistakable.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann, in collaboration with the band, also sets his own accents on the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
For the sound that feels even higher than before, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers an acclaimed solo, whereby he runs through the audience.
A certain volume belongs to a genre-related hard rock concert of course: At the "Mint Mosquito" rock night, according to the mixing console team, the three-part concert of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" is about 98 decibels.
This is, for example, at the compressed-air hammer level, but is thus still clearly below the controls of the "wacken-fesitvals", which "The Ignition" indicate on their website.
Ear deafening 120 decibels in nozzle drive volume, as usual with the annual metal dike in the north of the Republic, however, the Ahlen audience does not need on this rock night.
After just under four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocky gangart have long convinced with their sovereign, virtuoso play and their own compositions.
"Here we are, taking the bone saw and igniting a concert evening with the power of a tiger," all three groups, of course in the figurative sense, can say at the end.
And above all, enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

Sailplane crash at Essen/Mülheim airport
A fatal accident occurred at Mülheim/Essen airport.
In a parking lot at Mülheim/Essen Airport, a sailplane crashed on Sunday.
The pilot died in the accident.
Near Mülheim/Essen airport, a fatal accident occurred on Sunday.
As the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" reports, a sailplane crashed at the exhibition car park at the airport.
The pilot was killed.
As the "WAZ" reports further, the flight student was on board alone - the plane is supposed to be a single-seater.
The plane was already on landing at the time of the accident.
The crash site is only a short distance away from a festival tent on the airport premises.
There has been an Oktoberfest since this weekend.
The airport Mülheim/Essen is located on the city limits of the two Ruhr area cities and directly at the driveway to the motorway 52.
From the parking lot there is a Park&Ride offer for large events at the Messe Essen or the Gruga Hall in Essen.
Trump: “And then we fell in love”
The fact that North Korean President Kim is quite well-informed in spite of the nuclear crisis is no secret.
But now Trump has made a real love declaration to his colleague.
It also has to do with Kim's "beautiful letters."
At the tender age of 72, the married U.S. president has declared himself a new flame.
The tragic thing is that it is a long-distance relationship.
In public, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love on Saturday to North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un.
In front of supporters in the U.S. state of West Virginia, Trump found almost tender words for the half-old sprout of the ruling dynasty from Pyongyang, although the one in the struggle for North Korea’s nuclear disarmament proves to be quite tough chunks.
"I was tough, he was, and it was going back and forth between us," Trump said.
And then we fell in love.
- Okay? - Yeah.
No, really.
And not only the conversations with Kim would have melted his heart.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Their personal connection has also borne political fruit: Trump referred to Kim’s announced halt to all nuclear and missile tests, even though critics see little more than lip confessions behind it.
That the affection for the infamous “Rocket Man” – so Trump’s nickname for Kim – might not be everyone’s memory, the US president seemed quite aware.
In any case, he anticipated the expected criticism at his appearance in a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling: "Donald Trump says they've fallen in love."
How terrible, how terrible is that?
This is so unpresidential.
But he cared very little about that, Trump explained, pointing his finger at the crowd: “I’ve always told you it’s so easy to be presidential.”
But then out there, not 10,000 people would be pushing into this bustling arena, but we would only have 200 people standing outside.
Oktoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler best visited, atmospheric as well as spoiled by the sun: Very varied and with a good shot of Oktoberfest flair Baesweiler's downtown on Sunday.
For the first time, the Oktoberfest took place not only in the festival tent at the fire tower, but was extended to the city by the trade association on Sunday.
Refugees Rescued From Libyan Prison With Video
Nigerian refugees have used a mobile phone video to point out their disastrous detention conditions in Libya, enabling them to be rescued.
The group had filmed the recording in their cell in the coastal town of Sawija in July under threat of death and disseminated it online.
"They refuse to send us back," a man said in the video message.
We suffer here, we die here.
The recording was sent to the website "France 24 Observers", whose editors alerted the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were finally flown to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video, we could not have returned to Nigeria," Efe Onyeka, who recorded the video, told AFP.
The 25-year-old was arrested in Libya while trying to cross the Mediterranean to Europe.
With the video, he put his life in danger, according to his own statement.
One of his colleagues had been beaten almost to death by the guards, Onyeka said.
In general, the conditions of detention were catastrophic: "They beat us all with pipes and sticks."
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organises the voluntary return of refugees stranded in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria were sent back to their homes this year, the IOM spokesman in the West African country, Jorge Galindo, said.
The case of the now rescued Nigerians is not unusual in view of the poor detention conditions in Libya.
He hadn’t heard of a phone call for help yet.
International organizations have long criticized the conditions in the Libyan refugee camps as inhumane.
The North African state, which is largely dominated by militias, is the main transit country for migrants on their way from Africa to Europe.
When a teacher went to the primary school place on Sunday afternoon to prepare her lessons for Monday, she surprised a burglar.
At about 4:50 p.m., the teacher entered the building via the main entrance.
In the entrance hall of the first floor, she saw a man fleeing immediately.
First through a door, then over the roof terrace and from there via a staircase to the ground floor or the forecourt.
The teacher notified the police who initiated the investigation.
Whether things or money have been stolen cannot yet be said.

German was trapped in his own car for days
A 75-year-old has had to endure in his car for several days and nights in a forest area in central France after he stuck the car off all forest paths and a tree blocked the car door.
Rescuers accidentally discovered the car on Saturday afternoon near a pasture and rescued the missing person since Tuesday evening, police said on Sunday.
The 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was reportedly in good health despite the cold nights and the long period without care.
He said he was now looking forward to his home.
The pensioner had been reported missing by his family after he had not returned from a ride on his SUV through the local meadows and fields on Tuesday.
Despite intensive search, the man’s whereabouts had remained unclear for days.
Laschet urges rule of law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) has in conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, according to his own statements, called for the rule of law in Turkey.
The relations between the two countries are currently "overshadowed," Laschet said on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne Airport.
This mainly concerns waves of arrests, press freedom and religious freedom.
"If relations are to normalize in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, then the rule of law is a very important prerequisite."
Laschet also addressed the cases of Germans in prison in Turkey.
He has expressed the expectation that freedom of expression will be respected.
Erdogan reiterated the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan had been transferred to a flight-ready building of the Federal Ministry of Defence at Cologne Airport.
Originally it was supposed to take place at Schloss Wahn - but the castle owners had rejected it out of political conviction against Erdogan.
After the talks, Erdogan traveled further to the opening of the Ditib mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had cancelled a joint appearance in the building.
But he said, "The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country."
And we are also their contact person - and not the Turkish president.
Lack of confidence in the US: North Korea calls for disarmament
While US President Trump will not tire of emphasizing the success of the negotiations on North Korea’s denuclearization, the East Asian regime is more sober.
Secretary of State Ri calls for Washington's support.
North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has accused the U.S. government in the UN general debate of blocking negotiations for a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula with its ongoing sanctions.
"The recent stalemate comes from the US building on coercive measures that are deadly to building trust," Ri said in New York.
Disarmament would be unthinkable for North Korea under these circumstances.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way we will be the first to disarm ourselves," the North Korean chief diplomat said.
That sanctions could “force North Korea on its knees” is “a dream of people who don’t know us.”
To build trust, however, his country stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test facility, Ri emphasized.
However, there have been no "corresponding reactions" from the US side, the minister criticized.
Because of North Korea’s nuclear and missile program, the UN Security Council decided on sanctions against the internationally isolated country three times last year alone.
US President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urged the United Nations in recent days to strictly adhere to the sanctions.
At the same time, the U.S. government is working on a rapprochement.
In June, Trump met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for the first time.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US president is aiming for a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo will return to Pyongyang for talks on ending North Korea’s nuclear weapons program.
The HoT serves: New cuisine with donations from the community
That they were actually in a youth meeting, the many visitors of the house of the open door HoT got nothing: white blankets and flower ornaments on the tables and a large buffet were waiting for the guests after the Thanksgiving service.
The young people of the HoT had enchanted the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The facility was funded by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to thank with the food.
The start with the new facility was not exactly easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT, remembers.
We had already filled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.
But then on the first day after the summer break came the nasty surprise: A power outage had put the huge, two-piece refrigerator out of operation, the food was spoiled and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start all over again: we got a lot of support from friends and neighbors, but the children and young people wanted to do it alone," Westbuer said.
And so they all tackled.
The result could be seen, the guests were enthusiastic.
"Kitcheners can't do better," praised one visitor, while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or guests were allowed to use quiche, liver cheese, or cake.
"It's really great what the children and young people have put on their feet," Pastor Frank Beckmann stressed, while magician Stephan Lammen amazed with card tricks and other tricks.
Jürgen Sator leaves the Board of Governors of North Rhine-Westphalia
Out of frustration with criticism from his own ranks, the head of the Essener Tafel, Jörg Sartor, has resigned from his post in the Landesverband.
Sartor had become known nationwide because the Essener Tafel had introduced a admission stop for foreigners.
He had already resigned in July as vice-chairman of the NRW tables, Sartor told the "Welt am Sonntag".
Too many have fallen in my back.
The head of the Tafeln-Landesverband NRW, Wolfgang Weilerswist, expressed his understanding of the decision of his longtime deputy to the dpa.
The sharp criticism has taken Sartor with it.
"I can understand his step - there have been people who didn't know exactly why the Essener Tafel does this."
But Sartor is still active for the Essener Tafel - "six days a week, nothing changes," Weilerswist said.
Sartor again criticized colleagues from other tables in the "Welt am Sonntag" magazine.
You should not take the approach of "without us, the people in the city are starving."
It is the responsibility of the state to ensure that people do not starve.
The Essener did not attend a congress of tables on Friday in Berlin.
"There's too much sweet cuddle being told to me," he said.
There are all these social fuzzis that criticized me at the time.
SF Lorch play 2:0 guided tour - Gmünder Tagespost
Fußball, Bezirksliga Lorch loses against Neuler 2:3 - TV Heuchlingen wins in Kirchheim after deficit - Bettringen beats Lauchheim clear.
With 2:0, Lorch was already in the lead in the home game against TV Neuler - in the end it was 2:3 and the disappointment with the sports friends was great.
In Kirchheim, the TVH quickly fell behind with 0:1, but won with 2:1 after 90 minutes. The SGB was at the top of the table with a 3:0 in the meantime.
Gladbach plays two-time lead - Schalke without embolo with first victory
Borussia Mönchengladbach has to wait for an away win in Wolfsburg.
At 2:2, the foals play a lead twice.
Schalke comes against Mainz to the first win of the season (1:0).
(sda) Schalke has maneuvered four times in the first five league games with early counter-goals in the offside.
Now the team of Domenico Tedesco again showed the strength with which it had taken the first place behind Bayern last season.
Alessandro Schöpf led the home team in the eleventh minute after strong preliminary work by Yevgeny Konopljanka by head, as a result of which the hosts preserved the mini cushion with a compact defensive performance.
Thanks to an exceptional comeback, Borussia Dortmund is greeting again from the top of the Bundesliga.
The team of Lucien Favre had negotiated a 0-2 draw against Bayer Leverkusen until the break, but came to a 4:2 victory in the 2nd half.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65th) and Marco Reus (69th) matched up with a doublet within four minutes, while Paco Alcacer, who was replaced by Favre in the 63rd minute, made another doublet in the final phase (86th/94) for the crowning conclusion of the performance increase after the break.
The first victory was also won by VfB Stuttgart.
In the meantime, against Werder Bremen, decimated by a yellow-red card against Milos Veljkovic before the break, the Stuttgarters had to fear.
Borna Sosa and the inattentive goalie Ron-Robert Zieler manufactured a curious throw-in owner's goal that helped the guests balance in the 68th minute.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro led the VfB to the first victory.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not make a completely successful debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The Swiss quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang Gladbacher took the lead twice, played 2:2 and have been waiting for an away victory in the VW city since 2003.
Renato Steffen was responsible for Wolfsburg's 1-1 equalization with his second Bundesligator.
Yann Sommer was powerless in the flat shot from 20 meters of the Aargau, as was the second goal after an hour.
Nevertheless, the trends at Gladbach are quite promising.
Alassane Pléa proves to be a goalkeeper in the storm of foals.
Against Wolfsburg, the French record purchase came from OGC Nice hit for the third time in a row and for the seventh time in the seventh mandatory game.
After seven laps, Gladbach took fourth place.
Within 40 minutes, the previously undefeated Werder Bremen maneuvered against VfB Stuttgart into an uncomfortable position.
After 19 minutes, the team of Florian Kohlfeldt was surprised by a Stuttgart opponent, who the ex-Luganesi Anastasios Donis finished with his first season goal, after 36 minutes Milos Veljkovic continued to his team: The 23-year-old Serb cashed after a jersey supper against Daniel Didavi Yellow-Red.
Although Stuttgart’s defender Borna Sosa and goalie Ron-Robert Zieler brought the Bremer back into the game with a curious throw-in owner’s goal (68th), a quarter-hour before the end Gonzalo Castro shot the Stuttgarters back on the victory road.
Nuremberg decided the duel against Düsseldorf 3:0 sovereignly for themselves.
After half an hour, Hanno Behrens already put the home team on track with Foulpenalty.
Macedonians vote on new state name
Today, around 1.8 million Macedonians vote to change their country’s name in North Macedonia.
If yes, the nearly three decades of conflict with neighbouring Greece could be resolved.
Athens had insisted on a name change because of its northern province of the same name and blocked any Macedonian approach to the West.
Voters are also deciding on the future of Western integration.
The U.S. had announced that the country could quickly become a member of NATO if a positive outcome of the referendum were to be achieved.
Syrians in U-Haft.
The refugee attacked three women.
A Syrian brutally beat up three pensioners and wounded them in some cases severely.
The 41-year-old asylum seeker had raided the Fluchtgasse in Alsergrund on Friday around 10 p.m.
When the police arrived, they appealed to the accused, who threw his fists at passersby and tried to attack them, to his behavior.
Then the Syrian tried to beat and kick the officials.
A little later it turned out that the suspect had hit three elderly ladies (65, 67, 75) with his fists on the floor at a tram stop on Währinger Straße shortly before.
He also kicked the trio with his feet.
Some of the pensioners were seriously injured.
They suffered hematomas, bruises and concussions.
The asylum seeker was also seriously injured "for an unknown reason", as the police said.
He was taken to the hospital and monitored throughout the treatment.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost exactly a year after the entry into force of the marriage for all, SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his longtime friend Christoph Rohde.
The two said yes on Saturday in Hamburg.
A registered life partnership had not come into question for her, Kahrs had previously said to the "Bild" newspaper.
"If we get married, it's right." He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a budgetary spokesman of the SPD parliamentary group and one of the spokesmen of the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs had stirred up a stir on June 30, 2017.
He had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of "stumbling" on the subject.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said, alluding to the accidental announcement of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
As of October 1, 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to have their life partnership registered since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example with regard to the right of adoption.
Garden day: 400 meters hedge cut
There was a lot of work ahead of the members of the Citizens' Association Kinderhaus and the Society for Leprosy.
Because about 400 meters of hedges around the gardens of the inhabitants of the Pfründnerhaus should be cut.
Supported by the residents, it went to work for around twelve supporters.
"We are doing this to reduce costs," said the chairman of the citizens' association Walter Schröer.
And so many things have accumulated.
Due to the hot summer we are late this time, but luckily it is just a cut.
Because already in the spring, the hedge had already been shaved.
The breakfast always following work also has a long tradition.
“Everyone should stay strong,” said Walter Schröer.
World Cup in Rio: Hannes Aigner wins gold at the Canoe Slalom World Cup
Augsburger Hannes Aigner has won the gold medal at the conclusion of the Canoe Slalom World Championship in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old made a perfect run on the Olympic track on Sunday.
Two years ago, he had missed Olympic bronze by three hundredths of a second.
I was well prepared, had enough rides here at the facility and it was all right today," said the London Olympic Third in 2012.
In the finish he threw away his paddle for joy and raised both arms victoriously - knowing that it would be enough for at least one medal.
After all, he had number four.
But the six remaining starters could not top his fabulous time of 89.69 seconds.
Second was the Czech Jiri Prskavec ahead of the Russian Pawel Eigel.
The Gauting Police Inspectorate reports the first attempted burglary this autumn into a single-family house.
Fortunately, the perpetrators failed.
The days are getting shorter - burglars want to take advantage of that again.
The Gauting Police Inspectorate reported yesterday the first attempted burglary this fall.
The fact that it remained in the attempt at the single-family house on Königswieser Straße is due to the alarm system.
It started when the perpetrators laid hands on Friday shortly before 8 p.m.
The burglars suspected that the residents were not at home.
The alarm system, however, apparently surprised them so much that they escaped without prey.
Notes to PI Gauting, phone (089) 8 93 13 30.
Bankruptcy at Hertha: Overtaken by reality: Bayern against Ajax challenged
The predicate is unbeatable: The defeat in Berlin wants FC Bayern "not to be pleased".
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first interim conclusion for the term of Niko Kovac.
The first small performance drop under the new coach Niko Kovac is by no means expected to increase to a greater autumnal low for the Munich team.
“A week ago, we had the impression that we were invincible.
Now a little bit of reality has caught up with us," Thomas Müller stated after the deserved 2-0 defeat at Hertha BSC and called for a reaction for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Anyone who knows us knows that this really annoys us and that is why we give gas towards Tuesday.
For the first time in more than a year away, no own goal scored, as at the same time of the pre-season two mandatory games in series without a win, the leaderboard in the football Bundesliga lost for the time being to Borussia Dortmund.
Although the overall situation is far from as dramatic as the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, the record champion must be warned.
FC Augsburg at the 1:1 with its running-intensive man-to-man tactics and the Berliners through their playful pinpoints over the outside delivered two blueprints within three days, as the last seemingly overpowering Bayern can be cracked after all.
"Those who know FC Bayern know that we don't like this and we will do everything we can to be successful again," Kovac said.
Otherwise, however, he treated his losers in his native city surprisingly gently and pushed his first defeat as Munich coach only on the once again poor handling of opportunities.
A victory against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would nevertheless make the first interim conclusion of his term positive - otherwise the tone is likely to tighten.
For example, Kovac did not take any extraordinary measures before this season's second appearance in the royal class after the 2-0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the day off on Sunday, as planned, the short preparation for the second preliminary round game against Ajax, which had also defeated AEK Athens with 3:0.
"Now it caught us in two games, but we will also score our goals again," announced national team captain Manuel Neuer.
Like already after the lost cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt at the same place, Joshua Kimmich spoke plainly.
The right-wing defender acted in the role of a warner.
"I don't think that's all bad luck, we have to work it out again because we don't make the many chances and make the mistakes in the back," the 23-year-old stressed shortly before leaving the Olympic stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous season, the Bayern were already behind Dortmund with five counters, which has now taken the lead again with a point of lead.
And so Kimmich rated at least positively with a wink that the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bavaria has now come to an end.
“That’s a good thing,” the national player said.
It’s good for the league.
DFB boss in line of fire: <0xC3><0x96>zil-Causa: sharp attack from Erdogan to Grindel
With serious accusations, Turkish President Erdogan denounces an exclusion of Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the line.
Now a new post is to be created.
Berlin - On different stages, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the sovereignty of interpretation in Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil.
After the Turkish president strongly criticized the handling of the former world champion in Germany at the opening of the great Ditib mosque in Cologne, the DFB head defended the association line.
On early Sunday morning, Grindel, personally attacked by <0xC3><0x96>zil, announced the consequences of the cause in the Mainz ZDF "sports studio".
"We have to draw very precise conclusions in the future - because we also have many players with a migration background in the U-Teams - that such a thing does not happen again," said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without a migration background as further integration officer.
At the same time, Grindel once again stated that Erdogan does not stand for the values of football and the DFB.
He had sharply denounced racism against <0xC3><0x96>zil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil, born and raised in Germany, and our Ilkay.
They excluded them from this society because they were allowed to be photographed with me in England,” Erdogan said on Saturday in the cathedral city.
Honestly, as their president, I couldn’t take it for granted that our two young men, who have risen to the German national team, were excluded.
Grindel referred to Gündogan’s statement that, unlike <0xC3><0x96>zil after the World Cup affair, which began with photos of the two with Erdogan, he felt “reasonably treated by the DFB”.
At the same time, he announced that he would be putting himself in front of players in the future.
That someone says, "If I win, I'm German, if I lose, I'm a migrant - that's not possible."
"I am very sorry that he has such an impression," Grindel said.
We should have defended Mesut more, I always said that.
But he does not see a basis for <0xC3><0x96>zil’s return to the national team.
As a consequence, an additional integration officer will be appointed alongside the Brazilian-born Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon.
“If someone without a migrant background clearly affects society and football and says, ‘The issue is important, we have to take care of it’, that would also be an initiative to provide a better foundation for our clubs on the ground, where integration must work,” Grindel said.
Despite criticism of his person after the World Cup and the <0xC3><0x96>zil affair, he wants to run for the office as DFB president again next year.
"I'm doing my job and trying to do it as well as I can," Grindel said.
Year-old builds three accidents within three hours
Coburg/Rödental - According to police, the 75-year-old caused the accidents on Friday between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m.
Initially, the 75-year-old driver was approached by a lady at the red traffic light in the area of Lauterer Höhe.
He told the retiree that he had driven against his car.
However, there was no personal exchange, as the 75-year-old could no longer find the lady in the parking lot.
A short time later, the police received a telephone report about a driver who had come off the road and driven against a guide post.
In response, the man did not want the police on the spot and then drove off.
After that, the Rödentaler drove home.
However, in his place of residence, where he has lived for decades, the pensioner has proceeded and when turning a construction vehicle has been rammed.
Eventually, the police were able to find him and stop him.
His car suffered significant accident damage.
The 75-year-old made a confused impression and could not remember many things.
The damage is about 1300 euros.
Moor fire in Meppen: Almost 1000 personnel are still deployed.
Around four weeks after the outbreak of the moor fire on a Federal Armed Forces site in the Emsland, 980 personnel are still engaged in the extinguishing work.
This was announced by the German Armed Forces on Sunday.
As the situation continued to develop steadily, according to a spokesperson, 70 volunteers were recently withdrawn.
A further reduction in the number of personnel is planned, it said.
On the night before Sunday, an above-ground fire had been discovered and extinguished.
Last week, the disaster had been lifted, which was declared well a week earlier on September 21, because it was feared that the flames would endanger adjacent forests and settlements due to wind and sparks.
On Thursday, it was said that the fire would no longer spread to neighboring communities.
At times, more than 1,500 firefighters tried to get the fire under control.
The Luftwaffe continues to support the work on the Bundeswehr test site at Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also reconnaissance flights with the Bundeswehr drones.
According to the Bundeswehr, reconnaissance flights with "Tornados" are also planned for October 2 and 5.
The fire was triggered by test rockets fired by Airbus technicians.
The smoke flag of the Moorbrand was temporarily pulled up to a hundred kilometers far across the northwest of Germany as far as Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr wants to set up a contact point that will receive damage reports.
Initial claims for damages had already been announced by hoteliers and holiday home owners.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church of St. Katharinen in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost exactly a year after the entry into force of the marriage for all, the politician married his longtime friend in Hamburg.
The two have been a couple for 25 years.
Hamburg - Almost exactly a year after the entry into force of the marriage for all, SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his longtime friend Christoph Rohde.
The two said yes on Saturday in Hamburg.
A registered life partnership had not come into question for her, Kahrs had previously said to the "Bild" newspaper.
If we get married, right.
He has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a budgetary spokesman of the SPD parliamentary group and one of the spokesmen of the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs had stirred up a stir on June 30, 2017.
He had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of "stumbling" on the subject.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said, alluding to the accidental announcement of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
As of October 1, 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to have their life partnership registered since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example with regard to the right of adoption.
Macedonian Referendum on New State Names Begins
In Macedonia, the highly anticipated referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
Around 1.8 million voters will decide whether their state will be called North Macedonia in the future.
This is because of its northern province of the same name, neighbouring Greece.
As a means of pressure, Athens had blocked every approach from Skopje to the EU and NATO for almost three decades.
Should the citizens vote yes, they will also be the starting point for their country’s western integration.
Elie Wiesel, The Author Who Saved the Shoah from Forgotten
Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel would have turned 90 on September 30.
The 1986 Nobel Peace Prize laureate dies in the United States in 2016, leaving behind a work that preserves the horrors of the Shoah for posterity.
Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve relatives in stress situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs may continue to be taken only with explicit consent, Swisstransplant emphasizes.
(dpa) Switzerland is launching an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This should facilitate organ donation and relieve relatives in stress situations.
People who want to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes can then be retrieved from Swisstransplant if necessary.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can continue to be taken - as in Germany - only with explicit consent, Swisstransplant emphasizes.
It is assumed that 15 percent of Swiss people have a donor card, says Franz Immer, director of the Swisstransplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of cases, a card is found at the decisive moment in potential donors.
In more than 60 percent of conversations, relatives do not know the wish of the deceased.
"They then have to decide on behalf of the deceased, which is often very burdensome," says Immer.
A similar registration system already exists in the UK.
In Germany, there are considerations to store information about possible organ donation on the health insurance card, as the spokeswoman of the Federal Center for Health Education, Marita Völker-Albert says.
"A register in which people can enter their wishes - for or against organ donation - does not exist," she says.
Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has spoken out in favour of a new regulation of organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would initially be considered an organ donor, unless he or relatives object.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-Year-Old Student Is World Champion in Head Computing
14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is the world champion in mind computing.
He won the weekend in Wolfsburg against 39 competitors.
Martina Flamme-Jasper from the Science Museum Phaeno, the venue of the competition, said on Sunday.
16-year-old Wenzel Gruß from Germany took third place.
The youngest World Cup participant was a twelve-year-old Japanese student, the oldest a 74-year-old retired from France, as chief arbiter Ralf Laue said.
The computer science professor from Zwickau (Saxony) organizes the competition every two years.
Previous tasks were, for example: 14,130 214 x 17,981,822 or 57,809,355 + 28 x 16,448.333.
Since spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon, where participants competed against guests from the audience with calculators.
Wenzel Gruß from Lastrup demonstrated how, while calculating, he holds a ball with his head in the air.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
A total of 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
Greetings was in Bielefeld two years ago as a 14-year-old.
With terms like superbrain, genius or prodigy, organizers can’t start Laue.
"Head calculations can be trained," he said.
Many participants practiced several hours a day.
In India or Singapore, there are even stadium-oriented computing competitions.
The disciplines include, for example, the square root drawing of six-digit numbers.
When calculating versatility, candidates are given surprise tasks for which they need to quickly find a solution strategy.
Here, too, the Germans had good chances, the main arbitrator said.
Otherwise, Asians are often advantageous, because head computing is learned more intensively and with other effective methods already in early childhood.
Video with naked Serena Williams: It’s all about breast cancer early detection
Tennis ass Serena Williams shows off her sensitive and sensitive side.
The 37-year-old wants to point out breast cancer with this video and advocate for early detection.
It is about life and death, but also about courage and enlightenment.
Serena Williams sings upstairs without the song "I Touch Myself" from the group "The Divinyls" - only her hands cover her most intimate places.
Singer Chrissy Amphlett has died.
The emotional video is part of the “I Touch Myself” project, which is about breast cancer early detection that can save lives.
Serena Williams died almost a year ago.
At the birth of their daughter Alexis Olympia, there were complications.
Emergency surgery was initiated to save the baby’s life.
In a subsequent CT, blood clots in Serena's lung were then discovered.
Just in time...
Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
The federal government is planning a significant extension of the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the turquoise-blue coalition will send a corresponding draft law on the so-called "symbols law".
The aim is to significantly increase the number of terrorist or similar groups covered by the ban.
Polar cold air brings fresh snow to the mountains in the west
Ms. Holle is shaking out her beds for the first time in the West next week: Polar cold air reaches Vorarlberg, North Tyrol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit at the beginning of the week drops to 1,500 to 1,200 meters - in narrow valleys it can snow down to about 1,000 meters at strong intensity, it was said.
From the Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern, 20 to 40 centimetres of fresh snow can be expected above 2,000 meters.
On higher pass roads (Arlbergpass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße) the road conditions become wintery.
Farmers are allowed to start their annual kink care on Monday
Schleswig-Holstein’s farmers are allowed to start their annual kink care on Monday.
The unique "green walls" in Germany have shaped the landscape of the forest-poor state for about 200 years.
The up to five meters wide tree hedges and scrub hedges are "forest replacement" and for many animals and plants the last retreat rooms.
Knicks connect scattered habitats as corridors, through which the exchange of organisms can still function, as the managing director of the Naturschutzbund Deutschland (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Knicks are living fences
The Knicks were built on the orders of the Danish king Christian VI in 1766, who ruled Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field boundaries and livestock fences, they also supplied the farmers with firewood and beams for their half-timbered houses.
His name "Knick" comes from that time: by "knicking" the branches, the dense, intertwined boundaries could develop.
Today, some 45,000 kilometres of hedges stretch between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, giving the image of a wood-rich, diversely structured landscape.
According to the NABU, they are now used by around 7,000 animal species as a substitute habitat.
In a kilometer of Knick, up to 1800 different species could live and breed up to 30 pairs of birds.
However, the Knick can only fulfil its ecologically important function if it is properly maintained in winter.
Otherwise, it becomes a light row of trees that, in addition to biodiversity, also loses its wind protection effect, Ludwichowski said.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, folding care may only be carried out outside the breeding season from October to March.
After tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesian talks about situation on site
In an interview with the Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland (RND), the local Radika Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquake and tsunami:
Were you there during the tsunami?
No, I was in Jakarta on the island of Java at the time.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I heard about the tsunami, I immediately made my way back to Sulawesi.
I arrived there on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight because the airport on Palu was closed at the time.
What is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that aid supplies can also be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all completely destroyed.
Our office of World Vision has also been destroyed, but we have provisionally set up something where we have also accommodated other people.
Where are the people living in Sulawesi now?
Many have run to surrounding hills, where they still persevere for fear of another tsunami and earthquakes, and where they have no access to water and food.
Some are staying in front of their homes, there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores and also the gas stations are completely closed, people partially steal food and gasoline.
The public service is completely shut down, the national government is helping out.
A prison has also been destroyed, the prisoners are partly running free and finding them is difficult.
There are still many bodies around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How is the communication and information supply on the island?
At the moment we have cell phone reception, but before that did not work and we only got information via the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors, and other people they don’t know if they live or where they are, because people were not at home during the earthquakes, but were on the road at work, for example.
The tsunami warning system did not work properly.
Do you have any information on this?
We don’t know the reasons for this, but when the warning came, many thought “Okay, not a tsunami” – and then he came.
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami, there was misinformation that a tsunami was hitting the region and they ran onto the surrounding mountains.
Isn’t an island like Sulawesi, located on the Pacific Fire Ring, prepared for earthquakes?
Yes, there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We usually know how to respond to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has hit a lot of people.
Muscle injuries against Werder: VfB has to give up on Aogo and Donis for a long time
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will be missing from VfB Stuttgart with serious muscle injuries for a long time.
Aogo had contracted a muscle fiber tear in the rear left thigh at 2:1 against Werder Bremen on Saturday, the football Bundesligist announced on Sunday.
In Donis, the doctors diagnosed a muscle bundle tear in the thigh.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hannover 96 on Saturday and will probably still miss games after the following international break.
VfB Stuttgart did not make a forecast for downtime.
A muscle bundle tear usually heals within six to eight weeks, a muscle fiber tear usually heals a little faster.
Triumph of Hyperrealism at the San Sebástian Film Festival
San Sebastián - With the Film Festival of San Sebastián closes annually the series of the most prestigious European festivals.
Despite all the songs on the cinema can be summed up: 2018 was a remarkable year for the film.
After a convincing competition in Cannes, especially with strong contributions from Europe and Asia and a Venice that attracted a lot of attention with Oscar candidates from Hollywood, San Sebastian also delivered one of its best competitions of recent years.
On Sunday morning, the fire department in Olching tried to catch an injured duck.
However, the action lasted for some time.
Even a boat was used.
Olching - Walkers at Lake Olching noticed a white, injured duck on Sunday morning.
She was in the area of the water watch station.
To help the animal, the passersby called the police and the fire brigade.
However, the first attempts to catch the duck went wrong.
Despite the injury, she was able to evade the forces again and again.
In the end, she fled to the lake.
With a lifeboat, the firefighters were able to circle the animal and push it back ashore, where it was then, after almost an hour, put into a transport box by a firefighter with a hearty handle.
The duck, injured on the chest, was then taken to the veterinary clinic of the LMU in Oberschleißheim.
But according to the initial assessments, their chances of survival are rather low.
Biathlete Julian Eberhard aims for World Cup medal
Fourth place at Olympia was biathlete Julian Eberhard for a long time.
In the coming winter, the Saalfeldener wants to catch up on the missing precious metal at the World Cup in <0xC3><0x96>stersund.
The last shot cost the 31-year-old in the Olympic sprint of Pyeongchang the close to reaching medal.
Seven-tenths of a second was missing at the end on bronze.
"I deliberately took time to process this," says Eberhard at the opening of the MyGym gym in his hometown of Saalfelden.
A medal was the goal, I was in top shape, but it just didn’t want to be.
The Pinzgauer is all the more motivated to catch up with the missing precious metal in the new season: "The goal can only be to get back to a major event with the constitution, to win something.
At some point, you have to strike.
The World Cup track in <0xC3><0x96>stersund (SWE) is Eberhard: "I have already closed the track in my heart", he recalls with pleasure his fourth World Cup place in the singles race last year.
Immediately after the Olympics, he celebrated the only single victory for Austria in the last World Cup winter in the mass start competition of Kontiolahti (FIN).
With the season he ran in Oslo (NOR) to rank two.
Brett Kavanaugh: FBI Investigation at Turbo Speed
The time is extremely short and the number of interviews planned is very limited.
With an FBI investigation at a turbo rate, the Republicans in the U.S. Senate want to secure the thin majority for the controversy over coercion allegations judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
President Donald Trump has set a deadline for investigators to investigate the alleged incidents over 30 years ago.
The most recent turn in the drama about Kavanaugh’s appeal, accompanied by a cultural struggle, had been triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor Christine Blasey Ford, in which the lawyer ran furious tirades against the opposition Democrats, the Senate Judiciary Committee should pave the way for the final confirmation of the arch-conservative judge at the U.S. Supreme Court.
The majority of Republicans seemed secure when suddenly Senator Jeff Flake, contrary to his original announcement, declared that he would agree but demand an FBI investigation.
After tumultuous scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who had described the heavy talks on Thursday as “disgusting,” initially abstained from further attacks on women and, on the contrary, spoke of “happiness in misfortune.”
In this way, the last doubts could be cleared, he said.
Later, at an election rally, Trump harshly attacked Democrats for rejecting Kavanaugh: “They are trying to block and destroy.”
Trump orders FBI investigation into Kavanaugh case
The White House has also severely restricted investigators’ powers.
A government official told the Wall Street Journal: “They’re not going on a fishing trip.”
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses will be heard.
According to the municipality, the mobile radar device installed in a "civil vehicle" of the municipality of Ried for monitoring the speed limit will be stationed on the Gartenstraße from Monday, 1 October.
There is also the Federal School Centre.
The municipality also operates several fixed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: Fear has been felt
Coaches Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated their first win of the season against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is great after the first win of the season.
Nevertheless, against Mainz, the factor time also played a role.
Gelsenkirchen - It is now well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist at football matches.
It was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
"I've seen every ball in it.
And there were a lot of corners and a lot of balls in our penalty area," said Schalke 04's sports board - and breathed up.
After all, the Königsblauen had still managed to bring the bare 1-0 against the Rhine Hesse over time and thus the first season victory under the roof.
In fact, it could have been different.
After the lead by Alessandro Schöpf 11 had given safety to the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco: "In total, the first half was good, both playful and from pressing", the head obviously played more and more a role as the duration of the game increased.
Don't create a headball monster
"The last ten minutes have felt like two hours for me," said Heidel, "If the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand that."
The boys were afraid to give that out of their hands and therefore retreated further and further.
And defended with man and mouse against Mainz.
To save the first three counters of the season.
"We have all fallen a huge stone from the heart," said Schöpf, who had no insignificant part in it with his headball hit: "I am actually the worst headball player in the team."
In the end, only victory counts.
The relief was felt throughout the arena, of course also at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start in the early stages and make a fireworks show," said Schalke's head coach.
The victory was important.
Finally, we can look forward to a few hours.
I am very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We played smartly, quietly and bravely, so we have to play games over 90 minutes.
Probably the biggest shortcoming of the afternoon: Königsblau missed it, rather worrying about clearer conditions.
The possibilities for this were finally there, for example by the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who twice hit the latte 59th/72nd or Amine Harit 62nd.
"Then it wouldn't have been a tremor victory," Tedesco said: "You've already felt the fear a bit."
So I'm glad we won.
He wasn’t the only shalker.
Fischbachau: Smoke column visible in the Leitzachtal 2 km
The smoke was not overlooked.
From about two kilometers away, a hiker in the Leitzachtal observed a fire on Sunday at around 13.30 a.m.
Now the police are investigating.
Fischbachau - Police and fire department soon found out the cause: An unknown person had set fire to garbage on a two-square-metre area on Gschwendner Berg.
According to police, it seemed as if he had monitored the fire for a long time, but then left the fire unattended.
And that near the forest.
30 Fischbachau firefighters were busy pulling apart and extinguishing.
The police are now investigating arson.
Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion on an equal footing
In front of them is the author, Professor Doctor Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He has repeatedly followed the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"I have made it my mission to bring interesting people to Greven for many years," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Treff" - the association that cooperates with the alliance "Cultural Policy" in the orientation of the evening.
El-Mafaalani gets very loosely into the reading, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the subject in an understandable way.
With a lot of gestures, solid numbers and some jokes, he brings the audience closer to one of the most conflicting themes: migration and integration.
Why do conflicts arise despite successful integration?
The Syrian author uses the answer to the question of a metaphor.
The German society sits at a table, the first generation of migrants at the cat table.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to sit at the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they have always sat at the big table and now want to participate.
This leads to conflict.
It is not therefore decisive whether you are politically on the right or on the left, but rather: "Am I in favour of or against an open society?"
In the beginning, the discussion round starts more and more aggressively.
And there is a need for speech.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration among students.
El-Mafaalani stands for, not on stage, a symbol of the discussion: it is on eye level.
The professor of sociology does not impose his opinion, stressing that he speaks of the average, not of individual destinies.
He is pleased that there is interest in the issue, because "only when we understand what the problem is can we find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
During the subsequent signing lesson he also had an open ear for the questions of the guests and was also intensively discussed in the foyer, with prepared Kurdish specialties.
Basketball: Bonn and Gießen win opening matches
The Giessen 46ers and Telekom Baskets Bonn have finished the first day of the Basketball Bundesliga (BBL) with a home and an away win.
Giessen prevailed in a hard-fought game in his own hall with 91:84 (43:46) against the Central German BC.
The ambitious Bonner won at the BG Göttingen with 86:79 (49:47).
First leader of the season is Alba Berlin after the 112:55 gala on Saturday against Science City Jena.
At the beginning of the new season, German champions Bayern Munich and former series champion Brose Bamberg had much more trouble.
Munich already struggled on Friday to a 83:77 at ratiopharm Ulm, Bamberg won on Saturday the Frankenderby at s.Oliver Würzburg with 84:80.
Building in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 plots
The demand is apparently huge: Over 100 interested parties have applied for the purchase of one of the lands in Landsham-South.
The municipality of Pliening has sold the first plots of land in the new construction area Landsham-Süd on the free market.
Mayor Roland Frick said.
In addition, the application phase is completed for those 20 plots that the municipality offers at more favourable conditions or prices - similar to the previous local model.
More than 100 applications have been received, according to Frick.
"The documents are currently being reviewed" with regard to the application criteria, completeness and accuracy.
According to the Plieninger mayor, the goal is to have the applicants ranking list for the 20 plots by the end of the year and to submit them to the municipal council.
After that, the award can be made.
A total of 50 plots of land for single and semi-detached houses will be created on the site in the south of Landsham, as well as four plots for multi-family buildings with expected eight residential units each.
The development is now virtually complete, the roads and roads are to be paved soon.
A single plot and two of the apartment buildings belong to a private person, the rest of the municipality of Pliening.
It sells the majority on the free market, 20 plots in a socially acceptable model.
According to Frick, the two multi-family houses of the municipality will be built as affordable housing.
With a total of 16 free state-funded, income-oriented housing.
Room for 200 people
Approximately 200 people will be living on the newly built Landsham-South area.
Not only that: according to Frick, the start for the construction of a new kindergarten is now taking place there, at the beginning of October.
It will house three kindergarten and three nativity groups and a multi-purpose room.
The opening is scheduled for September 2019, the start of the next kindergarten year.
This is how Schalkes Naldo "great sport" also succeeds on the bench
Not in the starting eleven for the third time in a row: Nevertheless, Naldo thanks Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues had not sat in the Schalker Startelf for the third time in a row, but on the exchange bench, the understanding would have been great for many people, if the almost two-metre-sized Brazilian had once really talked about the frustration of the soul.
But when the Schalker players gathered in the middle circle after the 1-0 victory over FSV Mainz 05 as usual and thanked head coach Domenico Tedesco to all his professionals, the 36-year-old, whom everyone calls Naldo for simplicity, turned in and said, "We have to thank you, coach!"
"It was very emotional, it was great sport," Tedesco later said of the reaction of his deputy captain, who, despite his renewed reservist existence, had no grudge whatsoever.
Probably Naldo, who was celebrated as the best Schalker last season, knows that he did not really get on the ground with his coach - but got a break for good reason.
One reason called "load control."
It was not easy to tell him
"It wasn't easy to tell him, I'm telling you quite honestly," Tedesco said of the moment he told Naldo that he wasn't in the starting eleven.
He is an important player, he is an important person.
But it’s always about the thing, it’s about the club,” Tedesco justified the move.
Naldo played against Bayern and Porto for 90 minutes.
He's 36 years old.
It is important that everyone is able to sniff through at the moment.
And that we all stay in the boat," Tedesco explained the rotation, which also recently caught Naldo.
And to which the Brazilian responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: by proving to be an exemplary team player even on the bench.
The mood in Austria’s industry continued to accelerate its downward trend compared to the eurozone in August.
The Purchasing Manager Index (PMI) was at a 37-month low with 46.7 points.
Europe-wide, however, Austria still has the third-best mood behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute said on Monday to its survey of 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the PMI of the euro zone increased by 1.1 to 45.1 points, but the index is still below the 50-counter mark for the 13th consecutive month, which indicates growth.
Only Ireland’s industry broke this threshold in August with 50.9 points.
The final light was the Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the mood barometer declined, but slower than in the previous months.
In Spain, the index reached its highest level since March, with 44.0 points.
"The slightly weakened descent could mean that the worst has survived," said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
However, the industry remains the number one growth brake in the third quarter.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: export orders in the eurozone fell as sharply as they have since November 2011.
The companies therefore cut jobs for the seventh consecutive month.
In China, too, industrial production declined more strongly in August than initially assumed.
The mood barometer dropped from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts initially expected 47.8 points.
The Purchasing Manager Index is based on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
Among other things, the developments in turnover, employment, storage and prices are recorded.
Tuchel's PSG team succeeds after victory in eighth league game
29 September 2018 at 19:45
Nice coach Thomas Tuchel is racing from victory to victory with Paris Saint-Germain in France's football championship.
At the OGC Nice, the defender won the title thanks to two goals from superstar Neymar with 3:0 (1:0) and was thus also successful in the eighth league game.
Last year, Olympique Lyon had made such a good start to the season in France 82 years ago.
Brazilian Neymar put PSG in the lead after 22 minutes and made the final score in the replay.
In the meantime, Christopher Nkunku (46th) was responsible for the 2-0.
With this, Paris also succeeded in the general rehearsal for the groundbreaking second Champions League group game against Red Star Belgrade on Wednesday.
To kick off the championship, Tuchel's team had to face their only defeat this season at Liverpool 2:3 so far.
