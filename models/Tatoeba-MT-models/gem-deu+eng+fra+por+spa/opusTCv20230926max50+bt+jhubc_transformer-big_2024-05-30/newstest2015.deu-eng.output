Plans for stronger nuclear cooperation are at the top of the agenda.
India is also hoping for a Defence Cooperation Treaty between the two nations.
Karratha Police Arrested 20-Year-Old After Fast Motorcycle Hunt
A motorcycle was seized after the driver drove it at 125 km/h in a 70 km/h zone and through bushland to escape the police in Bilbara.
Traffic police in Karratha tried to stop a blue motorcycle this morning after watching it leave a gas station on Bathdate Road at 125 km/h.
Police reported that the driver then ignored the stop signals and continued on Burgess Road before heading off to the bushland, where officials lost sight of it.
The motorcycle as well as a person who corresponded to the driver's description were later seen at a house on Walcott Way in Bulgarra.
Karratha police accuse a 20-year-old man of disregarding a stop signal as well as reckless driving.
He is scheduled to appear before the local court in Karratha on September 23.
The motorcycle was secured and confiscated for three months.
George Webster charged with hotel rape in Naim and Pitlochry
A man is on trial for raping women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was indicted at a hearing by the Glasgow Supreme Court.
He is accused of raping a woman at Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire, on June 7, 2013.
The indictment is that Webster attacked her while she was "unconscious, asleep, and unable to signal consent."
Webster is also accused of raping a second woman at the Golf View Hotel in Naim, Scotland, on 4 May 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the date for November 17 at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
Return to the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have introduced a bill to establish the organization of trade unions as a civil right.
"Just as unions die, so do middle-class jobs," said Ellison, a Minnesota Democrat and deputy chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.
Therefore, I am proud to present the Employee Empowerment Act together with the civil rights icon John Lewis.
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal opportunities for discrimination on the basis of the organisation of trade unions as for other forms of discrimination – and thus stops anti-union forces.
Complementing the National Labour Law Act to create an opportunity for discriminated workers to organize a trade union representation to sue for justice in a civil court - and to obtain damages or penalties - is a sensible and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis, and the other sponsors are proposing for their bill is to link back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks trade unions have faced in recent years—in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other states across the country—Americans have once encouraged countries around the world to recognize, expand, and uphold labor rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans still remember when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right of association in one breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to pass a constitution to ensure that the militarized autocracy of Hedki Tojos was replaced by democracy.
Fully aware that the workers and their unions took a role in creating a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly acknowledged that "the rights of the workers to unification and joint negotiation and action are guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that Adolf Hitler's fascism would be replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing the fact that the workers would have to organize themselves and raise their voices in the new nation, the Germans inserted a clause that stated explicitly: "The right to form associations to secure and improve the working and economic conditions is guaranteed to every individual and every profession or trade.
Agreements that restrict or aim to restrict this right are null and void; measures aimed at it are unlawful.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt presided over the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as adopted by the United Nations as a worldwide agreement in 1948, Roosevelt and the other authors added a guarantee that “everyone has the right to form or join unions to protect their interests.”
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights.
When this country advised other countries on how to shape civil and democratic societies, Americans declared that the right to form a trade union – and that this union would then be allowed to participate in collective bargaining as an equal partner with companies and government agencies – must be protected.
In fact, after these rights have been under attack in America, it is very wise to re-evaluate the American ideal, according to which the working people must have the right to unite and make themselves heard in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the workers’ movement did not limit the strength of the nation, but increased it.
By raising the standard of living of millions of people, work has miraculously created a market for industry and raised the entire nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack work forget these simple truths, but history preserves them.
History remembers, and so should we.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of employee representations - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that have made America great in the past and fulfilled the promise of democracy.
Judge suspends law that could force all abortion clinics in Louisiana to close
A U.S. federal judge on Sunday provisionally stopped implementing a law in Louisiana that lawyers say would have led to the closure of all five abortion clinics in the state.
This measure, brought to law by Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana, in June and scheduled to enter into force on September 1, would force doctors performing abortions to acquire a patient admission right at a hospital within a 30-mile radius of their practice.
However, the judge’s decision means that doctors may continue to legally perform abortions for the time being while they are applying for such a right.
"The plaintiffs can continue to work in accordance with the law as they strive to obtain these rights," Federal Judge John deGravelles wrote in his ruling.
Within a month, a hearing is scheduled for the judge to bring about a more permanent decision for the law.
Abortion advocates welcomed the decision, the latest in a series of judgments against similar measures, saying that doctors would gain more time to gain hospital admission rights.
"Today's decision means that women in Louisiana are avoiding a devious law that wants to take away their health and rights," said Nancy Northup, president and chairman of the Center for Reproductive Rights, who had sued on behalf of three of the state's five clinics to stop the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the judgment also extended to the doctors from the two clinics, who had not joined the lawsuit and also applied for admission rights.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have enacted similar laws, with courts recently declaring such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
Key areas of a Texas law that would have forced most of the clinics remaining in the state to close were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Advocates for abortion and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists, as well as the American Medical Association, agree that admission rights require unnecessary restrictions from doctors.
Opponents of abortion disagree that the measures serve to protect women’s health, although some also welcomed the effects of closing clinics.
Only a doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has patient identification rights, the Center for Reproduction Rights said.
If all other doctors in the state were forced to stop performing abortions, this doctor would no longer perform the operation for fear of its safety, the group said.
In their argument against the verdict, Louisiana state officials said they would not punish doctors for conducting abortions while their applications for patient ID rights were still pending.
Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatments lead to higher death rates from ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have posted a video homage to her mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
For women in rural areas of Australia, there is a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than for women in cities.
Researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1,100 Australian women who were diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005, and found that only 25 percent were still alive five years after the diagnosis.
Research lead Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
SMALL STUDY: New drugs could slow lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers examined the medical care of women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that a woman’s age at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, pre-existing conditions, as well as social and economic status also influenced the chances of survival.
For older women and those whose cancer was already more advanced at the time of diagnosis, the survival rate was lowest.
For those living in rural and remote areas of the state, the mortality risk during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
Although the study did not investigate why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suspects a late diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centers as possible factors for this.
"This disease is best treated by gynecological oncologists, and these are mostly found in larger cities," she said.
Despite improving telemedicine services to counter distances, she proposed as a possible remedy a strengthening of the service of influencing doctors to give specialists the opportunity to care for women closer to their place of residence, as well as treatment programs for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said the study, regardless of geographical status, revealed a poor long-term survival rate in women with ovarian cancer, underlining the need for better treatment and prevention strategies.
The study, funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer, is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a 33-year-old mother from the Gold Coast, learned that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centers regret declining homeowner numbers
The decline, along with an increased drop in the number of homeowners under the age of 35, could lead to garden centers losing tens of thousands of pounds a year if today’s young consumers reach the “nuclear age group for garden products,” according to a study by the HTA, according to the Financial Times.
The report states that tenants spend an average of 55 percent of the amount that people with a home spend on their garden.
The increase in people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popular process of asphalting front gardens for parking purposes, and the declining garden size are other factors that threaten the industry, in which an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>5 billion is put on sale annually.
In the Greater London area, where the share of homeowners has fallen from 61 to 43 percent over a six-year period, the lowest spending on garden products per household is reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that living for rent or small gardens does not mean that people cannot pull plants.
Guy Barter, chief garden consultant for the RHS, said, “Container gardeners are very popular with tenants, for example, because they can take their plants with them during a move.”
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the “golden age” of garden retail due to rising homeowner numbers and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-90s.
He also predicted an improved market situation for this year due to the better weather after unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement in Pakistan, led by opposition politician Imran Khan and cleric Tahirul Qadri, continues.
In the capital, Islamabad, about 1,000 protesters stormed the state television channel PTV.
Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said soldiers could have pushed the protesters out of PTV buildings again.
The station suspended its operation for about 40 minutes, but is now broadcasting again.
At the same time, some 3,000 protesters attempted to reach the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
About a kilometre away, they delivered themselves with sticks and stones equipped clashes with security forces.
The police used tear gas.
The protesters demanded Sharif’s resignation, but he refused.
The country's army, meanwhile, urges a political solution to the conflict, "without wasting time and without applying force."
After a meeting at the headquarters on Sunday evening, the military said: "The army remains committed to its role of ensuring the security of the state."
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has already put up more frequently.
Opposition politician Imran Khan accuses Prime Minister Sharif of cheating in last May’s parliamentary elections.
The protests escalated on the weekend after Khan and Qadri called on their supporters to advance to Sharif’s residence.
Three people were killed.
Turkey appoints U.S. diplomat for spying report
The Turkish Foreign Ministry has commissioned the country’s oldest U.S. diplomats for information on a report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said the U.S. embassy executive and Turkish officials had discussed the report on Monday.
German magazine Der Spiegel and online magazine The Intercept reported that former US National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden’s reports show that Turkey was a major area of activity for US and British intelligence.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the importance of the report, saying that all major countries were spying on each other.
An earlier report, which also targeted Germany’s most important intelligence agency Ankara, caused much more angry reactions by the Turkish government.
Warning strike: Locomotive drivers threatened with consequences for commuters
The nationwide warning strike of the locomotive drivers on Monday evening could also affect passenger traffic in NRW.
The interruption announced between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. affects all transport companies nationwide, including long-distance, regional and S-Bahn transport,
The main direction of the warning strike is freight traffic.

Sven Schmitten, District Chairman of the German Locomotive Leadership (GDL), said in Düsseldorf.
We are expecting significant failures.
There are no regional priorities.
The main thrust of the warning strike is freight traffic.
Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced that it would do everything possible to keep the impact as low as possible.
However, the GDL did not say where it was going to strike, so it was difficult to predict the consequences in concrete terms.
Police chief of Magaluf accused of corruption
Prosecutors on Friday presented evidence of blackmail by police officers and employees of the city of Calvià to the public prosecutor’s office of Mallorca.
The chief of Calvià police on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested after allegations of corruption by businessmen and bar owners in the infamous binge drinking hotspot Magaluf.
Chief Commissioner José Antonio Navarro was arrested after corruption charges against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of Magaluf's bars and nightclubs are located.
According to the online daily Mallorca Diario, the prosecutors presented evidence of blackmail by police officers and employees of the city of Calvià to the Office of the Prosecutor for Anti-Corruption in Mallorca on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with the corruption allegations and are being interrogated by a judge together with Navarro.
The national Spanish daily ABC reported that the angry nightclub owners testified that the nepotism of the authorities had a serious impact on their business.
"It's no longer about making money, it's about survival," one of the businessmen told the court.
Leave our livelihoods out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer due to a viral YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British tourist performing felatio on 24 men during a drunken tour.
The island authorities have since tried to stop the illicit behavior of alcoholic holidaymakers in Magaluf by minimizing the number of participants in the infamous alcohol-soaked pub tours.
The Playhouse Club, where the fellatio incident took place, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and the pub tour organizer Carnage faced a joint penalty of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, which is especially popular with young British holidaymakers, is also known for a number of accidents under the influence of alcohol, including the trend of "balconing", where people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony to the hotel pool.
The first spring day with wet and stormy weather conditions interferes with flights from Adelaide Airport
The Spring has given South Australia a winter surprise, with heavy showers and strong winds interfering with flights from Adelaide Airport.
In the evening until 9 p.m., another 5mm of rain fell on the city, after 6.6mm, which had already fallen on the night of Sunday.
The final rainfall was the result of a series of short, stormy showers, including a casting that started just before 8 p.m. and provided nearly 4mm of rainfall in about 10 minutes.
After winter provided an early dose of spring last week, temperatures in the city fell back to a peak of just 15.8°C on Monday.
The harsh weather conditions probably led to the late landing of a Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane should have landed shortly after 7:30 p.m., but was hit by a sheer wind — a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance — and had to restart.
Wind gusts at that time reached about 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport.
The flight data showed that the aircraft had to take off even on a second landing approach and finally set off at about 20:40.
The flight delay subsequently led to the delay of some other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
Adelaide has a high temperature of 16°C on Tuesday, with possible showers.
Matthies says: It's high time to network
Given the galloping technical progress that threatens to turn our comfortable home into high-tech control panels, our columnist Bernd Matthies is comforted with a very familiar electronic accessory.
As I'm writing this, I'm looking at the spiral cable that connects the listener to the phone, and I'm thinking, "Boah, how retro is that?"
But there is a thought behind it: if the cable were not, all listeners would fly around the house in no time, and that would be even more retro.
In any case, it applies to the ekeltronic (ekeltronic?
No, typo: electronic) sector the rule that the world novelty of today is the electric waste of tomorrow, bought - outdated.
And for example, if you still have a tube TV in the living room today, you simply say that you reject television in principle.
Why these considerations?
Because the pressing of the Ifa at the radio tower this week reminds us again of our absolute incompetence in electronics matters.
The layman, who once mastered the washing machine and CD players blindly, today does not even understand the purpose of the devices, which are spread out in front of him with incomprehensibly vain expert talk: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" promises us.
Yeah, are you okay?
What should you talk about with people who seem to be voluntarily spreading such quark?
Basically, for about 20 years, it has been mainly about the fact that we should like to network our house.
So that the yogurt itself reorders, so that the fire detector tells us on holiday in the Maldives that it is burning in the study room.
And wouldn't it be wonderful if we left the air conditioning from the office on our soon arrival ...?
Yes, this requires air conditioning.
But a dream is sure to come true soon: we raise our wristwatch, you say loudly "suck!" - and at home the vacuum robot starts.
I'm crazy.
Everything turns out to be nothing less than a revolution: "The boundaries between white and brown goods blur," swirls an industry expert, you can connect the washing machine to a headphone, the steam cooker sends the weather report and the data glasses show how long the pizza in the oven still needs, but it does not help, because we are stuck in traffic jams.
We also know from daily practice: If a new-fashioned device is really needed urgently, the battery is guaranteed to be empty.
Another reason is that the spiral cable on the phone will survive the next radio shows.
Israeli children return to their schools after war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from the areas near the Gaza Strip returned to schools on Monday after spending the summer in air shelters, while rocket and mortar fire fired on their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, and the schools in Gaza remained closed while the area was being deterred from fighting.
The start of school brought a sense of joy and expectation to the rocket-shooting communities in southern Israel, but the signs of the fighting are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, employees of the "Pashosh" kindergarten, which was hit by a rocket, removed shells from the walls and sliding walls before the students arrived.
"We're a little scared, but we're excited," said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibbutz Saad and English teacher there.
Many children from our area urgently need to return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said it felt “a bit weird” to suddenly go back to school.
"These were difficult times, and we didn't leave the house at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Until a ceasefire interrupted the war last week, thousands of residents of border communities like Saad stayed in their homes or left their homes to move to safer areas further away from Gaza and escape rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a community near the Gaza border where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar shell, are still hesitant to return.
The Ministry of Education said about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Her children were temporarily placed in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attended a school in Sderot, a Gaza border city heavily marked by Palestinian bombardment.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said "we will make sure that you acquire knowledge and provide you with security."
Israel and Hamas agreed on a permanent ceasefire on Tuesday.
The ceasefire brought an immediate end to the fighting, but major issues remain unresolved, such as Hamas’ call for the lifting of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of Gaza’s air and sea ports.
Israel calls for the disarmament of Hamas and the surrender of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin in Egypt this month.
During the war, more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, three-quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children, according to estimates by Palestinians and the UN.
Israel denies this information and estimates that at least half of the dead are fighters, but did not provide any concrete evidence for this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortar grenades during the fighting on Israeli cities, most in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in the Gaza area and about 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools that were converted into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in shelters and the fighting continues, the education authorities postponed the start of the school year last week.
"I hope the school will soon be reopened so that we can continue to learn, just like the children in the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza City.
Election in Saxony: CDU Vice Strobl calls into question NPD ban proceedings
In view of the loss of votes of the NPD in Saxony, CDU federal vice-president Thomas Strobl has ruled for an end to the ongoing NPD ban proceedings before the Federal Constitutional Court.
Berlin - According to CDU federal vice-president Thomas Strobl, the ongoing ban proceedings against the NPD before the Federal Constitutional Court should come to an end.
"The NPD is performing worse than last time," said Strobl, who is also CDU head of state in Baden-Württemberg, the "Leipziger Volkszeitung".
This is a pleasing development in the right direction and one that makes me more likely to conclude that the NPD is being fought politically and not before the Constitutional Court.
The NPD had narrowly failed at the five-percent hurdle in the vote on Sunday.
A first attempt to ban the far-right party had failed in 2003, because the constitutional protection at the time also had informants at the head of the NPD.
In December 2013, after a long preparation, the Federal Council submitted a new application in Karlsruhe.
The Federal Government and the Bundestag did not join.
Harburg: Tents for new refugees
Refugees are now being accommodated in tents in New Zealand.
The central first reception for refugees in Harburg is bursting from all seams.
Now the interior authority has three tents of the Red Cross set up next to it.
The district politicians were only briefly informed shortly before - they are not very enthusiastic.
"These Hauruck actions continue to stir up citizens' reservations and do not give district politicians the opportunity to participate constructively in the humane accommodation of refugees," says Britta Herrmann, Group Leader of the Greens in the Harburg District Assembly.
Their party demands that the Harburg district administration provide unused houses for accommodation at present.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
The reasons for the overcrowding in the initial reception are the rush of help seekers - and the fact that the authorities cannot provide enough places in follow-up facilities.
Many refugees therefore stay longer than the regular three months.
House prices have experienced the strongest winter increase in seven years, shows a widely observed index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for homes in the Australian capital rose by 1.1 percent in August, according to RP data from Monday.
As a result of this increase, the overall increase in June, July and August is 4.2 percent, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 percent, more than twice as high as the increase in the 12 months to August 2013, but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country.
RP Data’s research director, Tim Lawless, said Sydney and Melbourne are driving a two-way market.
The figures from RP Data show that home prices in Sydney rose by 16.1 percent last year, compared to 11.7 percent in Melbourne.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose by an average of five and six percent.
At the other end of the scale is Canberra, which has been hit hard by cuts in government spending and where prices rose by only 1.4 percent over the year.
Mr. Lawless went on to say that with the beginning of spring, there would now be an increase in the properties for sale that would undergo the market "a real test" for the next few months.
“If you look at the consistently high rate of auction prices, a generally fast selling rate, and the consistently low interest rate environment, it’s likely that home prices will rise even further over the next three months,” he said.
In a statement to the Neue Presse, he contradicts the statements of Managing Director Peer Medau and attests to this, posing "as a general".
This is not the style of the university, the report says.
The Medau family had already been informed orally about the university's intentions in mid-June.
The statement that the plans were not announced until July is definitely wrong," said Pötzl.
At the same time, he points out that the plans are not "predeterminations or even decisions", but there are "preferences".
The expansion of the narrow road up to the castle, which is necessary for the access, is also less dramatic than the Medau feared.
There was and is not a nine-metre-wide road.
The current level is 5.50 meters, which is one meter wider than before," explains Pötzl.
The argument of the Medau operators that their free and school-owned parking spaces will then only be used by students of the university in the future, Pötzl does not want to apply.
There is no parking at all, because as with other public parking lots, this can now be solved intelligently.
Thinking of the residents
The Kinderkrippe Bergwichtel, which is located on the premises and whose front door would lead to the access to the parking deck, should "not be impaired," according to the president of the university.
Rather, he says, "it is not only about the nursery, but also about the local residents at the entrance to Friedrich-Streib-Straße and the 800 pupils of the neighbouring secondary school.
So it’s about much more than the particular interests of Mr. Medau,” says Pötzl.
Whether the criticism of the parents' advisory board of the nursery, with the expansion of the street would be justified one "of the few natural spots of Coburg" would be lost, "can be decided by the reader himself."
At the beginning of October, Pötzl will, together with the State Building Office Bamberg, inform the city councils about the structural development of the university by 2020 "and, in this context, address the importance of the new development".
Last week, Peer Medau informed the parents of the nursery about the university's plans.
Accordingly, the access to the new parking deck should not be via the campus and the Friedrich-Streib-Straße as before, but via the Medau Mountain.
This would mean that the narrow road would have to be expanded in two lanes over a distance of about one kilometre.
According to calculations of the Medaus, the traffic in the park of Hohenfels Castle would thus increase ten times.
About 2,000 vehicles per day.
The city has not yet commented on the project.
Glandorf resigns from national handball team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old from the Bundesliga SG Flensburg-Handewitt led mainly health problems for this decision.
The decision has not been easy for me, it has been ripening for several months.
It's time for me to listen to the signals of my body and end my career in the national team," the 2007 world champion said on his Facebook page.
He thus retires internationally with a record of 167 international games and 576 goals for Germany.
Because the throw-powerful rear-room player for the Champions League winner from Flensburg wants to go on goal hunting for a few more years, he is now no longer available to the new federal coach Dagur Sigurdsson.
With the Icelander, who announced his squad for the international games against Switzerland on Tuesday, Glandorf conducted a "long and good conversation.
His ideas and approaches have inspired me just as much as they will inspire my longtime players and my successors.
But for my club I would like to be available in the next few years, for this longer regeneration breaks are needed, which the current double load does not allow.
The left-handed man had even had to fear the end of his career in 2012 after a heel infection.
Due to Achilles tendon problems, he had been treated by team doctors of the German Handball Federation (DHB) with a cortisone syringe, which later triggered a strong inflammation.
An emergency operation and two more procedures followed.
Then Glandorf had announced a lawsuit against the team doctor, the dispute ended with a settlement.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team career go by no body without a trace.
I have some health construction sites that I can no longer ignore.
After the three infectious foot surgeries that took place at short intervals in 2012, I never really got my blood pressure under control.
There are a few other wear-related complaints.
Even at the beginning of the year, I noticed that although I can control my head, I can't fool my body," Glandorf told the magazine "Handball Time."
He would only be ready for a comeback in the event of an absolute emergency.
"When all the strings tear, I'm always ready to talk," the two-time family father told the magazine.
However, I can count the years in which I can still play handball on one hand.
I also have to say that after my long hospital stay in 2012, I have also become quite humble in terms of my health.
After my career, at least I want to be able to walk straight.
In addition to winning the 2007 World Cup and the 2014 Champions League, he also won the EHF Cup in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo).
In 2012, he also secured the European Cup winners with Flensburg.
German economy shrinks by 0.2 percent in spring
Crises around the world slowed the German economy in the second quarter.
Gross domestic product decreased by 0.2 percent from April to the end of June 2014 compared to the previous quarter.
This was announced by the Federal Statistical Office and confirmed preliminary calculations.
Consumption alone revived the economy in the spring, while investment declined.
Foreign trade also slowed down the economy.
Thanks to the strong year-on-year kick-off, the first half of 2013 saw a total GDP plus of 0.8 percent compared to the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and the destination of the "Münsterland-Mooiste", which on Sunday led for the first time through the Burgmannsstadt.
The town of Horstmar experienced an invasion of Dutch "fietsenfahrer" on Sunday.
The largest cycling association in the Netherlands, NTFU, organised the so-called "Münsterlande-Mooiste".
This is the largest bike tour across the Münsterland, the cyclist paradise near the Netherlands.
More than 1000 participants thanked Jos ter Huerne for organising this tour of the Münsterland.
Published in various specialist journals, this tour was offered to interested parties.
We came from Den Helder and drove overnight to take part in this tour.
We would also like to get to know the Münsterland in this way," the cyclists were delighted about the route through the districts of Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After registration in the association home of the Sagittarius Brotherhood Sta.
Katharina went on a small "ride of peace" through the city over the wall, where the start took place.
The route, which was indicated for three different categories, continued towards Herrenholz via Schöppinger Berg towards Coesfeld and via Havixbeck and Billerbeck back to Horstmar.
On routes of 95 kilometers with 1175 meters of altitude, 120 kilometers with 1475 meters of altitude and 145 kilometers with 1775 meters of altitude, the cyclists proved their good condition.
They were fed along the way in Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
Main organizer Jos ter Huerne and Mayor Deputy Heinz Lölfing were very pleased with the success of this cycling event.
We are satisfied and it was a nice experience for all involved.
The organization ran without problems and there were no negative incidents," Heinz Lölfing draws a positive conclusion of this event.
Unfortunately, there weren’t as many participants as the organizer had hoped, probably due to the bad weather forecasts and the morning rain.
"We'll see you again in 2015 with hopefully good weather on August 30 or during another weekend," the cyclists promised to come back to Münsterland and the organizers plan a new edition.
Konstantin Wecker's ruthlessly honest memoirs
It is actually more philosophical testimony than biography, which Konstantin Wecker, songwriter, pacifist, politsicher activist, ex-prisoner, has brought to paper in "Monk and Warrior" on 287 pages.
Not chronologically, but more thought fragments for thought fragments, the Munich-born on June 1, 1947 wrote down his memoirs, each chapter initiated by a matching lyrics.
And he is ruthlessly honest: from masturbation as a high school student to shoplifting and drug use, he does not omit any human weakness.
Also to show how he himself learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings.
Wide space also occupies abstract, but all the more important terms: love, soul, ego, being in the now, spirituality - all of which he tries to go to the bottom, in a very philosophical, but also very personal way.
And he also explains his pacifism, his social criticism, his political commitment - and also how he was shaped not only by music (the opera lover became a soul and rock musician), but also by his imprisonment.
The latter has also brought the living man Konstantin Wecker closer to the ascetic monk, who is created "by subtraction", as he says, "by omitting everything unnecessary".
But among all the high-spirited views, there are also short anecdotes about the earth: for example about brawls in a local frequented by GIs or a crazy car ride, in which he frontally targeted a tree.
He is also ruthlessly honest.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me in his arms.
Never said "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and their relationship was limited.
Henry rehearses for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and emerged from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He attended "many" therapies after his mother's death, and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
You never saw his face, only heard his voice: "Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move! Move! Move!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton – who were already grown up when I was a child – went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket stroke.
I never had such a conversation with him.
For much of my life he was this serious guy in the corner who read the newspaper.
Henry recently opened a foundry in Dudley, and although conditions are better than at his father's time, he gained an insight into what life might have been like for him.
It's a little lighter now, but they're dark, smoked, deep Stygian mazes with flames and smoke and a lot of soot.
My father used to just lay down in the tub and then you could hear him slowly starting to sing because he could wash the foundry off himself.
As I walked around there, I realized that he had been doing this for years to bring the food to the table, and my respect for him grew.
Nevertheless, Henry grew up as a child without the love testimonies of his parents.
My father never embraced me, he never said "I love you."
It wasn’t until my mother got bad at the end of her life that we started saying, “I love you, I love you, I love you.”
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love he had missed as a child.
Could you stop with the "I love you"?
Stop hugging me! Stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
with Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
It is still befriended by French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was a diabetic.
This contributed to her death.
So when I became very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, “You have to be radical.
So I pulled through this fitness thing and also had to do a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's exhausting.
Nobody likes to eat carrots.
Henry’s career change may be reflected in his elegant, short-cut beard.
Since he was praised by critics for his Othello, he has been taken from the theatre.
It was followed by The Comedy of Mistakes, and then Fences by August Wilson.
This is a different experience from the sitcoms and comedies that filled his busy working life.
He started at only 16 years old when he worked in a factory.
A DJ spotted him on stage imitating people and wrote to New Faces about him.
His television career began in the mid-seventies. "I was the only black imitator/comedian on television for quite a long time."
He learned in the profession.
Not only did I have to grow up in front of the public, but I also learned from 1975 to 1985 how to become an efficient joke-telling machine while I was a star through television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
Since his manager owned the stage right on the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which people "painted themselves black", Henry performed his comedy there for over five years.
My family was very uncomfortable.
I kind of wish it never happened, but I don’t regret it.
It was a strange, unpleasant position for me, but I worked on giant projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this “years of award-winning light pillar of British television” was also a “great parody of black people.”
By introducing characters that mocked and celebrated British black culture, Henry worked on an alternative comedy circle in the 1980s.
The first series of the Lenny Henry Show aired in 1984, and in the 1990s he was known as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.
Advertising, documentaries, TV series, and film roles shaped his next decade, but after his 2008 BBC series LennyHenry.tv, he thought, "What are you doing next, Len, because it all feels like you're just spending time or stepping a little on the spot."
Then came a documentary series for Radio 4 titled What's So Great About ...?
The first episode was about Shakespeare.
I was allergic to Shakespeare.
I had never really learned anything about him at school and thought he was mostly a middle-class domain, white in tights and a cabbage head in the front.
So I was terrified of it.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said, "You should try it.
Don't make it bad if you don't know what you're talking about.
Take a few of the words in your mouth, and then you will understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry performed 20 lines from Othello’s final speech for the documentary, and he was thrilled.
I felt like I could do that.
It was almost as if someone had finally put my head right.
“That’s what it’s about, it’s a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your text, research a bit.
The rehearsals were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to be expecting a car accident, and that just didn’t happen.
And soon he appeared in the comedy of errors.
Suddenly I was at the National Theatre and I could hardly believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There was a technical error and Henry instinctively felt he had to entertain the audience.
"A little voice told me, 'You have to bridge 10 minutes now while they repair the computer.'"
Instead, the stage manager announced that the performance would continue as soon as the problem was solved.
I walked off the stage and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
I'm not responsible for it.
I can leave it to someone else.
"You play in a play, so stay in your role."
Henry in Fences at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for Fences was challenging.
Panic is very good, which strengthens the tendons.
This too was well received, so it's like a big shield of the gods saying to me, "This is your destiny."
He says this, of course, with a thunderous voice.
So I'll stick with it.
I really love it.
I love being in a rehearsal room.
But Henry still has the head of a comedian – our conversation is full of humorous outbursts, while he imitates people over and over again.
I have decided not to make a stand-up comedy because I find that this kind of instant gratification of a room full of strangers is somehow dangerous.
If you are always looking for that, you are driving it against a wall.
I sometimes perform live at the Apollo if I want to, but overall it doesn’t give me as much as before.
I ask him if he will ever do a stand-up comedy tour again.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps shape a beginning, a middle part, and the end of a journey – I don’t think I’ll ever want to give it up again.
Is this his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like to be an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and that’s great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Houthi rebels block roads in Yemen’s capital
In the conflict between Shiite Houthi rebels and the Yemeni government, the Houthis have called for civil disobedience in the capital Sanaa.
Houthi supporters had occupied central streets in Sanaa on Monday, a spokesman for the Houthi party "Ansar Allah" said.
Access to Parliament has also been blocked.
Yemeni media reports a traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online edition of the newspaper "Yemen Post", Houthi leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi had called for the measures on Sunday evening.
According to the paper, Huthi threatened to escalate the conflict if his demands were not met.
The Shiite Houthis are fighting for greater independence from Sunni-ruled Yemen and are calling for the resignation of the government.
The Houthi people have been besieging the Yemeni capital for almost two weeks.
Around 30,000 rebels have set up protest camps on the main access roads of Sanaa.
There are bloody battles with the Yemeni army.
Kenya Registers Officials to Curb ‘Ghost Employees’
Kenya has begun to biometrically register all state officials to remove "ghost employees" from the government's payroll.
Employees who do not register in the next two weeks will no longer be paid, the government said in a statement.
The government suspects that thousands of people will still receive salaries even after they leave the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight public service corruption when he took office in 2013.
An audit at the beginning of this year found that at least $1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>700,000) per month was lost in payments for “spirit workers” and other abusive financial practices.
The government suspects that salaries will continue to be paid to accounts after a person dies or leaves public service, Wanyama Chebusiri reports for the BBC from the capital Nairobi.
All officials must now appear at identification centers in the next two weeks to ensure their data is recorded via biometric registrations, a government message was announced.
Anyone who would not do so without a credible apology would be removed from the payroll.
“Through this approach, it will significantly contribute to the rationalization of public service by determining the actual number of officials and also clearing the payroll at both levels of government – thus eliminating the ‘spirit workers’,” said Anne Waiguru, the cabinet secretary in the Ministry of Decentralization and Planning.
The scandal surrounding art consultant Helge Achenbach will be discussed in court for the first time on November 11.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of Aldi founder Theo Albrecht, claim 19.4 million euros in damages from Achenbach and two of his companies in insolvency proceedings in a civil case in the Düsseldorf district court.
This was announced by a court spokeswoman on Monday.
The application states that Achenbach cheated on the purchase of works of art and classic cars and that Berthold Albrecht charged purchase prices higher than actually paid.
As a result, the agreed commission would also be higher.
Achenbach bought valuables for Albrecht for 121 million euros.
Children need roots and wings
For 44 years he was in school service, 23 of them as headmaster.
From this time Manfred Richter knows many Petershausener and Kollbacher from their time as pupils.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always supported by his aspiration to see the human being in the student.
The snow cap is the most famous mountain in the Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif from his home.
Richter was born in 1930 in Trautenau/North Bohemia, now Trutnov.
At the age of 14, he became interested in the teaching profession after four years of high school.
A year later, the Sudeten Germans were expropriated.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave their home.
After a few months in a camp, it went to Bavaria in 1946 - in the freight wagon.
Judge went to the upper Franconian village of Senkendorf.
Teacher training took place in Bamberg.
To do this, Manfred Richter had to walk six times a week ten kilometers to the nearest train station, take the train to Bamberg, walk three kilometers across the whole city to school and back in the evening.
After two months, Manfred Richter got a place to sleep in a Red Cross home in Bamberg: together with up to 15 fellow students in a dorm room.
In 1951 he took the first and in 1954, after three years of teaching, the second state exam.
Since Oberfranken did not have a teaching position for him, he applied to Upper Bavaria and came to the school in Kollbach on 1 November 1954.
The "Miss Room" was his first "service apartment" in the schoolhouse.
In 1958, he moved into a three-room service apartment in the newly built teacher's house next to the school.
This house was bought by Manfred Richter in 1980, after the school in Kollbach had been dissolved in 1968.
Until then, there were three classes in Kollbach in the Petershausen-Kollbach School Association and five classes in Petershausen.
From the school year 1968/69 these were combined in Petershausen in today's Town Hall.
When the school association Indersdorf was founded, only the primary school remained in the village.
In order to avoid a reclassification in the now smaller school, the then Rector Georg Sigl moved to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
But Petershausen grew, and so the children and their teachers were able to acquire the present building from September 1982, which was extended in 1997 after Richter's retirement.
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor Ludwig Götz, who, at the expense of the municipality, had additionally built a workshop room and cellar rooms during the 1997 expansion, although this was not eligible for grants according to the guidelines for school buildings.
"Mayor Götz was very school-friendly," Richter recalled gratefully.
In his entire career, Manfred Richter never forgot the speech of a government official who had responded to a lecture at a school council on law and justice: "One must never forget love". Manfred Richter implemented what he had heard there as a young teacher.
"You have to give the children two things: roots and wings," says the 84-year-old today.
And he had to learn: "This does not always succeed." Whether he means only his students or just like his own six children, is not quite clear.
In any case, judges’ actions were sometimes unconventional.
When students were beaten, he did not give them any punitive work, nor were they called to sit back.
At the expense of the municipality, Richter had two pairs of boxing gloves and had the two opponents compete against each other, even if there was a violet.
For the good of the school, Judges as rector maintained a good relationship with the then mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
This moved the non-party judge after his retirement to run at least last on the CSU list for the municipal council in 1996.
However, Richter was selected in sixth place and joined the CSU.
180 kilometers in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 cyclists make stops in the spa park of Bad Salzhausen and Schotten
When cyclists take a break on their tour in Bad Salzhausen or Schotten, this is nothing special in itself.
On Friday, however, the number of resters alone made an impression: The 700 participants of the hr4 bike tour and their companions enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of Bad Salzhausen and later a party under the open sky in the Scottish Alteburgpark.
Under the motto "Raddle and celebrate on newly discovered paths between Nidda and Kinzig", the participants had met on Thursday in Bad Vilbel and witnessed a concert by Van Baker & Band.
On Friday it became serious: The cyclists took the first stage, the 60 kilometers across Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and on to Schotten.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes were welcomed by Mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who had started with the bicycle in Bad Vilbel, and the head of the own business Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-Döring.
To refresh body and mind all kinds of good things had been prepared: The rural women from Ranstadt and Nieder-Mockstadt had baked 85 sheets of apple, twitch, sprinkle and cheese cakes, which served the skilled cyclists wonderfully.
"Such cakes can only be baked by rural women," praised a participant from Aulendiebach, while ordering another piece.
At the drinks booth of the gymnastics club Geiß-Nidda cold refreshments could be obtained.
The "Duo Bravo" entertained the visitors with well-known melodies from operettas and musicals and reaped enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful ambience of the park seemed relaxing.
A gentleman also enjoyed a head massage from his partner: "He deserved it, after all, he has re-attached jumped off bike chains today".
Meanwhile, the mayor and the company manager still had to work: they were interviewed by reporter Rainer Janke at the fountain in front of the drinking spa and took the opportunity to promote Bad Salzhausen on the radio.
Even promotion manager Tobias Hagen, since the first hr4 bike tour in 2004, was only able to snuff out for a short time, after all, he had plenty to do with the technology on site.
His pickup truck, in which he communicated with his employees and the 15-member motorcycle squad of the Hesse police via three phones and a radio, wrote Facebook entries and made reports, also needed a check.
"The majority of the participants come from the Rhine-Main region," he said, "but cyclists have also come from Gießen or Fulda, from Lauterbach or the Taunus and even from numerous cities in Westphalia.
The number of participants depends a bit on the available overnight capacity.
In category I, the participants are accommodated in hotels, in category II in collective accommodations.
From the spa, the cyclists had a good impression when they left after an hour and a half: "Goodbye!"
"It was nice in Bad Salzhausen!" they waved to say goodbye.
After arriving in Scotland, the group was allowed to take a short break.
But in the evening the cyclists were challenged in the idyllic Alteburgpark.
Under the direction of the Scottish Society for Tourism and City Marketing (GTS), the park had received a beautiful festive ambience and of course they had prepared treats, such as flame cakes with well-cooled feather whitener.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS Managing Director Markus Hoßfeld and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs welcomed the visitors in his role as Board Member of the ADAC Hessen-Thüringen.
The three were visibly pleased about the "many operations in Scots".
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance stage.
The opportunity for swinging outdoors was eagerly taken advantage of despite the sporty activity on the bike.
Among the guests were increasingly mixed citizens, who were impressed by the good mood as well as the large crowd of cyclists.
On the second day, the stations Birstein, Wächtersbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the Trenkwalders - were on the program for the cyclists.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometers of cycling, the athletes arrived again in Bad Vilbel.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested for "conspiracy" against government
A total of 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey on suspicion of “conspiracy against the government,” local media agencies report.
The police did not make any immediate comments.
Among the arrested are 14 high-ranking police officers, reports Hürriyet Daily News.
Some of them were involved in corruption investigations against government officials, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly setting up an organized criminal association and tapping phone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (then Prime Minister) described her actions as part of the activities led by Islamist cleric Fethulla Güllen against him and other persons in power positions.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (1 September) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Yazenyuk brought his daughter to school.
There, he told waiting journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
The sky is not peaceful all over Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful heaven.
The whole of Ukraine, a giant common Ukrainian People’s Front, must fight for a peaceful heaven.
Aleksan Pastukhow, head of the school in Slavyansk, who visited Yazenyuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that there will finally be peace again and that the children will receive an education that will be useful to them in their future lives.
The first day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with the children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons in their hands and giving flowers to their teachers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director she needs.
It arrives with a proud tow of fame from the banking world, the media management and the inner circle of the Tory party.
She has her own front-end experience.
Her career began at the global management consulting firm Bain and Co., whereupon she moved to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
She was chairman of the Financial Times for seven years and resigned when the top position of Pearson’s parent company went to a younger male colleague.
Her resignation allegedly amounted to almost <0xC2><0xA3>1 million.
Their political ranking is also solid.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, the former chairman of BP, when he was looking for more private business knowledge in Whitehall: she became an advisor to the cabinet.
Her husband is a former Tory councillor.
Already in May I described the task of the chairman with a poisoned cup.
Not only does the BBC stand as a huge and complex entity at the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Trust works in two directions: inwardly on the first guard of the BBC’s own management hierarchy, but also outwardly as a voice of public concern and unrest when things go wrong.
This creates an almost unsustainable duopoly that demands a complete and comprehensive reform.
But what new president would risk taking on everything and breaking down an institution as complex as a Chinese dynasty while perhaps killing himself for his job?
It's a difficult task.
And as if that weren’t enough, many are still interested in seeing the BBC downsized – power, money and status outdated.
As competition approaches and new technologies threaten old, convenient security, the upcoming negotiation of royalties for the BBC poses particular risks.
For the modest sum of <0xC2><0xA3>145.50 a year, the British public buys into the world’s surely largest media company.
The BBC tells a good story: it says it reaches 96 percent of all households and costs each of them just 40 pence a day.
And apparently, the BBC is rising again on the popularity scale: 53 percent support it today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The viewing and usage habits for the BBC have changed: I get news headlines on my phone these days and see missed programs later on my iPlayer.
But it remains a very beloved and remarkable institution.
She needs a great chairman - I hope she found him.
Perry from Texas says derogatory tweet was not authorized
A tweet from the official user account of Texas Republican Governor Rick Perry on Sunday contained a derogatory remark about the Democratic District Attorney, which is at the center of a criminal charge against him for abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted and replaced by another of Perry’s accounts, which denies the previous one.
A tweet has just been sent from my account that was not authorized by me.
"I don't approve of the tweet and deleted it," the post said.
Perry employees did not respond promptly to requests for comments.
Although the tweets went out of Perry’s official user account, it was not clear who actually operated the feed.
The previous tweet drew an unfavourable picture of Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
Perry vetoed her office’s financial support when she refused to resign, leading to a charge against Perry — who may be a 2016 presidential candidate — before a Grand Jury this month in Austin.
The tweet reads, "I don't always drive drunk with three times the permissible alcohol level ... but if I do, I'll accuse Governor Perry if he talks it out."
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not in charge of the Grand Jury's investigation against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio who was selected by a Republican judge.
Perry pleaded not guilty and called the indictment a political trick.
His high-class team of lawyers asked the judge in charge of the case to dismiss the indictment, arguing that the law against the oldest serving governor in the state of Texas is unconstitutionally diffuse.
Perry halted $7.5 million of state funds to the state’s Public Integrity Unit — which is based in Travis County and is investigating state corruption cases in Texas — when Lehmberg refused to resign.
This veto caused a public complaint by a left-wing watchdog group.
Perry’s official user account is frequently updated – and sometimes famous.
After finishing fifth at the Iowa elections during his 2012 presidential candidacy, Perry responded to speculation that he would stop by posting a tweet of a photo of himself jogging near a lake, saying, "South Carolina, we're coming!"
Berkeley declares housing market 'normal' again
One of London’s most prominent contractors pointed out that the housing market in south-east England had “returned” to normal levels.
Homes in the capital were highly coveted and subject to huge price increases, prompting the Bank of England to set mortgage ceilings in June due to widespread fear of a credit bubble.
Tony Pidgley, founder and CEO of the high-class construction company Berkeley, said on Monday, “Since the start of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since its peak in 2013, adding that this provides a “stable operating environment.”
The real estate market in London was well positioned during the downturn as foreign buyers pressed into the capital.
According to the Cadastre Office, prices in the city area jumped by 18.5 percent last year alone, far more than the average increase in England and Wales as a whole.
The average selling prices at Berkeley’s private, inexpensive, and student offerings rose by about a fifth last year, reaching <0xC2><0xA3>423,000 at the end of April.
However, a stronger pound has made property ownership in London less attractive to foreign buyers in recent months – some of them have also been discouraged by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric about a possible “villa tax” ahead of the May general elections.
London real estate agent Foxtons warned last week that the April mortgage market report, which introduced tighter lending regulations, would also lead to lower market growth in both real estate sales and prices in the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England on Monday shows a decline in mortgage grants in July, which also suggests that the real estate market is cooling down.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, revised its forecast for the rise in real estate prices in London for 2015 down to 3 percent, based on an already weakening house price awareness.
Transaction volumes in London’s most expensive areas such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington have declined by a quarter year on year, according to realtor WA Ellis.
Still, the desire for a home in the capital is a blessing for Berkeley, as the amounts due for futures sales amount to more than <0xC2><0xA3>2.2 billion.
Mr. Pidgley added: “Demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations has remained stable and as a result, deadline sales have also remained stable.”
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year by the end of April - almost a third more than its 2007 pre-crisis peak.
Annual pre-tax earnings rose by 40 percent to <0xC2><0xA3>280 million annually, and sales by 18 percent to <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion.
In a statement Monday prior to the company’s annual meeting, Mr. Pidgley said that Berkeley’s revenues for the current year are expected to meet current market expectations.
Analysts consistently estimate the annual pre-tax result at <0xC2><0xA3>450 million.
Berkeley stocks stood firm at <0xC2><0xA3>23.96 in London trade in the afternoon.
Naked photos of Jennifer Lawrence posted by hackers on the internet
Jennifer Lawrence at the 85th Academy Awards.
Nude photos of Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence were posted online by a hacker who claimed to have a "master list" of images of another 100 starlets.
A representative of the star from "The Tribute of Panem" confirmed that Lawrence's photos were genuine and accused the hacker of "blatant violation of privacy".
Authorities have been notified and will be pursuing all those who post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos originally posted on the photo-sharing page 4chan were allegedly obtained through a gap in Apple’s iCloud online storage system. The alleged “master list” of hacking victims includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFed reported.
It is not certain how many of the images are genuine, although Winstead, star of "Scott Pilgrim Against the Rest of the World" on Twitter also condemned the hack.
"To those of you who are looking at photos taken by my husband and I in our private home years ago, I hope you're really happy with yourselves," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice from the Nickolodeon series "iCarly" and "Victorious", however, denied that the photos were pictures of her and tweeted "These so-called nude pictures of me are FEELED, people.
Let's start with the beginnings. *Wortspiel intends*.
Buzzfeed reported late Sunday that a spokesperson for pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the alleged photos of her.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson's highly acclaimed new novel about love and the letter "J".
They disintegrated, so you could best describe it, they slowly dissolved like a cardboard box that you left in the rain.
Occasionally, a woman told him he was too serious, strenuous, intense, distant, and maybe a bit scratchy.
Then he shook his hand.
He knew scratching.
He was prickly, like a hedgehog, yes.
The last victim of this pricklyness was a just beginning affair, which had been more promising than usual for relieving the lonely boredom of his life, and perhaps even brought him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a tremblingly delicate beauty with untamed hair and a fluttering heart from a village on the North Island that was even more remote and rougher than Port Reuben.
She had come to the south with an older companion who Kevern thought was her aunt, and who had inherited a property in a wet but paradise valley with the proper name of Paradise Valley.
For several years, no one lived in the house.
The pipes were leaky, in the bathrooms there were still spiders, slugs had left their marks on all the windows and thought they belonged to them, and the garden was overgrown with weeds that looked like huge cabbage heads.
It was like the house of a children’s fairy tale, both threatening and tempting, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the longlist for the 2014 Man Booker Prize.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern had sat with Ailinn hand-holding on the broken deck chairs in the high grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon. Both had clutched into the service console, which provided the country with soothing music and soothing messages.
Your feet are too big.
Due to their very own aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Not forbidden - Nothing was really forbidden - just not played.
It has been successfully obsolete, just as the word obsolete.
The general taste created what decrees and regulations had never made, and just as people choose books from plate-washer to millionaire memoirs, cookbooks and romance novels, so they chose the ballads in music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern began playing an imaginary piano and singing Ailinn’s big feet in a roughly comic serenade.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"This was a well-known song by a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he told her, automatically putting two fingers on his lips.
His father had always done this to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It had started as a game between him and his father when he was little.
His father had played it with his own father, he said.
If you start a word with a J without putting two fingers over your lips, it will cost you a penny.
It hadn’t been a very funny game at the time, and it wasn’t very funny now either.
He knew this was expected of him, that was all.
It had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard of any.
Jazz was not played, even if it was not directly banned.
Improvisation was no longer modern.
There was only room for a single “if” in life.
At the beginning of a tune, people wanted to be sure where it would end.
Likewise the mind.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was musically expressed.
Although he had turned 10 years old without hearing from Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about jazz from his father's semi-secret collection of old CDs.
But at least he didn't have to explain to Ailinn that Fat's Waller was black.
At her age, she probably couldn’t remember a time when pop singers weren’t black.
Again, no laws or constraints.
A compliant society meant that every element of this society gratefully agreed to the principle of group gifts - gratefully as those spared by fate.
People of Afro-Caribbean origin were suitable for entertainment and sports by temperament and physique, so they sang and ran.
People who originally came from the Indian subcontinent were, like nature, blessed with electronic talent and were cared for with the task of ensuring that no family remained without a working service phone.
What was left of the Polish community took care of the sewerage; what was left of the Greeks smashed plates.
Those from the Gulf States and the Levant whose grandparents had not left the country as soon as what had happened, if it had happened – for fear of being charged with fire rage, even for fear that the flames would consume them next – had been opened with depressive and shisha whistling activity.
Everyone according to their abilities.
Since she had only heard ballads, Ailinn found it difficult to understand how the insulting words Kevern had just sung to her could ever be played.
Music was an expression of love.
"They're not really offensive," Kevern said.
Except maybe for people whose feet are too big.
My father never offended anyone, but he loved that song.
He spoke too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceptive sense of security.
Nothing could overcome the sound insulation of the giant char-like leaves.
Ailinn still did not understand.
Why would your father love something like that?
He wanted to say it was a cheat, but hesitated to put two fingers on his lips again in her presence.
She thought he was a little weird.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She shook her head in disbelief and blocked Kevern’s sight.
There was nothing to see around the world but her uncombed raven-black hair.
There was nothing else he would have wanted to see.
"If you say so," they mean without conviction.
But that doesn't explain why you're insinuating it to me.
She seemed honestly concerned.
Are my feet too big?
He looked again.
Your feet aren't that straight.
Maybe your ankles, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
That's just the stupid song.
He could have said "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"Your thick ankles are exactly the reason you like me," he tried instead.
I'm a bit perverse there.
That didn't sound right.
It should have been weird.
When he tried to be funny, he often got into trouble because, like his father, he did not have the soothing charm needed to tame the cruelty inherent in jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel too.
Maybe he wanted to be, Kevern.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomons turned red and got up from her deck chair, overturned the console and spilled the wine they had drunk.
Elderflower wine, so drunkenness was no excuse for him.
In her excitement, she seemed to tremble like a palm tree in the storm.
"And your fat head is exactly the reason why I feel pervertedly attracted to you," she said.
Except that I'm not.
She felt sorry for him, both for the unnecessary rudeness of his words and for the fear that appeared in her eyes when she rebelled against him.
Did she think he was going to beat her?
She had not told him about life in the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially the same as here.
The same huge and ice-cold ocean broke here as it broke there on the shore.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and more miserable after what had happened than their forefathers had been as smugglers and beach robbers, went from pub to pub, always ready to raise their hand against a woman who refused or laughed at them.
Dickhead?
They would have shown her a big fist if she didn't pay attention!
Knitting was the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, an antidote to the idle love ballads from the console - first knitting and then beating.
In Kevern's view, this was an unnecessary refinement, since knuckling itself was already an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign to walk through her body.
He stood up from the deck chair like an old man.
She also felt bleached, but the force of his grief surprised her.
That was not the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched him as he walked away—as her companion watched him from a room on the upper floor—a man lamented by something he himself had conjured up.
Adam left the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some had raised their hands against her.
A man turned away from her, bent his back, ashamed, defeated, without a fighting spirit—why was this a sight she seemed to know well when she could not remember a single time she had seen something like this before today?
When she was alone again, Ailinn Solomons looked at her feet.
Several years before the events just told, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative monitoring body for the public mood, worked on a short talk about the continued violence at low and medium levels in precisely the parts of the country in which its reduction, if not abolition, had been most likely to have been invested in.
"A lot has already been done, and a lot still needs to be done," she wrote, "to appease the innate aggression of a people who has waged a thousand wars and won most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country, where the sweet breath of human kindness has historically been felt despite the lofty church towers between the hedges.
But some characteristics turn out to be inextinguishable.
The higher the church tower, it seems, the less the passion it continues to awaken.
The population weeps when listening to sentimental ballads, is intoxicated with stories of overcoming difficulties and claims to believe firmly in the virtues of marriage and family life, yet not only does the former crudeness hold the rural communities as well as our urban structures firmly in the hands, but there is even evidence for the emergence of a new and backward game and the arguing at home, at work, on the streets.
"They have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate," her mentor said when he read the whole report.
I suggest you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.
I also have to ask: are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to say that," replied Esme Nussbaum.
Are you lesbian?
Once again, Esme invoked her right to privacy and denial of the statement.
Feminist?
Silence again.
"I don't ask that," said Luther Rabinowitz, "because I'm against atheism, lesbianism, or feminism.
This is a bias-free workplace.
We serve a bias-free society.
But certain types of hypersensitivity that are absolutely acceptable and commendable in themselves can occasionally distort results as you have imagined them.
They themselves obviously have prejudices against the Church, and these things, which they call “backward” and “raw,” could just as well be interpreted by others as an expression of a natural force and vitality.
If you continue to ride on what happened, if it happened, as if it had happened yesterday, it means taking away the country’s essential vitality.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz was speaking.
Behind his head, an LED lettering in Flamingorosa repeated the advice that Ofnow had given the country over the last quarter of a century or more.
Smile at your neighbor, appreciate your partner, listen to ballads, visit musicals, use your phone, speak, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, the sung word is better than the written, but nothing is better than love.
"I absolutely understand what you want to go on," replied Esme Nussbaum in a calm voice, as she was sure her superior had finished speaking, "and I say nothing but that we have not yet been cured as effectively as we imagine ourselves.
My concern is that without warning, we may find ourselves repeating the mistakes that led to what happened when it happened.
This time, however, it is not the others to whom we omit our anger and our distrust.
Luther Rabinowitz used his hands to form a pyramid.
To indicate an angel's patience.
"You're going too far," he said, "if you call acts "mistakes" that our grandparents may or may not have committed.
They also go too far when you talk about them omitting their “anger” and their “distrust” of “others.”
It shouldn’t actually be necessary to remind someone in your position that when we’re understanding the past as well as protecting the present, we’re not talking about “us” and “others.”
There was no “we” and there was no “other”.
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
"From which, if we are honest with ourselves," Esme dared to throw in, "no part of society can claim to have behaved well.
I'm not accusing anyone.
Whether it was bad or good, what happened has happened.
That was then.
There is no need to say anything about this - we agree on that.
And just as no guilt has to be attributed, no guilt has to be repaid if such repaid would be appropriate and if there was a way to repaid it.
But for what does the past serve if we do not learn from it -
The past serves to make us forget it.
If I may say anything about it --
Luther Rabinowitz collapsed his pyramid.
"I will consider her report," he said, dismissing her.
The next day, as she went to work as usual, she was run over by a motorcyclist who, as passers-by described, had driven into a kind of “brutal anger” on the footpath.
There are coincidences.
Lesotho military member says no coup is planned; prime minister remains in South Africa
Military officials in Lesotho denied having planned a coup to overthrow the government, saying they were proceeding against police officers accused of arming political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and announced that the country’s army had surrounded its official residence and occupied government buildings in the capital, Maseru.
The prime minister took his family to neighbouring South Africa after reporting of assassination threats.
Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said there was no de facto coup, but that the military was responding to the threat posed by “political fanatics” whose arming was imminent by the police.
"What happened this morning was that the staff of the defense forces of Lesotho acted after receiving several intelligence reports that some elements within the police were actually acting to arm some of the political, partisan young fanatics who were about to do devastating damage," he told Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military action had made the impression of a overthrow.
"Although no one has claimed to have seized the government by force, all reports agree that the activities of Lesotho's defense forces have so far shown signs of a coup d'état," he said.
Lesotho's military spokespersons said on Sunday that the soldiers were retreating to their barracks and the situation in the capital was calm.
In the meantime, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoya Metsing takes over the government during Thabane's absence.
Thabane said he believes he has become a target because of his attempt to fight corruption in the country.
In Lesotho, there have been major tensions since June after Thabane suspended parliamentary sessions due to the clashes in his united government.
He said his actions had not undermined the government, despite other accusations.
Production in the Eurozone at a 13-month low
The increase in production in the eurozone slowed down in August to its lowest point in the last 13 months, according to a closely monitored study.
The final Markit Purchasing Manager Index of the manufacturing industry (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, after a level of 51.8 in July.
A figure above 50 indicates an expansion.
New orders declined and factories experienced breakdowns at a time of increasing tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures arrive before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
Markets expect the bank to have a clear plan to deal with a hesitant Eurozone recovery and the threat of deflation at an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There is speculation that the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could provide further information over the course of this week as to whether he is considering a quantitative easing for the eurozone, in line with those undertaken by the UK and the US during the financial crisis.
“Although a small growth is better than no growth at all, the slowing effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties on manufacturers have become more apparent,” said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, Russia’s largest trading partner in the EU, fell to the lowest level in 11 months with 51.4.
In the meantime, the PMI fell to 46.9 in the second largest economic nation in the bloc, France.
France remains a child of concern, as is Italy’s decline from solid expansion to stagnation.
Evidence that growth incentives are no longer taking hold in the key industry mechanism in Germany, Spain and the Netherlands is also not reassuring," said Mr Dobson.
The decline in industry is likely to fuel the fire of analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal incentives.
A positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economics expert at IHS Global Insight, said: “The best thing to say about the August purchasing manager index of the eurozone manufacturing industry is that after that the sector continues to grow.”
"Producers in the eurozone are obviously finding life quite difficult at the moment, as the current increased geopolitical tensions - especially with regard to Russia and Ukraine - increase uncertainties in the still difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy – in particular, and consumer confidence – and are likely to cause some orders to be delayed or even cancelled, particularly large orders.
He said it would be "increasingly likely" that the ECB would eventually have to initiate some kind of QE, "although we suspect this will be limited."
The hell decade of the Beslan survivors: ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school, as the children trapped in it still suffer today.
Ten years ago, over 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militias in a school in Beslan, southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day martyrdom that shocked the world.
We have returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the atrocity in the classroom.
Exactly a decade after the horrific siege of the school of Beslan, which killed 334 people, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When fanatical Islamist terrorists captured and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, the beginning of a new school year, this seemed like the worst of evil.
The tragedy united West and East in disgust, and then surprisingly turned into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the atrocity in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, although the memory of this terrorist hell will haunt them forever.
Your greatest hope?
That the war that is now plaguing Ukraine - and in which children like them die - is now coming to an end.
The girl who was photographed trying to climb back into the shot-down school sports hall
She was photographed by the Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakov and famous when she was only trying to climb back into the smashed school sports hall in her underwear after a mine exploded.
Completely confused, Aida was looking for her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were considered dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me to run for my life, but I couldn't," Aida said at the time.
My legs were bloody.
I got up and climbed back in to look for my mother.
A soldier brought her to safety.
After a series of operations, she felt completely healed, but said yesterday: “Three months ago, the pain returned.
I'm afraid I'm going to have to have surgery again.
Some shells are still in my knee.
Her goal now is to become a dentist to help people as she has been helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it didn't break me," she says combatively.
“It happened to me, and that can’t be changed.
Once a year, I always go to the gym to remember those who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were little and dreamed of going to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish my studies and start my career.
I think of a family later.
She says that the siege will always remain a part of her, although the memory gets a little weaker every year.
I am glad that many people around the world still remember our horrors and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in the UK and everywhere.
When I see the photo of myself climbing back to school online, I think many people see it for the first time, understand our disaster and help prevent something like this from happening again.
The boy who fled through the bullet, thinking his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (Russians go to school at age 7) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother Tamara.
As a seven-year-old, he said, "Mom told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand."
After an explosion, he thought he was going to die.
She said to him, "Run."
Fearing that she might be dead, he fled and saw a crying toddler on the way, took it by the hand and fled through a bullet.
His father, Vladimir, who held his son in his arms outside, said: "Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In reality, Tamara had stumbled outside and suffered leg injuries in the hospital, assuming that her son had died.
After her reunion, she said, "I cried with joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later flown to London (by the now-disbanded News of the World) to receive the title of Barnardo's Children's Champion from then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say that it gets paler in my memory.
I remember throwing away all my toy guns right after.
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes and that’s no problem for me.
“I’m not afraid to go back to the gym, but I’m not thinking about myself.
I remember those kids with whom I played in the yard and who didn’t make it outside.
We never say they were killed or are dead.
We say they stayed in the sports hall.
I remember very well my trip to London, especially the toy store, where I could choose anything I wanted, and the ride in an open carriage at the top.
But now he is afraid of places like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of misfortune he and his friends suffered.
This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I am so sorry for all those who suffer from the atrocities," said Damir, who worked as a volunteer in a monastery last week.
I'm so eager to help.
I want to go to the police one day and hope they take me to the training academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said: "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were simply no children who could call and walk around, and that silence lasted for many months.
She vividly remembers her trip to London with Damir.
The people in London were crying when I told our story.
I understood then how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the prize and the opportunity to travel to London in autumn 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her that 10 years have passed, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London, and how that helped Damir and me.
I still remember how Damir liked to eat borscht and they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with waiters in a restaurant, Damir shot at them with his water gun, and they ran away and played with him.
And that was just a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said, “I always think this world hasn’t gotten any better in these 10 years.
In Ukraine, the war continues now, and every day people die, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed.
These are just the kind of kids like ours.
I think that for many, war is part of the news they hear when they are bored or busy with something else.
I just know what these people are feeling, the whole horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and that is so sad.
Damir grew up and is a very gentle and calm boy, he is not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he does not seek revenge, he is not overwhelmed by past atrocities.
I know he doesn’t like to remember it, but he has six close friends from the class and they occasionally go to the gym and light candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it—I remember how he sometimes lay on the sofa, his face turned away from us, for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember him throwing away all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is now 17, bigger than me, handsome, intelligent and healthy.
I can’t believe I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
As I recovered from the explosion and got on my feet, I looked around and saw hell around me, with parts of my body all around.
I was absolutely certain that my little boy could not have survived in this hell.
"I remember shouting to him, 'Damir, run, run away,' but I was also so sure he hadn't heard me.
But he heard it and he ran away.
And so life, unlike many others, continues for us.
Georgij Ilyin, 17 years old
The boy whose terrible image became the symbol of the abominations of Beslan after the siege
Consolation: Beslan survivor Georgy Lyin with his mother Fatima after the 2004 siege, on the right a picture of Georgy today
His blood-stained face was marked by fear as he ran for his life while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols of the barbarism of Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54, a doctor, had dropped him off for his first day of school before she rushed to take her older son Vladimir to university.
"I left the yard about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him, and so my little boy stayed there alone for three terrible days," she recalls.
Not quite alone, there was a whole family of relatives of ours, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgij managed to survive.
The closer that date gets, the harder it is to think about it and talk about it.
There is not a single day when we do not remember this tragedy.
We don’t think it’s been a long time, I mean it would have happened yesterday, some scenes from these days are always chasing me.
No one will ever forget that, I promise you.
Intense: The image of Georgy (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right).
I remember that Georgij was so eager to go to school that day, he said he wanted to embrace his teacher.
I only knew he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even this statue of weeping Georgij in San Marino.
Georgij does not like the picture, and it is hidden in our home in the bookshelf.
I understand that, but I also mean that people all over the world feel our pain thanks to this image.
Georgij says today: "It is important that such a thing can never happen again.
“I doubt we will ever know the truth.
People investigate such tragedies over and over again and never learn the truth.
And now they are investigating the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused him?
This world is becoming something terrible.
“I can’t understand how this is possible, because when you ask people, no one wants a war, so how does that happen?
Ten years is nothing like that.
It takes us dozens of years to forget a little.
It has attacked my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years I had a few nightmares because of the siege, but then it got better.
I went back to school in 2004 and was scared every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That’s why I always go to the sports hall when September 1st gets closer.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It’s hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to do it.
I don’t feel like a victim, this story is now part of my past.
I won't forget, but I'm not sorry.
My life goes on.
I finished school this year and attend a medical school in Vladikavkaz.
I'm gonna be a cardiac surgeon.
My first choice was training in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health did not allow it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that's not going to happen.
Georgy Faniyev, 20 years old
The boy who survived even though he was trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist
A miracle: Georgy Faniyev was trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist during the siege, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, he was trapped in the sports hall and sat next to the bomb attached to the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It's really a miracle that he wasn't killed.
"We feel like it was yesterday," says Georgij, who wanted to go to the FSB as a secret service officer, but was unable to do so because of his health damage due to the siege.
It’s still with me, it’s nothing I’ve left behind.
I’m older now and people are saying that kids can easily deal with bad experiences – I have to say that’s not true.
“In 2006, I worked with psychologists and actually felt a little better afterwards, but I can’t forget it.
And I'd like to forget.
2005 - the following year - was the first and only time I went back to the gym.
I lost consciousness.
I will never return there again and please do not ask me to show you where I sat in this famous picture.
Survivor: Georgy Faniyev today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is tremendous and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I don’t like to think or talk about it and they never asked me about school.
Physically, I'm fine.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can walk well now.
But because of my health, I couldn’t study at the FSB’s intelligence academy in Saint Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent in my documents, even the medical ones, and they replied that it was not possible.
My second passion was animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I've been there for two years.
He learns how to treat all animals "from cats to cows".
He said: “I knew I would never tell my children about my experiences.
Children should know nothing about it and of course they should not suffer it.
His mother, Marina, 42, said, “This pain never leaves me.
He's in my soul, worse as the anniversary approaches.
I will go to the celebrations to commemorate.
I know that Georgij will not go.
It has to be a lot harder for him because he was there and I wasn't.
I waited for him at home and couldn’t help.
I am so thankful to God that he has been given back to me. Here in Beslan, all of them are drawn.
It stays in us.
Georgij is now an adult, but that horror is still in him.
It's hard to accept that when something so unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't participate because of his knee.
He has been operated on several times, he can walk but not do any sport.
I would say that he has overcome the horror at 50%, but you can never completely overcome it and forget.
This terrible experience will always persecute us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed in the siege and that only intensifies my pain.
I lost a lot of people that I knew well and that were expensive to me.
My Son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could give me, but my heart cries for the dead.
I know of families where new children were born, but also of widows who never married again.
It’s hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don’t want to.
I will never forget how my heart sprang inside me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what's going on in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is very close to our country now and I can hardly believe it.
We used to be a friendly country, how can we fight now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure that many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many are still being killed.
If only we could grab all these rebels and throw them out - as far away as possible.
Aljona Tskayeva, 10
The baby that was so grippingly carried into safety by a Special Operations Command
Rescued: Alyona Tskayeva is taken to safety by a Russian Special Operations Command (left).
She is now ten (right) and does not remember the atrocities at all.
The world held its breath in 2004 when the baby Aljona was carried in the arms of a Russian police officer from the siege of Beslan.
The terrorists let her go, but in their cruelty held back her 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar in the school sports hall.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljona's mother and sister died in the murderous massacre.
Her father Ruslan has since remarried and has a little girl with his new wife Svetlana, which he named after his lost daughter Kristina.
Aljona, now ten years old, does not remember the siege and has grown into a smart and happy girl, say neighbors.
“They’re a big happy family now and Aljona and Makhar are both great kids,” says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to spare them all the memories that come up with the tenth anniversary.
You will understand why.
Man Accused of Overturning a Girl at Fife Pedestrian Crossing
A 78-year-old man stands on trial for overtaking a three-year-old girl on a pedestrian crossing in Fife.
Gordon Steward is accused of hitting a girl on the crossing in Pittenween, East Neuk.
The indictment states that Mr. Steward had controlled his Audi Q3 without the necessary care and attention and injured the girl.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, dismisses the accusation in front of the Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC set the trial for January.
4 Tips for Better Underwater Photos and Videos
If you would like to take photos or videos underwater, there is a choice of devices.
The cheapest option is a waterproof point-and-shoot like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action cam like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both available for around $300.
I took these photos at a family party with multiple cameras, all available for under $350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the battery compartment and other compartments are tightly closed.
Also, set your camera to the photos or videos you want to take.
Some cameras and camcorders have scene and recording modes that optimize exposure time for the dim underwater conditions.
And before you jump in, check to what depth your equipment is functional.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Search our shopping guide and reviews for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.
Take multiple shots - because many will not work.
Point-and-shoot cameras have an LCD that allows you to compose images, action cams usually don’t.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to watch this underwater, and the right image setting is a matter of luck.
So make a lot of recordings.
If your camera has a row mode that takes a series of shots with slightly changed exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light gets dramatically worse the further you move away from the surface.
So, if possible, stay close to the surface when shooting in a pool, lake or sea.
This also allows you to add more color to your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Go close to the objects.
This is also a good advice on land, but it is all the more important underwater because of the poor lighting conditions.
It’s especially important when you’re working with an action cam: these devices often have a fixed wide-angle lens, which means you’ll need to get closer to your objects if they’re going to fill the entire picture frame.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the sort whose character changes things, even in such a gigantic organization as the NHS.
As a consultant anesthesiologist, he devoted his career to the task of saving the sick from both the agony of the disease and the agony of treatment.
Among his patients, his wife recalls, was an MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that doctors’ diagnoses and diseases are important, while those treated are predominantly concerned with something completely different: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one who started his path of suffering.
"I didn't feel like it," he wrote in May of this year.
I had a hard time catching up.
As he struggled with the flu-like symptoms, he noticed that he was impatiently reproaching his wife, Juliet.
"I'd rather do it now than later," he noted.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt quite unusually disturbed and for no reason.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to do an X-ray of his chest.
Only two weeks ago he had been skiing in the French Alps.
The result of the X-ray examination was available.
He suffered from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that attacks the breast skin, which covers the lungs.
As with most cancers, the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokers develop lung cancer, not all lung cancer patients have been smokers in the past.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos exposure - contact with the fiber building material, which was once considered a "miracle material" but has now been detected as deadly.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a condition that can be easily ignored.
Asbestos is a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the UK since the 1960s, when the industry voluntarily committed to stop using it.
Even where it was still used, only people in certain industries worked directly with the fabric - plumbers, construction workers, carpenters and shipyard workers, for example.
As an industrial hazardous substance from another era, it seems to be hardly worrying today.
But this self-satisfaction is inappropriate.
Britain, it seems, is now experiencing the climax of a mesolthelioma epidemic.
There are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die from this disease as from road accidents.
Annual numbers of mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and expected future deaths in the UK
The reason we are experiencing the deadly effects now, although asbestos has been illegal for years (1999 all types of asbestos were banned), is that a mesothelioma develops only after decades.
And the scourge of mesothelioma is not limited to former workers in the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and is often still, present in the homes we live in, the offices we work in, the schools we study in, and the shops we shop in.
And therefore, mesothelioma knows no class barriers, financial boundaries, occupations or age.
The privileged bastions, from London’s elegant department stores to private schools, are no shelter.
Parliament buildings are asbestos contaminated.
Also in the hospitals, where we are supposed to be healed, have already been identified as the source of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He was also not a plumber.
In fact, it was difficult for him to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
"It looks like there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I completed my education for six years," he wrote.
Everyone - students, nurses, doctors and gatekeepers - use the tunnels.
One wonders how many of my peers will suffer from the same disease?
Unfortunately, he was able to at least partly answer this question.
"Of the four doctors who were trained at Guy's Hospital and who developed mesothelioma in the last five years," he wrote in a letter in 2010, "I am the last one alive."
How many of us are still going to get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma at the age of 48.
When he died on February 17, he was 55.
It was an unusually long survival time.
Fifty percent of all mesothelioma diseases die within 8 months of diagnosis.
The disease always ends fatally.
We can therefore only repeat Lawson’s question: “How many of us will still be ill?”
Britain’s leading expert on mesothelioma, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain is expected to end, a total of 90,000 will have fallen victim to the disease.
Most of them have no idea at the moment that they will die like that.

A brief look at the files of the courts, to which the victims often turn for claims for damages, shows how far the scourge of mesothelioma is already widespread.
For example, in June this year, Marks & Spencer admitted to negligently exposing Janice Allen to asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations—one of which was the flagship store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old when she started working at M&S.
Now she has two children in her twenties.
"Before this thing," she says, "I had never heard of mesothelioma, I didn't even really know anything about asbestos.
I never thought that would concern me.
Few people know much about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos refers not to a substance, but to a group of six minerals.
The name derives from the word "Asbestiform", a description of the fiber structure that makes the fabric resilient and flexible.
Three of the six were used in the construction industry.
Chrysotile, also known as white asbestos, is by far the most commonly found asbestos in buildings today.
It has been used for roof panels, floor panels, pipe insulation, boiler insulation, even for brake pads in cars.
It is less lethal than other forms of asbestos, but is still considered by the EU and the WHO to be a "great health risk" with possible fatalities.
However, the brown asbestos (Amosite) and the blue asbestos (Krokydolite) are more dangerous.
Britain was once the world’s largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suggest that “there is clear but indirect evidence that this was a major reason for the uniquely high mesothelioma rates.”

Janice Allen may not have seen herself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but the work of Julian Peto suggests that her story is by no means unusual.
He has presented a study of those affected, which shows that "a substantial proportion of mesothelioma without known exposure was caused by work or at home presumably by asbestos contact in the environment."
A lot of these contacts, he says, are due to the "normal use and aging" of our buildings.
It looks like no one can assume to be safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which examined the Westminster Palace, shows how people in the heart of the government may have been unknowingly exposed to the substance.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service shafts and pipelines behind Parliament’s committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be stirred up by something as harmless as “strong air movements.”
Members of Parliament are often accused of caring for their own interests, but here it seems the opposite is true.
While the Directorate of the Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the Westminster Palace had received a "clean health certificate", it is now undeniable that <0xC2><0xA3>1 billion of work has to be spent over several years to renovate the parliament, modernize the electrical installations and remove asbestos, and that after the general elections in 2015, the deputies will probably meet green in the Westminster Centre.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the presence of asbestos was not handled in accordance with the respective regulations."
No one can know if this mismanagement will cost lives.
All you can do now is wait.
One person who could never accurately determine contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, 50-year-old Abbott suspects that he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital where asbestos complaints were positively decided," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It’s so hard to remember all the places you’ve worked on and the data.
What he still remembers exactly is the day in early December 2009, when he got such a kind of fever.
He was 45 and had surgery late in the evening.
Suddenly I had frostbite.
It came all of a sudden.
I felt terrible.
I didn’t think I could make the trip home anymore.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain was from the thoracic skin around his lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma.
He didn’t go to work for a month.
Surprised doctors took X-rays of his chest and put on pleural catheter to extract fluid from the lungs and test in the lab.
However, his complaints remained undiagnosed.
His health slowly improved, and he returned to work.
However, from time to time the symptoms returned, often after exercise and vigorous breathing.
In 2011, a patient from Abbott came to his practice with similar symptoms and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even now, Abbott did not link this to his own case.
Finally, his patient was several decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in this case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition worsened again and his family doctor brought his CT scans and X-rays to an expert group.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott felt sick for the first time, a camera-equipped probe was inserted into the cavity between the rib and chest.
I am an optimist.
I usually just keep going," he says.
Honestly, I didn’t worry so much.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was in the week between Christmas and New Year: "They told me it was mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis of Mesothelioma
Suddenly, Abbott had appointments with Macmillan nurses, one of whom advised him to take a lawyer.
Only now did he understand the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings, where pipes were often insulated with asbestos," he says.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now sick.
And so mesothelioma now meets younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous pipes with asbestos insulation in hospitals were underground, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.
But many employees who switched from one building to another in pedestrian tunnels (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in underground canteens (as Graham Abbott often did) were most likely to come into contact with the toxic substances.
It turns out that over several decades after the war, hospitals were potentially life-saving for patients, but life-threatening for treating physicians.
It is still being removed today.
Students placed their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
And it's not just about hospitals.
Asbestos has been widely used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls because of its fabulous insulating and flame retardant properties.
Schools too.
In fact, many people probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
Across the country, in thousands of chemical hours, students have placed their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
The issue of asbestos in schools is now frequently addressed on websites.
And in the meantime, such innocent objects in our homes as flooring or shed roofs have included asbestos by default.
"It's an industrial poison contained in much of our real estate," remarked Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that occurred to an affected woman was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So be careful how you tear down your garden shed.
The impact of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, is immense.
“It takes a while to process that,” says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I realized I couldn’t focus on what I was doing.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I'm not going to see another Christmas.
With the greatest difficulty was the change of perspective from the position of a doctor to that of a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers how overwhelmed he was by all the information he had to deal with.
"It was very difficult to take up all of this," he says.
“I asked my doctor, ‘How long do I have?’
I was given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, “Well, I’m not going to see another Christmas.
That's it."
Mesothelioma is particularly insidious because it is our life-sustaining mechanism – breathing itself – that causes the deadly cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos is made of the smallest fibers.
When the asbestos is swirled up and the fibers are inhaled, they can settle in the pectoral skin, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the breast skin and can trigger cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibers," said Professor Tom Treasure, a heart-thoracic physician who moved to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
The very hospital Andrew Lawson suspected of exposing him to asbestos is now, ironically, a leading center in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated several others who were probably also exposed to asbestos during her training in the hospital.
As soon as the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, Treasure says, “they are pushed from the breathing process to the edge where the skin is.
It is naturally invasive from the beginning.
The usual options for other cancers don’t work as well with mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of an operation, for example, is hotly disputed.
Some think it’s worth a try.
Treasure denies that.
"You can't cut the pectoral out," he says.
You don't get around that with the knife.
Meanwhile, the cancer "doesn't respond very well to chemotherapy," which "shows an effect," but doesn't heal.
"Sometimes there are long-term survivors," Treasure says.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live longer, much longer than expected.
Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after his diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still struggling.
After contacting mesothelioma, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who four years after his diagnosis had become a one-man support and counseling office for fellow sufferers.
"Hello, cancer center," he cheerfully introduced himself when calling.
"He was very positive," Abbott says.
He had received his diagnosis 4 years earlier and was still very active.
Initially, Abbott had been offered six chemotherapy cycles that lasted four months and were expected to extend his life by only one month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, managed to "make things appear in a slightly more positive light."
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, a heart-thoracic specialist at Guy's.
"We had an advantage in that I didn't have to be referred, I just called and got an appointment," Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to receive a referral and wait for the approval of the treatment.
Money is crucial for mesothelioma sufferers in order to experience the best therapies available.
But when these treatments ultimately fail, many sufferers are facing another financial concern – about the future of the families they leave behind.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
“It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health,” Morgan says.
But what changed in the 1960s was that they realized that even a very low load posed a health risk.
And here the negligence of the companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually settled their case, but it wasn't what Morgan called "full compensation," as Lawson couldn't prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma was due to an asbestos contact at Guy's.
However, after investigating his death, a Guy's spokesperson confirmed that "the asbestos fibers in the affected cellar area were removed in the 1990s."
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to Remove Asbestos
In fact, for mesothelioma sufferers seeking compensation, attributing deadly asbestos contact to a company or workplace is an enormous problem—usually decades after the incidents.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed down.
Insurance documents can be lost.
And those who oppose claims know that the time is for them, but certainly not with the plaintiffs.
In response, there was significant new legislation this year that makes it easier for mesothelioma sufferers to sue for compensation, even if their former employers are no longer available.
The law has set up a <0xC2><0xA3>350 million fund fund funded by the insurance industry for anyone who has been diagnosed after July 2012, can prove a contact but can’t sue anyone.
In these cases, plaintiffs receive 80 percent of what a court could have granted them in a normal damages process – about <0xC2><0xA3>120,000.
Approximately 300 successful applications for the programme are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan thinks, like so many mesothelioma sufferers, that <0xC2><0xA3>350 million was a “very good job” for the insurance industry.
"This is a deal from insurers to insurers," he says, suggesting that this sum is about a quarter of what insurers would have to pay if time hadn't passed and mesothelioma sufferers could find the companies and sue them normally.
Mike Penning, then Minister of Labour and Pensions, also admitted that the law was “not perfect”.
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that in view of seven deaths daily, quick action was needed.
"People are suffering so much and need help today," Penning said during the second hearing of the mesothelioma law in December last year.
At that time Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After her initial consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation, which, unlike Tom Treasure, he expects to have a positive effect.
This was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy – a triple therapy that allows Lang-Lazdunski to present a survival rate over five years of up to 40 percent.
Abbott felt strengthened.
"That's the most important thing, of course," Abbott says.
You see this again and again in patients.
There is something that will keep you going.
If you give up, you'll get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012.
At the end of August, he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles behind him.
Aftercare scans showed no signs of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer spots around my chest.
I just turned 50.
This is not life-threatening.
This is life-ending.
Abbott underwent six chemotherapy cycles again.
Now no trace of the tumors is visible.
But the process is very physically and psychologically exhausting.
You need to think about practical things - about the money when I am no longer, for example, or show my wife how the boiler time setting works.
If you get bad news, you get negative.
You have to look forward.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, this is not always easy.
"It's hard for parents," he says.
It’s hard to know what to say and how much.
When I got my first diagnosis, I told my girl that I had a disease that I wouldn’t get old with.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very sociable and impetuous.
She told her friends and we soon got a lot of calls.
Ellie was more reluctant.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to go through.
But for Mesothelioma sufferers, such conversations are not permeated by hope, not by a trace of hope for survival.
The disease brings (as well as ultimately for Stephen Jay Gould) a grim security.
As Andrew Morgan says, “Mesothelioma is not life-threatening.

China denies Hong Kong right to government elections, protesters vow retaliation
On Sunday, despite increasing calls for democratic reforms, the Chinese parliament voted against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 election by the Hong Kong electorate.
This action is likely to fuel the long-announced protests in Hong Kong’s business district, while activists initiated the planning and mobilization within a few hours of the announcement.
The decision of the Chinese People’s Congress basically allows the communist leaders to reject all non-peking candidates.
"This is not unexpected, but it does make us angry," said law expert Emily Lau, chairman of the Democratic Party.
That’s not what Beijing had promised.
They lied to the people of Hong Kong.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, said that accepting public nominations in the elections would be too “chaotic” for the Hong Kong government.
Since 1997, when the UK returned control of Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has promised to allow its residents to vote for the presidency from 2017 onwards.
The Chinese leadership presented the decision on Sunday as a democratic breakthrough because it gives the citizens of Hong Kong a direct right to vote, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership is keeping the process under tight control of a Beijing-controlled nomination committee.
According to a new clause, only candidates "with love of the country and love of Hong Kong" will be admitted.
The decision follows a summer in which some of Hong Kong’s largest and most publicly active protests have taken place in several years.
Behind the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the movement Occupy Central With Love and Peace, whose organizers have threatened to close off the financial district if Beijing does not allow for a genuine universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain in front of the government headquarters in Hong Kong within a few hours of the announcement.
At the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement had reached a new level of civil disobedience and they were planning waves of protest in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any details about this, apparently to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online announcement, the organizers stated that the movement "has considered the occupation of the central district only as a last resort, an action that should only take place when all the opportunities for dialogue are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to have to say that today all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of the central district will definitely take place.
Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing’s announcement for days, and security measures including police forces and barricades were tightened in front of the government building on Sunday.
The unrest is exacerbated by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city.
The influx of people from the mainland increases competition for products and services.
In addition, there is growing fear that Hong Kong’s values of democracy and freedom of speech will begin to crumble under the growing pressure of Beijing.
Some criticized the demonstrations of the Occupy-Central movement as endangering business operations – the lifeline of Hong Kong.
“The protests they’re talking about could cause huge economic damage, depending on how many are involved and how long they last,” said law expert Regine Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to raise fears that Hong Kong will get out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
China’s state-controlled media also recently reported on Hong Kong’s democracy activists as Western power-led subversive agents.
This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on the right to vote in which 780,000 people participated - more than a fifth of voters in Hong Kong.
In July, tens of thousands took part in one of the largest demonstrations of democracy in the region’s history.
The tradition of graduation balls in the United States is now being transferred to the universities where freshmen performances are offered by private airplane.
We look forward to responding to this demand and offering the UK’s first luxury travel service for students today.
In order to achieve a particularly impressive appearance at the university, the company also offers transportation options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also stated that the service has a security division.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to carriage their belongings through the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
Along with our new VIF options, we look forward to making sure that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury this year.
A company spokesperson said there were no new bookings yet, as the service had just been introduced, but added that "students would book the service in the next few weeks."
The company also announced that despite the tuition fees of <0xC2><0xA3>9,000 per year, it expects a market for this offer.
Students today are very different in their expectations and demands from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it's more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do just that.
The National Student Union, however, criticized the service as being detached.
Megan Dunn, Vice President of the NUS for Higher Education said: "This offer seems completely separate from the lives of the majority of students.
Many students starting their studies this month are facing a cost of living crisis as the available financial aid in the form of loans and scholarships does not keep pace with the sharply rising bills for the simplest livelihoods before they can even think of spending thousands of pounds on something as simple as arriving at the student residence.
Feminists criticize racial question and police behavior after Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed earlier this month by a police officer in Ferguson, MO.
Participants raised their hands in the air and sang, "Hands up, don't shoot," while waiting for the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, over the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noted a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
According to their experience, white feminist commentators put gender before race when it comes to addressing reproductive rights and income inequalities.
However, as tensions rose in the Middle West and gained attention across the country, Perez saw that white women’s responses revolved 100% around the race.
Compared to the responses of black women shortly after the August 9 shootings, the personal essays with titles like "Thoughts about Ferguson from a White Woman" and "Feminism is not just about oppressing women" came relatively late.
But for Perez, that meant an important change.
"I don't think you can find many people in feminism who talk about being white and privileges in such a high-class way," she said.
People felt compelled to express something about the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis we are in and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnicized that they have to express it.
For English professor Koritha Mitchell of Ohio State University, Ferguson brought to light problems that black American women face every day, but are not seen as “women’s issues” in cultural space.
"I can post something funny on Facebook about myself and my partner and get 150 likes from anywhere," Mitchell said.
When I post something about how colored people are under siege in their own country, the silence is deafening.
"How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship but not about security in public space?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell who have studied race, gender, and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between race and gender problems.
For them, black women have not had the luxury of separating themes cleanly; they live in combined reality every day.
While white women now connect the issues of race and gender in the feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, a professor of women and gender studies at George Mason University, says her predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the justification was almost always the rape of a white woman," Hattery said.
White women had to be involved in the story to justify the lynching.
For Hattery, the split between white and black women came at the point where white women’s suffrage fighters like Susan B. Anthony analyzed the country in the late 19th century and found that the struggle for suffrage could only be successful for one group at a time: women or blacks.
"They made the decision to stand up for women's suffrage, and blacks' suffrage should come later," Hattery said.
When you remember such things, you become aware with power why colored women don’t trust white women.
We didn't do our job well.
We have never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women were granted the right to vote in 1920, it took another decade for white women to organize against lynching in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was formed almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women, Mitchell says.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist reactions to the questions raised by Ferguson—police behavior, racial discrimination—is a mirror of the time when white feminists played “catch” with the problems black women have been dealing with for generations.
"Wouldn't it be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms take the right to educate a child as seriously as they do with the right to contraception?" Mitchell asked.
Second-generation feminists, who built their careers on the struggle for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives, are now trying to understand what that means.
The well-known white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went on Facebook two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown and published a pointed article by Rebecca Carroll, a Guardian columnist, demanding more protests from white Americans on the topic of racism.
"I hope that women who have a different but parallel reason for understanding an inherent danger to the body — and opinions about the race that are significantly different in public polls — will lead the changes," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem stands for a more intersectional feminism that addresses racial as well as gender issues, some of her comments on the racial issue in America are astonished.
Christina Sommers, researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, are "far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's remarks about Ferguson contrast with her earlier criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently launched a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were annoying reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The relationship of the police to the black community is not the only problem that is pushing into the forefront of mainstream feminism.
After the U.S. Border Police picked up nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the country’s southwestern border this year, the issue of immigration reform is also coming to the surface – this time as a women’s issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that in order to rethink the issue as an essential women’s issue, all she has to do is publish the stories of immigrant women.
"These speak for themselves," Mercado said.
When the vast majority of work visas go to male immigrants, the women who accompany them are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories find a reverberation in women's organizations," she said.
"Swine House" in Ipswich is for sale
The image of a house for sale was removed by real estate agents when it became clear that it showed a large pig that had made it comfortable in the living room.
The detached house has one bedroom, is located on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for <0xC2><0xA3>120,000.
The details included a picture of the living room of the house - which also included a pig that had his head on a sofa.
Real estate agent Connells said the pig in the photo was the owner's pet.
"However, the photo was mispublished and has since been removed," a company spokeswoman said.
In the House Exposé, Connells described the former Assembly House as a "unique one-bedroom detached house."
Although the broker has removed the image from the website, it still appears on promotional material.
The sale of the home caused interest on social media when some asked if the pig was included in the purchase price.
The SW city of Harvey is home to a new millionaire after lottery win
A lottery player from Harvey is on this month
The search for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth continues, with a lucky winner receiving nearly $1.1 million from Saturday’s lottery draw.
A newspaper kiosk in Harvey pulled the jackpot in the draw of the first division for the second time in five years, after $1 million in November 2009.
The lucky winner has yet to report.
Store owner Steve Forward said the profit caused conversation in the small town in southwest Perth.
The city is talking about nothing else, and everyone is quite excited.
We thought that such a win could happen.
Eight WA winners celebrated wins in the first division last month, a due conclusion for a few lucky weeks for players in the state.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires in August, after a Belmont couple made the mega-winning $7.5 million just weeks earlier.
The winning couple had been playing for twenty years and said the win would allow them the opportunity to travel around the world and buy a new house.
Harvey’s millionaire is the 59th winner of the first division in the WA this year, with a total of nearly $85 million.
Leonidas prayed in the gladiators' arena
It was not only the gladiators who stood deep in the mud at the first Rheinbacher Römertag in the theme park.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract well over 1,000 visitors yesterday, who defied the rain showers and the autumnal cold and were completely enthralled by the historical spectacle.
There was a colorful array of representations, performances, plays, exhibits and information about the time of the Romans and their significance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial combat force of the gladiators school "Amor Mortis", which used every rainfall break to demonstrate its robust martial arts in the arena prepared with soft sand.
Gladiator owner "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and knowledgeable presenter, sending his men in succession to the ring for heroic duels in various gladiatorial genres.
At first, the "provocators" were in the row with a square shield and a short sword, as well as a leg rail on the left leg and an arm rail on the right arm.
Then followed the "Essedarii" with breastplate, short sword and throwing flange as well as iron gladiator helmet, leg and arm protection.
Particularly impressive was the appearance of the "Retiarius", who with throwing net, trident and dagger competed against the "Secutor" and after a short fight knocked the boy to the ground.
As the swords clashed metallicly, the shields scattered and the throwing flanges surrendered through the arena that could become a fear and anguish for the health of the gladiators.
But the imposing "Summa Rudis", the muscular arbiter, always had an attentive eye on them.
"We wanted to revive Roman everyday life and make the culture of the Roman era experienceable," explained Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the organizer "Freundeskreis Römerkanal", the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, the amusement park became an "Oppidum Romanum" for a day, a Roman city, as Vice Mayor Claus Wehage noted in his greeting.
After all, the Romans brought not only war and conquest to our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire today.
Remains of these were also to be admired on the Roman Day, for example "Aqueduct Marble" from the eleven-meter-high and 1400-meter-long Roman Canal Bridge, which once stood at Lüftelberg.
The Frontinus company confronted the water and energy supply once and now, and Managing Director Petra Fricke knew: "We still benefit from the knowledge of then".
This is also confirmed by graduate surveying engineer Ralph Heiliger of the "Ingenieurteam Zwei" from Rheinbach, who introduced surveying instruments of the Romans such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models from the excavations in 1894 as well as bricks from the original hypocaust, the hot air heating, which once warmed the Roman villa.
Also impressive are the footprints that were left by Wolf and Fox in the clay footsteps two millennia ago before they were burned.
In 2011, the Office for Land Heritage Care at the Landesverband Rheinland excavated the remains of a Roman villa in the Gewerbepark Nord in Rheinbach.
The walls of an agricultural building were found with a dredge for drying grain and for malting.
The building probably belonged to a villa Rustica, an agricultural estate, archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser explained.
A series of finds from these excavations were presented in a glass display case, including a large plate, several fine glass jars, and parts of a delicate necklace.
The villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century AD, until the invasion of the Germans in the then Roman Rhineland, Morscheiser suspects.
In addition, the children engaged in the Roman windmill game, similar to today's mill game, or they wrote their names on wax boards with metal handles, as did the Roman students.
At the stand of the Römerthermen Zülpich the children were allowed to lay mosaics themselves, at the stand of the glass museum Rheinbach glass mosaics and at the stand of the nature center Eifel Nettersheim a heavy wheat mill made of stone to grind the flour for a flat bread or a cereal.
With the original Roman trolley faithfully rebuilt by two coldblowers, visitors drove through the theme park and also passed the impressive stand of the Municipal Gymnasium, which presented the results of its "Roman Project Weeks".
With a Roman week from 13 to 21 September, the municipality of Wachtberg will also contribute to the Roman year 2014, declared throughout the Rhineland, which is to commemorate the death of Emperor Augustus 2,000 years ago.
Together with the home and history associations as well as the Wachtberg Wander-Verein, the Partnership Association and the Laienspielkreis Oberbachem, themed walks, a lecture, cooking evenings and guided tours for school classes are offered and remind the Roman past of Wachtberg.
For example, a Roman legionnaire is told about his work on the trained Wachtberg, plants are presented as living monuments from the Roman period and a funny lesson in terms of international understanding is presented between a group of Wachtberger "Germans" and attracted Romans.
The Adendorf Primary School is dedicated to the Roman theme as part of a project week.
The aim of Roman Week is to re-experience the numerous traces of the Romans in Wachtberg, which are often no longer visible at first glance.
In the Wachtberger Town Hall, a small presentation will commemorate the discovery of the Berkumer Matron Sanctuary in 1879.
Ebola: The epidemic weighs heavily on the West African economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a major blow to the economy.
Markets are orphaned - and international companies are at a distance.
The devastating Ebola epidemic is hitting the economy of West Africa.
The crop rots in the fields, the mines are abandoned and the markets are orphaned - the virus has hardened the region.
Some international companies are also already moving away.
"The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, but also an economic one," said the head of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka.
Liberia is hardest hit
“It’s a total disaster, we’re losing a lot of money,” says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothes at the second largest market in Liberia’s capital, Monrovia.
Only those who want to buy food or something to disinfect against Ebola come to the market.
Liberia has been hit the hardest by the virus, with more than 600 people affected by the fever.
Recently, health authorities said the disease had spread to every corner of the country.
The virus has also spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
In total, more than 1,500 people have already died, and thousands more have been infected.
Foreign companies withdraw employees
All over the resource-rich countries, companies are suspending their operations.
Foreign companies such as the steel group Arcelor Mittal are withdrawing their employees, several international airlines are no longer flying to the affected regions.
Local traders and farmers are also reacting: Few merchants still leave their home towns to get supplies.
In some quarantined areas of Sierra Leone and Liberia, cacao and coffee beans, which are important for export, are rotting in the fields.
The farmers do not dare to leave their homes for the harvest.
Food is scarce
“People will travel less and less,” says Phillipe De Vreyer, Parisian expert on the economy of West Africa.
For example, the man who usually goes to the market and sells his vegetables prefers to stay at home.
The population therefore feels the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently: food is scarce.
In the markets, stocks of basic foodstuffs such as rice are declining.
At the same time, the region, heavily dependent on international companies, threatens to suffer image damage – with far-reaching consequences.
The biggest danger is that international companies will basically avoid the area for a long time, says Philippe Hugon of the French think tank Iris.
It is crucial how far and how long the virus will spread.
Investors may have the impression that it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and thus to invest," Hugon warned.
The disease also burdens the strained state budgets of the states
The disease also burdens the already strained state budgets of the affected states.
Rating agency Moody’s fears that their budgets will be heavily burdened by the high spending on the health system and, in addition, by the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank has already pledged to help the health systems of the affected countries with $60 million (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>45 million).
The effects are already noticeable in Nigeria, where so far only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed.
The oil-rich region in the southern Niger Delta has not yet been affected.
But elsewhere, many people are already staying at home for fear of infection.
Reservations in hotels also decline significantly.
Sagittarius celebrates its 50th anniversary
The Schützenverein "Tannenwald" Berngau celebrates its 50th anniversary from 12 to 14 September.
At the Schützenverein Tannenwald, preparations for the 50th anniversary of the founding party are underway from 12 to 14 September.
It is scheduled for Friday, September 12, a great entertainment evening with the group "Dorfrocker".
Saturday at 6 p.m. is the big Böllershooting.
Then, in the big festival tent, the mood evening with the "Stoapfälzer Spitzbuam".
The wind band takes care of the music
Highlights on Sunday are the feast service and 9.30 a.m. in the parish church and the grand procession at 2 p.m.
In the afternoon is also the price distribution of the Federal and Gau shooting.
A particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 party ladies with their Dirndln.
Festkapelle is the blaskapelle Berngau.
Mayor Wolfgang Wild and Secretary of State Albert Füracker took over the patronage.
The original name "Schützengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" dates back to 1907, when the association for "social entertainment through exercise in room stud and small caliber shooting" was founded on 21 March.
The Nazi regime had caused the dissolution of the association in 1937.
It was not until 1964 that 19 young men found themselves again, who on 30 April at the Gasthaus Lukas raised the "new" Schützenverein "Tannenwald" Berngau from baptism.
Karl März and Adolf Ried led the club through a difficult start time as a shooter master, in which it was mainly about finding a club venue and installing the shooting operation.
Already in the autumn of 1965, the Schützenverein started in the "Leininger" inn with two teams in the round competitions.
In the following years, the sports shooters, who were now organized into seven teams, established themselves in all classes up to the 1st Gauliga.
The club records were set annually and the magical limit of 380 rings was reached for the first time in 1980 by Rudi Meier.
As the performance of the active shooters has increased, so have the number of members.
After the club premises "Leininger" no longer met the requirements of a modern shooting club, the then board of directors under the leadership of Johann Rinn decided to create a future home in the basement rooms of the new "Landgasthof Härteis".
After a work of 2700 hours, on 8 May 1988, Father Strasser granted the church blessing for the new Sagittarius rooms.
One of the major highlights in the history of the club was certainly the 44th Gauss shooting, combined with the solemn consecration of the new shooter flag in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994, the Schützenverein celebrated its 30th anniversary.
A Böller group was founded in 1995.
Josef Schmalzl became Böllerreferent.
A major challenge for the "Böllerer" and for the club as a whole was the organisation of the Bavarian Böllertreffen 2005.
During many hours of voluntary work last year, the club members modernized the rooms and the shooting facility in the Berngauer Hof, thus updating the state-of-the-art technology.
Eleven teams in round matches
You can also see the sporting achievements of the Schützenverein.
A total of eleven teams are currently participating in the round competitions: six air rifle teams, one air gun team, one sports gun KK1, one youth and two AH teams.
The 1st team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann has climbed from the Gauoberliga (highest league in Schützengau ANB) to the Bezirksliga 1 in the round 2013/14.
The second team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml has risen from the Gauliga Nord to the Gauoberliga.
In addition to the shooting sport, events such as bockstechen, carnival and royal ball, club excursion and Christmas celebration have tradition.
The shooters are also present at the festivals in the parish and community.
Tony Stewart has an accident when he returns to the race track.
Tony Stewart's return to the track ended about halfway through his race at the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart drove against the wall for the second time after his right front tyre burst in round 172 and ended his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left it without talking to journalists.
His team boss Chad Johnston said his 14-member team was disappointed, but is now focusing on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish we had a better effort and a better result for him," Johnston said.
We'll go to Richmond and hope we can do better there.
Stewart drove into a wall earlier in the race on Sunday night after a collision with Kyle Busch and had to have the right side of his car repaired.
"I went in today with pretty good hopes for a good result," Johnston said, adding, "It just didn't work."
Not long after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded into the tug and the team had packed and was ready to leave.
Stewart failed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver at a runway race in northern New York State.
He decided to return this week and win either in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to win a place in the chase.
He returned to his workplace during an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who had stepped onto the road during a race to confront Stewart.
Authorities said on Friday that investigations into the cause of the accident will continue for at least two weeks.
No decision has yet been made as to whether Stewart will face an indictment.
The three-time champion was greeted with great applause when he was introduced before the race.
After a start at 12th position, Stewart had already advanced into the first 10 shortly afterwards and was temporarily in fourth place.
After a restart in round 122, Buschs
Carriage with No. 18 out of control after exiting Curve 2 and collided with Stewart, with both cars running against the wall.
Stewart continued, but fell back to 21st place.
Looking for new dancers
Just try it out: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and manager Lisa Neitzel (from left) are looking forward to teammates.
Like many other clubs, the jazz groups in TV Jahn also create full-day lessons at the secondary schools.
After the summer holidays, some groups have severely decimated.
Now we are looking for more young people for a sport that is healthy and fun.
In the two jazz and modern dance groups of Lisa Neitzel, former dancer in the jazz and modern dance formation "Spirits", there are only nine children left.
"Three in the group of eight to twelve years old, six in the group of twelve to 15 years old," says the 20-year-old.
With more active people, the whole thing would be much more fun, "you could dance completely different choreographies," she says.
If you want to dance, you can sniff into the training class on Thursdays between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m. or on Fridays between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m. in the dance sports room at the former Hotel Meyer, Freistraße 9, without obligation.
"Training regularly starts with a warm-up program," says the coach.
After that, various choreographies are practiced.
JazzDance has the feature that there is no fixed shape and is therefore open to many styles.
Elements from folklore to classical to sports and acrobatics are processed in jazz dance.
Of course, the socialization is not too short.
"We also go to dinner, watch dance movies and we have also stayed in the dance room before," Lisa Neitzel reports.
In the group you can make friends, share a beautiful hobby and do a lot for your own motor development.
If you don’t like jazz dancing, you can also sniff into one of the other offers of TV Jahn.
Children and young people can always sniff into the lessons on Wednesdays in the areas of children’s dance/jazz dance, bambini ballet, video clip dancing and hip hop.
The dance coach is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome to the dance evenings on Monday and Wednesday.
If you are interested in discofox, slow waltz, Viennese waltz, rumba, cha-cha-cha and tango, you can stop by and join us.
Bulgarian prison guards protest nationwide
Hundreds of prison employees from all over Bulgaria have organized a nationwide protest in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demands for the restoration of their old working conditions, which have recently been changed.
Higher salaries are also on a list of demands to be discussed with Interim Justice Minister Hristo Ivanov.
Officials have been protesting symbolically against the new working hours for a month and demanding a return to the previous 24-hour shifts.
Despite the meetings between the union of prison employees and representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, the National Bulgarian Ratio (BNR) reported.
Negotiations continue, the Director-General for the implementation of punitive measures, Rosen Zhelyazkov told the BNR.
The protest of the prison staff is expected to be supported by members of the Union of Employees of the Ministry of the Interior.
Ukrainian army has abandoned Luhansk airport
In eastern Ukraine, the pro-Russian fighters continue to advance.
After heavy fighting, which allegedly involved Russian tank battalions, the Ukrainian army today, Monday, abandoned the airport of the rebel stronghold of Luhansk.
The army said seven soldiers had been killed in the last 24 hours.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had previously drawn personal consequences from the severe defeats of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the top army leadership, without giving details.
Pro-Russian separatists shoot down plane
In the fight against Ukrainian government forces, pro-Russian separatists have reportedly shot down a fighter plane and two military helicopters.
Around 100 soldiers were also injured or killed in fighting in the Donetsk region, the insurgents told Russian agencies on Monday.
Coast Guard ships sunk
The insurgents also claimed to have sunk two boats of the Ukrainian Coast Guard for the first time in the Azov Sea.
Ukrainian Border Guards confirmed that two of its ships had fallen under fire on Sunday near the port city of Mariupol.
Seven border guards were injured, a spokesman in Kiev told the broadcaster 112.ua.
Two crew members were reported missing.
Local media blamed Russia for the incident.
The separatists also reported that they had brought several villages in the Donetsk area under their control.
Diplomatic offensive in Minsk
In the Belarusian capital Minsk, the Ukraine Contact Group meets today.
In addition to representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, an envoy of the separatists from eastern Ukraine should also participate.
In advance, all actors used their performances to publicly announce their demand.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia due to planned deployments in Eastern Europe as a result of the Ukraine crisis.
NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels that NATO is adhering to the 1997 NATO-Russia Council founding agreement.
However, the NATO chief accused Russia of “a sharp breach” of the agreement.
“Today we have to face the reality that Russia does not see NATO as a partner,” Rasmussen said.
Russian documents and statements state that “they see us as opponents.”
Stronger NATO presence
Rasmussen has also announced that he wants to strengthen the NATO presence in Eastern Europe.
A “readiness action plan” to be finalized at the NATO summit in Wales will ensure that “we will have more visible NATO presence in the East for as long as necessary,” Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels.
Kiev and Moscow agree on new gas talks
Russia and Ukraine have officially agreed on new talks to settle their gas dispute.
Negotiations are scheduled for next Saturday, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Nowak said on Monday.
It is still awaiting a decision by the European Union whether it will also send a representative to the talks.
Because of the dispute over the price of gas, Ukraine has not been getting any fuel from Russia for weeks.
EU Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger recently mediated between the two sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also cut off gas supplies to Europe.
Europe draws around a third of its natural gas from Russian sources, a large part of which flows through Ukraine.
Merkel speaks word of power: Tolls will come "totally clear"
Now the Chancellor has made it clear once again.
However, it is not a free letter for all the complicated details.
Persistent concerns from the CDU against the car toll have increasingly angered the CSU.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken a powerful word for the introduction of a car toll after persistent opposition from her CDU.
"To be very clear, she is in the coalition agreement and she will come," the party leader said on Monday after meetings of the CDU's top committees in Berlin.
However, for the time being, Merkel did not set a detailed model.
In the black-and-red government program, "certain parameters" are mentioned.
Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) has made a proposal, and it is now being worked on.
However, the NRW-CDU insists on its no to a toll on all roads.
Merkel stressed that Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) is also making a constructive contribution to the deliberations on a bill.
In addition to the topic, he also talked with Dobrindt about other ways to activate more private capital for investments in infrastructure, including broadband expansion.
Schäuble had left a "mirror" report unannounced on Sunday, his house is examining its own concept to reward highway investors with toll revenue - after the 2017 election.
CSU chief Horst Seehofer then warned against developing toll concepts against the leading minister in the cabinet.
CDU federal vice-president Armin Laschet reaffirmed his objections.
"The coalition agreement never assumed tolls on all district and federal roads," said the North Rhine-Westphalian CDU chairman.
In this respect, it is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced that he will speak again on the subject.
Opposition to the plans also comes from the CDU countries associations Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate.
Background are fears that a toll will interfere with small border traffic to neighbouring states.
Seehofer had demanded coalition allegiance from the CDU because of the toll criticism.
The Left sees the plans as a failure in the face of the dispute in the Union.
"The Murks toll is dead," party leader Bernd Riexinger told the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Monday).
Dobrindt wants to introduce a vignette obligation on all German roads, which should start in 2016.
However, domestic car owners may not be charged additionally under the coalition agreement.
Therefore, they should receive full compensation for the toll via the car tax.
However, under EU law, the model must not discriminate against foreign drivers because of their nationality.
Genetic disorder often misdiagnosed
A British woman says she thought as a result of a misdiagnosis over many years that she would die.
Karin Rodgers lived almost her entire youth believing that she had only a few years left to live after being diagnosed with another disease.
She actually suffered from Charcot Marie Tooth Disease (CMT) — a group of inherited disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK reported that misdiagnosis is a common problem in people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
About 23,000 people in the UK are believed to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, insecure walking and curved toes.
The disease is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms get worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed she was suffering from Friedreich Ataxia (FA) - a disease with very poor chances of survival.
Rodgers thought she would sit in a wheelchair before she turned 18, and die before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children, who is now 51 years old, said: "As a child, I knew I couldn't do the same thing as the others.
I fell down all the time and everything lasted longer with me.
I could never skate or skate with the other kids and was often taunted at school because of my way of walking and running.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13, after several operations to relieve her Achilles tendon and stretch her feet, she saw her medical record when her doctor left the room and read that she was suffering from FA.
"I felt guilty because I had been curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, searched for the disease in the library, and wrote to the FA Society," she said.
When I received an answer, I was shocked and terribly panicked.
I thought I would be in a wheelchair at 18 and die at 25, and in between I would slowly lose all my skills.
I did it all by myself and planned my own funeral.
She said when she turned 17, she realized that her abilities had not decreased as much as she had imagined, and asked her doctor.
He just stood up and hugged me and said, "My dear, I don't think you have that, otherwise you'd be in a wheelchair by now."
I think you have something much less life-threatening.
After several genetic tests, her CMT was detected.
"When he explained to me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT awareness month to raise awareness of this disease.
Stabsfeldwebel a. D. Berni Diether has been working as a fireworker since the closure of the former troop training ground
For almost ten years, no more shootings have been taking place on the former troop training ground in Münsingen.
Nevertheless, deadly ammunition still appears every month in the heart of the Swabian Alb biosphere area.
The grenades are sometimes so dangerous that they have to be blown up on site.
A deafening bang sounds during the explosions over the heart of the biosphere area.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot was fired at the Münsingen training ground, which was closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operation.
Since that time, the 6500-hectare area has been the core of the Swabian Alb biosphere area, which is open on 13 designated paths for hikers and cyclists.
Tax burden of businessmen in Washington area rises with economic recovery
A recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax filings for companies in the country rose slightly last year as economic recovery accelerated, according to a newly published study last week, and companies in the Washington area were no exception.
Companies in the District, Maryland, and Virginia area collectively paid $27.6 billion to state and local agencies in fiscal 2013, an increase of 3.8 percent over 2012 revenues of $26.6 billion.
The state and local tax burden of the companies rose by 4.3 percent last year to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 percent in the previous year, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after the several years of declining notices in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes rose more than local taxes, by 4.3 percent, according to the study conducted by the services agency Ernst & Young with the Center for State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the district’s tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland’s revenue comes from corporations.
Virginia generates the lowest tax revenue from companies at 28 percent.
Much of the increase in tax revenues is due to a recovery in real estate values of the companies, the researchers say, leading to a 3.7 percent increase in real estate taxes this year after the three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent.
While a large part of these profits came from major states such as California, New York and Texas, the procedure seems to apply to the Washington area as well.
Companies in the District, Maryland, and Virginia collectively paid over $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 — a 4.2 percent increase over the course of a year.
But the apparent recovery in real estate values in Maryland is not as effective in increasing state and local tax revenues, as here real estate taxes amount to just over one-fifth of corporate tax returns.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay nearly half of their state and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.
“In Maryland, a large portion of real estate, especially in the tax area around D.C., is either owned by the government or by nonprofit organizations that don’t pay property taxes,” said Douglas Lindholm, Managing Director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, in order to provide the same services that other states offer.
The recent recovery in corporate tax revenues cannot be attributed solely to the recovery of the real estate market
Business revenues also seem to be recovering, according to the data.
Companies in the region reported income taxes at state organizations of $2.3 billion compared to $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland raised $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount in the region.
While the trend is going in the same direction, the local tax burden for companies is not rising evenly in all three locations.
The rise rate in the district was 4.3 percent of the national average, while the rise in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia reported an under-average tax revenue of 4.1 percent.
Virginia has the significantly lowest corporate income taxes in all three areas of government at 6 percent (all three have fixed corporate tax rates).
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 percent and in the district is relatively high at 9.975 percent.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of this year showed that lower state and local corporate taxes are required in Virginia and there is a better tax climate overall than in Maryland.
The district was not investigated in the study.
Despite the advantages, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbor.
North Carolina has passed laws to lower its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will drop to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues to meet its income targets in the coming year, this law could reduce the state’s corporate income tax rate to 3 percent by 2017.
Meanwhile, small businesses in the Washington area seem to be doing better, and they are therefore paying more state and local taxes, according to the latest study.
Corporate taxes paid as personal income taxes by small business people — a transitional structure that most small businesses are organized by — rose by 20 percent to $2.4 billion in the District, Maryland, and Virginia last year, a significantly faster rate of growth than corporate taxes overall.
The researchers say the trend and increase in corporate taxes across the country is likely to continue this year, with general defense tax revenues for the state and local governments rising by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year.
Nevertheless, the Washington area could lag behind if the federal government’s spending cuts impact the labor market in the region.
Partner city: German beer for Guangzhou
Hops and malt - also a popular combination in China.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt’s partner city in China now wants a brewery and also hopes for a direct flight connection between the two cities.
German beer, brewed in Frankfurt's partner city Guangzhou - this is the urgent wish of the officials in China.
"We would be very pleased if a German brewery settled in our city," said Li Yiwei, the deputy party secretary of the South China metropolis, during a visit to a SPD delegation in his city this week.
In the course of the talks, the official of the ruling Communist Party of China repeatedly returned to this concern of the twelve-million metropolis.
Guangzhou, which in Germany is also called Canton, is one of the richest cities in China, Li advertised.
Therefore, people also had the purchasing power to afford German beer.
Hessian SPD chairman Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel, who led the German political delegation, told the host that he would be consulting in Germany for a possible partner for the project.
"Beer doesn't need much: good water, grain and joy of life," he added at lunch with the party leader in Guangzhou.
This joy of life already radiates Mr. Li, he flattered the host.
Then the official from Guangzhou came up with shepherd's gumbel - but with red wine, which was served to the dinner.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao dates back to German brewing art.
Tsingtao beer is brewed according to the German Purity Law.
More business traffic
A second wish of the Chinese hosts would be a direct flight between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Li.
Lufthansa had offered the flight earlier, but cancelled in 2012 for economic reasons.
"It would be worth it again," the local politician proved convinced.
"Trade between our two cities continues to increase".
Currently, travelers would have to take the detour via Changsha in Hunan province, Li complained.
The administration of the province of Guangdong, whose capital is Guangzhou, also hopes for the flight connection.
The vice-governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, put this desire in the foreground in his talks with the Social Democrats.
"That's a very good idea," replied Schäfer-Gümbel - the Chinese Deputy Minister Li Jinjun, an intimate connoisseur of Germany, nodded in agreement.
Maintained partnership
Guangzhou’s deputy party leader hopes to visit Frankfurt for a partnership meeting next year.
Li Yiwei was already on the Main, but not yet in that function.
He only took office this year after his predecessor had been promoted from office for corruption allegations.
The local party leader Wan Qinglian also had to leave.
The action against Guangzhou officials is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in party and administration, which is being harshly enforced by President Xi Jinping.
The new top politician Li Yiwei had worked for an American company before his party career, which is highly unusual in the Communist Party of China.
Prior to taking office in Guangzhou, he worked as a senior official in Fujian, where the automaker VW is building a large plant.
Frankfurt has officially entered into more than a dozen city partnerships.
The connection to Guangzhou, 9,000 kilometers away, is one of those that are maintained by both sides, for example with a student exchange.
Last year, the 25th anniversary of the German-Chinese connection was celebrated.
The southern Chinese metropolis on the Pearl River is almost as strong with its economic power as all of Hesse.
Next year, it wants to achieve a gross domestic product of 250 billion euros, Li reported.
Joan Rivers' family "squeezes their thumbs"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since being admitted to a New York City hospital three days ago, but her daughter showed hope today that the 81-year-old comedian will recover from her illness.
“Thank you for your continued love and support,” Melissa Rivers said in a statement.
We're all thumbs up.
According to sources, her mother was admitted to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after a cardiac arrest emergency at a clinic on the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy.
Doctors deliberately keep them sedated and under close observation until they are more satisfied with their condition, which continues to be described as “serious.”
The reactions came from many sides, including in the form of overwhelming online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Eco-friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages
More stringent environmental standards will apply to cars and vacuum cleaners that come into the market from today onwards.
Similar to refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners will receive a label from September 1st, where the buyer can see key data such as the energy efficiency of the device at a glance.
For new cars in the pollutant class "Euro 6" stricter nitrogen oxide values apply.
In addition, there is more money for the scaffolding builders: they receive a nationally uniform minimum wage of 10.25 euros.
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what information had reported on Monday morning: The online retailer – and video producer, and a host of other things – is buying the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
The announcement comes as a surprise, not because no one expected a acquisition of Twitch, but because it was widely suspected that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago, it looked like the sale of Twitch to Google’s video service was decided for a cool billion thing, and the collaboration also seemed natural.
Twitch, which was founded only three years ago as Justin.tv, was launched as a general streaming service – a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to release their brave pieces in games, a "YouTube for live games," according to an insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play", a video genre in which better-knowers give the (mostly older) games a touch of secret science theater, are already very popular on YouTube.
It’s just that YouTube is often called when you want to describe Twitch, so the news that YouTube wanted to buy Twitch was taken a little bored, a textbook example of an established tech company buying up a potential competitor.
It’s a mystery why the deal with YouTube didn’t come about, as the company reportedly was willing to pay just as much as Amazon.
Emmet Shear, president of Twitch, said: “We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term vision, and they want to help us get there faster.”
Another secret is, frankly, the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me, who explain that they prefer to play sports rather than watch, it’s hard to grasp the attraction of watching others play instead of taking the control console into their own hands.
It’s one thing to look over a friend’s shoulder at 3 a.m. as she sneaks through Resident Evil, and something completely different to watch a spinner being shot in the head 20 times in a row in Call of Duty.
All these games you can watch right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are first-person games, so watching without own control over the viewing perspective can be a really good recipe for headaches.
I admit that the quick runs in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age complete entire games in record time are entertaining.
But as long as there’s not a game or humor virtuoso, his Twitch channel probably isn’t that interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know about this?
Twitch is visited by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic peaks.
How exactly does Amazon want to make money?
It’s hard to imagine Twitch being integrated into Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as YouTube Twitch could have swallowed.
But Twitch has something every business would like to have: thousands of young men who are being advertised as advertisers.
As the chairman of Twitch, Shear, said, Amazon and Twitch both "believe in the future of gaming," and the medium shows no signs of shrinking, not even - schluck - as a spectator sport.
There was a lot going on on Sunday at the Burggartenfest.
The concept of the organizers was correct.
Despite the heavy rain on Saturday evening, an estimated 1,200 music fans came to the open-air festival in the castle garden.
At times, the admission had to be stopped.
"That was annoying," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Saltwedel l Light and fun.
From two Spanish words, Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem formed the name Amula.
Because the open air in the Salzwedeler Burggarten should radiate brightness during the day and in the evening through various shows.
Well, and the fun comes by itself anyway.
This was evident early on Saturday, when the first visitors opened their doors to the open air.
A celebration for all generations had been promised by the organizers.
And they succeeded.
Around the supply stands on the Burggartenwiese, Salzwedeler, but also guests from the nearby and wider surroundings had made themselves comfortable.
They followed the first live performances, tilted their feet in the beat, enjoyed cool drinks - in short: pure relaxation and enjoyment were in vogue.
And this across generations.
While some lumbered on blankets on the extra-carved white sand at the beach bar, others sipped on a quarter of wine in the wine shop, the offspring raged on the bouncing castle, which was a great attraction for the smaller guests.
But even in children's make-up, the volunteers had to do all the hands full in the truest sense of the word in order to become masters of the hustle and bustle and conjure imaginative creations into the little faces.
The larger ones used the kicker tables or participated in a skateboard workshop organized by the Goodfoot crew from Salzwedel.
Until the big rain came.
Shortly before 5:30 p.m. he bounced down on the visitors, especially families searching for the wide and dry.
But the attractiveness of the festival did not stop.
"There were more people coming than expected," said Ron Sem, who spoke of a "success on the whole line."
Therefore, there is nothing to prevent the big party from repeating next year.
Although there is still work to be done on the content and size of the event, Sem made it clear to the popular voice in a first balance sheet on Sunday.
He called it annoying that in the meantime the admission had to be stopped.
Obviously, the security company had been booked with too few forces.
As a consequence, some who had already paid did not come to the site.
The resonance was very good.
In a first careful estimate, the Salzwedel co-organizer spoke of about 1200 visitors who tumbled in the castle garden.
There were problems with sound technology.
The Salzwedeler hip-hop band Blocks<0x60>n<0x60>Rox broke off their appearance therefore denerved.
The technicians were unable to create a half-reasonable sound.
The planned shisha lounges could not be built because the tents could not be brought to Salzwedel due to a tire breakdown.
"But next year they will be there," the organizer said.
The premiere of the Amula-Open-Air was more than successful by the number of visitors.
And that in bad weather.
However, the organizers have made some mistakes that will still be forgiven the first time, but must be eliminated in the second edition.
The social network Facebook also has to be criticized by the organizers.
"Sorry, but for twelve euros you simply expected more," says Melanie Meier on the event page.
"You've taken over a little bit, unfortunately," says Ele Zimmermann in the same place.
Others do not see the initial problems very closely.
I find it very good that some not only talk stupidly, but also really try to put something on their feet.
Hut off!" writes Stephanie Jenss to the amula.
Now the organizers have a year to dismiss these criticisms.
New Radom in Berkum: Wachtberg's landmark shrinks
As expected, this is not the case.
Rather, the ready-to-use component is waiting to be inserted into the distinctive structure.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: Almost 50 years after the creation of the TIRA space observation radar, the shell, the so-called radome, is completely renewed.
The new Radom will be slightly smaller than the old one with a diameter of 47.5 meters.
However, the size remains a world record.
The final step to completing the new case is the cap exchange
The upper quarter of the old shell is separated and removed with a crane.
After that, the last quarter of the new envelope is placed.
If the weather is good, the event will take place at the beginning of this week.
Participant in the Ice Bucket Challenge turns jaw
Isabelle Roberts from Britain screamed so much as her ice-cold water was poured over her head that she hurt the bone structure of her face.
This ice bucket challenge went painfully wrong.
A woman was admitted to the hospital after screaming so loudly at the Ice Bucket Challenge that she froze her jaw.
Isabelle Roberts from Britain screamed so much as her ice-cold water was poured over her head that she hurt the structure of her face.
"The water was so cold that I screamed, and while I did, my jaw just stopped," she told The Mirror.
Ice water is poured over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but that didn’t work, the jaw was hooked, and then I understood that something was wrong.
My mother and sister saw this too and almost got into their pants with laughter, but I had to go to the emergency room.
The 20-year-old from the UK was hospitalized to get her jaw constricted after participating in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip was linked to an internet sensation and thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
Will the castle clubs soon pull on a strand again?
Recently, there were repeated disputes between the two Wolfratshauser Burgvereine.
Now the boards are considering a possible cooperation.
As a model for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshaus Castle, the late Richard Dimbath, former chairman of the Wolfratshaus Castle Friends, led the project in Guédelon, France.
Just a year ago, there was no good climate between the Burgverein and the Burgfreunde Wolfratshausen.
So far, the views on how to deal with the history of the Wolfratshaus Castle and a possible reconstruction seemed very different.
Now the two camps are moving towards each other: talks are soon to be held about a common approach.
The board members Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfreunde) confirm this on demand from our newspaper.
"I called Mr. Piffl and suggested that we could sit together once," Sjöberg reports.
In his view, all members of both clubs could pull together again in the future.
This means that visible successes can be seen more quickly.
While the friends of the castle around the suddenly deceased Richard Dimbath had until the last time in mind a reconstruction of the castle on the mountain forest, for the Burgverein around Sjöberg the "exploration and experience" of the site stands at the forefront.
Herbert Piffl, Second Chairman of the Burgfreunde, was very pleased about the call.
Since Dimbath's death, he has been in charge of the castle friends.
A new chairman is expected to be found at a general meeting in mid-September.
According to the 74-year-old, the club currently has around 40 members.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we stopped the club's activities out of respect, and this "thinking phase" was needed to "think about how it could go on."
According to Piffl, the new chairman should then go into the conversation with the Burgverein.
Until then, the castle friends could also get a current mood picture within their group.
There is currently no candidate for the presidency, says Piffl.
"But I am confident that someone will find himself." He himself does not want to run because he has his residence in Bad Tölz.
The new chairman should be a Wolfratshauser.
The Tölzer wants to work on the project "but would very much like to continue to cooperate".
The different points of view in terms of reconstruction will probably persist in the eyes of Piffl in the near future.
He commends Dimbath as a "missionary" who always believed in the rebuilding of the castle.
Two similar, already advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an airlock.
Due to a high participation of the population as well as through volunteers from all over the world, they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: "I was skeptical at first.
But over time, I have become more and more convinced that it makes sense to push the project forward. A "one-stop-shop" for the Flößerstadt could be created.
There's nothing else here.
In addition, the project would be funded through EU grants, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, Piffl believes.
"Personally, I don't want to throw the idea of reconstruction overboard," he said, hoping that the Burgverein might make a move on this point.
Their goal, to document the story first, "is important and good."
After that, you could see further.
Smart Ways to Save on Uni Textbooks
Since the cost of university textbooks for many students is more than $1,000 per year, fast-second-semester student Matt Schroeder thought of a clever savings idea.
He invented a loan system for books from high-semester students and offered nominal compensation to delay resale.
"My math book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a chick-fil-a-keek," said Schroeder, 19, who attends Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $430, he said.
He spent $120.
The college management said that on average students spend more than $1,200 annually on textbooks and study materials, but that there would be various cost mitigation options for students.
Online stores and creative approaches like the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of choice for students.
Renting textbooks is becoming more popular, and so students can use a book for a semester, often at a much cheaper price than when buying.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 university book stores, said that textbook rentals have doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of the books in college book stores were rented last spring semester, Neebos vice president Tevor Meyer said.
According to the National Association of College Stores, less than half of all textbooks are purchased in campus bookshops.
Here is the one-off for the best deals.
Buy online
Some new books online only cost a third of the price for which they can be found in the campus bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" by Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs nearly $290, but can be purchased from the specialist textbook retailer Chegg.com for $239.99.
Buying used
If you don’t mind the notes of other people or normal signs of use, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is used to have on Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a graduate student at Brigham Young University, says he spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a second-hand issue of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."
The book was sold for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls, advised students to ask their professors if previous expenses were allowed.
Sometimes the updates are not relevant for the seminar work.
In such cases, older expenses can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest expense.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, Half.com from eBay Inc is also a popular alternative to used books.
Renting
Renting textbooks is worth considering if you treat them reasonably well, remember to return them, and you don’t want to keep the books after completing the course.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could rent “Calculus” for the duration of a semester for about $20.
Find out about the terms of the store where you are renting, including the penalties that may be incurred for writing notes, underlines or signs of use.
If you do not return the book, the penalties may even exceed the price of a new book.
E-books
E-books instead of traditional textbooks are also an option.
Sometimes these books are rented de facto by providing an electronic license for a certain period of time from wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg, and Barnes & Noble Inc.
At Chegg, you can rent "Calculus" for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says that students often find the best deals in literary courses, as many classics can be downloaded for free these days, while scientific and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
Definitely look around.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon be attending Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for pricing books, as you can be sure to find the right textbook.
And before placing an online order, you should check, according to Gault, whether the book is actually in stock.
He learned this lesson on the hard way.
He bought a book that had four weeks of delivery time and eventually paid the full price at the college bookstore.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" Didn't Become a Cashier
"The Expendables 3" by Sylvester Stallone raised less than $30 million of his $90 million budget in the US, while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" raised only $12 million of his $70 million budget.
The film "Sex Tape", tailored to Cameron Diaz, recorded only $14.6 million on the opening weekend, while children's films such as "Dragon-Taming Easy 2" also disappoint in revenue.
An article by Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that in children's films, the lack of quality in the films themselves could be the reason.
Collin described 2014 as "the worst year" so far for children's movies, describing "dragon taming made easy 2" as a purely "functional" fantasy sequel.
However, when it comes to films for a slightly older audience, it seems that the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic ratings for each summer movie launch shown on at least 2,000 screens between Memorial Day and July 20, 2013 and the current year.
The results are based on the opinions of cinema visitors and film critics and suggest that this year’s film hits are equivalent to last year’s.
Some commentators believe that the development is due to changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney’s upcoming jungle book film, told Hollywood Reporter: “I think times are changing.”
We must accept this and not try to follow the past.
In contrast to the currently weak cash results of Hollywood productions, Netflix recently generated revenues of $1.2 billion in streaming content, almost twice as much as last year, when revenues amounted to $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios for focusing too much on filming comics and prophesied a "core melt" of Hollywood.
In light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that his gloomy prophecy may well contain a true core.
However, due to the potential cashier hits expected in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
X-Men producer Simon Kinberg recently described the decline in cashier results as simply “cyclical” and told Hollywood Reporter: “Next summer will be the biggest summer at the box office at all, and no one will worry about the business anymore.”
When the 2nd table tennis district class was deleted a few years ago in order to tighten the league division, this was a step in the right direction.
Now the German Table Tennis Federation has taken an additional 3rd Bundesliga into the program.
He who has not ascended has descended.
Göttingen’s class-highest team Torpedo in the Oberliga relegation has avoided the relegation, but will only play fifth in the coming season.
Torpedoes ladies remain in fourth place, despite their grandiose march into the regional league.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Niedersachsenliga, as well as the boys of SC Weende.
The SG Lenglern and the Torpedo-Reserve will compete in the new Verbandsliga, and no Göttinger Klubs will be represented in the Landesliga.
The women's TTV Geismar plays in the Verbandsliga, the torpedo second in the Landesliga.
What looks like a better district class from the composition is now the new district Oberliga Süd.
TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and the TTC will compete here.
In the district league as regional representatives Dransfeld and the SC Weende play, in the district class of the TTC II, Rot-Weiß, the Bovender SV II and the teams of the TTV Geismar II and III.
Güntersen, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are here.
Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen start in the district league.
Nine teams each
The SC Weende sends his girls to the small district league.
Also the district league squad of SCW boys - there still starts Torpedo II - is not complete.
In a district class, Geismar, Tuspo Weende and the Bovender SV go into the season.
In the first season of the newly formed regional association, the two Göttinger Kreisligen start with nine teams each.
In the West-Staffel are the Rot-Weiß II, Bovender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II.
In the Ost-Staffel, among others, Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen play.
The Women's Circle League consists of Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and the SG Rhume.
This is still better than in Osterode County, where there are no more women’s teams at the county level.
It is striking that none of the six 2nd circle classes reach setpoint strength, here the innovative and revolutionary circle board will already have to think about.
NATO summit: first protests in Newport and Cardiff
On the weekend, there were protests by opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the center of Newport for an anti-Nato march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered in Cardiff in front of the city hall to hold a so-called counter summit.
Stephen Fairclough followed the developments over the weekend for us and spoke to protesters who travelled from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenager flew out of the Blue Mountains
TWO youthful bush walkers were brought to safety by rope winch after being trapped overnight in the Blue Mountains in NSW.
THE 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man set off for their tour in Govetts Leap in Blackheath shortly after Sunday afternoon.
Concerned relatives called the police at about 8 p.m. when the two had not returned home.
A search squad from local police and rescue services broke up and the couple was found near the Bridal Veil waterfalls at about 11 p.m.
The girl had injured herself on the knee and the man had fallen and had opened his head.
Rescuers stayed with the couple overnight, and they were flown out on Monday morning.
They were admitted to the Blue Mountains Hospital in stable condition with an ambulance.
Anti-government protests escalate in Pakistan
The approximately 1,000 protesters had been pushed out of the PTV building by soldiers, said Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid.
The station resumed broadcasting after about half an hour.
PTV director Athar Farooq said the protesters, equipped with sticks, had damaged equipment in the editorial.
Dead or injured were not reported.
The protesters are demanding the resignation of the head of government to whom they accuse of electoral fraud.
Police said about a kilometre away from Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's residence on Monday, there were clashes of some 3,000 protesters with security forces.
According to hospital reports, a police officer was injured.
Over the weekend, at least three people were killed and more than 500 injured as protesters attempted to penetrate Sharif’s residence.
They demand the resignation of the Prime Minister.
The powerful military had called on a political solution to the conflict “without wasting time and without applying force” on Sunday evening after a meeting at the army headquarters.
The statement added: “The army remains committed to its role of ensuring the security of the state.”
The escalating violence has fostered concern about military intervention, which has been pushing more frequently in the past.
The protests led by opposition politician Imran Khan and preacher Tahirul Qadri have been ongoing since Independence Day on August 14.
Sharif refuses to resign.
Khan and Qadri had called on their supporters on Sunday to persevere.
"We will not go back without forcing Sharif to resign," Khan said.
Qadri said the same thing.
Khan accuses Sharif of winning last May’s parliamentary elections by fraud.
Qadri calls for the resignation of the central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government should reform the electoral system and call for new elections.
More than 40,000 security forces are deployed to protect the government district.
The demonstrators had initially held out peacefully in front of parliament until Khan and Qadri called on them to penetrate Sharif’s residence on the weekend.
Hütteldorfer finished third in the table after his second win of the season.
With the 2-0 over Grödig for Rapid took a bitter week on Sunday a conciliatory end.
"The victory is very liberating," said coach Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached an intermediate low with the out in the Europa League on Thursday.
"The success experience was incredibly important," confirmed captain and goalkeeper Steffen Hofmann, who advanced to third place with green-white.
Rapid has shown the right reaction to the disappointment against Helsinki with the second win of the season and goes into the international break with a successful experience.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said defender Thomas Schrammel, who set the course for victory with his magnificent leadership volley from the 16th corner in the 14th minute.
"I thought I was snatching all the frustration of Thursday and snuck it under the latte," the 26-year-old said, smiling.
When Schrammel met for the last time in a Bundesliga match on 13 November 2010, it was still for Ried.
The first championship goal in the Rapid-Dress will therefore remain in his special memory.
"For me, this is something very special, because I'm from the Rapid generation," Schrammel said.
Because of Mario Pavelic’s short-term cymbal injury, Schrammel moved from the left to the right defensive side and did his job very well there too.
He has enough experience that he can also exercise this position in the opposite direction.
He has earned the goal, he has already done some assists this year,” Barisic praised.
Team showing character Schrammel also delivered the flank to 2:0 by Hofmann after a good hour, which finally brought the decision.
Before that, the guests could have written.
"Thank God we were a bit lucky today," said Schrammel, referring to the discrepancy between performance and result over the past few weeks: "The results were not right, but the playfulness was always good compared to last year."
Barisic even found that they had been "better than today in many games before" - against "the strongest team that has played in this stadium this season."
The first three points since July 26 have therefore proved that the team structure is intact despite the setbacks: "Today my team has shown that it has character."
It’s no less enjoyable for him: “That we finally played to zero again.”
Also the fact that Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger made several losses and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger made their start-elf debuts makes the victory even more valuable.
"One must not forget that," Barisic, who lost in the last three days with Behrendt and Pavelic players, "who have been very stable lately."
The international break must therefore be used to "lick wounds and gain a bit in the physical field," Barisic, who has five U21 selection players in his ranks, explained.
One of the people who is particularly interested in the break is Captain Hofmann.
He breaks up for the team, goes over pain.
In this difficult phase, he has shown that he is a very important player for us," Barisic said.
Hofmann not only gave Rapids the structure to the game before his replacement in the 68th minute, but also scored the second goal.
For the 33-year-old, who completed his 350th Bundesliga game, it was the first goal out of the game since November 2, 2013 (4-2 over the Admira).
Hofmann: "Don't believe that everything is fine now" "We certainly had a bit of luck, but at some point the luck has to come back to us as well.
Now it was high time,” Hofmann said.
However, he warned of concentrated further work: "You can't always see this in black and white.
We have not played as badly in the last few weeks as this has been depicted.
But we must also not believe that everything is fine now.
He could not deny the importance of his role for the team.
It’s a very young team that I can help very much at the moment.
“They’re going to come to me at some point,” said Hofmann.
Grödig coach Michael Baur had little to reproach himself and his team.
He regretted the quick head-to-head "out of the category Magic Gate", as well as the regular goal of Nutz in the 40th minute, which had been wrongly dismissed by referee Kollegger.
The only accusation I can make to the team is that we were not concrete enough towards goal in some stages.
We did not have enough degrees.
Center defender Maximilian Karner saw it similarly: "It just started badly, but then we found clean and even scored a goal.
On the whole, there would have been more in it.
Underneath this top there is peace
We showed a powerful tribe in our puzzle task of the summer series "Mein Stück vom Rhöner Glück" last Friday.
Several of these tree giants still exist in the district, the pictured specimen is the "Geissruheiche" above Unterweißenbrunn.
A bumpy footpath leads up to the approximately 600-year-old oak.
It passes couples, basalt stone piles and basalt stone seas.
A little below the quarry from Bauersberg, a kilometer north of the road to Weisbach, there it stands.
Vital looks the natural monument, it protrudes beyond the other trees of the surrounding area and with a circumference of more than eight meters resembles an American sequoia tree.
A little Buddha on a tree stump suggests that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
However, despite intensive research, there were only indications of the origin of the name.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider consulted the Bischofsheim Archive and interviewed elderly people from Unterweißenbrunn to find out about the familiarity of the Geissruhe.
The result of his research remained the rather sober explanation for the name.
According to this, until about 80 years ago, the goat herders were supposed to have driven their animals from Unterweißenbrunn to the laboriously cleared and freed from stones.
At the foot of the tree, the shepherds, exhausted by the ascent, are said to have rested.
In the meantime, the area has regained its importance, because the meadows actually pasture goat herds again.
The area has also been declared the core zone of the biosphere reserve, Schneider has further discovered.
When entering the stone collections, however, caution should be exercised, because the basalt warmed up by the sun is also a popular place for crusaders.
A hiking trail leads from Unterweißenbrunn to the tree, which is a bit hidden.
Further paths are signposted, ascending in the direction of Hochrhön and inviting you to an extended hike.
Where is the water castle?
However, a water castle, which is sought in our next task, is rather rare to find in the height.
The reflection in the trench already gives a good impression of the building, but we have some historical buildings in the county to which the building might fit.

After weeks of tug-of-war, Italy’s prime minister and current EU chairman, Matteo Renzi, pushed against strong conservative resistance at the EU Special Summit last week by nominating his foreign minister Federica Mogherini as head of EU foreign policy, she will succeed Britain’s Catherine Ashton.
Renzi considers, as the pro-government daily La Repubblica reports, the appointment of his Mogherini, who is also a favourite in the government team, as a strengthening of the position of the Social Democrats and his own in the EU.
He also expects a boost for his "reform package" in Italy.
Last but not least, Renzi hopes to calm down the left-wing party base that is constantly opposing him, because Mogherini is assigned to it - albeit in a rather moderate way.
To the conservative representatives with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and the nominated Poland as President of the Council, Donald Tusk will be, according to the predominant opinion in Rome, thus establishing a political balance.
At the same time, the EU’s chief diplomat will be the vice-president of the European Commission, Juncker.
The European Parliament’s still-to-be-received approval is deemed to be secure.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have called the nomination of the 41-year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) an "important recognition" of Italy's role in the EU.
La Repubblica is spreading optimism that Mogherini, who has been proven in leading party offices for almost two decades and is known for her ambition, will be able to meet the "enormous challenges".
The native Roman woman is married and has two daughters.
Her political career began in 1996 in the youth organization of the then Democratici di Sinistra (Left Democrats), which merged with the Catholic Center Party Margherita in 2008 to form the present-day Social Democratic PD.
In 1999, Mogherini became vice-president of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth for three years.
With the election in 2001 to the Left Democrats Party Council, she entered the high party politics, worked in the Foreign Policy Department, whose leader she soon became.
It occupied traditional focuses of Italian foreign policy such as the Middle East, became known through studies on NATO deployment in Afghanistan, in which Italy is involved with a troop contingent, maintained contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and with the Democrats in the United States.
Since 2008, she has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies, where she is an expert on defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became Prime Minister in February 2014, he appointed Mogherini as his foreign minister.
If the PD today has a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country, which contributed to the party's over 40 percent votes in the EU elections in May, then, as noted in PD circles, Federica Mogherini has a share of it.
The statements in Brussels that the new EU foreign minister has too little diplomatic experience, so lack of substance, are countered in the PD.
In Brussels, especially from Poland and the Baltic members, Mogherini’s suspiciously realistic accents on the crisis in Ukraine are being pursued and defamed as a “Russian-friendly course”.
It is in favour of the South Stream pipeline operated by the Russian company Gasprom, through which Russian natural gas is to be transported directly to southern Europe bypassing Ukraine, which also serves Italy’s energy security.
After Renzi took office as EU president in July, Mogherini travelled to Moscow for her first state visit.
Photos she showed with Putin at the shake-hands were taken with indignation in Brussels, as well as inviting the Kremlin chief to a Milan economic summit for October.
A total of nine young people started their training at emz-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
Among them is an apprentice who has already completed another training in the company.
In the future, the new employees will work in four training professions: electronics engineer (three apprentices), mechatronics engineer (two), tool mechanic (two) and process mechanic (two).
All trainees come from the district of Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas Bücherl from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer from Neunburg vorm Wald, Felix Domoier from Oberviechtach, Daniel Sorgenfrei and Sebastian Zahner from Pfreimd as well as Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new apprentices previously attended primary and secondary schools and secondary schools.
From Wednesday to Friday, trainees of all ages as well as the instructors go to a team-building event in Oberammergau, where, among other things, a full-day hike and rafting at the inn are on the program.
The company has 435 employees throughout Germany and 950 worldwide.
The number of apprentices across all years is 27.
The Socialists in France should "shut up and put France in order," said François Hollande's main ally.
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided left to show “her love” for the controversial socialist president, whose cabinet reorganization has met with disapproval among the vast majority of French.
The President deserves everyone’s respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stay by his side," he said with great applause.
As a reassuring gesture, the prime minister insisted that his government would not question the controversial 35-hour week in France despite fierce demands for a loosening of the regime on the part of Emmanuel Macron, the new economic minister.
On Saturday, Mr. Hollande urged his fellow Socialists to show themselves “unified” with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Minister of Justice, sprinkled sand into the gear, performing at a meeting of apostate socialist MPs and criticizing the Socialist Party for taking the French "belief in their future".
Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, mocked the Socialists’ ongoing trench fights, saying she couldn’t imagine the new Valls government going to last longer than a few months.
François Hollande is the emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls also has none, they are forced to form a new government if the old one has not even survived a summer.
“And the new one won’t survive the fall or winter either,” Le Pen told supporters.
She reiterated her party’s call for a dissolution of parliament and said she was confident to emerge as a winner in early elections and was ready for the government.
The ruling party of France suffered a defeat in the local elections in March and the right-wing National Front was ahead in the EU elections in May.
A survey in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche found that 76 percent of French people believe that the Socialist Party is at risk of disintegrating into several rival factions before the end of Hollande’s term in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government did not achieve an improvement in the economy and record unemployment figures.
"There's a small window of opportunity, but public opinion needs to quickly feel that things are changing," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could continue to deteriorate.
Norwegian Cruise is about to make a $3 billion deal with Prestige Cruises
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world’s third-largest cruise liner, is conducting advanced negotiations to acquire its competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for about $3 billion, according to industry experts.
A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a $6.8 billion market value company, access to Prestige Cruises’ luxury cruise ships and its wealthy customers, while competing with major rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could be announced as early as this week, the sources said on Sunday, warning that the talks could also end without results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns a 20 percent stake in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain anonymous, as the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while a spokesperson for Apollo declined to comment.
The Miami-based company Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenues were $2.57 billion in 2013, an increase of 13 percent compared to 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates under the brand names Oceania and Regent, which jointly operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenue for 2013 of $1.2 billion, an increase of 6 percent compared to the previous year.
The cruise industry totals around $29 billion and is expected to grow in the coming years due to the strengthening of the middle class in emerging markets such as China and India.
The companies are trying to position themselves as the best choice among cruise providers for these new customers.
Prestige Cruises filed for IPO with U.S. regulators in January 2014.
Apollo has been the majority shareholder of the company since a $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was formed in its current form in 2000 through a merger with a cruise liner owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a leisure and casino mixing company under the control of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise went public in January 2013.
Genting held 28 percent of the shares at the end of June, Apollo 20 percent of the shares and the private equity company TPG Capital LP an 8 percent stake in the company, according to licensing authorities.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruises jointly hold more than 82 percent of passenger capacity on American cruise ships, according to the original application documents for the IPO of Prestige Cruises.
Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China the day after the election.
A peking-faith group waved the Chinese flag nearby.
The Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress passed a framework law on Sunday that only allows two or three candidates to run for leadership in Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first obtain the majority support of a nomination committee, which is expected to be staffed with Peking-faithful members.
This decision makes it almost impossible for opposition Democrats to be allowed to vote and prompted pro-democracy activists to live up to their threat and paralyze Hong Kong’s financial center with “Occupy Central” protests.
Political reforms have long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong; and China’s party leadership fears that calls for democracy may spread to other cities.
Following the publication of a Beijing White Paper depicting China’s supremacy over Hong Kong in June, democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on the electoral process in the Special Administrative Region, in which hundreds of thousands marched into the city’s business district and organized a sit-in.
Li’s interview is organized by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
The Deputy Chairman of the Standing Committee’s Legal Commission, Zhang Rongshun, and the Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macau Office of the State Council, Feng Wei, should be interviewed during the day.
Student activists announced that they would gather in the afternoon in front of the leadership office in Hong Kong.
Britain did not have any democratic elements until the final phase of the 150-year colonial government in Hong Kong.
Putin demands Kiev to start "state talks" with eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government cease fighting the separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the "statehood" of the renegade region.
His spokesman, Dimitri Peskov, later made it clear that Putin did not mean that the territory of eastern Ukraine under the control of the separatists would become part of Russia, but that his status vis-à-vis Ukraine would need to be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
Putin’s call to the Kiev government to negotiate on an equal footing with the pro-Russian insurgents, however, fits with the strategy he has apparently pursued since the beginning of the riots five months ago: helping the separatists to seize territories and pressuring the Ukrainian government to enable the newly proclaimed region of Novorossia to achieve factual independence for an alliance with Russia rather than with the West.
In an interview with state television channel Kanal Eins, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to recapture the areas held by separatists in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were captured in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently referred to the occupied territory as "Novorossia" or "New Russia", a term reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary heyday of the Russian Empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who hope for soon-to-be peace talks during the campaigns of Ukrainian politicians for the elections on Oct. 26 and while government groups attack civilian communities in the areas held by separatists are "trapped in their illusions," Itar-Tass reported.
"We need to start detailed discussions immediately, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization of society and the status of the state of Southeastern Ukraine, in order to safeguard the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said Putin’s reference to statehood should be seen in the context of greater autonomy, which has been discussed by the Kiev leadership for months, in order to dispel fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the eastern territories the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.
It is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The Kremlin spokesman’s clarity on correcting the “misinterpretation” of Putin’s remarks underlined Russia’s claim to leadership in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the East as opposed to the direct annexation of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million residents are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far greater difficulties in annexing the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and pre-conflict polls showed a broad majority in favour of staying in Ukraine.
The autonomy addressed by Russian diplomats on international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations, giving the Kremlin de facto control over an area that connects the Russian territory with Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, which was annexed five months ago, is the home port for most of the Russian Navy, as well as an important trading port and historic coastal region.
In addition, the regions between the Rostov area in Russia and Crimea are rich in mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian military.
In his inaugural speech on 7 June, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko suggested that Ukrainian legislation, following new elections, should consider additions to the Constitution to give the respective territories greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
But his notion of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to that of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, whose arming and incitement Moscow is accused of.
Putin’s last call to Kiev to negotiate on an equal footing with the separatist leaders followed a further advance of the rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine via the previously peaceful region along the Azov Sea.
The Russian-backed separatists took control of Novoasovsk, which Ukrainian security officials fear is the first step of a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Crimea.
For this reason, massive civilian and military preparations have begun to fortify Mariupol, a steel industry port with 500,000 inhabitants, located between Novoasovsk and the narrow access to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels on Saturday and urged action to prevent another Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are nearing a point where there is no going back," Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not decide on any concrete actions, the leadership called for the draft of further sanctions against Russia, which should enter into force in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaysk after two Russian tank columns and 1,000 soldiers entered the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists, said Colonel Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council Reports on Saturday in Kiev.
The first allegedly 63 Ukrainian soldiers trapped by the Russian invasion of Ilovaysk were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko said on Sunday.
Nude photo scandal around Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten didn’t hesitate to get his anger out of hackers who presumably stole nude photos of his fiancée Gabi Grecko and a Who is Who of Hollywood’s A celebrities.
The film town is in a state of excitement after a series of unique photos of naked Jennifer Lawrence appeared on the internet in a hacking scandal surrounding celebrities.
The hacker has over 60 nude photos of Lawrence, star from "The Tribute of Panem" and superstars, including models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne also reportedly made private photos public due to an iCloud gap.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who got engaged to Grecko last month, told Confidential, “It’s disgusting.”
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
Grecko, currently in New York City, reportedly told a news website that the hack was “disgraceful” and that the victims “felt hurt.”
The hacker probably has 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots of her lying upstairs without a pool.
Palmer's film works include "Love Is Invincible" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and actress Browning from Sucker Punch were not available for comments on the hacked images yesterday.
A spokesperson for Lawrence' told TMZ, "It's a heinous violation of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen denounced the hacker in his tweet: "Posting hacked images from a mobile phone is nothing more than selling helterware."
From a purely legal point of view, the redistribution of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Cyclists, joggers and hikers were there yesterday at the 8th cycling on the Großer Feldberg and supported the association "Hilfe für Krebskranke Kinder".
The tour, which was a torture for some, was an easy training for others.
But everyone agreed on one thing: it was fun.
Thomas Studanski probably slept well last night.
For the first time in his life, the head of the Oberurseler brewery rode his bike onto the Feldberg.
For a good cause.
He can easily put away the small muscle pain, especially since the participation in the 8th cycling on the Großer Feldberg in favour of the association "Hilfe für Krebskranke Kinder" (Frankfurt) also brought him personally a valuable knowledge.
That's a great thing.
"I know now that I can do that - fine!"
A little pampering on the way in the applause curve?
No, if I had stopped once, it would have been out...
Like Thomas Studanski, who sits for the CDU in the Oberurseler Stadtparlament, many of the 718 participants tortured themselves to the mountains yesterday in the early dew and came close to exhaustion, but happily on the plateau.
Others, on the other hand, found it easier to overcome the 11-kilometer stretch between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Dießner, for example.
The all-in-red Green politician from the Kreistag - red dress, red bike - did something on understatement at the start ("Every lot of professionals, there is arriving the goal!"), but then turned out to be half-professional on the mountain and went through the goal after 45 minutes without breathlessness.
He too went through the track in a slide, as did Nina Kuhn, press spokeswoman of the city of Oberursel, who had set out on the road together with Frank Grüneisen.
For the two triathletes, the "Feldberg-Raddeln" was not necessarily a sporting challenge: "This is about charity, we are happy to be there - we would have made an exit today anyway," says Kuhn.
On the way they had met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) had gone down to Oberursel in the morning to step back on the hill immediately afterwards.
The Frankfurter Florian Zierz had swung himself in the saddle at 9 o'clock in the morning at home, "made" the Feldberg twice, then rolled home with fun.
I also had fun with Fritten-Toni.
For the head of the Oberurseler cult kiosk, cycling across the Feldberg is simply one of them.
He had aimed for 40 minutes with his 6.5-kilo race bike.
It's a crazy event.
For this purpose - I'm happy to be there," said Andreas Balzke.
The well-trained Mainzer says of himself that he is an "ambitious road cyclist".
He has to be, because he was on the "Fixie wheel", which are also racing bikes, but without a gearshift...
Not only the 20 hikers who climbed over the White Wall and the fox punch to the summit, but also a jogger who pulled a car tyre with weights behind him on a cord, proved that it was easy to get up even without a bike.
Bergwacht-Doctor Professor Volker Lischke, who with his team, equipped with all-wheel-drive bully and quad, ensured safety, said: "I know" Den from Frankfurt, who trains for a special sled trail, only that he stops the sled himself.
The 718 participants - and thus as many as never before - had been sent to the track in groups in the morning.
The hikers first at 9.30 am.
The first cyclists and runners followed at 10 a.m.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers started.
Bent Hansen, chairman of the association "Radeln auf dem Großen Feldberg", gave the starting commands and wished the participants a nice trip.
For next year, he hopes that it will be possible to block the route up to Feldberg for the safety of the participants.
