Politicians in Wales afraid to "look like fools"
Some members of the Welsh National Assembly were appalled by a proposal to change their title to MWPs (Members of the Welsh Parliament).
It has arisen as a result of plans to change the assembly's name to Welsh Parliament.
AMs from across the political spectrum are concerned that the name change could give rise to ridicule.
A Labour party member said his group was concerned because "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, twp means silly, and pwp means shit.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party said that the group as a whole "was not satisfied" and had proposed alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said his group was "open" to the name change, but noted that there is only a brief verbal leap from the MWP to the Muppet (fool).
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced in the same way as the letter u is pronounced in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting a bill introducing the name changes, said: "The final decision on names that MEPs will be given, of course, is up to the MEPs themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, with broad support for calling the Assembly a Welsh Parliament.
With regard to the title of the AMs, the Commission preferred Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs, but the MWP option received the greatest support in a public consultation.
AMs seemingly suggest alternative options, but the struggle to reach agreement may prove difficult for the president of the assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to put together a bill on the changes within a few weeks.
The bill on the reforms includes other changes in the way the Assembly works, including rules on the disqualification of AMs and the composition of the committee system.
The AMs will get the final vote on what they will be called when the bill is debated.
Macedonians vote to change country name
Voters will vote on Sunday to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The vote will be held in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour constitutes a claim on the territory of Greece and has long protested against Macedonia's attempts to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov is opposed to the vote and says he will deny the vote.
Supporters of the vote, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is just a price paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The clocks in St. Martin's will be quiet while the churches in Harlem are struggling
"The elderly people I've talked to said that in the old days there was a bar and a church on every corner," said Mr. Adams.
“Now there is none of them.”
He said it's understandable that the bars are disappearing.
“People are socializing in other ways these days,” he said.
“Bars are no longer the neighborhood’s living rooms, where people enter on a daily basis.”
In relation to churches, he worries that the money raised from selling assets will not last long and that they "become back where they started, sooner or later."
He adds that churches could be replaced by apartment complexes that are full of the kind of people who don’t help the neighborhood’s returning sanctuary.
“The overwhelming majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings are white,” he says, “and this further exaggerates developments where these churches eventually close completely because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into the condominiums will become members of the churches.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin’s a decade later.
The original Methodist church moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had worked nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black parish under the pastor John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of shops on 125th Street, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, which would not hire or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when Father Johnson's parishioners made plans to restore the building, they ordered the bell tower.
Priest David Johnson, father Johnson’s son and successor in St. Martin’s, proudly called the carillon “the bells of the poor.”
The expert, who played the carillon in June, called it something else: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carillon in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr Merriweather said that St. Martin's did not find a substitute for him.
What has taken place in St. Martin's over the past few months has been a complicated tale of architects and contractors, some of whom have been overtaken by church leaders, others by the diocese.
The Congregational Council – the parish’s leading body of leading laymen – wrote in July to the diocese about concerns that the diocese “would try to push the expenses forward” to the Congregational Council, even though the Congregational Council had not been involved in hiring the architects and contractors that the diocese sent in.
Some of the congregation members complained of lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old on diving trip after lobsters in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving for lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, officials said.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then paddling over to him with a group to help him out of the water.
Hammel says he thought it was just enthusiasm to have caught a lobster, but then he realized the boy was shouting, "I was bitten!
“I was bitten!”
"All his collarbone was torn up," said Hammel, when he came to the boy.
"I shouted that everyone should get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" added Hammel.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is reported to be in critical condition.
It is unclear which species of shark attacked.
Lifeguard Larry Giles said at a media briefing that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was not considered to be a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to his upper torso.
Officials closed access to the beach on the stretch from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for security reasons and to conduct investigations.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to take over beauty market in the UK
Sainsbury’s takes on the competition with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with ranks of beauty products with special assistants in the style of department stores.
As part of a major effort to seize the UK beauty market, which is worth <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and continues to grow as fashion and home products decline. The larger ranges of beauty products are being tested in 11 stores around the country and will be launched in several stores next year if they prove successful.
The investment in beauty products is taking place as supermarkets look for new products for shelves that were previously used for televisions, microwave ovens and home products.
Sainsbury’s says they are doubling their range of beauty products to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which are being introduced for the first time.
The existing ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also get more space with branded areas in the style of those seen in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching the range of boutique makeup, so the majority of products are suitable for vegans – something that is increasingly demanded by younger shoppers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop is testing stalls in two Sainsbury's stores. The first opened in Croydon in southern London last week, and the second opens in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and a trend towards buying small amounts of food daily at local grocery stores means that supermarkets need to do more to get people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that the stores will look like department stores as the supermarket chain takes up the fight with discount chains Aldi and Lidl by introducing more non-food services and goods.
Sainsbury's has introduced Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of Habitat outlets since they bought both chains two years ago. These actions have strengthened their grocery sales and have made their acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket’s previous attempts to update its beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 00's, but the collaboration ended in a dispute over how to distribute the earnings from supermarket pharmacies.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s sold its pharmacy chain with 281 stores to Celesio, who owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 three years ago.
According to the strategy, Lloyds will play a role in the plan by adding an additional range of luxury skincare brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s commercial director, said: “We have changed the look and decor of our ranges of beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to advise.
Our range of brands is designed to suit all needs and the engaging environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a compelling destination that challenges the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones 'furious' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from deal to <0xC2><0xA3>11 million
Dragons' Den star Peter Jones left "furious", after television host Holly Willoughby withdraws from deal at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn’t have time for their home product and accessories brand Truly.
The company had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
This Morning host, 37, went on Instagram to announce that she is leaving the project.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' Den star Peter Jones furious after she retires from their lucrative lifestyle brand at the last minute - to focus on her own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was “furious” when the popular TV woman during a tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, said her new deals—valuing up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million—meaned she no longer had enough time for their home product and accessories brand Truly.
The company had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was tipped to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
Willoughby, 37, went on Instagram to announce that she was leaving Truly while Jones flew out of the UK to one of her vacation rentals.
A source said: "Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
It should have been a long-term project that she had to deal with over the next few decades.
Her decision to resign surprised everyone involved.
No one would believe what happened Tuesday, it was so close to launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods at the headquarters in Marlow, which is already ready for sale."
Experts estimate that leaving This Morning host, one of the UK’s highest earnings stars, could cost the company millions due to large investments in products – ranging from cushions to candles to clothing and home products – and the potential for further delays in launch.
It can also be the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have had a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, took office as Chairman of the Board in March.
The two couples go on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of the shares in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will be the brand ambassador for M&S, replacing Ant McPartlin on ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We couldn't comment on his business action."
Hard talk, "and then we fell in love"
He laughed at the criticism he would receive from the news media for making a comment that "is not worthy of a president" and for being so positive with the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in his parody of a news host.
“I gave up nothing.”
He noted that Kim is interested in another meeting after Trump proclaimed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
Negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a "similar response" from the United States to North Korea's initial action against disarmament.
He noted that the United States instead continues with sanctions aimed at keeping the pressure running.
Trump took a more optimistic view at his election meeting.
"North Korea is doing very well," he said.
“There was a war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have been killed.
Now we have a wonderful relationship.”
He said his attempts to improve relations with Kim had produced positive results – the completion of rocket tests, assistance with the release of hostages and the return of the remains of U.S. militarymen.
And he defended his unusual approach to Kim.
“It’s so easy to behave stately, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we’d have around 200 people standing there,” Trump said, pointing to the group right in front of him.
Indonesian tsunami and earthquake ravage island and kill hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, NGOs were told that they were not needed.
Although over 10 percent of the population of Lombok was homeless, no national state of emergency was declared, which is a prerequisite for the call for international relief.
"In many cases, it has unfortunately been clear that they are not requesting international assistance, so it is a bit challenging," Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain whether foreign employees can work in the field.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Response Service, said that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organisations would be allowed to contribute to the relief efforts.
Because of the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly exposed to, the country is very poorly prepared for natural disasters.
Tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, but they are not a common sight on other coastlines.
A warning was issued in Palu, but apparently a tsunami siren is missing, and this has likely affected the death toll.
Even under the best conditions, it is challenging to travel between Indonesia’s many islands.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that has been in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new site of the accident.
President Joko Widodo made Indonesia's lack of infrastructure a central point in his election campaign, and he has spent a lot of money on roads and train routes.
But Mr Joko's administration has been plagued by a lack of funding in line with the election campaign next year.
Mr Joko is also experiencing pressure from underlying sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of belief.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands removed from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, bow and arrows and other primitive weapons.
Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge plays Chelsea at the last minute
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in the Premier League to Chelsea by scoring in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri just 30 yards from Chelsea's goal, while his team was behind with 1-0.
He pointed to the ball with his left foot before making a high shot at the farthest pole.
The ball flew high above the field to the top right corner of the net.
The ball dropped over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"It was just about getting in that position, getting the ball. Players like Shaq are always trying to get as far forward as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and I made a single touch. I didn't think so much about it and just took the shot."
Chelsea led 1-0 at halftime, after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
Chelsea attacker handed back the heel to Mateo Kovacic before speeding up the midfield and sprinting into Liverpool's half of the field.
Kovacic made a quick one-two in the midfield.
He then made a long pass that led Hazard into the field.
Hazard ran from the defense and finished to the farthest pole with a left-footed shot past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Naples in the Champions League group stage at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. Thursday in London.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster preparedness announces early Sunday.
Many were reported trapped in the rubble from buildings that fell after the earthquake, which measured 7.5 on the Richter scale, hit Friday and created waves up to 6 meters high, spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has over 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with rubble from collapsed buildings.

Parliament's statue of Cromwell becomes the latest memorial to be hit by discussion of "rewriting history"
The removal would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "madness" and an "attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the palace at Westminster would become a target.
The image storm during the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell is being sacrificed for his forefather Thomas's actions in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's stunning depiction of Cromwell is a testimony to 19th-century attitudes and part of the historiography of a figure that many still believe is worth paying tribute.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against outside pressure, in his case pressure from the monarchy.
Whether it is an accurate depiction is subject to ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is one recognizable figure representing one side of the struggle.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of tribute and commemoration."
Chinese farmer attacks and kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only under his surname “Yuan”, was found dead with an overrun artery and smeared in blood near a pigsty market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to give pigs vaccine injections at a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He had reportedly traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, the cousin found him dead and discovered that a door to the pig store next door was open.
He said that in the pigsty there was a big swine with blood in its mouth.
A forensic study confirmed that the 250 kg pig had bitten the farmer to death, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and injured,” said the cousin, who goes by the surname “Wu,” in a quote from the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed that Yuan entered the market at 4:40 p.m. Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market leader told Evening News that the pig had been locked away to prevent it from attacking others while police were collecting evidence at the scene.
It is reported that Yuan's family and authorities from the market are negotiating compensation for his death.
It is rare, but there have been previously recorded cases of pigs attacking humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing 295 kg was thrust by a Welsh farmer against his tractor, until his wife scared the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a “trigger.”
"They're just playful.
They nap, they're very curious... they're not going to hurt you.
You just have to treat them with respect,” he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa are expected to cause heavy rain in much of the southwestern United States.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa will weaken as it moves across the cooler waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
However, Rosa will provide heavy rains with flooding in northern Mexico and southwestern United States over the coming days.
Rosa had winds of 38 m/s, a Category 1 hurricane, at 10 a.m. Sunday (Danish time) and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
As Rosa approaches the peninsula of Baja California on Monday as a tropical storm, it begins to push tropical moisture to the north into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will give up to 254 mm of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Subsequently, the tropical moisture will interact with the approaching low-pressure ejector, creating heavy rainfall in the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Locally, 25 to 101 mm of rain will create dangerous storm surges, liquid fallout and possibly landslides in the desert.
Tropical humidity will cause rainfall of up to 51 to 76 mm per hour locally, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 51 to 101 mm of rain is expected in parts of the southwestern United States, especially over much of Arizona.
There is a high probability of storm surges with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of the tropical rains.
It would be a very bad idea to move out into the desert on foot when there is a risk of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into roaring rivers and thunderstorms will create powerful local winds and create dust blows.
The approaching low-pressure outlet will provide heavy rain along the coast in parts of southern California.
There is a risk of a total rainfall of more than 13 mm, which can result in smaller amounts of liquid precipitation and slippery roads.
This would be the region’s first rainfall in its rainy season.
Spreading tropical rains will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday and spread more late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners area on Tuesday and continues on Wednesday.
In October, there may be large temperature fluctuations throughout the United States as the Arctic gets cooler, but it remains fairly warm in the tropics.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences across the central United States on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 11 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to experience a warm start in October with temperatures above 26 degrees Celsius from the southern plains to parts of the northeastern regions.
There could be up to 26 degrees in New York City on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long climate outlook indicates that there is a high probability of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million watched the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
Over 20 million saw Thursday’s gripping testimony from the nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, and the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly taking place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television stations.
At the same time, the political struggle continued with stations that interrupted the regular programs to tell about Friday's late development: an agreement made up of Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, who allowed the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she is 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh, intoxicated, grumbled at her and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in an emotional testimony that he is 100 percent sure it didn’t happen.
According to Nielsen, it is likely that 20.4 million people saw it on Friday.
The company counted average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were no immediately available viewing numbers from other stations that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble measuring how many people watch programs in offices.
To put it in perspective, it’s a viewership figure similar to a game during the NFL playoffs or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion-sponsored hosts have strongly backed the appointment of Kavanaugh, was at the top of all stations with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the all-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican’s office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught for open CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning while protesters shouted at him as he tried to take an elevator to the hearing in the Judicial Committee.
He stood with a downward glance for several minutes while being slandered, and CNN broadcast live.
"I'm right here in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
He was told, "You have so much power, and so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and said before the elevator closed, he would have more to say at the hearing in the committee.
All the TV stations covered live a few hours later, when the Judicial Committee was to vote on whether Kavanaugh's nomination should proceed to a vote for the entire Senate.
But Flake said he would only vote in favour, believing that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee in the following week, which the Democrats, who are outnumbered in the Senate, had demanded.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and a number of senators subsequently, Flake made his decision.
Flake's election was influential because it was clear that Republicans would not have votes to approve Kavanaugh without the inquiry.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
UK prime minister accuses critics of 'playing politics' with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the EU of "playing politics" with Britain's future and undermining national interests.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview alongside that with Theresa May on the front page of the paper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson made his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying a proposal for Britain and the EU to collect each other’s tariffs was “completely ridiculous.”
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected of being behind LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect for the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and imprisoned on suspicion of negligent manslaughter, Baton Rouge police said.
Officials released video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the match.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on, CBS subsidiary WAFB reported.
After interrogating Simpson, the police said he had confessed to the shooting on Wayde.
His bail is set at $350,000, the lawyer reports.
The forensic surgeon in East Baton Rouge Parish issued a preliminary report Friday stating that the cause of death was a wound from a gunshot that went from head to neck.
The police department says a task force from the Louisiana State Police, the state police lab, Southern University police and residents of the area have assisted with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked police in the area for their "care and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 198 cm tall forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team is "broken" and "in shock" over Wayde's death.
"That's the kind of thing you're always afraid of," Wade said.
Volcano spits ashes over Mexico City
Ash, vomited from the Popocatepetl volcano, has reached the southern districts of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity occurred in the crater, and 183 spills of gas and ash were recorded within 24 hours.
The center monitored the rumblings and shaking over several laps.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on car windows in Mexico City neighborhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed increased activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, since an earthquake measuring 7.1 on the Richter scale rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of jubilee vote for independence
Six were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after protesters seeking independence clashed with rioters as several thousand took part in rival demonstrations marking the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists held back rioters, threw with and powder paint, and created dark dust clouds on streets that would normally be full of tourists.
Fights also arose later in the day, when police used their spells to keep the fighting down.
For several hours, independence groups shouted "Nothing forgotten, nothing forgiven" and were met with unionist protesters shouting "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries that occurred during the protests, the local press reported.
The mood remains tense in the independence-minded region a year after the vote on 1 October, which was declared illegal from Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Voters overwhelmingly voted for independence, but voter turnout was low, and those opposed to secession largely boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the holding of the vote during violent clashes at voting sites across the region.
Independence groups had camped the night of Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration was held, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer dares to hope that Catalonia can achieve independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for the joy of being given the opportunity to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Although they won a narrow but important victory in the regional elections in December last year, the Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum, and many of their best-known leaders have either themselves moved into exile or are in detention awaiting sentence for their role in holding the vote and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, recorded the protests on his phone in support of the police and said the conflict was created by politicians on both sides.
“There will be more and more tension,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who has been awaiting his trial since last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament elections next year.
"The nomination as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to distance ourselves from the setback in democratic values and the subjugation we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Man arrested after house hit by car
Three men of 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a car crashed into a house in Londonderry several times.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent Thursday around 19.30 BST.
Police Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building had been damaged.
A crossbow may also have been fired at the car at some point.
Menga shot gives Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secures victory
Livingston surprised the Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard his only second defeat after 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's shot made the difference when Gary Holt's team moved up side by side with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team hasn't won away in the league this season and will face the leading team Hearts, which they are eight points behind, next Sunday.
The Rangers will be attending Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, in turn, expands their undefeated streak to six games, and head coach Holt has still not had a defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses chances for cash stakes
Holt's team should have been in front of long before they scored, and their direct playing style created big problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but passed across in front of the goal, after which Alan Lithgow inevitably hit outside the goal after he slipped in to hit Craig Halkett's crossing header in front of the goal.
The home team was happy to let the Rangers play in front of them because they knew they could cause problems for the away team in deadball situations.
And it was under these circumstances that the important goal came.
Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to create Menga, who made a touch and scored from the middle of the field.
At the time, the Rangers had dominated possession but struggled to get through the home team's defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly challenged.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman's shot was averted with the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow shot outside the frame during another of Livingston's deadball situations.
There were regular passes into Livingston's field, but were averted, and two penalty claims – after Halkett's tackle on substitute Glenn Middleton and one handed on the ball – were rejected.
"Phänomenal" from Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal effort and strong result for Livingston.
Everyone played fantastically and exceeded the expectations of their upward journey.
Their playing style and squad have remained largely unchanged since their return to the best league, but much of the credit must go to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since he joined.
There were many heroes.
Captain Halkett was fantastic and led a well-organized defense, and Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes throughout the match.
The Rangers were lacking in inspiration.
They have sometimes been really good under Gerrard, but they played below level.
Their endings lacked sharpness—only once they were exposed to the home team—and it’s a steep awakening for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the scoreboard.
Erdogan gets mixed reception in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday (September 29), when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations with the two NATO members.
Disagreements have arisen in areas such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's rapprochement with the European Union.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new large mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
For security reasons, police held a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but plenty of supporters showed up nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan opponents – many of them Kurdish – also took note and condemned both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to accept the country.
The competing protests reflect a controversial guest who is seen as a hero by some German Turks and mocked as an autocrat by others.
Accident on the road in Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist died in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southwestern part of the city around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and there were rescuers at the scene, but the man died at the scene.
The accident occurred a few months after another cyclist died in a collision with a car whose driver fled the scene, on Childers Street, about 1 mile (1.6 km) from Saturday's accident.
The Metropolitan Police said police officers were working on identifying the man and informing his relatives.
Road blockages have been set up, bus routes have been rescheduled, and motorists are encouraged to stay out of the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Police Officers Injured During Riot
Six prison officials have been injured during riots in a high-security prison, according to the Prison Office.
There were riots at the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 9.30 BST on Sunday, and the riots are still going on.
Specialized "Tornado" officers are brought in to deal with the riots, involving eight inmates and taking place in one wing of the prison.
The officers were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A Prison Service spokesperson said: "Specially trained prison employees are detained to deal with the ongoing riots at HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and are clarified that those responsible will be reported to the police and may end up spending longer time behind bars.”
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison inspector was being treated in the hospital after being attacked by an inmate.
And in October last year, riot officers were summoned to the prison to deal with serious riots, where employees were attacked with billiard bullets.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with storm surges (dry areas may benefit)
It is rare that a tropical depression hits Arizona, but it is most likely to happen at the beginning of next week, when the remnants of Hurricane Rosa move across the desert landscape of the southwestern United States, creating a risk of storm surge.
The National Weather Service has already issued storm surge warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix on Tuesday with arrival late Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that only "ten tropical cyclones had retained tropical storm or low pressure status within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 60 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 51 to 102 mm of rain with isolated amounts up to 152 mm in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other areas in the southwestern desert landscape, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to gain 25 to 51 mm with the option of 102 mm locally.
For those outside the risk of storm surge, Rosa’s rain can be a blessing because the region is hit by drought.
Flooding is a very serious matter, but it is likely that some of the rain will be useful because the southwestern United States is currently experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. drought monitoring, just over 40 percent of Arizona experiences the least extreme drought, the second-highest category," reports weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa is expected to hit land on the peninsula of Baja California in Mexico.
Rosa still has hurricane force on Sunday morning with maximum wind speed of 38 m/s and is located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moves north at 19 km/h.
The storm encounters cooler waters in the Pacific and therefore falls in strength.
It is therefore expected to hit Mexico with tropical current on Monday afternoon or evening.
The rain over parts of Mexico can become heavy and pose a high risk of flooding.
"Precipitation is expected to total 76 to 152 mm from Baja California to northwestern Sonora with the possibility of up to 254 mm," reported weather.com.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then move up through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The primary expected danger from Rosa or the remains of it is very heavy rain in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the U.S. southwestern desert area," the National Hurricane Center reported.
The rain is expected to create life-threatening storm surges and liquid precipitation in deserts as well as landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 4 a.m. BST Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital where his condition is reported to be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, police in Avon and Somerset said.
Officers have called on anyone who may have mobile recordings of the incidents to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh succumbed to the Democratic Party's "evil and anger"
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the Democratic Party's reckless and monstrous tactics," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has been exposed to "the evil, the anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying allegations by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on his charges.
The president said on Saturday that the “American people saw the skill, quality and courage” of Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote for confirmation by Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that confirms one of the most capable legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a fantastic past in public service," he told a group of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to the nomination of Kavanaugh, while speaking of the importance of Republicans appearing in the polls in the midterm elections.
"In five weeks, one of the most important choices in our lifetime will be.
You can't vote for me, but you're actually voting for me," he said.
"That's why I'm traveling around fighting for great candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats are out on a mission to “contend and block.”
The first major procedural vote in the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place no later than Friday, a high-ranking person in the Republican party has told CNN.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, death toll increases
At least 384 were killed, and many of them were washed away by huge waves that hit the beach when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu on Friday, when up to six-metre-high waves hit the coast at dusk, sucking many to death and ruining everything on their way.
The tsunami occurred after an earthquake that measured 7.5 on the Richter scale.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still engaged in activities on the beach. They did not run immediately and became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster response BNPB, said during a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it dragged cars, tree trunks, houses, it hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved through the open sea at 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
More people managed to survive by climbing trees to escape the tsunami, he said.
About 16,700 were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Disaster preparedness has published aerial photographs showing many destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Afterwards, the coastal town continued to shake on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes could be felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s Board for Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released during Friday’s major earthquake was about 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city is geographically located at the end of a long, narrow bay, and it may have made the tsunami bigger, the board said.
Nugroho described the damage as “extensive” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of a number of victims were found stuck under the rubble from collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 had been injured and that 29 are reported missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could be greater along the 300 km long coastline north of Palu, the Donggala area closer to the earthquake’s epicenter.
Communication "was completely paralyzed without information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
“There are over 300,000 living here,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its employees and volunteers are heading for the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could get much worse," they said.
The board was criticized on Saturday from many fronts for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, but officials said the waves had arrived within the time when the warning was issued.
In amateur footage shared on social media, you can hear a man on the top floor of a building desperately shouting warnings about the tsuami coming closer to people on the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the coast and carries buildings and cars away.
Reuters was unable to confirm the authenticity of the footage immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut off communications around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending cargo aircraft with emergency aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities report, but there is still a great need for food and basic necessities among the evacuated.
The city's airport has been reopened, but only for relief work, and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is expected to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami is over 800.
It's really bad.
World Vision employees from Donggala have arrived safely in Palu city, where employees seek shelter under tarpaulins set up in the courtyard by their account. They came by areas of extensive destruction on the way, Doseba said.
"They told me they had so many broken houses," he said.
It's really bad.
Even when relief organizations began the hard work of putting relief back on track, complaints came that foreign relief workers with extensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
Under Indonesian law, financial aid, supplies and staff from abroad may only enter if the area where the accident occurred is declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says 'OK, it's a national disaster,' we can open for international assistance, but there is no status yet."
On the second night in Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of the missing people held on in the hope that their loved ones would become the miracles that illuminate the gloomy tales of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled up by a sewer.
On Saturday, rescue workers released a woman who had been trapped under rubble for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding national team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others who were caught at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Monday, were among his students.
“As a paragliding veteran, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon told how, in the hours following the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel circulating in paragliding circles, he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the participants in Palu, who were in the festival on the beach.
His messages, however, resulted in only one grey check mark instead of two blue.
“I think that means the messages weren’t delivered,” he says.
Thieves take $26,750 while filling ATM in Newport on the Levee
Twenty stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who was meeting an ATM in Newport on the Levee on Friday morning, according to a Newport police press release.
The driver of the car had emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, another man ran "behind the Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money that should have been delivered.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, according to the press release, but police did not specify how many were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about the thieves' identity should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The Rapper Changes His Name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West has changed his name to Ye.
He announced the change on Saturday on Twitter, where he wrote: "The creature formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for a while and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change takes place prior to his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show, who cancelled for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
The name is an abbreviation of his current artist name, but West has previously said that the name has religious significance for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year, discussing his album title with radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye – which is a reflection of our good, bad and confused sides, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of a number of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has switched between Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
One of West's former collaborators, JAY-Z, has also switched between lowercase and uppercase letters and changed whether the hyphen is included.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use military force against civilians
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation campaign against students.
Lopez Obrador pledged Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he "never would ever use the military to oppress the Mexican people."
Troops shot at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 at a time when left-wing student movements took root in many parts of Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly government grants to students and opening more free, open universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities draw young people into criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its funding for artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in the field, said investor and AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after various parts of the U.S. government have issued statements on artificial intelligence. However, the U.S. still lacks a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
China, however, introduced their plan last year and aims to take first place in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
“It would be a good idea to double the research budget for artificial intelligence, as all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we’re looking for the next big breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
Doubling the budget could double the chances of the next big achievement in artificial intelligence being achieved in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee published the book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” this month at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt and is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that beat the highest-rated American Othello player, and later became head of Microsoft Research and director of Google's department in China.
Lee recognized previous technology competitions backed by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge, held by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when a new competition would appear so that the next visionaries could be identified.
Scientists in the United States often have to work hard to obtain grants from the government, Lee says.
“It’s not China that grabs the academic leaders, it’s the big companies,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired star students from universities to work with artificial intelligence.
Lee said changes in immigration policies could also help the United States strengthen its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I think that PhDs in artificial intelligence should automatically be offered work permits.
The Government of China issued its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions in a way similar to the National Science Foundation and other state organizations’ distribution of money to American researchers, but the quality of the academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint center for artificial intelligence involving partners from industry and research, and the White House announced the foundation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
NSF is currently investing over $100 million a year in research into artificial intelligence.
However, U.S. legislation trying to establish a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has been standing still for months.
Macedonians vote to change country name
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday whether to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's attempts to gain membership of the EU and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and maintains that the name of their neighbouring country to the north constitutes a claim on Greek territory, and has therefore used their veto right when Macedonia has sought accession to NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's primarily Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not take part in the vote, and a boycott campaign has raised doubts as to whether the voter turnout will be the 50 % required for the vote to be valid.
The question on the ballot was: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that it is a price worth paying to provide access to associations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged as a result of the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote on the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the EU, because that means more safe lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
The vote is not legally binding, but enough Members of Parliament have said that they will comply with the vote and make it valid.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The National Election Commission said no irregularities were reported at 1 p.m.
But the turnout was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, where 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I voted today because of my children. We belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, an elector in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko took part in the vote in Macedonia on a change of name, which would open up membership of NATO and the EU, in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small scene and pulled up chairs in front of tents set up by those who would boycott the vote.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we will achieve membership with the forehead raised, not by the back door," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of European-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership would provide a much-needed investment in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I think a large majority will vote in favour because over 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He said a "yes" result would be a "security of our future".
A poll released last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research indicated that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would vote – fewer than the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by the Macedonian television channel Telma TV indicated that 57 percent of the respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
In order for the vote to be valid, the turnout must be at least 50 per cent plus one vote.
If the vote fails, it will be the first major political loss for the Provencal government since it took office in May last year.
See: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero fights his way through Brighton defense and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defended Brighton in Manchester City's 2-0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy with his scoring that came after 65 minutes.
The Argentine attacker received a pass in the midfield at the beginning of the sequence.
He quickly ran past three Brighton defenders before swinging into the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green jerseys.
He fought his way past one defender, and subsequently ran from several on the edge of Brighton's field.
He then made a pass on the left and found Sterling.
The English forward used his first touch in the field to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right boot to outsmart Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot in the right side of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with some problems with his feet," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him playing for about 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at that moment.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the immediate lead in the Premier League game.
The goal came after 29 minutes.
In that sequence, Aguero received the ball deep inside Brighton's territory.
He sent a nice pass along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few touches before he led Sterling to the farthest pole.
The Sky Blues forward spotted the ball in the net just before it slipped past the goal.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12.55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to tease the Rockies
The Nationals are eliminated from playoff participation, so they didn’t have much to fight for.
However, the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to take the lead on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there is still the possibility of participating in the playoffs for the Rockies, who have played a game more than the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies held at least in a wild-card spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but still have their first division title to good.
"Although we have nothing to play for, we can go to the game knowing that the atmosphere would be at its highest among the audience here in Denver, and that the opponents would play at the probably highest level I'm going to face this year.
Why shouldn't I be excited to play under these conditions?"
The Nationals have not yet announced the starting line-up for Sunday, but are likely to put Scherzer in as a pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be the first man on the spot for the 34th time, trained his throws on Tuesday and would pitch on Sunday, which is usually his rest day.
The right-handed player from Washington is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds election meeting in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding his election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while speaking of the importance of Republicans appearing in the polls in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
Five weeks from one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
It’s one of the big, big ones – you can’t vote for me, but you’re actually voting for me. That’s why I travel around and fight for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You can see this awful, awful radical group of Democrats, you can see it’s happening right now.
And they are determined to get power back by all available means. You can see how vicious, how disgusting they are.
They don't care who they hurt, who they run over to gain power and control. That's what they want, power and control, but we won't give them that."
The Democrats, he said, have as their mission "to fight and block".
"And you've seen it over the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "angry and vicious and disgusting and liars."
He referred to the Supreme Democratic Senator of the Senate Judicial Committee, Dianne Feinstein, by name, which sparked the buh from the audience.
“Do you remember her response?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh, no, wait – it was really bad body language – the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Labour is no longer an inclusive party.
They are intolerant of those who express their opinions.
When Momentum’s activists in my local party voted to censor me, it wasn’t really a surprise.
I am just the latest in a large number of Labour MPs who have been told that we are not welcome – simply because we have given our opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, received similar treatment because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship measure was to criticize me because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
In terms of the importance of a responsible economic policy, in terms of national security, in Europe, ironically similar issues, which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders in.
On Friday, the East Labour summit in Nottingham said, “We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of my eight years as a local Member of Parliament, Friday evening meetings have been just that.
Sadly, today the tone of many meetings is not that, and the promise of "friendly, gentler" policy is far back in the past, if it ever started.
It has become increasingly clear that divergent views are not tolerated in Labour, and that all opinions are weighed according to whether the party leadership can accept them.
It started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, when colleagues, with whom I previously thought I shared political views, began to expect me to make a U-turn and take positions that I would otherwise never have agreed on – whether it was about national security or the EU’s internal market.
When I say my opinion in public – and it really doesn’t matter what I say – a long list of gross messages on social media are following, calling for disapproval and contradiction of midterm policy and telling me that I shouldn’t be a member of Labour.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments addressed to me are usually political.
I have deep respect for the professionalism and combativeness of those colleagues who are daily overwhelmed with sexism or racism, but still continue to fight.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is where normal abuse has become.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour should create a tolerant culture.
But in reality it is no longer a spacious organization and with each motion of censure or amendment of the selection rules, the party becomes narrower.
I’ve been given a lot of advice over the last two years that if I put a lid on myself and don’t scream so loudly, then I’ll be “enough.”
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I joined Labour 32 years ago, when I went to school, I was provoked by the Thatcher government’s neglect that had left our classroom in a state of decay, and I set out to create better public services for those who need it most – whether it has been as a councillor or minister in the government.
I never hid my policy, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way have been confused about my political positions and disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who tabled the motion for a resolution on Friday, I would like to say that when the country bounces towards Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But the one message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to the local voters, whether they are members of Labour or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no kind of threat of opt-out or political suitability will dissuade me from acting on what I believe is your interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: undefeated Ayr becomes top team
Two late scores may have gotten the final result to draw a not entirely truthful picture, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved the victory in this amazingly entertaining match of the day in Tennent's Premiership.
They are now at the top of the scoreboard and are the only undefeated team out of ten.
In the end, it was their superior defense as much as their better use of chance that carried the home team home, and coach Peter Murchie had absolutely the right to be satisfied.
"Our games have been demanding so far and we are still undefeated, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Respect to Ayr, they took advantage of their chances better than us."
Grant Anderson's score after 14 minutes was followed by a successful kick from Frazier Clima and brought Ayr in front, but a yellow card to Scottish national Rory Hughes, which was dealt to the match by the Warriors, gave Melrose an advantage, and Jason Baggot made a score that was not followed by a kick.
Clima extended Ayr's lead with a penalty kick just before the half. He scored and then got a solo scoring, so Ayr stood 17-5 at the break.
But Melrose started well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's scoring, followed by a kick from Baggot, reduced the points difference to five.
There was then a long interruption because Ruaridh Knott had suffered a serious injury. He was carried out of the field on a stretcher. When the game resumed, Ayr extended the lead with a score from Stafford McDowall and a follow-up kick from Clima.
Acting Ayr leader Blair Macpherson then got a yellow card, and again Melrose took advantage of their extra man with a scoring from Bruce Colvine without a follow-up kick after a period of intense pressure.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to tackle Clima without the ball, MacPherson was able to score after a line-out behind the forthcoming Ayr cluster.
Clima followed with a kick inside the poles and followed with a more almost immediately after the game resumed, after Kyle Rowe intercepted David Armstrong's box kick and sent wing player Gregor Henry to the home field's fifth scoring.
Still Game star looking for new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran appears to be taking the step to the restaurant industry after it emerged that he has taken the position of CEO of an authorized restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, in which he writes and is the protagonist alongside his collaborator Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, but one source suggested to the Scottish Sun that Kiernan would be part of Glasgow's "growing market for restaurants".
"The sea is ours": Inland state Bolivia hopes that court will reopen route to the Pacific
Sailors patrol around the naval headquarters, wrapped in rigging, in La Paz.
In public buildings, a blue flag is raised.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are overpainted with the motto: “The sea is ours, it’s a right.
It’s a duty to take it back.”
Throughout the inland state of Bolivia, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody conflict over resources in the 19th century is still strong, as is the longing to sail on the Pacific Ocean again.
Hopes may be at their peak for several decades, while Bolivia awaits a ruling from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of voting.
"Bolivia has momentum, a sense of community and clarity, and of course awaits with a positive look at the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the ruling of the International Court of Justice on big screens across the country and hope that the Hague court will uphold Bolivia’s commitment to negotiate to give Bolivia sovereignty over an area with access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president, who is facing a controversial election campaign next year, also has a lot at stake at the verdict on Monday.
“We are close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised at the end of August.
But analysts believe it is unlikely that the court will take Bolivia’s side – and that there would be no major changes if it did.
The UN Assembly, which has its seat in the Netherlands, does not have the power to hand over Chilean territory and has stipulated that it cannot determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The International Court of Justice’s ruling only six months after the final arguments were heard indicates that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of advancing Bolivia’s cause, the past four years may have been a setback.
"The case of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian leadership," Zárate said.
Morales's belligerent rhetoric has eliminated the remaining Chilean goodwill, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the discussions at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the Court's decision-making was abnormally fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end an era of 139 years of disagreements and gain benefits for both parties," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, used the maritime problem as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up access to the Pacific," he added.
“The verdict is an opportunity to see that we have overcome the past.”
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless they can rely on the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his nation would never disarm its nuclear weapons if it could not first rely on Washington.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made during a summit in Singapore between rival leaders.
His comments were in line with the fact that U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is apparently facing a restart of the locked-down nuclear diplomacy over three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a “desire” that continued sanctions and US opposition to a declaration ending the Korean War will ever bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to the Declaration as long as Pyongyang has not first taken significant steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want another summit.
But there is widespread skepticism as to whether Pyongyang is serious about abolishing an arsenal that the country most likely sees as the only thing that can guarantee its security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month in preparation for a new summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest collections with large headgear that you will soon be able to buy in local stores
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or block the sun completely, you can find the answer here.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled on the catwalk a collection of odd, extra-large-sized headwear as part of their SS19 collection. The collection impressed at Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats have dominated Instagram this summer, and the two designers have sent their eye-catching creations down the catwalk.
The most impressive work by Valentino was a lavish with a feather-like wide shade that covered the heads of the models.
There were also other extra-large accessories, including watermelons with jewels and even a pineapple – but they’re not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also unveiled a selection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had stitched lips that resembled Hannibal Lecter more than haute couture.
One creation resembled diving gear with snorkel and mask, and others resembled a melted waffle ice.
And if you continue the big fashion statements, you’re in luck.
Style scouts predict that the huge hats could get to stores near you.
The giant hats arrive in the heels of "La Bomba", the straw hat with a 60 centimeter wide shade seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand, which is behind the highly impractical hat that was spread across social media, has sent a new big creation down the catwalk – a beach bag in straw that is almost as big as the model that displays it.
The orange bast bag with bast fringes and a white leather handle was the most eye-catching feature in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in regular stores next summer. The designer has had such a big influence that it will be hard to ignore the demand for giant-sized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scotland’s independent schools have many great academic achievements behind them, and it has continued in 2018 with yet another series of outstanding exam results, which are also reinforced by individual and collective success in sports, arts, music and other local endeavours.
With up to 30,000 students around Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their students and parents.
The independent schools seek to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their place as global citizens.
As an education sector that can assemble and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we see that modern languages remain a popular topic in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it hits his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it will hit your heart.”
It is an important reminder that we cannot just stick to English when we want to build relationships and trust among people from other countries.
We can see from the latest exam results this year that languages are the highest in the statistics with the most passed exams in the independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received the high grade A.
The data collected by SCIS’s 74 member schools showed that 72 percent of students received the grade A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French, and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language is now perceived as a subject choice at the same level as STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) courses in independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 study by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills found that among the reasons employers were unable to fill vacancies, 17% had to do with lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming more and more important in preparing young people for their future careers.
More job opportunities will require language skills in the future, and these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career that young people choose, if they have learned another language, they have a huge advantage in the future with a lifelong skill like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a multilingual person a head start on the competition.
According to a YouGov poll of over 4,000 respondents in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, and French is the only language spoken by a multi-digit percentage, 15 percent.
That is why it is important to invest in language education for those who are children today.
Speaking more languages, especially languages from developing countries, gives children a better chance of finding meaningful work.
In Scotland, there are differences between schools in what languages are taught.
A number of schools focus on the more classic modern languages, while others teach languages that are expected to be most important to the UK when looking forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, there will always be a variety of languages to choose from at independent schools with teachers who are specialists in the field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to delivering a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills required to succeed, whatever the future holds.
At the present time, it cannot be denied that languages continue to be truly important for the future of the country in a global business environment, and that must be reflected in the educations.
Modern languages should actually be regarded as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, this diversity and this distinction to Scotland’s youth.
I'm fine with the fair.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will make his debut for the Lakers Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans to watch LeBron James play his first game for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's pre-season game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It is not clear how many minutes he plays.
"It will be more than 1 and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is unlikely to play the entire game.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' planned six games before the start of the season.
“Where I am in my career, I don’t need to play before the start of the season to get ready,” he said.
Trump's Election Meeting in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of voter meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is Trump’s first of five planned election meetings next week, including meetings in Trump-friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote to confirm Trump’s appointed judge for the vacant seat at the Supreme Court has been suspended, Trump is trying to create support for the upcoming midterm elections because Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when the votes are cast in November.
When is Trump’s election meeting in West Virginia tonight, and how do you see it online?
Trump’s election meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, will be held at midnight (Danish time) on the night between Saturday 29 November and Sunday 30 November 2018.
You can watch Trump’s election in West Virginia online via livestream on YouTube.
Trump will most likely talk about this week’s hearings on Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated for the Supreme Court. The hearings were tense because of allegations of sexually abusive behavior, and the expected vote in the Senate for confirmation has been suspended for a week while the FBI is investigating the charges.
But the primary goal of this streak of voter gatherings is to create momentum for the Republicans who are facing a difficult election in November.
People from President Trump's campaign team said the five elections next week aim to "create energy among volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible now that we are entering the busy campaign time," a spokesman for the Trump campaign, who would not be quoted by name, told Reuters.
This evening's voter gathering is held at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling and is expected to attract Trump supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to step up to give him a boost in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political science professor at West Virginia University.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA has shown fighting spirit and trying to keep hope alive ahead of Sunday's singles duels
After three one-sided laps, Saturday’s four-man duels were perhaps what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging momentum is a completely invented sports concept, but a concept that players believe in – not least in competitions like this one.
Where would they say there is momentum now?
"They led by six points, and now it's four, so we probably see that as momentum," Jordan Spieth said.
Europe, of course, has the advantage: they are 4 points ahead and there are 12 more points to play for.
However, as Spieth says, Americans feel that they have a little wind in the sails, and there are plenty of encouraging things to focus on, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both boast three points out of four possible.
Spieth has been sharp from tee to green and sets a good example for his teammates.
The high cheers increased as the round continued, and Spieth hit an important put, which secured victory in duel four, although he and Thomas had been two strokes behind after two duels.
His put, which secured them the fight on hole 15 was met with a similar scream – the kind of scream that shows that he does not believe the American team is out of competition yet.
"You just have to find the inner strength and focus on your own struggle," Spieth said.
That’s all the players have left now.
18 holes where you can make a difference.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, arguably the biggest story from the Ryder Cup.
Europe's strange but sympathetic couple have scored four points in four games and appear flawless.
"Moliwood" was the only couple that didn't get a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bogeys Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes Friday morning.
The series and the way in which the energy seems to flow both to and from the wild audience shows that it will be the ones that will be hardest to beat Sunday. And it would undoubtedly be very popular if a potential European victory is tied up by Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Synchronous on each hole.
However, it is too early to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made brief trial against Sergio Garcia, the morning in the four-man duels, when he formed a couple with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double bogeys on the first nine holes dug the Spaniard and Swede into a hole they were never close to getting out of.
Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The matches with four balls and two teams of two players are so fascinating to watch up close because of the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give, and the way the strategy can change lightning fast.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has created a significant lead before the last day, but the four-man duels have also shown that Team USA has the fighting spirit that some, especially in the United States, have doubted.
Europe leads 10-6 ahead of last day of Ryder Cup
Europe has a big advantage before the last day of the Ryder Cup, after coming out of Saturday's fourballs and foursomes with a lead over the United States of 10-6.
The well-playing duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the way with two wins over a troubled Tiger Woods and has so far won four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn's European team, trying to win the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an inaccurate American team in the morning's fourballs and won the series 3-1.
The United States gave more resistance in the foursomes. They won four games, but were still behind.
Jim Furyk's team will need eight points in Sunday's 12 singles matches if they want to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to win four points in a row, and he and Molinari, who have been nicknamed "Molliwood" together, are after a sensational weekend the only second pair in Ryder Cup history to have won four points in their first four games.
They crushed Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs and then elegantly defeated a discouraged Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who fought his way through the first two games on Saturday, had little ingenious glimpses, but now he has lost 19 out of his 29 games in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose was well rested for the morning fourballs and returned to partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes and got a 2-1 win over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – who are number three in the world.
Europe, however, is doing quite as they want it, on a lightly windy day southwest of Paris.
Triple major winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas showed the way for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They got a hard-won 2-1 win over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in foursomes, after losing the first two holes.
It has only happened twice in the Ryder Cup history that a team has fought back after being four points behind before the singles matches. However, since Furyks currently holds the trophy, they only have to score a draw to keep it.
After being second best in two days, however, it seems that they cannot cope with a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says it will not disarm unilaterally if there is no confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions reinforce its distrust of the United States and that the country will not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under such conditions.
Ri Yong Ho told the global organization's general assembly that North Korea had shown "significant goodwill" over the past year, for example by halting nuclear and missile tests, decommissioning an area for nuclear testing, and promising not to further develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We have not seen a similar reaction from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there is no trust in our national security and under such conditions, there is no chance that we ourselves will take the first steps and disarm unilaterally."
While Ri reiterated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington’s opposition to a “phased” approach to nuclear disarmament, where North Korea would be rewarded if they took gradual steps. But his speech seemed important as it did not unambiguously reject unilateral disarmament, as has previously been the case from Pyongyang.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim promised to work “nuclear disarmament on the Korean peninsula,” while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea’s security.
North Korea has demanded a formal end to the Korean War, which took place in 1950-53, but the US has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also shown resistance to softening tough international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'nuclear disarmament first' and expands the pressure with sanctions to achieve their purpose by coercion and even opposes the 'declaration of the end of the war'," Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a dream come true among people who don’t know who we are.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions reinforce our distrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for another summit between Kim and Trump, as the US leader highlighted at the UN earlier this week.
The minister instead highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in within the last five months, adding: "If nuclear disarmament were to be negotiated with South Korea and not the United States, the negotiations would not be so locked down."
Nonetheless, the tone of Ris’ speech was very different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that firing North Korea’s missiles at the US mainland was inevitable, after “Mr Evil President” Trump called Kim a “rocket man” on a suicide mission.
Last year at the United Nations, Trump threatened "total destruction" of North Korea, but this year he praised Kim for showing courage in terms of disarmament, but said that there is still much to be done and that sanctions must remain until North Korea disarmament.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a schedule for these actions, but said, “It doesn’t matter if it takes two years, three years or five months.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that “the Security Council must maintain sanctions with conviction and without error until we achieve total, final, confirmed nuclear disarmament.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased economic sanctions against North Korea in an attempt to stop Pyongyang’s missile and nuclear weapons program.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and subsequently said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times during the year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that progress had been made, while North Korea accused him just hours later of making "gangster-like demands."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to close a missile facility as well as a nuclear complex if the U.S. took “similar steps.”
He said Kim had told him that the “similar steps” he demanded were the security promises Trump made in Singapore, as well as movements towards a normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Take a Course on Getting Enough Sleep
A new course at Harvard University has given all undergraduate students more sleep. The purpose of the course is to counteract the growing macho culture, where you study the whole night held up by large amounts of caffeine.
One researcher has shown that students at the world’s best university often do not know the first thing about taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, has made the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He got the idea for the course after giving a presentation on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
"When the paper was finished, a girl came up to me and said, 'Why do I only get to know this now when I'm on the candidate?'
"She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is offered for the first time this year, explains to students how good sleeping habits can improve one’s academic and sporting performance as well as one’s overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health field, says the university has decided to offer the course after finding out that the students were in severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The hour-long course consists, among other things, of various interactive exercises.
In one of the exercises, there is a picture of a dorm room where students have to click on coffee cups, curtains, running shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, and how one’s athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation, and how important good sleeping habits are.
In another part of the course, participants hear about how long-term sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attacks, blood clots, depression and cancer.
Participants are encouraged to think about their daily habits by clicking on different icons on an interactive map of the campus.
“We know it won’t change the behavior of the students right away.
But we think they have a right to know — just as one has a right to know how cigarettes affect health,” adds Professor Czeisler.
The pride that is in taking an “allnighter” still exists, he says, adding that modern technology and increased pressure on students have led to sleep deprivation being a growing problem.
The “secret weapon” against stress, exhaustion and anxiety is good and adequate sleep, he said – it even counteracts weight gain, because sleep deprivation makes the brain believe that you are starving, which is why they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler organize the course last year when he took one of his courses on his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and had him work on making it a general course throughout the university.
He hopes that the next step will be for all graduates to be offered a similar course before continuing their education.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set an alarm so that they know when to go to bed and when to get up. This can raise awareness of the harmful effects of the light from electronic monitors, which can move at the circadian rhythm and make it harder to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Goals from Menga lower Gerrard and co.
The Rangers suffered another defeat when Dolly Menga's goal meant Steven Gerrard's incoherent team had to cope with a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The team from Ibrox was looking for their first win away since the 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team gave Gerrard the only second defeat in 18 games as a coach, making it eight points up to Hearts in first place of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga struck seven minutes before the break, which an uninspired Rangers team could not answer.
The Rangers are now down to sixth place, while Livingston climbs up to third place after Hibernian with only the goal score to the difference.
And there could be more bad news on the way to the Rangers, as line referee Calum Spence had to be treated after being hit in the head by a thrown object that seemed to come from the away section.
Gerrard made eight changes to the line-up that reached the Betfed Cup semi-finals by tonning past Ayr.
Holt, on the other hand, stood with the same 11 who shaved a point of the Hearts' lead last week, and he would have been delighted to see his sharp team exhausting opponents across the field.
The Rangers had the ball the most, but Livingston was more effective.
They should have scored two minutes into the game when Menga's first-time pass sent Scott Pittman against Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder's attempt passed.
A deep kick from Keaghan Jacobs found his way to Captain Craig Halkett, but his defender Alan Lithgow kicked past the rear pole.
The Rangers, however, took control, but played more on hope than ability in the attacking game.
Alfredo Morales was certainly not satisfied when Judge Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's appeals for a penalty kick when he and Steven Lawless colluded after a 15-minute game.
The Rangers only managed two shots on goal in the first half, but former Rangers goalkeeper Liam Kelly had no problems with Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's tame shots.
Although Livi’s opening in the 34th minute was something of a coincidence, it must be said to be deserving of their efforts alone.
Again, the Rangers could not handle a dead-ball situation in depth from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who took the time to find Menga, who could easily kick it on goal.
During the break, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which almost instantly gave paws when the wing player sent the ball in to Morelos, but the well-played Kelly ran from his position to block.
However, Livingston forced the away team to play on their terms with many long balls up the pitch from Lithgow and Halkett.
Holt's team could have extended the lead in the final part of the match, but McGregor turned Jacobs down with a safe hand before Lithgow headed next to the goal.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton again appealed for a late penalty kick after being stricken with Jacobs, but Judge Thomson also looked the other way.
Yearbook: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from the yearbook "Sunday Morning": 30 September, 1882, 136 years ago today - if we count... - was the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that would eventually lead to the apparatus known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter has become an integral part of both science and popular culture, as can be seen in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans starred as German scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It is a Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms that the radioactivity of the minerals makes."
Evans: "Oh, stop it, it's all over now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before he would have turned 63.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Immune System to “See” Cancer Cells
New cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to “see” cancer cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of treatment
The method consists of extracting immune cells from a patient and changing them in the laboratory
They can then “see” the protein common to many cancers and where they are injected again.
A test vaccine performs promisingly in patients with a variety of cancers.
When a woman with ovarian cancer was treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells, the cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method consists of extracting immune cells from patients and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can “see” the protein called HER2 that many cancers have and then inject the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our findings suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “causes several cancers to develop,” including breast, ovarian, lung and bowel cancers, Professor Berzofsky explains.
A similar approach, taking immune cells out of patients and “teaching” them to attack cancer cells, has worked in the treatment of a certain type of leukemia.
Kanye West gave a Trump-friendly speech wearing a MAGA hat after his SNL appearance.
It didn't go well
After an incoherent performance in the Saturday Night Live studio, Kanye West was bowed off when he paid tribute to U.S. President Donald Trump, saying he himself would run for president in 2020.
After playing the evening's third song Ghost Town wearing a Make America Great Again cap, he began a thunder speech against the Democrats and maintained his support for Trump.
“I talk so often to white people who say, ‘Why do you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
But if I was worried about racism, I would have long since moved out of the United States,” he said.
SNL started the show tonight with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony on the Senate Court regarding Christine Blasey Ford's assault charges.
Although the footage was not shown, comedian Chris Rock West uploaded the tirade on social media.
It is unclear whether Rock attempted to expose West by posting the footage.
West also complained to the audience about poor treatment backstage because of his headgear.
"They bullied me backstage.
They said, 'Don't go out there wearing that hat.'
They bullied me!
And they said I had sunk deep," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see how deeply I've sunk?", saying that he would put on his Superman cape because that means "You can't decide what to do. Do you want progress in the world?
Try with love.”
The audience booed at least twice of his comments, and the SNL staff seemed embarrassed, Variety reported with a comment from a person present: "There was silence in the studio."
West had been booked as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose then-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many by performing the song I Love It while dressed up as a Perrier bottle.
West received the support of the leader of the conservative group, TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest people: THANK YOU FOR DON'T LEAVE YOU OUT OF THE PUBLISH."
Talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West just "is who he is, and it's just fine."
“But I do NOT choose to reward a person (by buying his music, his clothes or supporting his ‘art’) who embraces and pours out an ideology that is harmful to society.
He's allowed.
We do, too,” she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper had announced that he had taken a name change to "the entity officially known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name, following Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rap colleague Snoop Dogg has been named Snoop Lion, and the recently deceased music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to The Artist Formerly Known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder after stabbing a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed with a knife in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to be brought before the Court of Appeals in Belfast on Monday.
The charges are reviewed by the Public Prosecutor’s Office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington reveals toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for swinging swords in the role of Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor leans out after the stereotypical macho hero and says that those kinds of TV characters mean that young men often feel that they have to be tough to be respected.
Kit told Sunday Times Culture that he believes “something has gone wrong” and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie at 31, admitted that the problem is "very important to him".
“At the moment, I care a lot – where have we gone wrong in the city with masculinity?” he said.
"If we look at the current problems, what is it that we have taught young men in their upbringing?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to the very masculine characters.
He continued, "What is innate, and what is learned?
What is it that young men learn from television and on the streets that makes them feel like they should be men in this way?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time – how do we change it?
It is obvious that something has gone wrong with the young men.”
During the interview, he also admitted that he will not make sequels to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying he is "finished with battlefields and horses."
From November, Kit plays a remake of Sam Shepard’s True West, which is the story of a film director and his brother who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he considers meeting his wife Rose to be the best thing in the entire Game of Thrones experience.
"I met my wife because of this series, so that way it has given me my future family and shaped my life forever," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, whom Kit's character, Jon Snow, falls in love with, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple were married in June 2018 at Leslie’s family’s country estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been affected in the country, health authorities said.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were registered.
The vast majority of new cases were sexually transmitted, which is a new trend.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China due to infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who get HIV in this way has been reduced to something close to zero, Chinese health authorities told a conference in Yunnan province.
In one year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is an acute problem in China’s LGBT community.
In 1997, homosexuality was legalized, but discrimination against LGBT people is reportedly a widespread phenomenon.
Studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men sooner or later marry women because of the country’s conservative values.
Many cases of infection are due to the lack of use of contraception in these conditions.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised free and equal access to HIV medicines as an attempt to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies staff leaked data on Republican senators and thunders against “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
Senator Maxine Waters denied allegations that a member of her staff shared personal information about three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Democrat from Los Angeles claimed that the allegations stemmed from websites and supporters from the “outer right wing.”
"Lies, lies, and more terrible lies," Waters wrote in a Twitter post.
The published information allegedly contained home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of whom are from Utah.
The information was posted on the Internet on Thursday by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative support sites such as Gateway Pundit of RedState announced that the IP addresses pointed out that the information had been posted by Waters’ people, after which they published information about a member of Waters’ staff.
"This unfounded accusation is completely untrue and a straightforward lie," Waters said.
“The member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security has been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations is in no way responsible for this leak of information.
This unfounded accusation is utterly untrue and a direct lie.”
Waters’ resignation quickly received criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“It’s an angry denial,” Fleischer wrote.
"It suggests she doesn't have the right temperament to be a congressman.
If you are accused of something you haven’t done, don’t get angry.
You can't be defiant.
You must not question the motives of the prosecutor.
You have to keep the peace of mind.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Kavanaugh, who was criticized for being too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who aims to take over Waters's place in the midterm election, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Great, if that's true," he tweeted.
In Waters' official statement, she says her staff have contacted "the relevant authorities and law enforcement regarding these fraudulent allegations."
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are found," she continued, "and that they will be held legally accountable for their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to everyone on my staff."
Review of Johnny English Strikes Again – Underwhelming Spy Comedy with Rowan Atkinson
It has become the norm to look for a Brexit angle in all recent films with a British flavor, and it also seems relevant to the latest action comedy in the Johnny English series, which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and reappeared in 2011 with Johnny English – born again.
Will daring, sarcastic self-satisfaction about how bad it is with us become the country's new export opportunity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face and the big eyes has gotten his permission to make roars renewed-again. His name signals more than anything else that he is a comic invention aimed at places where the cinema visitors do not speak English.
He is, of course, the dumb secret agent who, despite his desire to be a smooth gentleman, has a bit of Clouseau, a pinch of Mr. Bean and a proper clutch of him who performed a single note to the Chariots of Fire song at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
He is also originally based on the worldwide and international scam that left chaos in its wake after Atkinson portrayed him in Barclaycard's television commercials.
There are some good moments in this latest shot on the trunk from JE.
I loved when Johnny English approached a helicopter wearing a medieval armor, and the propellers sounded against his helmet.
You can see Atkinson's talent for physical comedy, but the humour feels rather overwhelming and strangely superfluous, especially now that more "serious" movie series like 007 and Mission Impossible also feature comic as an ingredient.
The humor seems to be aimed at children rather than adults, and to me Johnny English’s crazy adventures aren’t as inventive and focused as Atkinson’s silent movie bullshits in the role of Mr. Bean.
The infinitely current starting point for the film is that Britain is in serious trouble.
An internet hacker has infiltrated England’s top-secret spy network and uncovered the identities of all the English agents in the field to the dismay of the responsible agent – a sadly very small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last chance for a pompous and combative prime minister who is already suffering a complete meltdown in political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best with this Teresa May-like character, but there is not much to work with in the script.
When her security advisers inform her that every active spy has been discovered, she is forced to cancel someone’s retirement.
And, of course, it's the clumsy Johnny English, who is now a school superintendent at an upper-class school, but who secretly teaches how to become a secret agent. There are some fun sequences here when English stands for some sort of School of Rock education in espionage.
English rushes back to an emergency meeting at Whitehall and reunites with his hard-tried former right-hand Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough has now married an over-enthusiastic but well-meaning U-boat captain – a role that Vicki Pepperdine is wasted on.
Thus, the Royal Secret Service's utterly troubled Batman and Robin are back when they meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale, Ophilia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is stumbling close to being flattered by the charismatic and sinister tech billionaire Jason Volta – played by Jake Lacy – who claims to solve England’s computer problems.
English and Bough begin their furiously risky escapades: disguised as servants, they set fire to a distinguished French restaurant; they create chaos when they smuggle themselves aboard Volta’s luxury yacht; and English creates pure ragnarok as he tries to use virtual reality glasses to get acquainted with Volta’s house.
All the guns are fired in the final sequence of the film, but no matter how well-meaning and energetic it is, there is a sense of child television over it.
Pretty mediocre.
And as I couldn’t help but think with the other Johnny English films: Can’t the English film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that does his talent justice?
Labour refuses to barrel with plan for four-day work week with unchanged wages for Britain
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour is said to be considering a radical plan so that the English can settle for a four-day week of work, but get a salary of five.
The party allegedly wants business leaders to use their artificial intelligence (AI) savings to give employees an extra day off.
This would mean that the employees would have three days of weekend without losing their salary.
Sources state that the idea would be consistent with the party's economic goal of drawing the country in a more favorable direction for the workers.
Trades Union Congress supports the idea of a four-day work week as a way for workers to benefit from a changing economy.
An experienced member of the Larbour Party told The Sunday Times: "A political proposal is expected to be published by the end of the year."
“It’s not going to happen in a day, but a four-day working week is a goal that fits with the party’s approach to changing the economy for the benefit of the workers and the party’s overall strategy for industry.”
Labour would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party proposed a four-day working week during the campaign for the 2017 parliamentary elections.
However, the aim is not supported unanimously by the Labour Party.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: "A four-day working week is not the party's policy and is not under consideration in the party."
Labour’s shadow finance minister John McDonnell used last week’s party meeting to outline his plans for a socialist economic revolution.
McDonnell says he is determined to tear back power from "anonymous directors" and "explorers" in utilities.
The shadow finance minister's plans also cast doubt on whether current shareholders in water utilities will get their money back, as a government headed by Labour could "count off" them on the basis of immoral acts.
He also confirmed plans to get workers on corporate boards and to create inclusive owner funds that will distribute 10 percent of private companies’ share value to employees who are expected to receive up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 annually.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell 60 Minutes whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change their vote
The FBI investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week. And that raises the question of whether the FBI findings could cause the Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview shown on Sunday, 60 Minutes journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could dig something out that could make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed to be more open to the idea than his colleague from South Carolina.
“Yes, of course,” Kennedy said.
“When I went into the hearing, I said I had spoken with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened – after the accusations came out – and said, “Did you do that?”
He was determined, determined, and unambiguous.”
Graham’s voice, on the other hand, seems to be chiseled in stone.
"I have made a decision with respect to Brett Kavanaugh, and anything else would require a very violent accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know that Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the people she mentioned could confirm it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don’t see that it should change anything.”
What is the Global Citizens Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York hosts the Global Citizens Festival – an annual music festival with a very impressive array of artists and an equally impressive goal; to end the world’s poverty.
For the seventh time, the Global Citizens Festival will receive tens of thousands of people on Central Park’s large lawn, where they can look forward to concerts with Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes. At the same time, the festival will raise awareness about the real goal, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
Started in 2012, the Global Citizen Festival is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international interest organization that fights to end poverty by increasing the number of active opponents.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (if you do not want to pay for a VIP ticket), concert attendees must perform a number of tasks or "actions". For example, do volunteering, write to a world leader, make a phone call or other meaningful action that can raise awareness about the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been now that they have 12 years to reach the goal?
Does the idea of rewarding people with a free concert create real change, or is it just another case of so-called “clicktivism” – i.e. that people feel they are making a difference by signing a petition online or making a Twitter post?
Global Citizen reports that since 2011, it has recorded more than 19 million “actions” from its members aimed at various goals.
They believe these actions have spurred world leaders to set binding targets and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion, which is expected to have affected more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group listed 390 goals and actions that had been achieved as a result of their actions, amounting to over $10 billion that had already been paid out or collected.
The group estimates that these funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of its main goals is The Power of Nutrition, which was started in the UK and is a collaboration between investors and people with a strong footprint. They strive to “help children live out their full potential” and pledge $35 million to alleviate nutritional problems in Rwanda after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the help of the UK government, donors, other countries’ governments and world citizens like you, the social injustice of malnutrition can become a footnote in the history books,” Tracey Ullman, ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, told the audience at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that the UK government has now pledged funds to improve nutrition for mothers and children after receiving more than 5,000 calls online. This project, Power of Nutrition, will help five million mothers and children with nutrition advice.
In response to one of the website’s frequently asked questions, “What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen wrote: "It will be a long and hard fight, and sometimes we will stumble and make mistakes.
But as with the civil rights movement and the movements against apartheid, it will succeed because we are stronger together.”
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are among the performers at this year’s festival in New York. Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will be hosts.
U.S. could use its fleet to “block” Russian energy exports, U.S. Home Secretary says
“If necessary,” Washington could use its fleet to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s interference in Syria – particularly where they operate at the invitation of the legitimate government – is a pretext for expanding sales of their energy.
“I think they’re in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, just like they do in Eastern and Southern Europe,” he said.
And according to him, there are both methods and resources to prevent it.
“The United States, with our fleet, has the ability to ensure that there is free passage on sea routes and, if necessary, we can also block them so that we ensure that their energy does not get on the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants at a meeting held by the Consumer Energy Alliance – a nonprofit organization that sees itself as “the voice of the American energy consumer.”
He compared Washington’s approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, saying that they are basically the same.
"The economic opportunities in relation to Iran and Russia are about exploiting and replacing fuel," he said, referring to Russia as a "one-trick pony" whose economy relies on fossil fuels.
These statements come after the Trump administration has aimed to increase European exports of liquefied natural gas to replace Russia, which is by far the cheapest choice for European consumers.
To achieve this, Trump administration spokesmen, including Donald Trump himself, have tried to convince Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 line project, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin Moscow’s “prisoner.”
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion costly Nord Stream 2 line, which is expected to double its current capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin believes that Washington’s strong opposition to the project is an expression of unequal conditions of competition and is merely due to economic considerations.
"I think we share the view that energy should not be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said at a subsequent meeting in Moscow with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in September.
The position of the Americans is met by criticism from Germany, which has confirmed its participation in the project.
Germany's leading industrial organization, the BDI, has asked the US to intervene outside the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem with a third party interfering in our energy supplies," BDI leader Dieter Kempf said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "strongly considers" running for president in 2020, Massachusetts senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren "strongly considers" running for president after the midterm election, she said on Saturday.
During a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering running.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and repair our political system, and that requires a woman in the front,” she said.
"After November 6th, I will strongly consider running for the presidential election."
Warren expressed his opinion about President Donald Trump during the City Council, saying that he is "leading the country in the wrong direction."
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been voiced in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren wrote: "Of course, the FBI will have to investigate the matter before the vote."
A poll from Thursday shows, however, that most of Warren’s own backcountry does not think she should run in 2020.
According to a poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe, 58% of “probable” voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run.
32% supported the possible candidacy.
The poll showed greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick with 38% in favour and 48% against a possible lineup.
Other high-profile Democratic candidates discussed in the 2020 presidential election include former vice president Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden announced his final decision in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions Track Palin’s PTSD at Donald Trump Election Meeting
The 26-year-old Track Palin was one year in Iraq after enlisting in the army in September.
On Monday, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through after returning home allows me to relate to other families who are feeling the consequences of PTSD and other injuries our soldiers are returning home with," she told audiences at a Trump electorate meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of his son and other war veterans that "they have changed and have become harder. They go and think if there is respect for what their colleagues on land and in the air and all other members of the military have done for the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, for preventing the report of domestic violence, and for holding a weapon in drunk condition, said police spokesman Dan Bennet.
18 states and D.C. support opposition to new asylum law
18 states and the District of Columbia support a legal objection to a new U.S. law denying asylum to victims fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and D.C. issued a partisan statement Friday in Washington in support of an asylum seeker who opposes the law, according to NBC News.
The plaintiff's full name in the lawsuit Grace vs. Sessions, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal law in August, has not been made public.
She stated that her partner "and his violent sons who are gang members" had abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The prosecutors, who support Grace, described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of American asylum seekers originated, as countries with far-reaching problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum law overturned a decision made by the U.S. Aliens Board in 2014 that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said on Friday that the new law “disregards decades of state, federal, and international law.”
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be decided on the basis of relevant facts and circumstances, and such an obstacle goes against that principle," the statement said.
The lawyers also argued in the statement that the law on rejecting immigrants harms the U.S. economy, as they are more likely to become self-employed and “provide necessary labor.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions deprived immigration judges of the right to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asylum is offered to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear on the basis of race, religion, nationality or membership of a given social group or political stance," Sessions said in his decree on June 11.
Asylum was never meant to address all the problems – or just all the serious problems – that people all over the world face every day.
As the death toll doubles, attempts to find survivors in Palu become desperate.
For survivors, the situation only got worse.
"It's very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she comforted her little fever-stricken boy at an evacuation center in the devastated town of Palu.
"Every minute the ambulance comes in with bodies.
We need clean water.”
The residents now returned to their broken homes to sort in soaked belongings and save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals, which were also affected by the 7.5 earthquake, were unable to follow suit.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, were outside Palus military hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to severe aftershocks.
He got tears in his eyes when he told how the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save ourselves.
I was torn against a broken wall, I think,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was going to a wedding in the city.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of Ugly Methods and Propaganda Ads
A week after a Chinese newspaper posted a four-page ad in a US daily that drummed up the benefits of US-Chinese cooperation, the US ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China Daily’s paid indenture in the Des Moines Register — Iowa’s best-selling newspaper — after accusing China of interfering in the November 6 congressional elections. China dismisses the accusation.
US officials told Reuters that Trump’s accusation of Chinese interference in the US election marks a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now stuck in an escalating trade war, where they have in several ways imposed tariffs on each other’s import goods.
China's retaliatory tariffs in the trade war would hit exporters in states like Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican party, Chinese and American experts say.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China former governor of Iowa, who is a major exporter of agricultural food to China, said Beijing has harmed U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
In Sunday’s Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote that China “is escalating the use of nasty methods by running propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“By spreading propaganda, the Chinese government uses the proud American tradition of freedom of speech and press freedom by running a paid ad in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In the kiosks here in Beijing, on the other hand, there will be few disagreements, and you will not get a fair picture of the different views of the Chinese people on China’s worrying economic direction, as the media is under tight control of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers failed to publish" his article, although he did not say which one.
Republicans alienate women ahead of midterm elections with Kavanaugh case, analysts warn
While many top Republicans support and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh against allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn that they will experience a counter-reaction in the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
The case has put the emotions in the air, and most Republicans have already announced that they would like to see the voting process continue.
"This cannot be done again," Grant Reher, professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article Saturday.
Reher said he doubts that Republican Senator Jeff Flake (Arizona)’s request for an 11-hour FBI investigation will alleviate anger among voters.
“Women don’t forget what happened yesterday – they won’t forget it tomorrow or in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn.
On Friday morning, during a demonstration in the Senate, protesters shouted, “November is coming!” as Republicans, who control the Judicial Committee, chose to move forward with Kavanaugh’s nomination despite the testimony of Professor Christine Blasey Ford.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will reach new heights," independent political commentator Stu Rothenberg told the news media.
“People say it has already reached a high level; that’s right.
But it can reach even higher, especially among women swing voters in the suburbs and younger voters – 18-29-year-olds – who rarely vote, despite not liking the president.”
Even before Ford's public accusations of the Supreme Court nominee's sexual assault, analysts had pointed out that it could backfire if Republicans continued with the nomination.
"It has become a worse mess for Republicans," Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee’s vote or the final outcome, or whether Kavanaugh is held accountable; it’s also about how Republicans handled it here and how they treated her,” said Guy Cecil, president of Priorities USA, a group that supports Democrats in being elected.
But Americans seem to have divided opinions on who to believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, the latter having a little more on his side.
A recent YouGov poll found that 41% of respondents believed in Ford’s testimony, while 35% said they believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they believed that Kavanaugh either likely or certainly lied during his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
At the request of Flake, the FBI is now investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least another, Deborah Ramirez writes to The Guardian.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh drunk abused her when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her her genitals to a party when they both studied at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the Internet plans to create a new Internet and compete with Google and Facebook
The inventor of the Internet, Tim Berners-Lee, is launching a new company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The newest project of the technology legend is called Inrupt and is a company based on Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners Lee joked that the plan with Inrupt is "world domination."
“We have to do it now,” he said about the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid’s technology, allowing people to create their own “personal online data collection” or a POD.
It can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify were available in a single browser at the same time.
What is unique about the personal online data collection is that it is entirely up to the user to decide who can access the specific information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data.”
According to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, the idea with Inrupt is to pool resources, processes and capabilities to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some software developers on project contract and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee says he and his team are not talking to “Facebook or Google about whether or not they should change everything completely so that all their business models suddenly become superfluous.”
"We're not asking for your permission."
In a post on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s “mission is to offer commercial energy and an ecosystem that can ensure the integrity and quality of the new internet being built on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he started the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an important voice in the so-called net neutrality debate.
While Inrupt is being launched, Berners-Lee will still be the inventor and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about the next period of the Internet," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Ecclesiastical recipient of the Victoria Cross from World War I is honored
The Church of England's only priest who won the Victoria Cross by fighting during World War I is celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Pastor Bernard Wann won the Order on September 29, 1918, during the attacks at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed four days later by a sniper and was never told he had won the highest English military order.
On Saturday, a memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northhamptonshire.
Michael Vann, one of his grandchildren, said it was "incredibly symbolic" that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's order-winning achievement.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under heavy fire from machine guns and artillery."
He later ran up to the front line and led his people forward with the "greatest courage of men" before attacking an artilleryman alone and defusing three guns.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I knew I could never live up to, but that makes me humble.”
He and his brother James Vann also placed a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann stated that he "felt very honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the support of all these people underscores the true heroism."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead got Gurli Gris
Imagine you’ve been up all night to see the star-studded Bellator 206 and then being refused to see the main event.
There were 13 matches on the program from San Jose, including six matches on the main program, and they were shown throughout the night in England on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready to meet, viewers in England were somewhat surprised when the transmission switched to show Gurli Gris.
Some were unimpressed after they had stayed awake until early in the morning for this very fight.
A Twitter fan described the shift to a children's cartoon as "a kind of sick joke."
"According to the legislation, this content was not appropriate at 6 a.m. so they had to switch to children's programs," Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president, said when asked about the broadcast.
"'Grisen Gurli', yes."
Bellator’s CEO, Scott Coker, said they will work to include English viewers in future planning.
"When thinking about the re-release, I think we can make it work," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock Sunday morning over there, and we won't find a solution to that until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when it was changed, I got a lot of messages, and they weren't all friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical flaw.
But it was actually the law.
I can promise you that it won’t happen next time.
We’re just five games instead of six, as we usually do, we tried to give our fans something extra, and then we went over time.
This is an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Had "Inferiority" Over Sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he felt less valuable than anyone else in his upbringing because of his sexuality, but that motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize until he got into the bigger classes that “everyone is not like me.”
When he was on Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said he was less interested in winning the Olympics after becoming a parent.
The regular host on the long-running radio program, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off due to illness.
Daley was a guest on Laverne's first program and said he felt "less worth" than anyone else in his upbringing because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said: “Until today, the feelings of being worth remembering and feeling different have been the things that have given me the strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something,” he said, so he didn’t disappoint everyone when they got to know his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze winner has become a high-profile LGBT advocate and used his participation at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal for a decriminalization of homosexuality in several countries.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without negative consequences, and he wanted to give others “hope.”
The triple world champion said he had been “surprised” when he fell in love with a man – American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, but said the age difference had never been a problem.
He said it’s hard to find someone the same age who has experienced similar ups and downs when going through so much at such a young age – he went to his first Olympics at 14, and his father died of cancer three years later.
The couple became parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that "his whole perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it would all be about whether I should win a gold medal," he said.
"But there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept his death, and one of the last things he asked was if they had got tickets to London in 2012 – when he would sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him he wouldn't be there by that time.
I held his hand when his breathing stopped, and it first occurred to me that he was not immortal when he stopped breathing and was dead," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I just knew that’s what I had dreamed of all my life – to dive in front of a home audience at the Olympics. There was nothing to beat that feeling,” he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first song selection – Proud by Heather Small – which had meant a lot during the run-up to the Olympics and still gave him goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs runs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 BST.
Mickelson on the bench for the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson sets a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he has to do something about the form if it's not going to be a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who sets a record for the 12th time in the competition, which takes place every 2 years, was put on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk due to Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of events in the U.S. as usual, the five-time big winner had to act cheerfully and rehearse his play in the hope of correcting the whips.
Even at the peak of his career, he had the most straight drift, which is why the 48-year-old is not a perfect match for the field at Le Golf National, where the long rough often punishes stray shots.
And if the pitch wasn’t a big enough mouthful, Mickelson will face the ever-exact winner of the British Open Francesco Molinari at the ninth game on Sunday, who has teamed up with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans who start the 12 singles matches start strong, Mickelson’s fight may be crucial.
Furyk did not surprisingly express confidence in his teammate.
"He understood his role completely today, gave me a pat on the back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has a lot of faith in himself.”
He is in the Hall of Fame and has given so much to these teams in the past – and also this week.
I didn’t think he was going to play two games.
I imagined he was going to play more, but that's how it went, and that's how it should be.
He wants to be out there like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson broke Nick Faldo’s record for the most games played in the Ryder Cup.
It could be the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never quite matched his individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven draws, although Furyk said his presence contributes something indefinable.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's witty, he likes to stick to people, and he's good to have in the team room," he explained.
"I also think the younger players had fun playing against him this week, which was fun to watch.
He contributes much more than just the game.”
European captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn knows that great leadership can quickly disappear
European captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn knows from experience that a solid lead before the last day of the Ryder Cup singles match can quickly become nerve-wracking.
The Dane made his debut in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a lead of five points over the Americans, but was just about to be overtaken before the finish line with a 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 victory.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a nice lead in Valderrama, we had a nice lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we just won," says Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn after seeing the 2018 team win both 5-3 Friday and yesterday to a total lead of 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The story tells me and the rest of the team that it’s not over.
It's gotta be full of garbage tomorrow.
Go out and do everything right.
It's not over until you have the points on the board.
We have a goal, and that is to try to win the trophy, and that is where our focus is.
I’ve always said that I’m focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we’re also aware of what’s on the other side – the best golfers in the world.”
Delighted with his players' performance on a difficult pitch, Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn added: "I don't take any of this for granted.
Tomorrow is a completely new challenge.
Tomorrow, it’s the individual performance that counts, and that’s something completely different.
It’s great to be out there with a partner when things are going well, but when you’re out there alone, you’re tested on all parameters as a golfer.
That’s what players need to understand – bring out the best in yourself tomorrow.
Now you must leave your partner, because he must also bring out the best in himself.”
It looks different for opponent Jim Furyk, who hopes for better individual performance than in the partner game with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself has experienced turnarounds on the last day. First on the winning team at Brookline before losing, when Europe did the "Miracle of Medinah".
"I remember every word," he said when asked how Captain Ben Crenshaw had spoken to his players before the last day in 1999.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you want a good start, as you saw at Brookline, as you saw at Medinah.
When momentum has found a direction, it puts a great deal of pressure on the middle battles.
We’re putting our team on the pitch in the order we feel, and we’re trying to create magic tomorrow.”
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the rebound and faces Rory McIlroy in the top game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and the other Europeans play in the first half of the order.
"I chose this group of players in this order because I think it ensures us all the way through," Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn said about his choice of single players.
Germany's new warship postponed again
The German fleet’s newest frigate should have been ready in 2014 to replace the Cold War warships, but the Germans have to wait at least another year due to technical problems and an escalating price, local media reports.
The deployment of the largest ship in the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg class of frigates, "Rheinland-Pfalz", has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to be part of the fleet in 2014, but aftermath problems have plagued the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, which the fleet ordered back in 2007, will replace the aging frigates of the Bremen class.
They are known to have a powerful cannon, a wide range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as stealth technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Another important feature of the latest frigates is a minor need for maintenance: it should be possible to keep the frigates away from the home ports for up to two years.
But the repeated delays mean that the advanced warships – which are said to make Germany appear as an overseas force – will already be obsolete when deployed, Die Zeit writes.
The failed F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the fleet had delivered a ship back to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media mentioned a number of decisive "software and hardware failures" that rendered the warship unusable in combat situations.
Software failures were of particular importance, as the ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class must be controlled by a crew of 120 sailors – that is only half the crew of the older Bremen frigates.
It also turned out that the ship was far too heavy, reducing its performance and limiting the fleet's ability for future updates.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is said to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to hardware failures, the price of the project, which includes training of the crew, is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), with an initial price of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates become even more important in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is shrinking.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German government’s defense committee, admitted earlier this year that the fleet “is running out of ready-to-deploy ships.”
The official said the problem has grown over time because the old ships were taken out of service without being replaced.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were ready to join the navy.
National Trust Snails to the Secret Life of Bats
New research from an area of the Scottish Highlands is trying to reveal how bats use the landscape when hunting.
The hope is that the findings will shed light on the unique behaviour of flying mammals and will help in the work of future conservation efforts.
The study is conducted by scientists from the Scottish National Trust and follows common bats, dwarf bats, long-eared bats and water bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed at carefully selected locations in the area to record the bats’ activities throughout the season.
Data is also collected by NTS staff and volunteers using handheld detectors.
In-depth analysis of the sound recordings will reveal the frequencies of bat calls and show which species does what.
To produce a detailed landscape picture of their behaviour, a report and a map of the habitat are made.
Nature Conservation Advisor for NTS Rob Dewar hopes that the findings reveal which areas of the habitat are most important and how they are used by the different species.
This knowledge can help determine the benefits of habitat conservation efforts such as the establishment of meadows and how best to preserve forest areas for bats and similar species.
The number of bats in Scotland and the UK has fallen drastically over the last 100 years.
They are threatened by buildings and urban expansion projects that affect the owners and reduce their habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a danger, as can fly traps, chemical treatment of building materials and attacks from pets.
In fact, bats are not blind.
But because they hunt primarily at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use an advanced echo-location technique to find insects and fly around obstacles.
NTS, which is responsible for the conservation of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
They have ten trained experts who often collect data, inspect nests and sometimes carry out rescue operations.
The organization has even made Scotland’s first and only dedicated bat reserve in the area around Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight out of ten of Scotland’s bat species.
The area's caretaker, David Thompson, says it's an ideal territory for them.
"Here at Threave we have a really good area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and all the good habitat.
There’s a lot you don’t know about bats, so work here and elsewhere can help you understand what they need to thrive.”
He stresses the importance of looking for bats before performing maintenance tasks on properties, as the destruction of a single nest can kill up to 400 females and cubs, thereby risking the destruction of an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, disturb or disturb them or their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish project manager for the Bat Conservation Trust, has called on the public to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of the species we have, we don't know how the populations evolve."
Ronaldo rejects rape charges while lawyers sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called rape charges against him "fake news" and says people "will promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German news media Der Spiegel, which brought the accusations.
The attacker from Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to keep it a secret, Der Spiegel wrote on Friday.
A few hours after the allegations were made public, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke to his 142 million followers on Instagram Live and criticized the information for being “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," the five-time winner of the Ballon d'Or told the camera.
“They want to promote themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine," the player added smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the charges, which they have called "an unforgivable disclosure of privacy suspicions," according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral corruption in a class similar to the accusation, which is arguably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The incident allegedly took place in June 2009 in a room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting each other at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to the report filed in the Clark County District Court in Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronald fell on his knees after the alleged incident, saying he was "a good guy 99% of the time" grabbed by "the one percent."
The case files claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that there was consent to it.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had her injuries photographed in a hospital, but that she later agreed to an out-of-court deal because she felt "anxious about retaliation" and worried about being "publicly embarrassed".
The 34-year-old now says she will rescind the agreement as she is still deeply affected by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo faced a shift from Manchester United to Real Madrid when the incident was supposed to have taken place, and this summer switched to Italian big club Juventus for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: Britain 'will forever regret' losing car manufacturers
Britain “will regret it forever” if it lost its status as a leading global car manufacturer after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "concerning" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily lower production at the factory in Burnaston near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that longer waiting time at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston factory, which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
“As I see it, production at our factory will cease if Britain goes out of the EU at the end of March,” Burnaston CEO Marvin Cooke said.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, express fears of leaving the EU without an agreement on cross-border trade.
For example, BMW says they will close their Mini factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concern of car manufacturers is the supply chain risks in the event of a non-agreed withdrawal.
Toyota’s production runs on a tight schedule, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be problems at the border, which, according to the automotive industry, could lead to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than one day of production at the Derbyshire plant, and then production would be stopped.
Clark says Theresa May's Chequers plan for future negotiations with the EU is "composed to precisely avoid these border inspections."
“We need a deal, we want the best deal that not only allows us – as I call it – to enjoy our current success, but to seize this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today program.
“The statements from Toyota and other manufacturers indicate that we need to be able to continue what have been successful supply chains.”
Toyota could not say how long production would have stopped, but in the long run, higher prices would reduce the factory’s competitiveness, which would ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is a joint trustee at the factory, says that his members are becoming more and more concerned: "My experience tells me that as soon as these jobs disappear, they won't come back."
A spokesman for the government said: "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House says
Donald Trump’s important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may “be postponed for another week” as the showdown around Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein looks at special prosecutor Robert Mueller over his shoulder during his investigation of Russian election interference, connections between Trump’s helpers and Russia, and the president’s possible obstruction of court.
Whether Trump will fire the Deputy Attorney General and thereby risk Mueller’s independence has been a gossip topic in Washington for months.
The New York Times wrote earlier this month that Rosenstein was considering wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of deposing the president via the 25th paragraph.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday he went to the White House, and the rumor was that he would resign.
Instead, a meeting was agreed on Thursday with Trump, who at the time was at the United Nations headquarters in New York.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a coincidence with the Senate court hearing where Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who have accused him of sexual assault, would testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, delaying the Senate election.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders was on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "There is no set date. It could be this week. I can also imagine that it could be pushed a week with everything going on in the Supreme Court.
But we have to see, and I always like to keep the press up to date.”
Some journalists would challenge the claim: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences was not due to TV journalists’ games for the gallery, but added, “I don’t disagree that they play up to the camera.”
She then said that direct contact between Trump and the press will be increased.
“The president accepts more questions from the press than any president before him,” she said, adding without quoting a source: “We’ve looked at the figures.”
Press conferences will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask direct questions to the President of the United States, it is infinitely much better than talking to me.
We’re trying to give it ample opportunity, and you’ve seen us do it over the last couple of weeks, and it’s going to be in the place of the press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States.”
Trump often accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open hearings or press conferences with high-ranking guests.
Press conferences with Trump alone are rare.
This week in New York, the president showed why, when he made an improvised and sometimes mysterious figure in front of the present journalists.
Health Minister contacts EU health workers in Scotland after Brexit concerns
The Minister of Health has written to the EU staff working in Scotland’s NHS to express the country’s gratitude and desire for them to stay after Brexit.
Member of the Scottish Parliament, Jeane Freeman, sent a letter less than six months before Britain withdrew from the European Union.
The Government of Scotland has already committed itself to pay for the applications for permanent residence of EU citizens working in its delegated public sector.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal have continued, and it seems that decisions are expected in the autumn.
But the UK government has also stepped up its preparations for a possible Brexit without an agreement.
I know it must be a very uncertain period for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the efforts made by each employee, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from and outside the EU bring valuable experience and competencies that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare for the benefit of patients and local communities.
Scotland is definitely your home and we want you to stay.
Christion Abercrombie undergoes acute surgery after head injury
The Tennessee State Tigers lineback, Christion Abercrombie, was acutely operated on after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat to the Vanderbilt Commodores, reports Tennessee's Mike Organ.
Tennessee State first coach Rod Reed told reporters that the incident took place before the break.
"He went out to the sideline and just fell about out there," Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sidelines before putting him on a stretcher and taking him in for further examination.
A Tennessee State spokesman told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie's operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center was over.
Harris added that there are “no details about the type or extent of the injury yet,” and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when he incurred the injury.
Abercrombie is studying for the second year and is starting his first season in Tennessee State after a shift from Illinois.
He had five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, giving him 18 tackles in total this season.
Foreign buyers are charged higher stamp duty when buying house in the UK
Foreign buyers are charged higher stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK. The extra money, according to the Conservative Party, will help the homeless.
This move should dampen Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters.
The higher stamp tax will affect those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year for the homeless.
Theresa May will today propose that foreign buyers be charged a higher stamp duty when buying properties in the UK, for the benefit of the homeless.
The move will be seen as an attempt to counter Jeremy Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters with promises of cheaper housing and going after those with the highest income.
The increase in stamp duty will affect people and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK. The earnings from this will be used for the government's struggle to ensure that everyone has a place to sleep.
The additional fee, which is added to the current stamp duty and the higher levels introduced two years ago on multi-storey purchases and purchases to rent, can reach 3%.
The Ministry of Finance expects it to be able to collect <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of new buildings in London are bought by people living abroad, which causes prices to rise and makes it harder for first-time buyers to get a foothold in the housing market.
Many rich areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost towns" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The bill comes just weeks after Boris Johnson proposed a cut in stamp duty to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices up by buying land they don’t use. He asked May to drop quotas on cheap housing to solve Britain’s “shameful housing situation.”
Corbyn has proposed a striking range of housing reforms, including checking rent prices and depriving the landlord of the ability to put people on the streets if they comply with the lease.
He will also strengthen the ability to build public housing.
May said: “Last year I said that I would use my presidency to restore the British dream; that life will be better for every generation.
And that means repairing our non-functioning housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it may not be as easy for foreign companies and people living outside the UK to buy homes as it is for hard-working British people.
For too many, the dream of owning a home has become too distant, and the indignity of sleeping on the street is still far too widespread.”
Jack Ross: “My ultimate goal is to be Scotland’s coach”
The head of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says that his "ultimate goal" is at some point to become Scotland's coach.
The 42-year-old enjoys the challenge of reviving the North East club, now third in League One, three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back in the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
“I played a game with the B team and that’s it,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportsound.
"But I grew up seeing Scotland on Hampden with my father when I was a kid, and that has always drawn me.
But that would only be possible if I were successful in coaching clubs.”
Ross' predecessors as coach for Sunderland are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic said he had no hesitation in following such established names in such a large club and had previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Now I measure success by whether I can get this club back in the Premier League.
From the structure and facilities of this club, it undoubtedly belongs in the Premier League,” he said.
"It's not an easy task, but I'll probably only see myself as successful here if I can get the club back there."
Ross is only three years into his career as a coach after a period as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and a 15-month failure as part of Heart's coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa come back after being down in the third-best rank and transformed St Mirren from the relegation threat to title winners the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his career as a player for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real crossroads," he remembers about the time in Alloa.
“I honestly thought that coaching was the right thing for me, more than being a player.
It sounds weird because I did well, served reasonably and had some success experiences.
But it can be hard to play.
There are a lot of things you have to go through on a weekly basis.
There is still that kind of stress and pressure as a coach, but it just feels right.
I have always wanted to train, and now I do. I have not been more comfortable with myself in my entire adult life."

The heatwave this summer has increased earnings for England’s pubs, but has put restaurant chains under greater pressure.
Sales in pubs and bars rose by 2.7% in July, while sales in restaurants fell by 4.8%, figures show.
Peter Martin, a CGA business consultant who has collected the figures, said: “Continuing sunshine and England’s unexpectedly long World Cup have meant July follows the June pattern, where pubs saw more sales of 2.8%, except that restaurants are harder hit now.
The 1.8% drop in restaurants in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars with a focus on the sale of beverages fared best and experienced progress similar to the decline of restaurants.
Pubs focusing on food suffered in the sun, but not as much as the restaurants.
Looks like people just want something to drink.
Across pub and bar chains, beverage sales increased by 6.6% for the month, while food fell by 3.3%.”
Paul Newman, analysing the service industry, said: “The results continue the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
When it comes to sales on the out-of-home market, the weather and major social or sports events are the biggest factors.
It is not surprising that restaurants are still struggling, although a fall in sales of 4.8% year after year will really hurt in addition to rising costs.
The long, hot summer could not come at a worse time for the food industry, and only time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we’ve had in August will provide a much-needed respite.”
The total increase in sales total for pubs and restaurants including new openings was 2.7% in July, reflecting the decline in newly launched brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors sales figures for the English pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyzes data from 47 different groups. Their annual turnover is more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and they are leaders in the field.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents.
One in five children — up to the age of 11 — have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers, according to a survey.
A survey of 20,000 4th-9th grade students reveals growth in “fake Insta” pages.
The news has increased the fear that sexual content is being posted
20% of students said they have a "main account" that they can show their parents
Every fifth child under the age of 11 creates social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students from 4th grade onwards reveals massive growth in “fake Insta” accounts – a reference to the Instagram image sharing service.
The news has increased the fear that sexual content is being posted.
20% of students said they have a “main account” that they can show to their parents while also having private ones.
A mother who fell over her 13-year-old daughter’s secret account saw a teenager who urged others to “rape me.”
The survey, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) for private schools, found that 40% of 11-18-year-olds had two profiles, half of which admitted to having private accounts.
The head of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said: “It’s frightening that so many teens are tempted to create online profiles where their parents and teachers can’t find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be the "Voice of the Athletes" on the board of Scottish Athletics.
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of Scottish Athletics at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most winning athlete, and chairman Ian Bettie described the shift as a good opportunity for those making sports decisions to benefit from her vast 10-year experience at international level.
"Eilidh enjoys great reputation in the athletic world in Scotland, the UK and the rest of the world, and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit from having her on the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I will try to be the voice of the athletes and I hope I can contribute and help lay out a direction for sport in Scotland."
The American, who won two of his four Olympic gold medals in the 200 and 400 metres at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, and who is now often a commentator for the BBC, could not go after a transient ischemic seizure.
He tweeted: “A month ago, I was hit by a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that time would tell if I would get on top of it and to what extent.
It has been hard work, but I am completely healthy, have learned to walk again and do agility exercises today!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!”
Advertising for breast pump comparing mothers to cows gets mixed reception online
A breast pump company has shared opinions online with an advertisement that compares breastfeeding mothers to cows that are milked.
To mark the launch of what is said to be “the world’s first silent breast pump,” the technology consumer magazine has released a sarcastic music video-inspired advertisement to showcase the freedom the new pump gives mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a costume filled with hay to a song in which it reads, "Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see a tail" and "If you hadn't noticed, this isn't yvere, it's my breasts."
“Pump it out, pump it out, I feed my baby, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my breast.”
But the advertisement, which has been published on the company's Facebook page, has caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received a mixed reception from the viewers. Many say it makes fun of the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
"Very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth before they can produce milk, except that their babies are stolen from them shortly after birth.”

Another wrote: “Understandably traumatic for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children?"
Another added: "What an insensitive advertisement."
Others defended the ad, and a woman admitted that she thought the song was "incredibly funny."
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I would have had one.
Breastfeeding made me feel just like a cow.
The advertisement is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It's a brilliant product," one wrote.
Another commented: “It’s a fun advertisement aimed at mothers who pump milk (often at their workplace or in the toilets) and feel like ‘cows’.
It’s not an advertisement that praises or criticizes the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they have danced with the discreet pumps in their bras.
The concept behind the advertising is based on the fact that many women who breastfeed say they feel like cows.
The pump from Elvie is completely silent, has no tubes or hoses and fits discreetly in a nursing bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their children and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and CEO of Mother, wrote: “The pump from Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
Drawing a parallel between breastfeeding mothers and dairy cows, we would focus on the challenges of breast pumping, while demonstrating in an entertaining and recognizable way the freedom that the new pump can provide.”
This is not the first time the pump from Elvie has made headlines.
In London Fashion Week, a mother went to two catwalks for Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children secretly moved to tent camp on Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has exploded, although the number of border crossers has not changed. This is partly due to a harsher rhetoric and the Trump administration’s harsher laws that make it harder to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and they have feared for their ability to stay in the country by presenting and accepting a child.
The risk of return increased in June when the authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of the household would provide fingerprints and that this data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that they had arrested several people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The administration later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had pure criminal records.
Nearly 80% of those who are either sponsors or members of sponsors’ households reside illegally in the country, and a large proportion of them are foreign criminals.
So we're still chasing those people," Albence said.
In an attempt to speed up the trials of the children, the authorities have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of their detention. Previously, it was within 60 days, aid workers say.
Many people use video calls instead of appearing and speaking their case for legal residence to an immigration judge.
Those convicted of being unable to stay will be deported quickly.
The longer children remain in custody, the more likely they are to develop anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outcomes or escape attempts, according to aid workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
People advocating for better conditions say these risks are more pronounced at larger facilities like Tornillo, where size makes it harder to keep an eye on whether a child is suffering.
They added that moving to a tent village without mental preparation or the opportunity to say goodbye to friends can accumulate trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria announces U.S., French and Turkish “occupation forces” to withdraw immediately
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Syria’s foreign minister Walid al-Moualem asked Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said that the foreign forces' stay in the country is illegal and under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and they will "be met with similar means."
"They must withdraw immediately and without conditions," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the war on terror is “almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and several million have fled their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to “fight this decisive war until we have cleansed all Syrian territories” of both terrorist groups and “illegal foreign presence.”
The U.S. has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who primarily train and advise Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces that are against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the war-torn country.
In the field of refugees, Moualem said conditions were good enough for them to return home, accusing "some Western countries" of "spreading unfounded fears" that caused the refugees to flee.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help facilitate these returns," he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no aid will be provided to rebuild the country until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Syria to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel-controlled city of Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a major attack by Syrian forces, supported by Russia, against the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would go after jihadists from the Nusra Front, a spur-of-al-Qaeda group, who "will be wiped out."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of the new committee soon to outline a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for an election. The committee consists of government and opposition members.
Moualem has set conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, stating that the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing the legislation of the current constitution," and warning against interference.
That’s why Trump wins another presidential term.
According to that logic, Trump is likely to be re-elected in 2020 unless the impeachment trial and scandals end his presidency ahead of time, as many liberal viewers probably hope.
In what will undoubtedly be "The most dramatic ending of a presidential term ever!"
There are currently no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, CNN’s viewership in the best time has almost doubled to 1.05 million and almost tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in best time, compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago. MSNBC’s The Rachel Maddow Show has the most viewers with up to 3.5 million on big news evenings.
"It's a spectacle that people are attracted to because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, who heads the ABC drama Designated Survivor about a head of cabinet who becomes president after an attack destroys the congressional building.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author behind "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,'" Scovell said.
The chaos is entertaining.
But unlike any other television program, the stories that come from Washington can decide the case between Roe and Wade, whether refugee families can be reunited and the health of the world economy.
Changing channels is only the most privileged.
And yet it’s about more than being an enlightened citizen when you watch six-hour panel discussion, where experts discuss Bob Woodward’s use of “deep background” when he wrote his book “Fear”; Paul Manafort’s ostrich leather jacket for $15,000 (“clothed with hybris,” wrote The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniels’ vivid descriptions of Trump’s anatomy.
I will never see Super Mario the same way.
“Some of what makes it feel like a reality show is that he gives you something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars,” about the Trump show’s rotating crew and daily surprises (disputes with N.F.L, praise to Kim Jong-un).
But if you miss a paragraph, you're off.
When I got to Fleiss this week, it was 26 degrees outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he was sitting inside watching MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
He could not force himself away; not with Brett Kavanaugh, who was to be heard in the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was to be decided.
"I remember when we did all these crazy shows in the past and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Big sums find their way to the close midterm elections to the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania receives large sums of money. As a result of the equalization of two "Congressional Districts", two members of Congress are fighting for the same seat.
This newly redesigned suburban district in Pittsburg is causing problems for Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another sitting congressman, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents Pennsylvania's 12th district, which overlaps heavily with the new 17th.
The maps were remade after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old district was unlawfully set up in favor of the Republicans.
The battle for the new 17th district has begun a battle for financial resources between the major party committees, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a high-profile election in March's special election for Pennsylvania's 18th district.
The seat has been in Republican hands for over ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political commentators give Democrats a small advantage.
The U.S. Considered Punishing El Salvador for Support to China, But Changed Its Mind
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing with few protests from Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners threw Trump’s leadership team out.
State Department officials decided to recall senior U.S. diplomats from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after "the recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan," State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But only El Salvador was punished. They received about $140 million from the United States in 2017 for, among other things, drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed penalties, which include cuts in financial aid and restrictions on entry permits, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder statistics.
As the internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a summit conference on security and economic development. It should have continued last year's meeting, which was deemed to be a step towards preventing immigrants from coming to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place anyway, and thus dropped the consideration of penalties to El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence will speak to the conference, scheduled for mid-October, to send a signal about the importance that Americans are putting in the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three U.S. deployed secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new harsh demands or punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton did not want to comment on the details of the case described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who would like to talk about the internal considerations if they remained anonymous.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an outside analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke on a condition of anonymity.
Know the history
The next obstacle could well be the special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible obstruction of the investigation, of which there is considerable and publicly available evidence.
Mueller will also direct his investigation to the question of whether Trump’s campaign secretly cooperated with Russia in the attack on the election.
If Congress gets into new hands, Trump will likely be held accountable as he prepares to face the voters again and eventually, of course, a jury of his peers.
There are many uncertainties, and I do not claim that Trump’s end is inevitable – and so are his counterparts in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we must all make choices that will affect how long the fight will continue.
In 1938, German officers were ready to launch a coup d'état against Hitler if only the West had been able to resist him by supporting the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and did not seize the opportunity to avoid the years-long bloodbath thereafter.
It is around such turning points that the axis of history turns and the irreversible march of democracy increases or decreases.
In the United States, we are facing several of these turning points.
What do we do if Trump fires the man who determines the future of Mueller’s investigation, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein?
Rosenstein's seat has been hot, since the present newspaper could announce that he had proposed last year to make covert footage of the president and challenged his suitability for office.
According to Rosenstein, The Times’s account is inaccurate.
“How do we react if the F.B.I.’s recently requested investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is suspended or not properly conducted – or if he is approved to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And, more importantly, in the midterm election, will we vote for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these trials, it will be a long winter for democracy.
But because of what I learned in Prague, I believe we can do it.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy’s homeland.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the table with the swastika.
How can I be anything but optimistic about it in my luggage?”

Graham Dorrans from Rangers is optimistic ahead of the game against SK Rapid Wien
After the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, the Rangers will have good chances of progressing from Group G of the Europa League with a victory against the Austrians.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his season debut before the 2-2 game against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use the result as a springboard for something even bigger.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
“We went to the game with the belief that we could get something home and we got a point.
Maybe we could have taken the plug home, but all in all, it was probably a reasonable result.
They were probably the best in the first half, but we came out in the second half and were the best team.
Thursday will be another great European night.
We hope to get three points, but it will be difficult because they got a good result in the last game. But with the crowd behind us, I am sure that we can put pressure on them and get a good result.
The last year has been hard because of all the things that have happened to my injuries and the changes in the club, but the mood is good now.
The team is good, and the boys are really enjoying it.
Hopefully we can go on now, put last season behind us and be successful.”
Anxiety About Retirement Savings Makes Women Sleepless
Despite the fact that the participants in the study had a firm idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few talked to the family about it.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide study said they discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
“Most people would like a family member to take care of them, but they’re not doing anything to start the conversation,” says Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance business.
That's how you get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to take care of you unless you tell them your wishes in good time.
Use your counselor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care. These choices can be decisive factors for the cost.
Ask your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you figure out how to pay for the expenses.
Long-term care can be financed, among other things, by means of a traditional long-term care insurance, life insurance with cash payments or self-insurance with your own funds – as long as you have finances for it.
Get the legal documents arranged: Take the legal battles in the run-up.
Get a power of attorney so you can get a trusted person to handle your medical treatment and make sure that doctors and nurses comply with your wishes in case you cannot communicate yourself.
Consider also a financial power of attorney.
In that case, you appoint a trusted person who can make financial decisions and make sure that your bills are paid if you are not able to.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that one of your aging parents is in urgent need of medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Get all these details down in writing so you're ready.
“It’s not just a question of the economy – who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
"What medicine?
Who takes care of the dog?
Get the plan in place."
Man shot several times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle on his way home from a trip in the city.
The victim was in his 40s and was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, diaphragm and hand.
Officers describe the shooting, which took place around 2:30 a.m., as "completely random."
The victim did not see the perpetrator.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are urging witnesses to come forward.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a violent earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to authorities who expect the number of deaths to increase.
Since the communication channels are out of play, relief workers have not been able to receive information from the regency of Donggala, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the earthquake struck.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province and is located at the bottom of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, which in 2017 had an estimated population of 379,800.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Donggala is a regency that stretches over more than 300 km of coastline on the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
The county, which is an administrative region of a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the cornerstones of the Central Sulawesi economy, especially in the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel extraction is also important in the province, but mainly takes place in Morowali, which is the coast opposite Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Center, Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996, Donggala was again hit by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia is seismically on the so-called Pacific fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years have been:
2004: A violent earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami on December 26 that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, including over half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake measuring 6.8 hit south of Java, Indonesia's most densely populated island, triggering a tsunami that raged toward the southern coast killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake measuring 7.5 hit one of the Mentawai islands from Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 meters, destroying dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: A superficial earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya regency of Aceh, scattering destruction and panic as the population was reminded of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 were killed by the collapse of the buildings.
2018: Severe earthquakes hit Indonesia’s tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son charged with domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former governor of Alaska and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for violence.
29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstructing reporting of domestic violence, and opposing arrest, according to the report issued Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to report the alleged crime.
Palin is in custody at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility with a $500 security deposit, KTUU reports.
He was brought to trial on Saturday, where he pleaded "clearly not guilty," the network reports.
Palin is charged with three Class A offences, which could result in a prison sentence of up to one year and a fine of $250,000.
He has also been charged with a Class B offense, which could result in a one-day jail sentence and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with crimes.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is currently pending in Alaska's Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, having prevented the reporting of a violent domestic crime and possession of weapons in an intoxicated state in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of striking her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after explaining her son’s violent behavior with PTSD as a result of his deployment to Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia kill hundreds of people
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The magnitude of the earthquake was 7.5 and triggered a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of homes.
The area is without electricity and communication routes, and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just south of central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
On social media, videos are circulating showing the moment the earthquake hits.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach party in the town of Palu when the tsunami raged toward the shore.
Public Prosecutors Try to Get Terror Suspect In NYC Sentenced to Rare Death Penalty
Public prosecutors are trying to sentence Sayfullo Saipov to death, suspected of the terrorist attack in New York City, which killed eight people – a rare sentence that was last convicted of a crime in the state in 1953.
In October, 30-year-old Saipov allegedly used a rental car from the Home Depot construction market to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where pedestrians and cyclists who got in the way were mowed down.
As a basis for the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious personal injuries. This is required by the declaration of intent for the death penalty in the southern district of New York.
According to the court document, the death penalty is a possible result of both of these charges.
Several weeks after the attack, a state jury was able to present Saipov with a 22-point indictment, including eight allegations of murder in connection with gangster activity, typically used by public prosecutors in organised crime cases, and an allegation of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded "extensive planning and preparation," the prosecutors said, describing Saipov's execution as "horrible, vicious and depraved."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused personal injury, bodily injury and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the southern district of New York last raised the defendant in a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but ended up in life imprisonment in September 2009.
In 1953, in a state case in New York City, the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of espionage on behalf of the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov was from Uzbekistan and, according to the court documents, showed no signs of repentance in the days and months after the attack.
According to the police, he told investigators that he was okay with his actions.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to commit the attack by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked to hang the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police officers said.
He has pleaded guilty to the 22 points of the indictment.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s public defenders, announced that they were “of course disappointed” by the prosecution’s decision.
"We believe that the decision to go after the death penalty and not accept a confession and life imprisonment without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma for all those involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defenders had previously asked the accusers not to go after the death penalty.
Conservative minister believes NIGEL FARAGE should take over Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's army" during a demonstration at the Conservative meeting today.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians should be able to “feel the pressure” from the Eurosceptics – after one of Theresa May’s own ministers said that Farage should take over the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told the Birmingham demonstration that Britain would have been “out now” if Farage had been a Brexit negotiator.
May’s challenge to create unity in the deeply divided party is underlined by the fact that conservative remainders are participating in a separate demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep his compromise plan on track under attack from both Brexiteers, remainders and the EU.
Her allies insist that despite the setback, she will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels – thereby forcing the Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package or "chaos".
To the demonstration Leave Means Leave in Solihull, Bone announced that he would scrap the Chequers plan.
He explained that Farage should have been included and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we'd be out now," he said.
The minister from Wellingborough added: “I will fight for Brexit, but we have to scrap Chequers.”
Regarding the background of his EU opposition, he said: "We did not fight world wars to be anyone's subordinate.
We will decide our own laws in our own country.”
Bone denied that public opinion should have changed since the 2016 vote: "That the British people should have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely wrong."
The conservative Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also at the demonstration and told the journalists: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The Chequers plan is unpopular in the general public, the opposition does not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and among our activists who are actually on the streets getting us elected.
Now drop Chequers and start listening."
As a pointed remark to May, she added: "Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Farage told the parade that politicians should be able to "feel the pressure" if they fail the decision from the 2016 vote.
“Now it’s a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
“They will betray Brexit, but we are united to tell them that we will not let them get away with that.”
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: “You must make sure that the political class, which is about to betray Brexit, can feel the pressure.
“We are mobilizing the people’s army here in the country that gave us the victory in Brexit, and we will not stop until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud Britain.”
Meanwhile, remnants marched through Birmingham before a two-hour parade in the city centre.
Scattered activists waved Conservative Against Brexit banners after the multiplication of the group this weekend.
Labour colleague Lord Adonis made fun of the security issues with the Conservative Party app before the meeting.
“These are the people who claim to have control over the IT systems and technology of Canada, border controls, free trade without borders in Ireland,” he said.
“It’s completely ridiculous.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren "strongly considering" running for president
Member of the House of Representatives Senator Elizabeth Warren "strongly considers running for the presidential election" after the midterm elections in November.
According to the Boston Globe, the Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about his future at a council meeting on Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Warren, who has often criticized Donald Trump, is due in November to seek re-election against state Republican candidate Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump’s Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
I wonder if he will challenge Trump in 2020.
The meeting in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with voters at the City Hall since Trump took office.
One participant asked her if she was planning to run for the presidential election.
Warren responded that it is time for “women to go to Washington and repair our political system, and that requires a woman in the front.”
Arrest in LSU's Sims Shooting Case
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect for the shooting of Wayde Sims, the basketball player from LSU, was arrested on Friday.
Police in Baton Rouge announced that 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson had been arrested Friday for an ET news meeting at 11 a.m.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday to ask for help identifying a man on the footage.
20-year-old Sims were shot and killed near Southern University early Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died of injuries," police chief Murphy J. Paul said in a statement.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and confessed to being present, possessing a weapon, and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any problems and is now in police custody in the East Baton Rouge District.
Sims was a two-metre third-year student who grew up in Baton Rouge. Last season he played 32 games, started in ten, and played an average of 17.4 minutes, earning 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is close to World Cup after team orders give him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team’s orders would play a decisive role in the race.
From the lead position, Bottas got a good start and was close to catching Hamilton completely off when he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel drove in the pit as the first, leaving Hamilton to fight with the traffic at the back of the field, which should have been crucial.
The Mercedes car went into pit a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came back ahead when the Ferrari driver after some wheel contact reluctantly had to leave the inner court after a double defense at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row and was seventh after the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led a large part of the race when, in an attempt at a quick finish, he failed to change tyres to take fourth place for Kimi Raikkonen.
He had to pit in the 44th inning, but could not increase the pace in the last eight innings, so Raikkonen secured fourth place.
“It’s a tough day because Valtteri did great all weekend and was really a gentleman when he let me pass.
The team did an incredible job of securing us both first and second place," Hamilton said.
Really bad body language
President Donald Trump taunted Senator Dianne Feinstein at a poll on Saturday for insisting she had not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
At a West Virginia poll, the president did not directly mention the testimony that Ford had given before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead said that the events in the Senate showed that people were "wicked and disgusting and dishonest."
“The one thing that could happen, and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see that anger, when you see people who are angry and vicious and disgusting and dishonest,” he said.
"When you look at statements and leaks, and then they say, 'Oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember that?
Dianne Feinstein, was it you who leaked it?
Remember her answer... Was it you who leaked the document – “oh, oh, what?
No, no, no, no.
I haven’t leaked anything.”
Hey, wait a minute.
Have we leaked... No, we haven't leaked anything," he added in an imitation of the senator.
Feinstein received the letter about Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
“I haven’t hidden Dr. Ford’s accusations, and I haven’t leaked her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
"She asked me to keep the letter confidential, and I did."
But her denial was not well-received by the president, who at Saturday’s voters’ meeting said, “I tell you, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but it’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
During the president’s continued defense of the nominated judge of the Supreme Court, who has been accused of sexual assault by three women, Trump suggested that Democrats use the accusations to benefit their own case.
“They shy away from any means in their efforts to regain power.
You can see the vileness, the abominations, they don't care who they have to drum to get power and control," the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars vs Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made it back after Friday's lost Elite League game against the Belfast Giants by winning the return game 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants quickly came ahead with two goals with attacks from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalized at home before Dwyer again brought the Giants ahead.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory with two more goals.
It was the season's third Elite League defeat for Adam Keefe's team, coming from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 in Friday's game in Belfast.
It was the fourth side-by-side meeting of the season, where the Giants went out as victors in the previous three games.
Dwyer set out in the fourth minute at 3:35 from an assist from Kendall McFaull with David Rutherford as an assist, when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In a busy previous period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt was behind Cownie's equaliser at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants came ahead at the first break when he made his second goal at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped, and Bouchard again equalized with a nice goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran collaborated to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game late in the second period, and he secured the victory with the team's fifth goal halfway through the last period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their five games, are home in Milton Keynes for their next game on Friday.
Flight Manager Died to Ensure Hundreds of Passengers Avoid Earthquakes
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is hailed as a hero after he died to ensure that a plane carrying hundreds of passengers got safely to the ground.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake last Friday hit Sulawesi Island and triggered a tsunami.
Severe aftershocks still ravage the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung's colleagues fled for life, he refused to leave his seat in the swaying control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained in place to make sure Batik Air Flight 6321, which held the runway, got safely into the air.
He jumped out of the control tower because he thought it was about to collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives.
We got a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a major hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We are devastated," he added.
Authorities fear that the death toll could reach several thousand, and the country's disaster preparedness announces that there is limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The death toll is expected to rise because there are still many bodies in the rubble and it is not possible to reach them," spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
Up to six-metre-high waves have destroyed Palu, which is holding a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are flying emergency aid and supplies in.
The 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, told Sky News: “Every minute a new ambulance arrives with several bodies.
There is a lack of clean water.
All the shops are looted."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working hard to help the survivors, but we don't know what we're getting at.
It’s already a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived at Palu on Sunday and told the country’s military: “I ask you all to work around the clock to perform all the tasks associated with the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” he said on CNN.
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombrok earlier this year, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini says a man is missing after plane crash in lagoon
The airline behind the plane that crashed into the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia now says a man is missing, although it had previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew members had been evacuated from the sinking plane.
According to a press release, Air Niugini said it was unable to locate a male passenger on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and police to try to find the man.
The airline has not returned to requests for more information about the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water during landing at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital until Saturday and that they were all in stable condition.
It is still not clear what caused the crash and the exact order of events.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said the plane landed in the lagoon in front of the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane flew past the runway.
US passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed on very shallow water.
"That was really lucky," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and other passengers could walk in water to life to get to the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said the crew panicked and screamed, and that he had suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working to renovate a nearby dock also helped in the rescue work by using a rubber boat to carry people ashore before the plane sank at a depth of about 30 meters.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in accidents with PNG-registered airlines over the past two decades, but that Air Niugini has not been involved in those accidents.
Analyst determines timeline for the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution concluded its evidence on Saturday during the appeal of a man accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in data analysis.
He described to the jury how he used teleinformation to collapse the course of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he got location data from several different mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the night she died, which was contrary to his earlier claims, writes The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was close to Chambers's cell phone at the time he had alleged that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police visited Sanford.
Sanford sat in the stand on Saturday and told me he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he "lied because my truck was in Nashville."
Another disagreement was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The mobile data showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis had deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its proceedings on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the jury to vote later that day.
The High Breed: What is political hip hop?
A hip-hop trio would like to challenge the negative view of the genre by giving their music positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol believes that hip hop has moved away from its origins with political messages and social problems.
They want to get back to the starting point and make political hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently gained a revival in the UK due to artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
Nanny in New York sues couple after firing with "racist" sms
A nanny in New York sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a text message by mistake from her mother complaining that she was "another black person."
The couple denied being racist, but compared the lawsuit to “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her dismay at finding out that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she showed up on her first day of work in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEY, NOT A BLACK PERSON," Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she came to send it to Giselle Maurice, even twice.
When she discovered her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman fired Giselle Maurice, saying that her former nanny, who was from African-American, had been bad at work and that she was instead expecting a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her one-day job and sent home in an Uber.
Now, Giselle Maurice is suing the couple to get compensation for the firing and $350 a day for the six months she was supposed to have lived with her family, even though this was agreed without a contract.
"I'd like to show them that you can't afford to do such a thing," she told the newspaper on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple have defended themselves by saying that they are not racists and that the dismissal of Maurice was justified because they were afraid that they would not be able to trust her after insulting her.
"My wife had come to send her something she wouldn't have said.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists," Plasco told The Post.
"But would you leave your children to someone you'd been rude to, even if it had happened by mistake?
Your baby?
Come on, man."
Plasco compared the lawsuit to "extortion" and that his wife had given birth two months earlier and was in a "very difficult situation".
“Are you really going after someone like that?
It is not very kindly done," added the investment advisor.
Although the trial is still underway, the People’s Court has already dismissed the couple on social media and shamed their behavior and logic.
New letter reveals Paddington publishers feared readers could not relate to a talking bear
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was admitted for publication, said of the letter: "It's hard to imagine being the one reading it for the first time before it was published.
It’s pretty fun to read now when you know how popular Paddington became.”
She said that her father, who worked as a cameraman at the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book about a small garment teddy bear, would have been optimistic, even if his story was rejected, and that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "bitter sweet" after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important part of our family" and says that her father, in all modesty, was proud of his success.
"He was a quiet man, and he didn't like to brag," she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it almost felt like you had a child who accomplished something: you’re proud of them, even if that’s not really your merit.
I think he saw Paddington's popularity that way.
Although it was his work and his imagination, he used to say it was Paddington's fault."
Saying goodbye to dying daughter over the phone
After landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that it was really bad and that she probably didn't survive," said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
"So I got a call from Nad that she was going to die in the next few minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
So I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll see you again soon.
I'll see you later.
The medicine she had been given to keep her heart moving slowly lost its effect.
She was dead shortly before, and now her body shut down.
I just had to sit there and wait for it to happen.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to try to get myself together.”
Eventually, the grieving Ednan-Laperouse boarded the plane with the other passengers, who had no idea what she was going through.
"Nobody knew," she said.
"I bowed my head and the tears kept running.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane I had an overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Grieving Women Try to Stop Suicide Hoppers
Two women who have lost relatives to suicide are trying to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers where you can get help.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he suffered from depression, and 18 when he committed suicide.
“I don’t want any parent to experience the grief I experience every day,” she said.
45-year-old Sharon Davis said her son was a promising cook with an infected smile.
His smile was known to everyone.
People said that his smile lighted up the room."
However, he stopped working before he died because he was feeling really bad.
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother found him after taking his own life.
Sharon Davis said, “I’m always afraid it’s spreading.”
Sharon Davis made the cards to “tell people that there is someone out there that you can contact and talk to, even your friends.
Don’t go with your thoughts yourself – you have to talk to someone.”
Sharon Davis' longtime friend, Kelly Humphreys, lost her fifteen-year-old boyfriend, Mark, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say anything about being upset or depressed or anything," she said.
A few days before Christmas, he began to change.
When the children opened their gifts, he had no eye contact with them at all."
She said that his death was very traumatic to them, but that they have to get through it: “It has created a hole in our family.
It has torn us apart.
We all have to fight and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is still uncertain as FBI begins investigation
“I thought that if we could actually get something like what he asked for – a time-limited investigation with limited scope – maybe we could get a bit of agreement,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee would “fall from the hindsight” in the middle of the locked party-shared situation.
Why would Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to conduct their investigation?
Their reluctance is due to timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, November 6, and if the Republicans, as expected, perform poorly, they will be weakened in their efforts to get the man they would like to have elected to the country’s highest judiciary.
George W. Bush has called senators to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and through that met his wife Ashley, who was Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI completes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still not known whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would give Vice President Mike Pence the decisive vote and elect him to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors 'falling' under Kim Jong-un
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug, referring to data from the South Korean merger ministry, said there were 1,127 dropouts last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park mentioned that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher numbers due to human smugglers were contributing to the changed figures.
Pyongyang has not made any official comments.
The vast majority of defectors from North Korea are eventually offered citizenship in South Korea.
The South Korean government says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most flee via China, which has the longest border adjacent to North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone between North and South Korea.
China considers the defectors as illegal immigrants and not as refugees, so they are often forced to return home.
The relationship between North and South Korea – which is technically still at war – has improved significantly over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to talk about the stranded negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This is after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to work towards a nuclear-free Korea at an overall level.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress.
"Without trust in the United States, there is no faith in our national security, and under such circumstances it is excluded that we will disarm on our own," Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is unfit for the Supreme Court
Speaking to the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated for the Supreme Court, called him "hysterical" and said his temperament was not suitable for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi’s comment came in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had behaved that way, you would have called her hysterical," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally dismissed the allegations that he had committed a sexual assault against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and when he spoke about his family and his high school years, he almost yelled and was crying.
He also denounced the Democrats in the committee and called the accusations against him “grotesque and a coordinated character courage” arranged by the left, who were angry that Hillary Clinton did not win the presidency in 2016.
Pelosi said she believed that Kavanaugh's statement proved that he could not sit in the Supreme Court because it showed that he is biased towards the Democrats.
"I think he has disqualified himself with the statements and the way he went after Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi evaded when she was asked if she would try to bring Kavanaugh to impeachment if he is confirmed and if the Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I would say that if he doesn't speak the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not fit to sit in the Supreme Court, but certainly rather in the court he's sitting in now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh currently serves as a judge in the Washington D.C. Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions in connection with Obama's health reform or the Roe v. Wade abortion case, because he is considered a conservative judge.
During the hearings, Kavanaugh did not answer questions about whether he would reverse certain previous Supreme Court rulings.
"It must not happen that a hysterical, biased person has to take up a job as a judge and expect us to say 'yes, it's not just great,'" Pelosi said.
And women have to use it.
It's a fair outcome, months and years of anger, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's abnormal, do you?"
She continued: “I got great support from a woman who was the boss, who said that she also cried when she got angry, but that she developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, ‘You might think I’m sorry because I’m crying.
But I'm angry."
And then she just kept on.
And I thought it was brilliant.”
Tears are allowed as an expression of anger, partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories is from one of my first jobs in an office with an overweight male, where I often cried out of anger, where I was taken by the neck of an elderly woman – a cold boss that I had always been a little afraid of – and pulled out the stairs.
"You must never let them see you cry," she said to me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They'll think you're sorry, and they'll accept that they got you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a member of the Colorado Congress of Democrats, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was revealed to be having an affair on a boat called Monkey Business and resigned as a candidate, Schroeder was really frustrated and came to the conclusion that she might as well run for president herself.
"It wasn't a very thoughtful decision," she said laughing to me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the run-up, and they certainly did not need another candidate.
Some called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because it was late in the election campaign, she was lagging behind with fundraising, so she promised she would not participate unless she raised $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 to men, only gave her $250.
"Do they think I'll get a discount?" she thought.
When she made a speech stating that she would not run, she was overwhelmed with emotions — gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to raise money and reach out to voters instead of voters, and anger at sexism — that she got a lump in the throat.
"You could think I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalled how the press reacted to her.
"You would think I was sponsored by Kleenex.
I remember thinking, what are you going to write on my tombstone?
“She was crying?”
How the US-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The opening rounds of the trade war between the United States and China were loud, and although the battle is far from over, divisions between the countries may be beneficial for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by imposing tariffs on key Chinese exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation this week with new customs duties affecting goods worth $200 billion applies, in principle, to half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Beijing has retaliated every time, most recently by imposing tariffs of 5-10% on US goods for $60 billion.
China has vowed to follow the United States all the way, and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to give in for the time being.
If it causes Washington to withdraw its demands, it means that they will give in, but for China’s President Xi Jinping, it will be far too embarrassing to bow to the United States.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the US pressure in the trade war could have a positive effect on China in the long run by making the two markets less interdependent.
“A quick decision in either Washington or Beijing can create the breeding ground for an economy that can get out of control in both countries, and it’s actually much more dangerous than you thought,” said Abigail Grace, a researcher focused on Asia at the Center for New American Security.
Syria is 'ready' to accept refugees, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for the refugees to return and asks for help to rebuild the country, which has been devastated by the more than seven-year war.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country were improving.
"Today, the situation is more stable and secure thanks to the successful fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to control the areas destroyed by terrorists and is working to restore a normal state of affairs.
All conditions are now in place for refugees to return to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorists and the unilateral economic sanctions that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since 2011 when the war began.
Another six million people who are still in the country need emergency aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would be happy to accept help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that the government would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries that helped support the rebellion.
Europe secures Ryder Cup victory in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup and beat the American team 16.5 - 10.5 in Le Golf National outside Paris.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a single Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the trophy back when Captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn's team reached the 14.5 points it required to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had a hard time in most of the tournament, shot his drift in the lake on par 3 on the 16th hole, causing him to lose the match against Francesco Molinari.
Italian Molinari performed well in all rounds, becoming 1 out of a total of 4 players who have scored 5-0-0 since 1979, when the tournament's current format started.
American Jordan Spieth was sent out with 5&4 by the lowest ranked European player, Danish Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen.
No. 1 in the world rankings, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Veteran with eight Ryder Cups in his baggage, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the tournament's most winning European with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't do for it.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm really happy to get the trophy back.
It's a team effort and I'm glad I could help," said Garcia after the European victory.
He sends the torch to his compatriot John Ram, who fell the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single match on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods. I followed him as a child," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a Ryder Cup history of 13-21-3.
It’s a funny statistic for one of the best golfers ever to win 14 major titles, surpassed only by Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had trouble finding shape all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who had a solid game throughout the tournament.
American captain Jim Furyk said after his team's disappointing performance: "I'm proud of the boys, because they fought for the cause.
There was still time this morning when we gave Europe countermeasures.
We lost.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
All 12 of his players played really well.
We will regroup, and I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and then we will move on.
I love the 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to lighten the hat.
We were defeated.”
