The Prague Stock Exchange falls to a minus against closing of business.
After the steep drop in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange was able to correct the losses.
The transactions with the shares of <0xC4><0x8C>EZ reached almost half of the normal day-to-day business.
The Prague Stock Exchange began trading on Tuesday with the collapse on Monday, when it dropped by another six percentage points.
This time it was the reason for the break-in on Wall Street.
Also in the Czech Republic, the market’s reaction to the result of the vote of the American House of Representatives, which it had refused to support a stabilization plan for the financial sector there, is evident.
Fall of shares in Asia
Stocks on the stock exchanges in Asia experienced a dramatic fall on Tuesday, although the indices were able to offset some of the losses over the course of the day.
The index of the Hang Seng stock exchange in Hong Kong lost almost four percentage points over the course of the business day, but was later able to compensate for some of the losses, thus reducing the decline to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which monitors the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong stock exchange, fell by 3.8 percent, while markets were closed in Shanghai.
The stocks on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but then reduced the losses to 4.3 percent.
The stock market in Taiwan fell by 3.6 percent after the index there.
"The timing of the rescue operation in the US is uncertain and will affect financial markets worldwide," Hong Kong Monetary Authority chief Joseph Yam said in a statement.
Hong Kong, although it belongs to China, determines its monetary policy itself, i.e. independently of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as those in the United States.
U.S. legislators should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and pass the draft support for the financial system.
Otherwise, other countries could also be affected by the collapse.
A bloodbath of American stocks
The U.S. House of Representatives on Monday rejected the plan to support the financial system, for which up to $700 billion (almost 12 trillion K<0xC4><0x8D>) was to be spent.
Legislators thus ignored President George Bush’s request to support the plan.
In Bush’s view, the plan would regulate the underlying causes of the financial crisis, thus helping to stabilize the entire economy.
The U.S. stocks experienced a bloodbath on Monday, and the main stock indices recorded the largest decline in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones Index fell by nearly seven percent, a similar decline he had most recently seen in 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but there were hardly any signs that the draft would not pass in the House of Representatives, the index experienced a free fall.
Congress Makes Concession: U.S. Government May Pump $700 Billion into Banks
The top representatives of the U.S. Congress and the administration of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of agreement on financial assistance for the American financial system.
The vote is scheduled for early next week.
American lawmakers reached a breakthrough in talks on the adoption of a $700 billion bailout plan for the American financial system.
However, this does not mean a victory.
Congressmen have to negotiate some details of the agreement before they can publish the final version of the law and vote on it.
The plan to support the financial system will be negotiated in the U.S. Congress on Monday.
On Sunday, the chairman of the Banking and Financial Services Committee, Barney Frank, told Reuters.
According to various reports, the plan could probably be voted on by Wednesday at the earliest.
According to economists, an announcement that the plan will be adopted should be the first significant psychological factor for a revival of financial markets.
After that, however, there will be a "disillusionment" due to the complicated mechanisms that could be used to help the markets in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made significant progress.
We have clarified our different views on what a package should look like to stabilize the market," said Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, told Bloomberg.
According to her, there could be a final vote on Sunday.
Legislators met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Sunday night to give the government fund its final form.
This provides for the purchase of unsold mortgage assets from the financial companies, plunging the financial companies into serious losses and endangering the stability of the entire system.
"We are on the verge of reaching a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and that must also be effective in the market.
You have to continue the recovery plan, but I think we're on target," Paulson said.
A signal for Asian business
The global financial crisis is also clearly reflected in the stock markets, which are falling sharply.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are trying to reach a final agreement in Congress before Sunday.
This is to reassure investors of business in Asian financial markets, which are in the first time zone, where a decision by Congress could affect business on Monday.
However, it is not yet quite clear when both chambers of the American Congress will vote on the law, and it is also unclear whether the negotiations at the last minute could still fail due to a problem.
Legislators hope it will be adopted in the next few days.
But the law will see some changes.
The total amount intended to assist the system shall be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion should be made available as soon as possible, as President George Bush demanded.
Congress can, however, block the disbursement of the remaining money if it has the impression that the program is not performing its function, with another $100 billion and later the final $350 billion.
Bush says progress in negotiations is positive
Although the president has a veto on this decision, Congress can override his veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program has persisted, which was based on obtaining finance for the purchase of bad mortgage securities whose value has fallen because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repay their mortgages.
"We've worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday, the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
President Bush was also pleased with the progress made.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said Bush was satisfied with Saturday's progress and "appreciates the bilateral effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy."
Restriction of golden parachutes
The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Christopher Dodd, the senior negotiator, said the legislators had agreed on responsibility for the money program, taxpayer protection from losses, the conclusion of benefits, and a schedule for financing the plan.
The new law also aims to restrict the so-called golden parachutes for directors of the companies involved in the program and sets up a committee that will be responsible for overseeing the fund.
This is to be led by the Ministry of Finance.
“We’ve worked very hard and made a great progress towards a deal that works and is important to the market and to all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also expects help for homeowners who have problems repaying their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new installments on mortgages that it buys up, with the goal being to lower the monthly costs for the debtors and allow them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological help
According to Patria Finance chief economist David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but it will be very difficult to implement.
“And that’s because you don’t know by what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets are purchased.
That will be crucial to how the financial sector and the government divide the losses among themselves," Marek told iHNed.cz server this week.
Whether the plan will be adopted now or at the beginning of next week is not decisive in Marek’s view.
"It is much more important that Congressmen agree to support the plan and adopt it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement for a farewell is the most important thing at this moment," said Marek.
Duel on knife cutting edge: MP3 player against mobile phones.
We advise you on your choice
While almost every mobile phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can still make calls.
So, of course, it looks like it’s better to just buy a phone.
Nevertheless, there are plenty of reasons why you should buy a standalone player.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and the claims of the future owner.
Surely you hardly buy yourself a great expensive turntable at home to listen to the latest album by Maxim Turbulenc.
Once, such musical novelties do not appear on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view, there is no objective reason for this.
However, if you have LPs with art rock, jazz or blues on the shelf, you probably dream of at least one.
This is also the case with music on the go, i.e. with compressed music, in a simplified way - music in MP3 format.
Here, too, there are price and quality categories.
For one, it may not be acceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a player, but just as a Pink Floyd fan will hardly be able to handle headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes between which there is enough space for everyone.
The selection is wide.
The life of the batteries is also crucial.
Some good music players can play a lot more than just music, but what mobile phones can do, they don’t even create in hints.
No modern device can be used as universally as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, calling and simsing, it can play music and videos, record both, it has a better, sometimes a worse camera and maybe can also navigate.
And if you still include the smartphones and communicators, you almost have a small computer in your pocket.
It’s a small miracle, because no refrigerator can grill and no TV can photograph.
However, the universality of mobile phones also brings disadvantages.
However, the more features you use on your phone, the more often you will need to recharge it.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy eaters.
Few phones can play music for more than ten to twelve hours, usually much less.
In this regard, Music Players (especially the simplest) are significantly more powerful.
That’s why you should expect the cheap phones to be able to play no more than a few hours of music.
If you are still on the phone from time to time, you prefer to buy a charger for the office - this also applies to more expensive devices.
With MP3 players, you won’t have this problem, even the less good ones will last at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation with one time charging off.
There is another problem when you want to overplay the music on your mobile phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the devices have a USB port, and not every phone can be connected directly to a PC without special software.
Of course, you can play the music directly on a storage medium, but only a few card readers can cope with the tiny memory cards used in mobile phones without reduction.
With players, you don’t need any special software, except for the iPod.
You only need to feed the device with music from your PC via USB port.
Most mobile phones and players create their own music library, arranged by the name of the performer, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the user rating.
Some devices only represent the tree structure of the address directory, similar to the Windows Explorer, some can do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobile phones can do more
When choosing a specific device, you should inquire in particular about the life of the battery, the storage capacity, the quality and the type of sound and, of course, also the ease of use.
If music is primarily a backdrop for you and you only hear it every day for a short time, for example on the tram, then any mobile phone that plays MP3 files is enough.
Which almost every cell phone can do.
You also don’t have to control which music formats a phone or player can process.
MP3 creates all, and most of the music you get will just be in this format.
The format is one of the most common, and most devices can also play music in WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format that Apple and its iPods use).
Better mobile phones also allow you to buy music online.
All you have to do is access the corresponding pages of a provider (or another provider) via mobile Internet, and you can already purchase a song or album.
This service in and of itself can be a striking argument for why you should buy a music phone.
Unfortunately, the offer of the providers is poor and is usually limited to fast radio hits.
The prices are also not the lowest.
In general, however, it is assumed that this type of music sales (be it via GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people carry their phones with them.
If you feel like listening to something, grab the phone in the jacket pocket while the player is forgotten at home.
However, it depends on whether you always carry headphones or at least one wireless hands-free device with you.
If not, you can access the built-in speaker that almost every phone has, but only the fewest MP3 players.
Probably the biggest advantage of music phones will be in the price for many.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand crowns.
For three and four thousand crowns, you’ll get a decent walkman.
The biggest handicap for most people will be that there are no normal headphones.
The best and most technically mature phones with a 3.5mm opening for normal headphones cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
The advantage of the players, in turn, lies in the ease of operation.
The simplest - and not necessarily the cheapest (see selection) - players can really serve anyone.
A minimum of functions, the similarity in operation with the previously normal cassette recorder or, for example, the turntable, is obvious.
There is no threat of a collision in the form of an erroneously employed mobile Internet and a subsequent horrifying bill for data transmissions.
Which device should you use now?
Even the cheapest phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable storage media (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even if you buy a corresponding card, two thousand crowns are enough.
But be careful.
In the basic models, only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are usually supported.
Only the most expensive can read 8GB memory cards.
If you already own a mobile phone and want to buy an inexpensive MP3 player, then go to Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max 2 GB), you will not have to put more than 1100 crowns on the table.
Being among the more sophisticated listeners, prefer to take specialized phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some from Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have standalone control buttons for MP3, and the ease of use comes close to that of a single MP3 player.
The most distant is Sony Ericsson, whose phones from the Walkman series have the same user interface as the individually sold MP3 players.
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, up to a maximum of 35 hours) provide you with MP3 players from the above mentioned manufacturers.
The first virtual provider is already coming to the Czech Republic this year.
Possibly
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite mature, the Czech providers offer virtually all the services offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, something is missing here - a virtual provider that forces the classic at lower prices.
Maybe this one won't wait long.
We have often reported on Mobil.cz that the Czech mobile operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
This was confirmed by the Telecommunications Authority <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, which pointed out that the price of SMS is higher here than in the rest of the European Union.
Following the European Commission’s final steps in the area of roaming charges regulation, it is so likely to be a paradoxical situation – for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
Why are prices in the Czech Republic so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, it lacks the competition that really makes a battle announcement.
Perhaps it sounds paradoxical, because in the Czech Republic there are three mobile networks and a penetration of far more than 100%.
The mobile operators, on the other hand, like to reproach the fact that there is extremely much competition in the Czech market.
The chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (<0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>) Pavel Dvo<0xC5><0x99>ák often agrees, who in the past had often said that there was no room for another provider in the Czech Republic.
It is probably true that a classic provider with its own network no longer has a lot of opportunities (by the way, it would probably hardly find frequencies).
However, there is another option – a virtual provider.
Particularly the entry of virtual providers into the mobile telephony market brought with it a significant price reduction, which the classical mobile telephony providers had to react to.
Even before companies such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile entered the UK market, there were similar voices as in the Czech Republic.
However, it has been shown that there is room for such providers and that they can really be successful.
It doesn’t take long to look for examples.
In February this year we reported on the launch of the virtual provider Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this provider succeeded in attracting more than 100 thousand customers and thus becoming the country’s fifth largest provider.
Behind Mobilking is the financial group Penta, which owns U:fon in the Czech Republic, among others.
The advantage of virtual providers is that you can focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to work effectively, virtual providers need far fewer customers than a traditional provider.
They do not require relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network.
In the world, virtual providers usually stand out as low-cost companies - they offer cheap phone calls and SMS, but often accompanied by a less extensive range of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a pretty good move to bet on a non-clinic target group.
This provider is specifically aimed at men.
"Real guys choose Mobilking - the provider they like and they can trust," said David Seibert, CEO of the Mobile Entertainment Company, the operating company of this virtual provider.
It is difficult to say whether a concept similar to that in Poland could also take root in the Czech Republic.
Vodafone Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD>’s press spokesman also doubts this: “The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment where most virtual providers are based.
In addition, it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the service offering."
In the Czech Republic, mobile operators say chanceless
However, it is almost certain that if a virtual mobile operator conquers the Czech Republic, this will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about an expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not look very hopeful.
Mobilking will be more likely to enter the market in other countries of our region," said Jana Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ková, press spokeswoman for the Penta financial group, in a telephone conversation for Mobil.cz.
Indirectly, it confirmed that the current mobile operators in the Czech Republic are not particularly inclined to this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything possible to ensure that no potential competitor arises.
Their interest in launching a virtual mobile operator has long been demonstrated by the Group GTS Novera, which wants to take another step towards becoming a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the corporate customer sector.
"We have a great interest in offering our customers not only fixed telecommunications services, but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them, we have already been able to achieve progress in the negotiations," said Pavel Kaidl, the press spokesman for the group.
Maybe better times are coming now.
Unofficial information indicates that the first virtual provider may be expected by the end of the year.
So far, however, this is surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence.
"At this moment, we do not assume that there is room for a full-fledged virtual provider in the Czech Republic.
The Czech market has large specificities compared to other markets.
So far, no subject has addressed us with a complex and serious project in this area," says Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88> from the press department of Telefónica O2 in his statement for Mobil.cz.
Other suppliers also point to the specifics of the Czech market.
T-Mobile’s press spokeswoman Martina Kemrová rarely agrees with O2’s statement: “So far, we have not found a viable and mutually beneficial project on which to build further.”
And she adds: “On T-Mobile’s network, hardly any virtual provider will emerge by the end of the year.
At this moment, we should already have a concrete offer in order to be able to think in such a short term."
Vodafone focuses its attention more on meeting the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> says: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual providers, especially in the area of cost sharing and infrastructure.
From the customer’s point of view, this is precisely what we consider to be the best.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile internet.”
The responsible authorities - hand in hand with the providers
The action of the mobile operators is easy to understand, another provider would be more competition, this would lead to falling prices and thus also a decline in profits.
So why should such a competitor be made easier to enter the market?
The fact that the vendors can pull at one strand when it comes to something, also proves the long back and forth about the creation of U:fon.
Probably the strongest pressure towards <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> was from the company T-Mobile at the time of U:fon’s launch.
This is also evidenced by the publicly available information from the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> websites.
Now, however, U:fon is just an argument as to why you should not allow a virtual provider.
Martina Kemrová commented: "The competitive environment of the mobile market has also recently been strengthened by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile operator.
Taking into account the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new player would place high demands on the market itself and, above all, on its services."
In view of this approach of the mobile operators, however, the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory authorities is surprising.
This is not just the attitude of the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, which unfortunately - unlike the UK and other highly developed countries - does not have the competence to interfere in economic competition in the Czech Republic.
It is exclusively owned by the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (<0xC3><0x9A>OHS).
This, however, related to this whole problem to its very typical attitude.
“The entry into the market of a virtual mobile operator would be possible after a contract has been concluded between a mobile operator and a virtual provider for the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
So far, no such contract has been concluded, because the offer of potential prospects was probably not sufficiently interesting for the classical providers," said in his answer to our question Kristián Chalupa from the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS's external relations department.
From representatives of the providers would not surprise such a formulation.
This is more than questionable by an authority that represents the interests of consumers and, among other things, ensures that no one abuses their position in the market.
In particular, when Kristián Chalupa adds: "Abroad, where virtual providers work quite normally, it can be seen that their entry into the market has contributed to a reduction in the price of mobile phone services."
Probably, however, pressure on the proper functioning of the market and a price reduction are not in the interests of <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
What is really shocking in this case is the almost touching agreement of the three mobile operators, which results from their reactions.
The question of whether it is really just a coincidence is obvious.
Just as the absolutely same gasoline price at the gas stations is certainly only coincidence and the result of a fierce competition.
"The Authority has not detected any indications of anti-competitive action in this matter, and therefore it has no reason to intervene in any way in the matter.
None of the providers has a dominant market position, so they do not have the corresponding increased responsibility for their trading in the market.
The necessary tools for opening up the mobile market to virtual providers are also likely to be lacking in the telecommunications regulator," Chalupa said in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of many contentious points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, drawn up by <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, according to which telecommunications is a single market from the point of view of economic competition.
In such a market, of course, none of the Czech mobile operators holds a dominant position.
However, some legal experts offer a different view - for a virtual provider to enter the market, the consent of the network operator is always necessary.
And the mobile operator has - logically - the monopoly for its network.
This means that it necessarily occupies a dominant position in a particular segment.
However, even if you do not agree with this argument, it should at least be a warning for the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS that three mobile operators are strikingly similar.
Complaints from a number of interested parties (including GTS Novera) prove that they encounter very similar obstacles in negotiations with all providers.
The transfer of responsibility to <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> is then a fairly common trick in telecommunications services, with which the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS distances itself from the whole matter.
This has been observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, the recently adopted amendment to the Telecommunications Act failed to enforce the extension of the competences of <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> to the area of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts had promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS need to know that too well, but they probably have other interests.
It's okay when nobody's looking
Regardless of the functioning of some pseudo-virtual providers, of which there are several in the Czech mobile networks.
They are companies that issue their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, but they are only partially public.
Usually, these are companies that operate in the field of multi-level marketing.
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others offer their own mobile phone services.
The price lists of these companies usually only go to the selected ones.
The joke of the matter is that the company acts towards the operator as a classic corporate customer ordering a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, he then receives special price offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar resale.
"Should there be cases that you describe, then it may be a violation of the contractual conditions that we will then deal with, which can lead to a termination of cooperation with the relevant society," Martina Kemrová replied to our question on this issue.
However, it is quite unlikely that such a thing does not talk around among the responsible persons of the mobile operators.
Especially in the case of the three mentioned companies, it can be thousands of customers.
However, no operator opposes such a procedure.
The profits from the activities of these companies are not negligible and, in contrast to the actual virtual providers, they are not affected by the actual official marketing.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> draws attention to possible problems: "The law allows for such types of speculation, despite all, the services of these companies are only used by a very small percentage of customers.
They must also accept that the SIM card in their phone does not run on their name, so they cannot have full access to it like the normal customers of the mobile operators."
That alone, however, should at least seem strange to the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>.
In addition, another question opens up for the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
If the mobile operators close their eyes before such a procedure, why do they lock themselves against a virtual provider?
It should be added that the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS has quite strong competencies to detect such activities and, if it does not want to, it does not have to be satisfied with the suppliers’ declaration that they know nothing about it and their terms and conditions would prohibit it.
When the Czech Republic is no longer the most expensive
As the text has already stressed several times, the entry of virtual providers into the market has resulted in a significant fall in the price of the various services.
In practically all countries where virtual providers have emerged, the classical providers have tried to prevent their emergence practically more or less.
The arguments they used were practically the same - a too small or too saturated market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In the highly developed countries, however, regulators intervened at these moments, who by no means sought to safeguard the interests of mobile operators, but those of their customers.
Whether through formal measures or non-formal pressure, they achieved the creation of the first virtual operator, followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are throwing themselves the whole case like a hot potato.
Based on our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that ambiguity in the competences is more than favorable in these cases.
But let’s not throw the gun into the grain.
If the background information is correct and a virtual provider soon emerges, the Czech mobile market may soon be back in motion.
If a provider allows the creation of a virtual mobile service provider, the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS will not remain idle when it comes to rejecting (discriminating) further prospects.
And the Czechs will not finally make more expensive phone calls than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, on the occasion of Czech State Day, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the national anthem Where Is My Homeland.
The anthem was newly recorded by the Orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Ji<0xC5><0x99>í B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávek.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo vocals, in choral version and in an instrumental version.
Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>ínková and Adam Plachetka took over the vocal version.
The editors of the hymn versions are Otakar Jeremiá<0xC5><0xA1> and Jaroslav Kr<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
On the server iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions.
For B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávek, the Czech national anthem is one of the most beautiful hymns.
Earlier, he had told Czech Radio that he had chosen singers with young, representative voices that are distinctive and popular for the solo variants.
"From the beginning, I tried to keep a clear diction with both and then with the choir, so that you can understand the text well, so that there is a harmony," the conductor said.
The Czech national anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov m<0xC5><0xAF>j first sounded on the stage of the Stand Theatre in 1834 in the original Czech play Fidlova<0xC4><0x8D>ka by Josef Kajetán Tyl, the music was by Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek <0xC5><0xA0>kroup.
It became popular, and people adopted it spontaneously.
The first verse of the song became an organic part of the national anthem after the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
It remained one of the seven state symbols even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
What does the "new" hymn sound like?
Prague transport companies are also promoting on a chip for the first time on Wednesday
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will enter the history of Prague’s transport companies as a date when the first passengers to embark on a subway, tram or bus will carry an electronic coupon in their pocket instead of a paper ticket.
These can currently buy about one hundred thousand people who own the chip card Opencard.
Passengers can purchase a 30-day, 90-day or annual coupon (valid from 1 January 2009) and have it played on their chip card at the same time, in the information centers and branches of the transport companies at the subway stations Muzeum, M<0xC5><0xAF>stek, Nádra<0xC5><0xBE>í Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice, Kolany<0xC5><0x9B>l, And<0xC4><0x9B>lis, Rozly<0xC5><0xA1>k.
The coupons have also been available on the Internet on the pages of the transport companies www.dpp.cz since yesterday.
The service was used by more than four hundred customers up to the afternoon hours.
Those who use internet sales can really forget about the output window in the subway stations, where they have had to wait regularly in long queues for their paper tickets.
You buy the coupon via the Internet, it is played on the Opencard in one of the thirteen branches of the city library.
“At these places, travellers also have a desk with trained staff at their disposal, which advises interested parties on online purchases and also plays the coupon on the map,” says project spokesman Martin Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>.
In addition to the libraries, you can also play the electronic coupons at self-service vending machines on the Opencard, which are attached in some subway stations.
What do these machines look like?
They are red, reminiscent of ticket holders, the passengers may have noticed them at the subway stations Roztyly, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are currently five of them in the city, but by the end of the year it should be eighty," Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD> adds.
The coupon is controlled by an automation machine instead of the driver
Operating the machines, which will work from tomorrow, is easy.
All you have to do is enter the chip card and the previously purchased coupon will play out on its own.
The electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the surrounding area.
So in the suburban trains and on the bus lines with the numbers 300 to 499, with which especially the inhabitants from the municipalities of the region of Central Bohemia get to the capital.
"In the trains belonging to Prague integrated transport, train attendants have reading devices that allow them to check the validity period of the coupons by time and zone," explains Filip Drápal of the organization Ropid the ticket control. This organization compiles the timetables for the Prague transport companies.
The suburban buses have card readers at the driver's checkout.
When boarding, the chip card must not only be presented to the driver, but the Opencard must be placed at a marked place on the side of the checkout.
This allows the driver to check the validity of the Coupons played up.
"If a passenger wants to check the validity of the coupons played up, nothing is easier than asking the driver for this information," said Drápal.
A passenger who does not travel on suburban buses and does not know when the coupon's validity ends can in turn go to the self-service vending machines, where the coupons are played out on the map.
The information about the validity of its documents is displayed on the display of the device.
The Sudeten demanded a referendum from the United States
In 1945, the Sudeten Germans asked for the allocation of the Bohemian Forest to the United States.
This is evident from a letter stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we would at least like to live under the auspices of the United States of America.
With such a wish, some groups of Sudeten Germans should have turned to the US president in 1945.
This can be seen from a letter that has been preserved in a private archive and which is now kept in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
The Germans of Krumau in the letter ask the American president not to allow the return of the "Sudetengaus" - which was taken on the basis of the Munich agreement by Hitler - to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and really want to be sure of the words that the American units are not entering German territory as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," a letter signed with the words "people whose destiny is at the heart of the Sudeten".
Since the accession to Czechoslovakia makes the Sudeten Germans - aware of the Czech national character - suspect that they would expect brutality, ruthlessness, incomprehension, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American President to take over the patronage of the Bohemian Forest for today and forever.
"We can't believe that, regardless of the view of a quarter of a million residents, you are allowing this territory to a foreign state that is trying to suppress and eliminate minorities and has contributed nothing to the victory of the Allies," the letter reads.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is allegedly the fear of revenge desires of the "Czech oppressors".
If the US President had doubts about the attitude of the Bohemian Forest Germans, it would be sufficient if he would initiate a referendum in the Bohemian Forest Gaul on whether the inhabitants would become part of the United States or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound somewhat na<0xC3><0xAF>ve in today’s knowledge of post-war history, in the opinion of some contemporary witnesses, it paints a good picture with regard to the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at the time.
Although the Bohemian Germans had to at least guess that they would negotiate their deportation from the Republic, few of them agreed to such a possibility at all.
Some waited for the United States and Britain to negotiate some sort of autonomy for the Sudeten.
Still others believed they could just stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who comes from Budweis.
He was used in the war as a Budweiser German in the navy on the Baltic Sea.
When, at the end of the war, he was taken into British captivity and taken to a prisoner of war camp in Holstein, dozens of other Bohemian Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that if they came home, the Czech would suit them," Chalupa said.
In his opinion, none of the German prisoners of war who had lived in Czechoslovakia before the war expected him to be expelled from the Republic on the basis of the Bene<0xC5><0xA1> decrees.
Don't you think - then pay!
An Emotional Campaign for Drivers
The most expensive action for safety on the roads in Czech history.
This would also characterize the emotional media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport wants to launch on Wednesday.
The authority of Minister Ale<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0x98>ebí<0xC4><0x8D>ek promises to distract drivers from dangerous behavior behind the steering wheel.
The campaign for 150 million crowns will run on television, radio, cinema, the Internet, but also on flyers.
It is intended to dissuade drivers from driving too fast and alcohol at the wheel.
And they also remember to strap on before starting the journey.
The campaign primarily aims to persuade young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
What is shown in the spots?
Especially stories of people who appeal to emotions.
This is also evidenced by the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign:
Don't you think - then pay!
The words "Don't think" are in capital letters on a license plate.
And in a pool of blood is the word "pay".
This means that you can pay for a moment of inattention with your own life.
The spots will "shock" the viewers until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can normally see images with drastic footage of accident victims.
It is expected that this will reduce the number of accidents and the number of road deaths on the Czech roads.
The spots were compiled by the agency Euro RSCG.
Sugar bread and whip for drivers
"For the drivers, the motto is sugar bread and whip.
Sugar bread means that when they drive in red, for example, they save time.
The whip is then the threat of a penalty or an accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk," said the traffic psychologist of the hospital Na Homolce Martin Ko<0xC5><0x99>án.
And that is why information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertising are necessary, says the psychologist.
Even less effective are, in his opinion, boards that alert drivers to a danger.
"If you set up a static board that warns of a danger, it will probably soon flow with the surroundings, and the drivers will no longer notice it," Ko<0xC5><0x99>án says.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
The chairman of the provisional Israeli government, Ehud Olmert, has advocated the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, if peace can be made with Palestine and Syria in exchange.
He emphasized this in an interview printed on Monday by the daily Jediot Achronot.
"We need to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, if not all," Olmert told the newspaper.
"We will retain a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to assign a similarly high percentage to the Palestinians (Israeli territory) because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that a possible return would also include East Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and above all does not want tractors or bulldozers rolling over his legs, as it happened to one of my best friends, will have to renounce a part of Jerusalem," Olmert said in an allusion to two attacks in the city in July, killing several people and injuring dozens.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the Templars and sacred and historical places", located on the territory of the Old Town.
“Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he said.
Deduction from the Golan Heights
Olmert advocated Israel’s withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he believes is an indispensable condition for concluding a peace treaty with Syria.
But this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"My proposal is not to make peace with Syria solely on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan Heights," Olmert said.
“The Syrians know all too well what they have to do to regain the Golan Heights.
They will have to renounce their current relationship with Iran; they will have to renounce their relationship with the (Shiite) Hezbollah movement; they will have to renounce the constant support they give to the terrorism of the (Shiite) Hamas movement, the terrorist network Al-Khaida and the Jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq,” he said.
Questions after the accident: Are stewards on the bus illegal?
The law does not know them, in a long-distance bus it is not allowed to roam around
In connection with the tragic accident of a bus of the Student Agency company near the Italian city of Padua, the question arises whether stewards and passengers are allowed to walk in and out of the bus while driving.
"If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of a steward is in contradiction with the law on road traffic," said the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The accident, which killed a twenty-two-year-old stewardess last week, was probably caused by the driver of the truck who crossed the bus.
The young woman was sitting next to the driver in the least safe place in the car, but she had two more seats.
However, a bus can also have an accident or brake sharply when the steward is carrying coffee or newspapers.
It also matters whether the bus is also equipped with standing seats according to the vehicle letter.
If this is not provided on the bus, the passengers must sit.
The long-distance buses of Student Agency have no standing seats; which the director of the company, Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, confirmed to Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
"We discussed this with the ministry, and this did not approve of the movement of travellers at first.
Later, this was withdrawn and we reached a consensus that travellers may go to the toilet while driving if they have their seats," he said.
The law doesn’t know a steward.
“There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of a steward – no legal provision describes this role.
However, there is also no legal provision prohibiting the carrier from providing services.
The law on road traffic only knows the term vehicle companion, but it does not define its rights and duties," the spokesman of the ministry Hanselka clearly adds.
The Director of the Department of Road Vehicles of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, on the other hand, believes that the law covers this problem afterwards.
“It depends on whether the bus also has standing seats in the product approval.
That's all," he stressed.
Buses are divided into city buses where there are standing seats and maximum speed is limited, local buses with standing seats and a higher allowed speed, and long-distance buses without standing seats with the highest allowed speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As in the plane, says the expert
BESIP traffic safety expert Jaroslav Ho<0xC5><0x99>ín sees no fundamental problem in the movement of stewards on board a bus.
“There are not many hazards in a fluid way of driving, the situation is comparable to the service on board an aircraft.
Again, it's not certain when turbulence will come, and the stewardess can hit her head."
"But if a bus brakes sharply, then of course the laws of physics also apply.
Just like on a city bus or tram.
The safety of the stewards must be clarified by internal regulations," he says, and also believes that this issue is not completely solved from the point of view of the law.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura is ready to cancel the services
Student Agency is the only bus company offering services from stewards.
The company employs about two hundred people in this function.
The director does not consider her profession to be risky even after the accident.
"But as soon as I get the impression that the steward's job is risky, I will cancel him.
Guests can get coffee and newspapers on board.
It would also reduce costs,” he said.
As an interest in security, the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin justifies the lack of stewards in his buses, but his company operates only a fraction of lines compared to Student Agency.
“We don’t have stewardesses, but we’ve been fighting against them from the beginning.
Sooner or later this ends with some fatal accident," he said to T<0xC3><0xBD>den.cz not quite a year ago.
It was an incredible tragedy
In the accident of a bus to Naples, a young stewardess from the Pilsen region, who had worked for the company for two years, was killed.
The Slovenian truck had probably turned off the stand strip without blinking and had blocked the bus from driving.
The driver of the bus tried to evade by a sharp maneuver, but collided with the right front part of the truck.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura denies that the two seats were sold for the stewards.
"These places cannot be reserved for long-distance connections, they are blocked."
Company wants to sue truck drivers.
With compensation for the young woman's family, the agency will not wait for the court ruling, but it also expects financial compensation from the culprit.
A change in law?
Not in sight
A more precise regulation of the movement of stewards on board a bus could bring about a legal regulation on which a thirty-member team of experts from the Ministry of Transport has been working for over a year.
"This has not yet reached a concrete conclusion.
Buses are also not necessarily on the agenda, rather the points system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile phones when driving", says expert Ho<0xC5><0x99>ín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of the stewards to be something that could significantly jeopardize the safety of passengers," said Hanselka, with the control of the safety of buses in the competence of the police and the occupational health and safety authorities.
Dusseldorf hopes rest on Frankfurt
There is no shortage of words in the letter of the WestLB board to the employees of the house.
By merging units of the Düsseldorf financial institution with the Frankfurt Deka-Bank, "the central capital market house of the Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe" could be created, the letter became known on Monday.
WestLB brought a "competency block" with sustainable profitability into such a business.
And in general, such a connection could be the decisive impetus for further bundling in the state banking sector.
This is how it is when a board wants to demonstrate ability to act in difficult times.
The WestLB is still under tremendous pressure.
Not only on the part of the EU Commission, but also through the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, which the North Rhine-Westphalian state government has only recently made clear that it is urgent to find a solution for the future.
However, the connection between the Deka-Bank, which Sparkassenkunden are familiar with because of its investment funds, and the WestLB has been the subject of discussion for some time now - also on the Frankfurt side.
Although Deka-Bank CEO Franz Waas has informed in the presentation of the half-year figures at the end of August, he does not see any sense in a merger of the house on the Mainzer Landstraße with a Landesbank, such as the Helaba or the WestLB.
However, the Deka Board of Directors, each half of which is supported by the Landesbanken and the Sparkassenverbände, has commissioned the Management Board to hold discussions with WestLB on joint business activities.
This could be the capital market business or parts of it.
The talks, it is said at the financial centre, have just begun.
Deka-Bank, which employs 3,000 people and is one of the most important employers in Frankfurt, is not the first time to talk about consolidation in the savings banking sector.
In 2003, it seemed for a moment that Deka Bank could merge with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
However, nothing came out of this trio.
The plans had hardly become public, the Hessian state government spoke out against a participation of Helaba in them.
The other two houses did not agree with each other either.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz instead went to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
But there have always been thought games about a connection of the Deka Bank with Landesbanken.
Recently, however, Günther Merl, CEO of Helaba, had spoken out against planning games about joining forces with his house.
Regardless of this, however, the realization seems to be ripening that a tightening of the various houses of the public sector is necessary.
Now that the state elections in Bavaria are over, BayernLB could be the first to join the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
This is not necessarily good news for Helaba.
If the pressure for further mergers increases, the partners will gradually assume it.
In the south, she would only be a junior partner, although she has so far endured the financial crisis far better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
In turn, the Sparkassen- und Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, which has a 85 percent stake in Helaba, has pushed forward a lock-in for a joint venture with West LB earlier this year.
Let's go to the North LB.
Such geostrategic considerations, however, are only one side.
On the other hand, the question is how the different business models of the individual houses fit together.
In June, Merl stated that the German Sparkassen- und Giroverband had not yet answered the decisive question of which business model should ensure the future viability of the Landesbanken.
In the end, there could also be a dismantling of West LB, which is of course not desirable there.
In the letter of the local board of directors, it is mentioned that a "total solution" for the house is definitely sought.
How this can be brought together with the combination of individual units with the Deka bank under one hat, will still be shown.
The second meadow weekend is known as the "Italian weekend"
For Elena it is the first time, for Luca it is the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena is with him as his girlfriend, and so everything is different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-liter beer barrel of the brand Kaiser, stands a massively built beard and proves to the about 200 Oktoberfest travelers how deep tones his throat can produce.
Elena gives Luca a slap first, then a kiss.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, the bus parking lot next to the station Puorta Nuova, this evening at 23.45 leave four buses, "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", arrival expected 6.30 pm.
Three buses are mainly reserved for Italians, in one bus only Brazilians travel.
In one corner of the parking lot, the South Americans are already singing next to their flag, they have already celebrated at night.
And so loud, says Marco Guarda, this is not for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with fur imitation lining and glasses with wide silver bars, belongs to the buses.
They have been going to Oktoberfest for five years, three tours this year alone.
At night, during the day on the Wiesn, back at 10:30 p.m.
Staying overnight would only mean unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
75 Euros costs the ride, the welcome drink with Kaiser beer, brewed faithful to the Bavarian purity law, the health insurance and the German-speaking tour guide - Marco has attended a language course in Frankfurt - included.
And already the buses roll into the night, on the Autostrada direction "Brennero".
There is no beer, not yet.
Quickly it gets quiet on the bus, the travelers sleep.
All right, they'll still need their powers.
It is held in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where a number of other buses with Italian license plates take a break on the motorway 8 just before Munich.
When Marcos group finally arrives in the parking lot near the Theresienwiese at half past seven in the morning, there are already 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco makes a final speech, explaining the attack plan.
First, put the yellow cap on.
On the left is "Oktoberfest", in fracture, next to the internet address of Marcos travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: "When the doors to the beer tent open, it's called running!", Marco calls in the morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the seats in the back of the tent.
"Not in front, otherwise we block, and not all yellow hats on the same benches, spread in the room!"
The measure, roars Marco, cost 8.25 euros.
And don't forget the tip.
"The security guards show that we behave well!
As soon as you leave the seats, they are gone!”
Thirdly, "Tonight get point half eleven back here!" Understood?
It's time to go to Wiesn.
On the way, a yellow cap ties to the trees, signs and even to the election poster of a large Bavarian People’s Party.
They want to be prepared for retreat.
It is the second meadow weekend, known as the "Italian weekend".
There is no exact figures; there is talk of 50,000 crossing the Alps and entering the beer tents, 10% of all visitors are supposed to have arrived from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police are reinforced by seven police officers from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which conducts a nation statistics in which the Italians take first place ahead of the British (about 60 missions) and Austrians (about 80) with about 200 medical care.
Especially popular with Italians is the Hofbräuzelt.
Sleepless nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
The German banking system is relatively stable, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück stressed last week.
How good that the politician used the word "relative" and also braided in that the German banking sector is not spared from the crisis developments.
Because it has now arrived on the weekend.
The Munich-listed real estate finance firm Hypo Real Estate (HRE) receives a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks in order to shield itself from the turbulence in the markets.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the loan aid amounted to up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>35 billion.
Hypo Real Estate only has to pay interest on the part that it also claims.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
Background is losses at the daughter Depfa.
According to a newspaper report, the state financer had refinanced himself extremely short-term for long-term projects for which he lent money – which is no longer possible because of the mistrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s cash reserve had shrunk by 95 percent to 2.37 million euros, and the equity ratio had also slightly declined from 1.6 percent to 1.45%.
The current income and net income from financial transactions had fallen to zero compared to the same period of the previous year, and the income from attributions to receivables and certain securities as well as from the dissolution of provisions in the credit business had fallen by more than 70 percent to EUR 5 million.
It was only thanks to higher revenues from reimbursements of downstream settlement costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group as well as from the reimbursement of interest under the Levy Code and from the business dealings for group companies that the earnings-minus had remained moderate at around 16 percent.
After his privatization in 1990, the former state financer had initially speculated with commercial real estate loans, which had then been outsourced to Aareal Bank.
Due to the lack of earnings in the classical state finance, the Depfa had become increasingly involved in infrastructure projects and the financing of joint projects of private investors and the state (private-public partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
On the value of the subsidiary, the Hypo Real Estate now has to make depreciation, which will have a "substantial material effect" on the profit and loss account of the group, it is called quite indefinitely.
The fact is that the dividend has been cancelled.
By 2007, it had been cut by two-thirds.
Hypo Real Estate has been a major state and infrastructure funder since the Depfa acquisition.
It is more dependent than other institutions on refinancing in the interbank market because it has no customer deposits.
With the collapse of American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, lending among banks has largely dried up again as banks hoard their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate annually needs short-term funding for refinancing for a part of Depfa’s loan portfolio – around EUR 50 billion.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the group's financing needs are covered by the loan for the foreseeable future and the company is shielded "from the influence of the currently largely inoperable international money markets".
From other sources it is heard that, thanks to the funds, the refinancing will be secured by the end of 2009.
HRE CEO Georg Funke, on the other hand, said that the Hypo Real Estate Group will no longer have to take advantage of the money markets in the foreseeable future.
The Bundesbank and the Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (BaFin) assume that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now secured.
This is to be hoped for shareholders and creditors of the bank.
But given the dynamics and uncertainties of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is even inconceivable that funding does not have to be used in full.
But the opposite cannot be eliminated either.
Since the bank was still facing bankruptcy late Sunday evening, even the at least preliminary rescue cannot calm the minds.
The share price falls by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
The bond prices, on the other hand, hold fairly well.
While the priority debt shows little movement, the prices of subordinated bonds yield more clearly.
Particularly affected are the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and, understandably, the maturities beyond 2009.
If hypo-real-estate bonds appear to have previously been a speculative investment alternative, their validity must be regarded as dependent on the stability of the international financial system after the sharp exacerbation of the banking crisis and the institution itself, which had only brought the crisis into the house with the takeover of Depfa.
As long as the central banks, governments and less afflicted commercial banks are still ready to support the system, a timely repayment of pensions can be assumed.
Or what hardly anyone dares to hope is that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the reports that overlap with the partial nationalisation, the probability of security has only become a legitimate hope at the moment.
This is especially likely to prepare long-term creditors for some sleepless nights with the decision whether to separate themselves from their commitments.
Short-term investors can use a final stroke to form a loss report for future offset tax payments on price gains in later years.
Sylvana and the Secrets of the Bento Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, is supposed to introduce herself on the first day of school at Tachibana High School, the girls start to laugh: The German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from manga - in the new exchange log she tells about Japan.
"The first day of school in Japan.
I was excited.
Even before the school, I had a bump.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and take the train to Tachibana High School for 40 minutes.
I had to find the way alone, fortunately I didn’t get lost.
The start of classes at the Tachibana does not seem to be as strict as at our home in Lower Saxony.
The students enter from eight o'clock until at twenty before nine a short meeting with the teacher, the 'home room', begins.
But before the class began, it was my turn to introduce myself.
I am not the kind of person who likes to speak in front of people, nor in front of a class of 40 students.
Because I didn’t have a school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt from my host mother, along with blouse, blue knee socks and black leather shoes.
So in this elevator I stood in front of the desk and tried to say everything right: 'Sayonara Where she Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and have my birthday in a week.
At that moment I was very happy that I had already started learning the language about two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class have all whispered, giggled and waved and I have constantly heard the word "Kawaii".
I knew that from my manga.
It belongs to the vital vocabulary of Japanese girls and means 'cute, sweet'.
Then I quickly moved to my place.
The girl next to me smiled quite broadly, she found it an honor that the exchange student should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite quiet, but when the gong sounded, I was assaulted.
Everyone was talking and giggling and asking me holes in my stomach - but it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
During the break, everyone unpacked their bentos.
My host mother had also made me such a lunch box - this is sometimes something different from the lonely German break breads.
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, salad of cucumbers and algae, fruit and a kind of meat in the tofu coat.
I don’t really know what I eat here in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely new.
It is clear that everything is really tasty.
Well, except for the salty pickled plums maybe, brrrrr!
The Bentos aren’t just lunch at Japanese schools.
It sometimes happens that a girl gives a boy a self-prepared bento, which she then makes particularly artistically - in the hope of getting to know the boy more about the break snack.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I wonder if I can watch this as well.
‘Why Japan?’ my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said:
“Because it fascinates me.”
I have been reading manga for years.
And so that I can better understand the comics and the culture in them, I also started to learn a bit of Japanese at some point.
So it was completely clear to me that I had to travel here at some point.
I also have a passion for traditions, customs and customs.
And they are very important here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I haven’t felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen.”
Even rats have feelings.
A rat or a scabbard flees in danger, does that mean that it also feels fear?
The neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
How can you tell if they feel the same way when they behave the same way we do?
The Internet magazine "Edge" has been publishing contributions by famous scientists for several years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove this to date where we cannot even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, we should at least hope, since all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we turn to other species and tackle issues of sensation or consciousness in general, we enter rugged terrain because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, she does the same thing as many other animals: she stands dead, fleeing or attacking.
Humans behave in a similar way, leading some scientists to conclude a comparable subjective experience.
But I don't believe in that.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
On the one hand, the circuits almost always associated with human consciousness include the lateral prefrontal cortex (due to its involvement in short-term memory and in the execution / control functions).
This broad region is much more developed in humans than in the rest of the primates and seems to be completely absent in other creatures.
So, at least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including the knowledge of who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to believe that man is even different from the other primates.
Another dramatic characteristic may lie in the linguistic nature of man: Since such a large part of his experience is associated with language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness did not depend on language, it would certainly affect it, so that animal consciousness, however it may be, is probably very different from most of our states of consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine what consciousness might look like in other animals.
If, as something internal and subjective, it can neither be measured nor, because of the special hardware, analyzed on the basis of our own experience, then its exploration presents us with great problems.
Most of my statements relate to the content of conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness besides it that should be more scientifically accessible.
One could study the consciousness processes of animals without regard to their contents, and that is exactly what happens in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially on the example of visualization.
But in this approach, followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, one focuses more on the neural correlates of consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: both may or may not be identical.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal cortex for the realization of visualization.
What is the result of the sensations?
I trace them back to the fact that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in a brain conscious of its own activity.
So what we call “fear” is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) occupies working memory.
In this way, sensations are closely linked to the regions of the cortex that characterize primates and especially humans.
In connection with the linguistic nature, there are fine gradations of sensation, because with the help of words and grammar, we can differentiate and categorize states, in order to attribute them to others alongside ourselves.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio suggests that sensations from more primitive activities in the body sensation regions of the cortex and brain stem are similar to Jaak Pankseep, who focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it may well be involved in cross-genre sensations.
Theoretically, I cannot disagree with this, but I think it is unproven.
Pankseep argues that what appears like fear in rats and humans probably feels the same way in both cases: But how can you check if rats and humans feel the same when they behave similarly?
A scabbard flees in danger if she too feels fear?
In my view, mere behavioral similarity cannot yet prove equality of experience.
Although the neural comparison helps further: rats and humans have similar brain strains, on the other hand, they do not even scrape a brain.
But is the brainstem responsible for sensations?
And even if you could prove it to humans, how would you prove it to rats?
I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even scabies (who knows?), have sensations.
But I don't know how to prove that.
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore emotional behavior rather than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, progress here on the neural level, if you measure the same in rats and humans.
As I do not study language and consciousness in rats, nor do I study sensations, I do not know if they exist.
You may think this is short-sighted, but I prefer to move forward than to constantly run against a wall.
I am a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Wasjunik said the preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees the decision of UEFA in Bordeaux as a proof of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to host the European Championships together with Poland," said Wasjunik.
“This is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still a lot to be done in both countries.”
In the timetable for the construction or conversion of the stadiums, roads, hotels and airports, the two hosts lag behind.
The number of EM stages may even be reduced from eight to six.
“We can’t waste time anymore.
We need to work at top speed now," said Ukrainian Federation President Grigori Surkis.
"Uefa will keep an eye on us all the time.
An even more radical step was taken in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish federation PZPN has been suspended by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and replaced by independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission had met at the request of Sport Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
"There is a serious danger that the PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules," Drzewiecki told Polish news agency PAP.
"We have assured UEFA President Michel Platini in a letter that preparations for the Euro 2012 will not suffer."
Several first league players had been sentenced to forced resignation for manipulation alone last season, after all, even the league start had to be postponed in the short term.
Disgusted Dennis Quaid strikes back
She wanted to promote a new film, spoke in an interview about privates - and now has trouble with the ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan outsmarted her infatuated Dennis Quaid as an adulterer.
He foams - and strikes back.
Late Rose War with ex-husband Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors now have an unpleasant quarrel with each other - in public.
In an interview with InStyle magazine last week, Meg Ryan said, “Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and it was very painful.”
The extent of the fraud was not known until after the divorce.
The reason for the soul striptease was Ryan's press work for her new film "The Women" - telling the story of an adultery.
Dennis Quaid's response to his outing as an unfaithful husband was clear: "Monstrous," the 54-year-old told the New York Daily News, that "Meg repeatedly chews back and reseals the history of our relationship."
It is also "unfortunate that the joint 16-year-old son Jack is once again publicly reminded of the pain and upheaval that means a divorce for every child."
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently became the father of twins.
And so his admissions conclude with the side hit: "My life goes on anyway.
I’m happy to have a wonderful family that is doing well.”
Prices of airline tickets and hotels drop
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, according to a recent study, flights were even up to 50 percent cheaper.
Flights and overnight stays in hotels have become cheaper again - this is the result of a study by the travel and financial service provider American Express.
The company analysed its accounting data from the first half of 2008 and noted a significant decline in the second quarter following a rise in prices in the first quarter.
Since prices in the hotel market have risen for years, overnight stays have already been reduced in many places.
From January to March, prices in 41 out of 48 European cities surveyed rose by an average of 6.9 percent compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The trend was most pronounced in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
American Express sees the weak dollar exchange rate as the cause, which has led to a "decreasing travel appetite of American tourists."
Financial centers such as Frankfurt or London were also more affected by the fall in hotel prices than industrial locations such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices even hold the record in Europe, with an increase of 26.3 percent.
The trend for airfares in the first quarter also showed an upward trend:
On average, passengers in the economy had to pay 7.1 percent more than in 2007, and fuel-intensive long-haul flights became up to 29.2 percent more expensive.
From April to June, prices for economy-class airline tickets fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but in the business and first-class, the price changes were much smaller.
In Germany, prices fell even more than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had risen by 11.9 percent, falling by 23.6 percent in the second quarter.
On German domestic flights, prices have even halved, according to the study.
The reason for the fall in prices is, on the one hand, the slowdown in economic growth, the company explains.
Demand is crumbling in many segments of the air travel market.
On the other hand, the open skies agreement, which liberalizes air traffic between the US and Europe, increases competition pressure.
Signs of the tense situation are the cancellation of unprofitable routes by airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that had filed for bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - in Europe alone, there were 24 airlines.
HSV beats Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods, the Hamburger SV becomes the table leader.
At Borussia, Luhukay still fails to find a working eleven.
By Kristoffer Klein enlarge break landing for international player Marko Marin.
The Gladbacher came into the game late and failed with a lift to the latte.
His message was precisely formulated, it went persuasively over his lips.
He simply knew he was right.
"We need the second goal," said Hermann Rieger in the hallway of the Hamburg Arena.
There was not much going on in the catacombs, the half-time break was over and most of them sat back in their seats.
Rieger has been a physiotherapist of the HSV for almost three decades, enjoying a higher reputation than some of the actors who have left.
And so his request was also heard in a responsible place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and agreed to raise his thumb.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg’s head coach Martin Jol.
His command will have shouted similarly: “Here with gate two!”
The implementation was absent.
"It wasn't all nice to look at today," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt would also have wished for it to be "relaxed".
The 1-0 (1-0) the Hamburgers owe to the header of Mladen Petric (11th); and the fact that very weak Gladbachers could not hurt the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol summed it up.
The Hamburger SV will be 121 years old this Monday.
On Saturday afternoon, the spectators celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the lightning table on the video wall, which marked their club as a class prime.
It's going to be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to classify this," said Marcell Jansen.
He suspects that the tabular interim testimony stands more for the unpredictability of the league than for the dominance of his HSV.
The team, with its late-committed additions - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petric and the promoted by FC Bayern - finds itself slow, but it can not yet shine.
"We need more flair and more dribblings," Jol demanded.
After the vote defeat
Wall Street is scared.
First news of the failure of the bailout allowed the Dow Jones to temporarily drop by 700 points.
It was the biggest loss in a day in its history.
Later, the Dow did something.
At 8:30 p.m., the world’s most important stock market barometer recorded a good five percent minus at 10,579 counters.
The technology exchange Nasdaq was down by more than seven percent at 1548 points.
The biggest loser at the time was in the Dow American Express, which lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of around 12 percent.
No title could win.
The shares of Goldman Sachs declined by nearly 10 percent.
Just a few days ago, big investor Warren Buffett took part in the company.
As part of the rescue plan, funds are to be made available for the purchase of so-called lazy mortgage securities.
However, the sum should not be paid out in one go, but gradually.
In return, the state should receive stock option warrants from financial companies, which could be redeemed with appropriate price developments, in order to reduce the burden on the state treasury.
Stock prices in Europe and USA in the downside
The billion-dollar aid to banks in Europe and the US does not resolve investors’ doubts.
The share price of the German big bank Hypo Real Estate crashes and tears the Dax down.
The US Dow Jones index is losing despite the planned rescue of the financial market by the state.
Spectacular price losses by Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have plunged the German Stock Index (Dax) deeply into depreciation.
Despite the bailout by the German government and private banks, the share of the Munich real estate finance company lost at times three-quarters of its value, while Commerzbank fell by more than 20 percent.
The Dax clearly slipped below the psychologically important 6,000-point mark and recorded a 3.7 percent minus at 5,839 points.
Stock markets all over the world fell to their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors feared that the US government’s $700 billion bailout might not be enough to revive financial markets.
The Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent to 10,809.25 points at the first trading hour.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the rescue plan, the vote in the Senate could follow on October 1.

Dark Matter Affects Flight of Spacecraft
For years, a mysterious phenomenon in research has caused confusion: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called swing-by-manoeuvres.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity may not be quite correct.
For almost 18 years, the Ulysses spacecraft flew through space.
Because of soon-to-be-frozen fuel lines, you are now threatening to die of cold.
Among scientists, a mysterious phenomenon has been causing confusion for years - the swing-by-anomaly.
The swing-by is a flight maneuver of space probes in which they receive additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as the Earth.
As a result, the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The European-American Cassini-Huygens research probe used this physical trick as well as the Ulysses solar probe.
However, what the researchers have been amazed at for years is that the missiles do not behave 100 percent as one would expect according to the ancient law of gravity.
Rather, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes unexpectedly get faster or slower.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They named him Swing-by-Anomaly.
Some experts fear that perhaps even Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity, which describes the attraction of matter by a curvature of space, might not be quite correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton still firmly believes that Einstein was not mistaken, and tries to explain the swing-by-anomalia using the so-called dark matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
"The anomaly could be caused by dark matter, which could also be very close to Earth," he writes.
Space scientists have only known about the existence of dark matter for about ten years.
It is apparently a force of attraction whose effect on other celestial bodies can be observed.
It itself, on the other hand, is completely invisible, that is, it does not emit and reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the calculations of the scientists, dark matter accounts for well over one-fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists abducted in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, the tourists abducted in Egypt should be free again, the Italian foreign minister confirmed.
The Sudanese kidnappers demanded a ransom of several million euros.
Six hostages were killed in a shooting before being released.
In southern Egypt, five Germans have been kidnapped.
The ransom negotiations are already underway.
Again and again Germans are targeted by kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
The European tourists abducted in the Sahara are apparently free.
This was reported by Egyptian state television, the Arab TV channel Al-Arabija and Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after reports from the Italian TV channel Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been freed.
We are currently checking their health status," Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian, as well as their eight Egyptian companions, are well and safe, the Egyptian state television reported.
The 19 participants of a desert expedition are already on their way to Cairo.
The background of a shooting before the release of the hostages remains unclear: according to an Egyptian security official, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six of the kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom," the official said.
It was “just a matter of receiving the hostages” when suddenly “this surprise” came.
Sudanese soldiers shot and arrested six of the kidnappers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The hostage-takers had demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money was to be handed over by the German wife to one of the hostages.
The daily "El Masri El Jom" reported, citing a German mediator, that the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the report, the hijackers want to release the female hostages after payment of the ransom.
The men were to be detained until the kidnappers had a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the report.
Abuse of Stepfather 'Leaded to Suicide'
Years of abuse by her stepfather has resulted in a woman killing herself, a court has reported.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, was sentenced to six years in prison after confessing to eight cases of sexual abuse.
The Truro Criminal Court learned that he regularly tied up his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between the ages of five and seven.
Trerise wrote in a confession: "I feel responsible for her death."
The court found out that Ms. Randle had committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on 1 April 2007, at the age of 34.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise had tied her up and blindfolded her eyes before performing sexual acts while her mother was away to work in a restaurant.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s and he moved back to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, the court learned that Ms. Randle, who spent much of her time volunteering for the National Trust, was prosecuted for abuse that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsay Quaife told the court that friends had said that Ms. Randle, who had been a zealous surfer and cyclist, had been "emotionally dead" since 2006 and had "given her life"
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
She is believed to have killed herself by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession letter ending in this way: "I used to tie her up and close her eyes."
“I didn’t force her sexually.
I feel responsible for her death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "You are an extremely strange fetishist and for her victim it must have been frightening, especially since she was only seven.
This unpleasant story ends with the victim’s suicide.
Worse still, the fact that it is very unlikely that the matter would have ended in court if she had not done so."
He added: “I take note of the impact, according to Stephanie’s father and mother’s description, their actions over the years have had on her daughter.
She would have been a promising, successful and happy young woman."
Officials responsible for lost data are charged
The BBC has learned that the cabinet official, who lost strictly confidential documents in a train in June, will be charged under the "Public Security Act".
The man was detached from the Ministry of Defence when he lost two highly confidential documents in a train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the weakest indictment within the law and there is no indication of criminal intent.
BBC defence correspondent Frank Gardner said the action was a surprise to many in Whitehall.
He said: “They thought this would be dealt with internally at the Department of Defense and Cabinet.”
The employee whose name cannot be named will be charged in accordance with paragraph 8.1 of the Act, the clause dealing with the secure retention of information.
The Royal Prosecutor’s Office recommended that the officer be charged by the Metropolitan Police for the highly sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he published contained classified assessments of al-Qaeda and the capabilities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken from his house to a secret place.
Housing companies face B&B costs
British housing companies could face costs of more than <0xC2><0xA3>80 million after the rescue of Bradford and Bingley Bank.
The government provided <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion to protect the deposits of Bradford & Bingley’s 2.6 million customers.
The interest on this loan is paid by all companies that receive money from investors, including the 59 construction companies.
The director-general of the Association of Housing Companies (BSA), Adrian Coles, said it was "intolerable" that the companies and their members had to pay.
The 14 billion loan will eventually be repaid once Bradford & Bingley’s loans are repaid.
But the interest accumulated in the meantime is credited each year to the 700 financial companies that accept deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Programme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing companies were included in this figure.
It is bitter that those institutions that have behaved cautiously ... are now being called upon to bear some of the costs of those institutions that have been far less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that each company would have to pay in proportion to the deposits it would hold, and that the companies together would have to pay about 18% of the cost.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the interest on the loan will amount to <0xC2><0xA3>450 million in 2009.
This means that the companies must raise <0xC2><0xA3>81 million for the interest rates of the first year.
Adrian Coles, the director-general of the Association of Housing Companies, told the BBC that he believes this is unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions that behaved cautiously during the real estate boom are now being called upon to bear some of the costs by those institutions that were far less cautious.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the records existed in 1945.
"We will be monitoring all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what alternatives there are to protect housing companies and their members from potentially significant costs."
The interest rates due in 2009 cover the seven months from the end of September this year until the end of March.
In 2010, interest rates will be due for a full year and that could be almost twice as much.
Since construction companies are bilateral organizations with no shareholders, their members will have to pay for the costs either through higher fees or lower interest on savings accounts.
Milk gets five pence per litre more expensive
The people of Jersey are faced with having to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will raise the wholesale price of its milk by another five pence per liter from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two pence increase in February, and comes after investigations by a consulting firm have been conducted.
Retailers should decide for themselves whether they want to pass on the price increase to their customers.
Before the price increase in February, the wholesale price of Jersey milk last changed in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh denied bail
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a bail request from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which means she could be arrested if she returns to the country.
Her lawyers said the court refused bail regarding the charge of extorting 50 million Taka ($729.700) from a businessman while she was prime minister.
The case is one of several pending charges of corruption against her.
Sheikh Hasina’s longtime political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh in the coming weeks, but her party, the Awami Alliance, demanded that the military-backed transitional government should first grant her full freedom.
Correspondents say that although her detention was granted to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear as part of her release whether she will be able to remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the Supreme Court’s decision.
"The Supreme Court has rejected Sheikh Hasina's bail request because it says she does not need to be granted a bail as she is already on parole abroad to be treated abroad," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
We will file a legal complaint against the Supreme Court."
Their lawyers argue that they need bail to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after October 17, an Awami Alliance party leader said on Sunday.
She was imprisoned last year after the army-backed transitional government took power, but had been released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
Concerns about the anti-police initiative in Afghanistan
In the recent anti-police initiative in Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children have not been vaccinated due to the violence associated with the Taliban, according to the United Nations.
The United Nations carried out a vaccination program in six provinces last week.
However, they were unable to reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
According to a UN spokesman, this was the case despite the Taliban’s promise not to attack or hinder the thousands of staff carrying out the vaccinations.
BskyB loses lawsuit in ITV case
BskyB has lost its lawsuit against the decision of the Competition Commission to reduce its share in the competing channel ITV.
The Competition Appeals Court has ordered BskyB to reduce its stake in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The Commission had previously claimed that BskyB’s share distorts competition and enables it to exert unfair influence on ITV.
BskyB acquired its share in 2006 by successfully preventing NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from acquiring ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that the purchase of the share in ITV by BskyB raised doubts about the independence of ITV, which prompted the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
The Virgin Boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the communications office of Ofcom have spoken out against the purchase.
BskyB argued that the pressure to reduce its share of ITV was an unreasonable and exaggerated measure, especially because BskyB had announced its intention to give up its voting rights.
New investigation into the U.S. prosecutor’s case
The U.S. Attorney General has commissioned a special investigator to deal with the dismissal of nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006.
The occasion was a report by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Justice criticizing the actions of the administration staff.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was driven by fears that the lawyers had been dismissed for political reasons.
Special Investigator Nora Dannehy is now to clarify whether the officials interrogated during the investigation lied to the investigators to obstruct the justice system.
Serious allegations including criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or clarified, Inspector-General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The appointment of a special investigator with the authority to force witnesses to testify was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began when the Department of Justice removed nine U.S. prosecutors from their offices in December 2006.
At that time, the ministry argued that the prosecutors would be fired due to poor performance.
However, it was later found that the dismissed prosecutors had not been judged worse than many of their colleagues, prompting many observers to consider the dismissals to be politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors were involved in the prosecution of high-ranking Republican congressmen, while others refused to investigate the allegations of Democratic electoral fraud.
U.S. prosecutors are tasked with investigating and prosecuting court cases for the government.
They may be dismissed at any time, but may not be dismissed for political reasons.
The then head of the Ministry of Justice attorney general Alberto Gonzales has been fired on because of the dismissals and has ultimately resigned his office.
A number of Justice Department officials have also resigned.
In particular, the Inspector General’s report has critically addressed the role of Gonzales by bearing the “main responsibility” for the dismissals, “abandoning” his leadership role and showing himself “extraordinarily disinterested” in the process.
Other officials, including former chief adviser to President Bush Karl Rove, have been criticized for their lack of cooperation with the investigators.
Meat Loaf's epic song to be honored
Rockstar Meat Loaf is to be honored during the music award ceremony "Q Award" for his epic anthem "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, who will accept his special gold prize during the ceremony next week in London, said he was honored to be recognized.
The song, which lasted nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track to Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
"Coldplay" leads the nominations for this year's awards after being selected in four categories.
The editor-in-chief of Q Magazine, Paul Rees, said there were some songs that went beyond such matters as time and genre, and "Bat Out Of Hell" was certainly one of them.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a powerful voice delivered by Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental part that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was released in the UK as a single in 1979 and peaked at number 15 on the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's "Bat Out Of Hell" has spent about nine years in the charts and sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose real name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered from serious health problems in recent years, one of which was surgery in 2003 for irregular heartbeat after he collapsed on stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel concerts due to acute laryngitis.
Later it became known that he had a cyst on his vocal cord.
Obscure street in town, often forgotten and possibly soon to sell
New York City has thousands of main roads, avenues, side roads, and other by-pass roads, some of which are famous and others just convenient.
Still, even for experienced taxi drivers and long-time locals, it’s hard to tell where Extra Place is located, simply because most have never heard of it.
This tiny street is located in the East Village and runs from First Street northwards between Bowery and Second Avenue without reaching Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a dusty alley than an actively used passageway.
There are no road signs either.
It is practically impossible to find them on a standard roadmap.
This street has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that recently built luxurious buildings on First Street.
It plans to re-pave Extra Place to create a clean passageway to the shops and boutiques expected in the new buildings.
Among the other admirers is the long-standing neighborhood, which says it is fascinated by the short alley, simply because it is one of the remains of the block’s past.
However, the city administration department, which is responsible for the protection and construction of the residential buildings and is responsible for the road, has no interest in receiving them.
During a meeting of the Municipal Council’s Land Use Committee this month, representatives of the City Council and Avalon Bay drafted a proposal for the purchase of the road by the construction company.
Still, the committee prefers the street to remain in the city's hands, and has asked for a new plan to be submitted next month, said Susan Stetzer, the district manager in the 3rd City Council.
"Only very little space has remained in the city's possession and we want Extra Place to remain in the city," she said.
"There could be offers on how to repair and operate the road, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want to keep public access guaranteed."
A few months ago, Avalon Bay announced that it would re-pave the small street and set up seats designed, among other things, for a café that the company would like to rent space to.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the road was made public for the first time during the session this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said the company wanted to use the road, but it did not necessarily want to own it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renovate this decaying alley and make it a public meeting place," she said, adding that the city itself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, spokesman for the Department of Building Protection, said it was actually the city’s desire to sell the street and stressed that the department’s task was to develop the real estate rather than manage it.
Compared to its colorful neighborhood of The Bowery, Extra Place has retained some of its historical impression.
Some believe the street got its name in 1802, when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was divided among his numerous children and a narrow strip of land was claimed by no one.
The back door of the music club CBGB, the punk rock monument, which closed in 2006, opened to Extra Place and the street is certainly best known as the backdrop for the photo on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
The patch was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
The road was full of scrap, rags and parts of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes.
Some residents, including the bloggers who write about the gentrification of the East Village, have rejected the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that this public property, as modest as it is, should continue to remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rarity – a virtually unchanged fragment of the city that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs the blog called "Jeremiah's disappearing New York" (subtitled "The Book of Lamentations: A bitter nostalgic look at the extinct city"), has published part of the city story conversation about Extra Place, which had appeared in the magazine "The New Yorker" in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at the time: "Extra Place is a small narrow cul-de-sac that remains dark even during the day and is characterized by rusted metal doors of warehouses, closed windows, and rain gutters flying past week-old newspapers".
With a few exceptions, the street looked just like that recently on one evening.
A rat ran through the back of the street, not far from the door that used to lead to the CBGB, where today there is a more expensive clothing store.
Graffiti were seen on the walls and an empty beer bottle lay on the floor not far from a fresh bundle of discarded newspapers.
Some passersby said they had rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested that the road could be polished up a little.
Fields, added that in his opinion, some people underestimate the charm of the street in its current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in places that were dark, damp, and disgusting.
Bilingual education debate: education in an English-language environment
In this issue of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of the candidates for bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, senior researcher in Caliphonic Studies and senior director in the Department of Educational Sciences at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs a School Choice".
Addressing Hispanic voters is a complicated task.
Barack Obama’s proposals on education are a typical example of this.
Obama’s election campaign mentions that “the likelihood of African-American and Hispanic students successfully completing school is lower than that of white students” – which is true.
To close this gap, Obama’s education plan specifically recommends, among other things, a bilingual transitional phase in education for those who first learn English.
Still, the question to Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which focuses on teaching languages other than English, contradicts his interest in reducing the gap in school performance.
Let’s take “Sixth Street Prep,” a primary school in eastern Los Angeles.
The majority of students are Hispanic and come from low-income families.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have recently been in the country, are learning English.
Nevertheless, in 2008, astonishing 100 percent fourth grade students passed the state exam in math at a good level.
Also surprisingly, 93 percent of the children from the fourth year of school were rated well in the English exam.
This astonishing success was achieved by methods other than those favored by Obama.
Sixth Street School places its emphasis on review and practice, on steady control of knowledge and an attitude that tolerates no exceptions.
Furthermore, the school practises the approach according to which the education is conducted in an English-speaking environment. That is precisely the point that Obama should take into account, according to school principal Linda Mikels.
This approach emphasizes the almost exclusive use of the English language in specialist teaching.
Mrs. Mikels, who rejects the idea of bilingual education, told me that the school would have a remarkable success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico. 12 months later, one would enter the classroom and not be able to recognize him.
"It works," she remarked, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like the “Sixth Street Prep” as a model for other schools with a large share of Latin American and other English-learning students?
The achievements of the school would make the answer to this question easy, but the educational policy positions within its own party (the national Bildunsvereinigungen have long supported the idea of bilingual education) and its own consistent support of bilingual education make predictions about Obama’s response uncertain.
While he agrees with the point that immigrants should learn English, he has recently trivialized the issue by noting that people should stop worrying about the legislation targeting “English only.”
Instead, he said, "You should make sure your child can speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close the gap in performance, he should carefully consider educational models that work rather than despise and trivialize them.
Oil prices fall as a result of renewed fears about the economy
The oil price has fallen sharply on Monday due to fears that even the American bailout plan for the financial markets might not be enough to revive the economy.
Crude futures transactions on the New York Stock Exchange fell by 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel in the morning session.
Since last Monday, the price has dropped by more than $20.
Over the past two weeks, goods markets have been shaken by both Wall Street financial turmoil and strong cyclones in the Gulf of Mexico.
After peaking at $145.29 per barrel in July, prices have fallen to nearly $90 per barrel this month, before rising again as a result of the enormous uncertainty in the financial markets.
On Monday, investors once again expressed concern, although congressmen had announced that they had agreed on a rescue plan this weekend that should be the largest in history.
This news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis is far from over.
In the last chapter of the growing crisis, according to a government announcement on Monday, Citigroup is to buy up the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation.
Meanwhile, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial group Fortis.
According to analysts at Barclays Capital, despite the tense negotiations that took place over the weekend and led to a rescue plan, it seems unable to revive the mood in the markets.
As the economic situation continues to deteriorate, it is to be expected that demand for goods, including oil, will continue to decline.
Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a statement to investors that forecasts for global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates had become extremely uncertain.
We believe, they continue to write, that the goods markets will also be affected.
"From the perspective of goods markets, we are most concerned about whether the US virus is spreading globally, especially to China."
The Bank’s analysts have revised their oil consumption expectations downwards due to weak economic growth for the coming year, and their oil and gas price projections for 2009 have been reduced by 20%.
Team record set by series in second quarter
Center defender Shaun Ellis thought he’d seen it all after running in the last eight and a half years more often than anyone else in the Jets jersey.
Then on Sunday he saw the second quarter, in which the Jets turned an unsuccessful game into a triumphant move.
"I've never seen anything like this before," Ellis said.
After a sloppy match between the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals that matched the bad weather, the second quarter began.
However, when quarterback Brett Favres Pass arrived at Lavernues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, it marked the perfect start to an afternoon where their evolving collaboration took a giant step forward.
Favre found Coles in this quarter for two more touchdowns, one time slipping out as an outs defender and the other time 10 seconds before the end of the half.
"I didn't make any special effort," Coles says about the passports that went to Coles.
“He is a super player.
Our vote voted, no matter what people think."
While Favre and Coles played catches, the defense quarterback took Kurt Warner apart.
Defensive defender Darrelle Revis intercepted an accident and turned it into a 32-yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens then caused a loss to Warner.
The last ball loss, forced at Bowens, was probably the craziest.
The Cardinal had captured the ball with 10 seconds left in the game when the Jets recaptured the ball and Jay Feely turned a 20 yard shot into a 34-to-0 lead.
These were the most points the Jets had ever scored in a quarter.
When asked to describe the madness, Erik Mangini, the coach of the Jets, replied, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
In response to both, because the jets left 21 points in the third quarter without scoring one, Mangini said, "Believe me, I enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A lot of points were scored in a short period of time."
Rested Gebrselassie breaks its world record
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has once again shown why some consider him to be the best long-distance runner of all time after breaking his own record in the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person to make the 42.2 kilometers in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the win on the flat course in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved his previous score of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, which he had achieved last year in Berlin.
Gebrselassie, 35, has thus set his 26th world record in his versatile career, in which he has achieved at least one World Championship title or set a world record on every track from one kilometre to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie skipped the Beijing Olympic marathon out of fear, perhaps exaggerated in retrospect, that air pollution could worsen his asthma problems.
Instead, he signed up for the competition in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions - in the sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the finish - Gebrselassie has won at an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since runners like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya switched to long-distance, the record time for marathon in the last 10 years has fallen by more than 2 minutes, since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in Berlin in 1998 with the result 2:06:05.
After his victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie told the press that he had cramps in his calf two weeks ago and was therefore unable to train for a week.
Obviously, he was refreshed after a break and did not return rusted.
“I’m so happy,” he told reporters.
"Everything went perfectly.
I started training again a week ago and had some concerns today, but in the end everything was great."
He was criticized – especially in Kenya, Ethiopia’s rivals from East Africa – for over-orchestrating his races, avoiding many of the world’s best marathon stars in general, relying too much on the race leaders as if it were a track race, and setting world records over the competition.
But this criticism hardly harms the size of Gebrselassies as a long-distance runner.
Accompanied by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie had reached the centre of the track in 1:02:04.
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi have continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the pacemakers had slowed down.
Just over three miles before the finish, Gebrselassie made his last run to separate from Kwambai, who came second in 2:05:36, improving his best time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi finished third in 2:07:48.
For women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now German, has completed a remarkable year by showing the seventh fastest result of all time at 2:19:19.
The world record of 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff from Great Britain.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko had surprisingly won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the games in Beijing due to problems described as a back injury, but has recovered to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her third marathon by five minutes.
She skilfully planned her run by having a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners torn out first, but outpaced after 30 kilometers.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia finished second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya came third in 2:25:01.
The pride and hardships in the life of the black population, in a city of a very special kind
Hidden among the sprawling amusement parks around Orlando, a few miles from the sparkling, noisy and gigantic bustle, lies a quiet city where the pride and complications of African-American culture come to light.
Eatonville, the first entirely black town in the country and hometown of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: "the city with 5 lakes, three croquet courts, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, more than enough guavas, 2 schools and no prison."
Today it is a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to commemorate the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet, in many ways, the city she describes – and which made her a tourist destination by taking her into the Florida Travel Guide, produced by the Federal Writers Project at the time of the Depression – is and remains a place of a very special kind.
Eatonville is as independent, prosperous and private as it was in the 1930s when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man who “knows so little about us that he doesn’t know what’s missing.”
Even nowadays, in a year in which a black presidential candidacy, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open talk on racial relations, many here are still tired of being watched by outsiders.
"We are very keen on how our story is told," said Hortense Jones, 59, from birth to a resident of the city and parish member of the city's oldest church.
It must be true."
Eatonville has long been defined as the paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is both a historical example of the black movement and a community of nearly 2,400 inhabitants, where the poverty rate is twice as high as the country’s average.
It is, on the one hand, a stronghold of literature and, on the other hand, an example of the – sometimes condemned, sometimes praised – black culture of the rural South, which has its roots in American slavery.
It is not surprising that residents here are both proud and on guard.
And really, the concerns about Eatonville's image actually started with Zora, as everyone here calls Hurston.
She presented her hometown to the world in books that came from the heart and were written in idiom, such as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1973).
Five paragraphs in the Florida Guide changed the city, which is very close to Route 77, a road that leads through the often-forgotten center of Florida, to the scenes of black history and human drama.
Freaking like Oskar in real life as well as in literature, Hurston led readers to the store of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more private affairs.
"Away from the street to the left," she wrote, "is the brown-white painted modern school, with its well-kept gardens and playgrounds, which Howard Miller always cares about, even though he can barely read and write."
She also mentioned Widow Dash's new husband, writing that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of any kind and whatever fits classrooms."
In just a few hundred words, Hurston associated Eatonville with self-government, but also with illiteracy, second marriage, and sex.
This was certainly not a travel guide.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by everyone.
"Zora described things as they were," said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls who immortalized Hurston by quoting the men who sang songs about her beauty that were full of sexual allusions.
She added: "Some people didn't like this."
Hurtson is still remembered here as a lively eccentric woman who returned regularly after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that when Hurston came to the city brewing, she usually did so without warning, in a noisy Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants, in a city that even today imagines something on her venerable style of clothing.
According to Mr. Franklin, most residents were intrigued, while many despised them.
“People were always happy to see Zora,” Franklin said.
But "she never stayed too long," he added as he swinged in his chair, on a rear-facing terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, in which Hurston was most likely baptized.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of print.
Together with most of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them.
Although she was once a famous author, a contemporaneous Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous tomb in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived.
In Eatonville, there was no big commemoration, no public readings in a big way.
"I don't think they understood their contribution in the world or their legacy in the least," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a biography about Hurston published in 2003.
The turn came in the 80s.
Orange County authorities wanted a five-lane highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the community's slow two-lane main road.
Orlando's suburbs had already pushed Highway 4 through the western outskirts of the city.
The proposal was made when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the fight against racial mixing brought hatred into the community.
“At this time, a bunch of white boys often came and they threw oranges and stuff at the people sitting away,” Mr. Franklin said.
“There was even a woman who was killed.
They threw a watermelon out of the car.”
In 1955, in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's demand to enforce integration by calling its decision in Brown's case against the school council "offensive rather than respecting my race."
Residents today say that although the elimination of racial segregation was positive in some respects, it weakened group cohesion in Eatonville and the self-confidence of its youth.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember - they hugged their teacher in the morning and they hugged their teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of the nonprofit group to protect the Eatonville community.
This could be sustained for so long, she added, until teachers and students were no longer coming from the same place.
"You didn't embrace his white teacher because he was a white teacher - I mean there's a cultural divide," said Ms. Nathiri.
However, civil rights have helped create room for more of Zora Neale Hurston’s—black writers, actors, and artists who overcame prejudice, as she did, with positive self-confidence and statements like, “How can anyone deny the joy of my society!
I don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker made her way to Hurston's nameless grave and began to fight for the revival of her fame.
Five years later, a highly praised Hurston biography by Robert E. Hemenway was found on the bookshelves, and once again made it a part of the American literary canon.
The highway project came at a time when Eatonville’s most famous daughter was once again in the public eye.
And this time Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The community began planning a Hurston Festival in 1988 to show what the district could destroy with the construction of the highway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January many return for the celebration.
A few years later, the district turned away from its road plans.
"The plans for a five-lane highway enlivened the city, accelerated the whole thing at peak speed, aroused real citizen pride," Ms Nathiri said.
Ms. Boyd put it a little simpler: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the highway project has contributed to a change in the city’s self-image.
There were more and more crowds, like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been going to church here since 1993, and locals began to re-appreciate the past.
Eatonville was included in the National Historic Register in 1998.
A new one-story library (named after Hurston) opened in 2006 on the newly paved and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Nowadays, Eatonville is still a special place in Florida: just 6 miles from downtown Orlando, it can sometimes feel like a back alley in the summer rain, as small as it was when it was founded by just 27 black families in the 1880s.
(It is 90% black nowadays.)
Outsiders in search of the history of Eatonville and its significance are often still treated with caution.
For most interviews, prior approval is necessary and certain things - such as the wall painting of Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a white man and depicting black men in field work - must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Ms. Jones, a brave, confident teacher with a fondness for dark red, still fear that her shielded community will be misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time that the Hurston Festival grew larger, an increased degree of home pride was also born.
Young people in particular tend to see Eatonville the way Hurston saw her entire race: beautiful, with all her problems, neither worse nor better and just as proud, creative and diligent, silly and mixed up as any other racial and ethnic group in America.
It is the sincere love for this city that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin’s nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who intends to return to Eatonville after college to work in the city council or the police, which he says might need some help.
And even the younger ones, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people who just drive through here will think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others,'" Alondra Kenon said on a Sunday after church.
"But if you actually stop and look at your story for a moment, it's a very beautiful city."
Here in New York we speak fluent financial latin.
At first glance, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan kept away from the newspaper stands and the huge TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn’t even realize they’re in the middle of a debacle.
They would never believe that above their heads, in the shoebox-like offices with the glass facades, bankers and hedge fund managers who have the monopoly in New York, have the worst horror working day every day since the stock market collapse of 1929.
The suppliers still push the metal tea trolleys along sidewalks with loud claps and carry trays loaded with muffins for breakfast sessions.
Latinos still roamed between apartments as human pack animals loaded with around 50 ironed t-shirts hanging from a yoke-like pole lying on their shoulders.
Office workers are still waiting for their breakfast bags at food stands on the sidewalks and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi on a weekday between 4 and 7 pm.
It didn’t feel like a crisis at all until Thursday afternoon, because of all the doomsday talk, I decided to open a new savings account.
Although I had decided to lay down my duty on the quiet late afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase branch, about 20 people were already queuing.
Not at the cash desks to withdraw or deposit money, but at the customer service desk where regular customers order checkbooks, ask tourists about the way to Macy’s department store and where new customers open accounts.
Most of the people before me, I learned later from Starr, my "personal banker licensed" for the same reason that I was in line.
Unlike me, however, they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks, in places from which they commuted, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had withdrawn money from so-called thrifts (a little like a building savings bank), cooperative banks, and those local savings banks that only have branches in one state and say they treat their customers like family.
Last year, 15 of these banks went silently and quietly bankrupt.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, went over bankruptcy management and when last Friday New Yorker drove home over the weekend, Wachovia, another bank that owns $440 billion in savings, was looking for a savings buyer.
Fearful of another collapse, the office and store employees who were in front of me brought their cash to a bank that is considered a safe haven, a bank responsible for most of the rescue purchases on Wall Street.
Quite ordinary New Yorkers have been acquiring a fluent financial latin in the last few weeks.
A woman who was on the phone in my Chinese tribal supermarket referred with so much familiarity to Lehman Brothers, the bankrupt bank, and their skinny-looking CEO, Dick Fuld, as if she were taunting a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, who's around the 50-year-old uniformed concierge of my apartment block, has gotten away from our usual conversational themes about Brad and Angelina and my grocery delivery.
"I now have all my savings in money market funds," she told me after my visit to the bank.
"I changed, I don't take any risks anymore."
Muslemic Tombs Defiled During Right-Slide in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a left-wing member of the Austrian right-wing Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter, a member of the Belgian right-wing Pertei Vlaams Belang, are taking part in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, 17 January 2008 to represent the organization "Cities Against Islamization".
They carry signs in the style of traffic signs on which a mosque is depicted, crossed with a red line.
Police are accusing right-wing extremists of profaning the grave in a Muslim cemetery in Austria, on the same weekend where extreme right-wing parties saw significant gains in the country’s parliamentary elections.
On the night from Friday to this morning, more than 90 graves at the cemetery in Traun near Linz were severely damaged in an action, according to police.
The perpetrators sprayed Jewish symbols such as the David Stern onto some of the graves, but criminal officials believe this is an attempt to cover up the motive of the extremists driven by hatred for Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is in any way related to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the grave profanation that took place as the religious month of Muslim Ramadan approaches its end.
At the same time, a round of conscience research is underway in Austria after the country slipped to the right in yesterday’s parliamentary election.
The FP<0xC3><0x96> and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, the two far-right parties with almost 30% of the vote, campaigned for a strict anti-immigrant law and some of their slogans were criticized by opponents as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, chairman of the FP<0xC3><0x96>, who won 18% of the vote, advocated a ban on headscarves and burkas, and even expressed his dislike for food that is generally associated with Islam.
At his last rally in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to ban the construction of mosques and minarets with the argument that these are political symbols of a continuous Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses conducted immediately after the election, which indicate that the extreme right is the politically strongest bloc in the country, indicate that this new development is based on young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Travel ban for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the glam rock star who has been convicted of child sexual abuse, has been banned from travelling to France and Spain.
Judges imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the authorities controlling him that he wanted to travel to Spain via France.
Police in Kent were granted a travel ban last Thursday after providing judges with evidence of Glitter’s criminal records for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the Ashford District Court hearing in Kent, but was represented by the law firm Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the Court reported: "On Thursday, September 25, the Kent police at Ashford County Court requested permission to prevent Mr. Paul Glad's foreign travel to France and Spain by March 25.
Paul Gadd was not personally present."
As required by the sex offender register, Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also notify the police 7 days before his scheduled departure.
Failure to notify the authorities could result in a prison sentence of 5 years.
Police in Kent said they would not discuss individual cases or Glitter's possible whereabouts in the country.
A spokeswoman for Kent's police unit said: "The Kent police will do everything necessary to protect children in this country and abroad."
"We believe it is easier to control someone who is in the UK because we have a comprehensive system to effectively prevent any potential risks."
"It is the top concern of the police in Kent to protect the residents of Kent and we are working closely together to monitor the behavior of registered sex offenders in the country to minimize any risk that might exist for the population.
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing 2 girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he was scheduled to take a flight to London.
But he said he was not comfortable and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not let him through passport control and he flew back and forth to Hong Kong after some time.
The Chinese authorities also denied him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officials insisted that he return to Britain.
Last but not least, he arrived at Terminal 3 in Heathrow on 22 August and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge District Court in West London, as Scotland Yard had successfully requested permission to demand that he register as a sex offender.
Glitter had previously been imprisoned in the United Kingdom for 4 months in 1999 for possession of images of child abuse.
According to the Interior Ministry, Interior Minister Jacqui Smith was reassured and satisfied that Glitter was prevented from travelling to France and Spain.
<0x60>I receive the master behind the scenes to capture his character,' Günter Brauer, photographer.
No heels, no ruffles, no costumes for the performance.
The nature of the great flamenco dancers who give up concentration and devote themselves to interpretation to get a relaxed look as a woman or as a man.
On the one hand, artists
On the other hand, personality
I look into private life, into those moments that are foreign to the audience, I know when I can find the personality-typical gesture, the depth of a stolen look, or the expressive strength of the hands that are worried because they are not entering the stage.
In his project <0x60>Flamenco-people', the German photographer Günter Bauer depicts the alternating theatrics of some stage productions with singers, dancers and guitarists, from which he was little known to the artists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of the flamenco representation on different levels.
The exhibition, which is part of the Month of Photography of Flamenco, <0x60>reflects the international importance of flamenco, which is becoming more and more important every day', explains the artist and makes it clear that <0x60>Flamenco-people' <0x60>can be any person, but when you look at the photos, the viewer notices that there are no typical pictures of artists on stage.
Normal people on the portraits are artists who are able to convey on stage passion, sadness, joy and thus move the audience.
In order to capture the personality of these artists, you do not have to take photos on stage.
Their personality and character is in their hearts.
What interested me was to create a personal atmosphere that would allow me to capture the characters of the greatest flamenco champions with the camera.”
Bauer, inspired by the festival <0x60>Cante de las Minas', set out on a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the image sorting function of the camera and the available material, images resembling classic photography were created.
The application of different stylistic means destroys the classical basis of the image, giving the image the modernity and the idea as the peasant understands flamenco: <0x60>music with traditional roots that changes and surprises every day'.
It is not only the dance, the singing or the instrumental play itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, who with his art seduces the audience.
The search for the essential, for a certain something that becomes visible in the form of listening, of being, is and was the fixed goal of this work, which will be presented in the near future in the gallery of El Fotómata.
Famous flamenco figures including Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others are among the narrow selection of nearly seventy artists photographed.
The project became an anthology of flamenco and will soon be published as a book, with all the portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer’s passion for portraits led him to take up this idea again two years ago and to realise it as <0x60>Portraits of the Veterans of Sport' (<0x60>SportARTproject').
Although the concepts of the project <0x60>Flamenco-people' are different, the photographer says <0x60>I like to photograph people, get to know them and put me in their state of life, be it for a short moment or a longer time.
I think that in the field of photography the portrait is the most difficult genre.
You meet or encounter people, personalities you sometimes don’t know at all, or they leave you alone for a few minutes to take a photo.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas.'
The collection of today's portraits of flamenco people is exhibited in the gallery of El Fotómata, which is located in the street called la calle de la Mata and runs parallel to the street la Alameda de Hércules. The exhibition can be visited until October 16.
Vargas Llosa admits that the Roma he is writing is “a fool’s daring.”
He does not yet know where the plot of the novel takes place and what it is about, but Mario Vargas Llosa persistently tries to advance the project he is currently working on, a novel with the protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland who lived in the Congo for twenty years and moved to the Amazon.
Yesterday, during his presence at the Hay Festival Segovia, the preferred Nobel laureate admitted that the project he is working on is “a daring thing” and “it all indicates that he shouldn’t have to write the novel.”
‘If I were sensible, I wouldn’t have done it, but I will do it and hope to finish the novel someday’, so he ended his participation in the festival where ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. Within four days he saw hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people who were in Segovia.
The author of <0x60>La ciudad y los perros' was one of the most outstanding figures at the third festival and made predictions.
Vargas Llosa, who won the premium of the Hay Festival and to whom most attendees gave their voice, is compared to the old edition of <0x60>Our mutual friend' and can be seen in the theatre Juan Bravo.
He was introduced by Félix Romeo and noted that he had an audience in front of him influencing, inspiring, inspiring, and noting that the Peruvian, possessing a wonderful memory and a great sense of humor, was not given enough time to review his work: how his vocation to literature arose from <0x60>extraordinary lust for adventure', from <0x60>joy of reading'.
The Hispano-American novelist admitted that there is "no way" to measure and how to know if books change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, a volatile experience," Vargas Llosa, who claims that it "evokes the effects of writing," stressed, "I'm asking each other more about the responsibilities of writing."
At the festival in Pozoblanco the weather did not play with: bullfights fell out in part.
After the announced bullfighters determined that the ground of the square was in poor condition, the bullfighting festival, which was to conclude the festival in Pozoblanco, was moved to yesterday morning.
The organizer, with the agreement of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, has decided to postpone the bullfight.
Thus, the festival was suspended from volatile weather, so that two out of three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday it rained, which is why the second planned bullfighting festival could not be celebrated.
The group of Matadores consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro Días and Juan Bautista, who gradually entered the bullring.
There was only a celebration on Friday.
The winner there was Daniel Luque, who cut off three ears and triumphed, after which he had left the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
That same evening, Alejandro Talavante hit two horns and an ear of the bull, which he had succeeded more by galloping than by his bullfighting art.
And even worse was El Juli, who passed through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without fame.
After fighting so badly, most of the audience responded to his second fight with buh-calls.
In <0xC3><0x81>lava, two people wanted to escape the control of their car, which was loaded with two thousand kilos of hashish.
Tomorrow: five minutes before ten.
Traffic controls in Ertzaintza, in the urban area of Armiñon (<0xC3><0x81>lava).
Two policemen called on the drivers of the car to stop, and they fled.
It seemed that they would not have to stop with the load of more than two thousand kilos of hashish.
The police pursued her and arrested one of the drivers, the 28-year-old man known as A. A. J., as reported by the Ministry of the Interior of the Basque State.
The detainee was charged with drug trafficking and forgery of official documents.
The incident occurred when the officials of the traffic police of the <0xC3><0x81>lava region had already completed the traffic control on the N-1 and drove past the town of Armiñon.
The driver disobeyed the instructions, suddenly increased the speed, and tried to escape the control.
The police began the pursuit until, after a few kilometers, the car stopped at the edge of the strip, at which point the drivers got out of the car to flee to a wooded area via a country road.
In the car, an Iveco Daily, the drug dealers transported 2,178 kilos of hashish, which was seized by the police.
The front part of the car was loaded with hashish bundles, which were later directed to other police departments for precise laboratory analysis and weighing the bundles.
In addition, the officials found that the license plate was “double” so that it did not match the license plate given in the car papers, which is why an additional arrest was made for falsification of official documents.
Ertzaintza City Police are continuing the investigation to arrest the second suspect, who, as already mentioned, was able to flee, but also to determine the origin of the confiscated drugs.
The 28-year-old A.A.J., who was arrested, was taken to a police station for interrogation and will be presented to the jailer in the next few hours.
Actress Heather Locklear was arrested for driving under the influence of an unknown drug.
Actress Heather Locklear, known for the role of Amanda from the "Melrose Place" series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the influence of an unknown drug.
A witness had watched her try to get out of her parking space in Montecito in a rather strange way, a spokesman for California's traffic police told People magazine.
The witness told in detail that Locklear pushed through the accelerator after 4:30 p.m. and made a lot of noise by trying to move her car backwards or forwards out of the parking space, and as she drove backwards, she grabbed her sunglasses a few times.
A little later, the witness, who initially had probably not recognized the actress, saw Locklear stopping on a nearby road and getting out of the car.
The witness was the person who notified the emergency services because she had “fear of Locklears living.”
When the police arrived, they found the actress sitting in her car, which was standing across the street blocking traffic.
"She seemed to be unoriented," so they took the police to a special drug and alcohol center to do a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was shown to be cooperative, excessive alcohol consumption was ruled out from the first moment. "Following the first observations of the officials, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of an unknown drug," the spokesman said.
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of an indefinite substance that could not be determined and was taken to a local investigative detention centre around 7 p.m.
Two months ago, Locklaer was released from the Arizona clinic after treatment, where she was treated for anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists that the Andalusian Federation of the United Left be responsible for the Silva case.
Gaspar Llamazares, the main coordinator of the VL and United Left MP, today assured that the regional association for education will be the one to make the decision in the case of the former City Council for Youth and Sports of the City Hall in Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of doing business with family members.
"In such cases, I am a great federalist, and the Andalusian organization will be the one to take over the responsibility for it," Llamazares pointed out, what approach the party must take towards the one who until now sits as a city councillor in the city council of Seville.
Nevertheless, the chairman of the VL defended the necessity of <0x60>transparency' in the possible investigations of the violations of the rules that Silva could have started: <0x60>The VL always insisted that such cases get the maximum transparency'.
With regard to this issue, he stressed that education has "a strict code of ethics for all public offices".
<0x60>Sangre de mayo': Hero Book by Garci
Inspired by <0x60>Episodios Nacionales' by Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Carci presents in <0x60>Sangre de mayo' the revised version of the famous Spanish uprising against the French. This is an admirable film in filmography, with about 15 million euros investment for the filming.
In this way, the cinematographer has tried to “represent a lot of personalities and social analysis”, which he has always admired in the works of the famous novelist, Carci explained today at the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long directory of actors.
<0x60>Sangre de mayo', with a film length of more than two and a half hours, will be presented in cinemas this Friday and later on the channel Telemadrid as a four-hour miniseries.
José Luis Garci, a great fan of Galdós' literature, assures that thanks to this filming his 'childhood dream' came true. This is due to Esperanza Aguirre, who three years ago commissioned him from the Autonomous Community of Madrid to film a film for the second century celebration on November 2nd in Madrid. Especially because the story took place on the basis of <0x60>Naodi<0x60>.
The total contribution of 15 million made by the Autonomous Community of Madrid for filming, Garci, as he added, offers the "unique possibility" with the help of decorations and corresponding clothing the image of "confused Spain, which chose the wrong leader for the fight, because the people had been brought back by the struggle for independence and under the rule of Ferdinand VII.
However, the Cineast regrets that one could not count on the funding as in <0x60>Alatriste' or <0x60>Los fantasmas de Goya' (twice as high as in <0x60>Sangre de mayo'), so some scenes from the script with Horacio Valcárcel, with whom Garci worked almost his entire career, could not be filmed.
For this reason, Garci, who was also a film director in <0x60>Volver a Empezar', has contributed through his usual way of working: he stood on stage to the actors, with whom one must first rehearse before starting to film and for those who had not done casting, he appeared to Kino to help in the <0x60>knowing' and in the <0x60>kino industry.
Many actors he encounters in <0x60>Sangre de mayo' have to repeat in front of his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, Oscar nominee in four nominations (of which he won one), is of the opinion and assured that none of the three candidates representing Spain at the Academy of Hollywood this year represents a young generation of Spanish filmography. Neither <0x60>Sangre de mayo', nor <0x60>Siete mesas de billar franceses' and finally not the selected film Lo giros cis.
Garci does not expect any awards for this film.
“At first you think you’re working for the offspring, later you realize it’s just for thriving, and now you’re happy when you’ve produced another movie,” Garci explains after more than 30 years of working.
Isabel Bayón recalls the memory of the dancer from Seville Tórtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville worships a dancer who also came from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: her father was Catalan (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and the mother Andalusian (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), she was born in the Triana district and when she was three years old, her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and an expert in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first fighters for the emancipation of women, such as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist, vegetarian, and advocated the abolition of the corset, which restricted the free movement of women.
Isabel Bayón was fascinated by the life of this woman, who left her mark on the dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe in the period between the wars.
“I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested me this role, which seemed impossible to me.”
“We’re not trying to tell you about her life, we’re trying to keep her spirit,” said the flamenco dancer.
Her dance basics have helped me a lot in flamenco.
For example, 'The Dance of the Butterfly' seemed to me like Guajira, or 'The Dance of the Serpent' like Tango.
Her dancing was sensual and I’ve been told that my dancing is also in this aesthetic area,” she claims.
The production expects two extraordinary collaborations: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing again for Isabel at one of her performances, as he did in <0x60>La puerta abierta'; and with flamenco master Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with one of her ex-students.
'Matilde plays Tórtola, a very mature personality.
I’m happy because she agreed to participate in my work, and I feel very honored.”
The staging also includes musical composition and the guitarists Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the vocals of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa el Viola and the collaboration with the actor Juanfra Júarez, he <0x60>s always taking over the role of the companion of the artists he was in.
This work also tells in a certain way about the life of this woman, who became known in places as far away as India, the United States or Russia, and also throughout Europe, although she usually lived in London.
“I wanted to recall her, because I think she is one of those women who have an enormous influence on a certain era and whose works no longer have any value and therefore she is even less appreciated,” says Bayón.
The performance takes place today at 20:30 in the theatre Lope de Vega.
The publication of the book <0x60>Diario de un poeta recibido casado' also includes the triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of <0x60>Diario de un poeta recibido casado' at Saint Stephen's Church (New York), in a place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in 1916, provides an appropriate atmosphere to carry out planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council for Culture to celebrate the <0x60>Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón's Jubilee.
Thus, the <0x60>triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' is concluded with the new edition of this work, with the international congress that takes place in New York, with the restoration of the house-museum of Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia and with the itinerary exhibition <0x60>Juan Ramón Jiménez: <0x60>Aquel chopo de luz', which was opened in New York in May
The Andalusian Council for Culture has also received eight hundred copies of <0x60>Diario de un poeta recibido casado', edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso, with the aim of making the person and the work of the Andalusian world poet more known.
The U.S. can't imagine it without Paul Newman
“Sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them.
This phrase comes from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in 'Sensation Reporter', and from the then-ruling notion of American cinema, which was abandoned, from all over America to Newman with his enthusiastic notion and followed her.
Look at how much it cost to win the Oscar.
And when he retired in 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
Nevertheless, it was a big blow to everyone.
“What one sometimes feels is much more than an expression, and now I have lost a great friend,” said Robert Redford, crying, “my life and my country were the greatest oddities of his life.”
No one was afraid to ridicule or exaggerate.
As the ‘father’ of cinema and homeland, he died in a sad moment of fear of terrorists and of the collapse of the market, in which the depressed self-esteem of Americans is in the hopeless search for reasons to regain dignity.
If in this hard time without virtue only a few people you can admire, you don’t necessarily have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For everyone, he embodied a platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered various losses as well as profits: from the foundation dedicated to the fight against drugs and founded in honor of his son from the first marriage, who died of overdose, to his own brand of homemade and organic products.
All of this is a gift to the country, where it took him a lot of effort to fight against a deadly food culture.
A wide wave of astonishment strikes house high over Hollywood regardless of nationalities and nationality.
The last James Bond, Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only one person died, but the whole era.
English film director and Oscar laureate Sam Mendes said that working with Newman was no more or no less than the peak of his career.
Russell Crowe, the evil boy who came from Australia, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
"The greatest of all of us has left us," George Clooney confirmed, perhaps one of the few who try to live today as Paul Newman lived: receiving high standards of righteousness, leading a responsible private life, far from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today’s media jungle.
But there's someone trying, and Paul Newman was an example of that.
He divorced once and was married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was faithful, although there were certainly many possibilities not to be.
‘Why should I eat a hamburger on the street when I have fillets at home?’ he often joked himself.
In heaven, he will be proud that on earth his daughters have the same opinion as his fans, which is not necessarily common in America.
“Of all the great roles he played, none was so proud of him as the faithful spouse, the loving father, the attentive grandfather and the philanthropist,” they said.
For the Olympic Games, the streets in Madrid are deficient.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to host some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the failure for 2012, it might be 2016 after all.
But I ask myself: ‘Are we prepared for this?’
Yes, we follow the example of the old roads, I say that it is not true!
It was described as the perfect road, and in my judgment, it was the worst road with all that there was.
Of course, this is a lot of nonsense, if you would take the evaluation into account and I could check it, such a thing would clearly not have come through.
But, let's go through everything from the beginning.
The nonsense starts with picking up tickets, which allows you to go first.
It doesn’t seem bad to me, but if they let you go, they should give you everything (including chips to avoid traffic jams).
I don't think so.
Here they only let you get the ticket (the first nonsense that is going there just for that reason) and (after an endless queue) there is the surprise! The T-shirt was only available in size <0x60>S' (a second nonsense because I need size XL)
Where do we live?
Or is it that after the crisis it was decided to buy only small, much cheaper shirts made of less fabric?
So good, things like this are a small thing compared to the days on the street.
Apart from having to go very early to get the chip, there is already a queue of at least 15 minutes and, moreover, you have to leave the backpack.
The wait took more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in the case of a road where 11,000 people are expected.
Eventually, as was to be expected, the road started and we hadn’t left our backpacks in front of it, even if it had once succeeded, but it would have been harder to get them back.
In addition, in those 40 minutes of waiting, it looked like rain, so there was the temptation to organize a popular uprising and raid the cottage.
I think tomorrow some 500 people will certainly have pneumonia and some like me will not even appear in the classification in time because of this chip I got, I can already imagine that the outcome was incorrectly stamped.
Of course, if you asked me for a perfect road, I would never think of that road.
So I think we will long dream of a city that is well prepared for the Olympic Games.
Microsoft looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the <0x60>Emerging Technology Conference', hosted by MIT, Microsoft has presented the progress of the new image recognition system and human interaction, a being of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, but capable of doing some primitive tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft this is a route planner to move around the company's campus while listening to what the system is doing.
Thanks to a camera and a form and face recognition system, this <0x60>receptionist' can recognize how many people are in the room, who they are and even remember how they were dressed, it can listen and understand the keywords of their conversation.
It can also categorize the attendees into the groups after the conversations.
In the presentation video, ‘the receptionist’ notices a third person, but she understands that this person is not part of the group that is talking to her and is not a company employee.
She asks if the person here wants to visit someone and answers that she will soon listen.
All without the blue screenshot
Impressive
This is certainly the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example, on the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week we talked very superficially about Microsoft’s strategy change.
Windows 7 will be faster and not have as many embedded programs.
Steve Ballmer noted that if the computers were equipped with the essentials, instead of filling them with commercial garbage, they would work five times faster.
Everything is just a observation, considering that in Windows versions, Microsoft added some function and <0x60>extras'.
The change of direction is worthwhile
The Microsoft is right, the operating system is gradually losing importance, just like the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the web, that was part of the theory that it was Google’s first step to compete with Windows.
Many have pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system, as an indispensable part, will always be necessary for hardware and software to work simultaneously.
The operating system performs the function that can be compared to the function of his wife or husband when it comes to telling his mother-in-law something.
That's right.
The system will never disappear, but one must think of his “death,” not as an absolute, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
Every time people pay less attention to the operating system, they pay more attention to the web browser.
The computer only starts to run Firefox, Explorer, or Chrome, and every day we spend more time browsing than in the <0x60>windows' environment.
What is the use of half of existing computer applications?
Less is more
And Windows 7 needs to be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
Easier, not so exaggerated, less complicated.
Microsoft’s interest is more in integrating its online services, which can eventually become the alternative to Google.
In reality, they need it, no doubt. I'll give you a small example of this.
I took the photo of this place in Redmond, in one of the recreation rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month.
Attached to the vending machine is a sign: <0x60>Your search. Our future'. It expresses a request to use your own tool for online search.
In 2006, an independent study found that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google for online research.
By the way, last week it was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 has been delayed.
It will not appear at the beginning, but at the end of 2009, rather in 2010.
Microsoft is looking for the opportunity to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 to market simultaneously.
Every day, the phone turns into a computer.
The Android and iPhone are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio wore it in <0x60>Blood Diamond' by Edward Zwick, just like Al Pacino in <0x60>The Godfather' by Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time, it belongs to the clothing of a well-built pastor.
If we start to list the countless Stars appearances, we can draw back to the image of a very powerful man, with a pointed beard, who had lifted heavy weights in a walking circus.
Basically, this is a typical male t-shirt made of cotton, sleeveless and waisted.
The English speakers call it <0x60>tank', but Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles outperforms all other brands.
First, because of its great name, although it is called 'Marcel' in the narrow circle. Legend tells that the creation of the name is linked to sport and came from boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of singer Edith Piaf.
<0x60>La Marcel' surpasses everyone for its excellent cotton, for its distinctive unisex cut and is characterized by a small Belgian flag (barely recognizable) that these T-shirts have as a detail on the neckline.
And beware, the Belgian company is not just focusing on the production of <0x60>tanks'.
They also have College Sweatshirts, Boxer Retro, Cardigans and Cashmere, Cotton Pants, Striped T-shirts, Babies, Mini Shorts
Modeled and comfortable underwear.
Although, it is a shame to use them as underwear.
They are very charming.
“I want to be a young mother; I don’t worry about the candidate.”
Her great appearance with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Mónica Cruz is small but full of joy.
At the moment, the siblings Gruz take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
For Mónica, this means much more than for some pretty and rich girls who keep their reputation.
She was in Paris at the promotion of the Mango company, moved there her residence and also makes the presentation of the most important prizes in fashion, which the Spanish fashion house sponsors.
Merciful and shy, winner on the short distances.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection for this autumn/winter season, which my sister Penélope and I designed for Mango, and I also attended the presentation of the second edition of the <0x60>Mango Fashion Awards' and participated in the dinner in Valentino's honor.
A very intensive working time that is exciting at the same time.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister and I are both fascinated by the cinema of the 50s and 60s; there we find many ideas.
I like to walk through a city and watch women dressed, combining their clothes, which I often do.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think yes, but in the end, everything meets in one and these areas have many similarities.
Ever since I was a child, I have been fascinated by the clothes; I always wanted to go to my grandmother to roam in my aunt’s closets and see her clothes.
That was great, almost better than going to an amusement park.
Even later, as a dancer, I always tried to pay attention to the clothes.
You know, we dancers like it so much to have our own style in class and rehearsals to look in the mirror and feel good about it.
As an actress, when you get the costume, you put yourself in the real actor role.
Finally, everything is interconnected, it is so, much respect for the costume designer and their professionalism.
You recently turned 30, haven’t you fallen into a crisis?
Oh, my God.
I feel better than ever, as a thirty-year-old I feel good.
I think the woman gets mature, has experience and can enjoy life with fewer mistakes.
I'm not afraid of my biological clock.
I have done the things I wanted to do since I was a kid and that gave me a lot of inner joy.
So, you're thinking of becoming a mother, aren't you?
For a long time I have known that I am going to be a mother, because my body demands it, and I want to be a young mother; I don’t want to miss that.
As for the candidate, I am not worried.
I will convey to my child great feelings of happiness and educate him with a lot of love.
As far as film art is concerned, you keep an eye on the works you participated in and which were filmed last year.
That’s exactly what it is and I really want it to be presented to the public.
I, as a woman who comes from the theater, am very impatient and restless and want to have everything at once, which of course can not be immediately.
I very much wish <0x60>La última hora' and <0x60>En busca de la tumba de Cristo' to be performed for the first time.
Let's see how they like you
A couple of days ago you appeared on the runway with Naomi Campbell, right?
All right, don't say that.
It’s not that I went on the runway to model.
Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for some time, just called me and invited me to London to participate in a parade for the charity event of her organization <0x60>Women for a Better World' and the clothes we show. I know that two pieces of clothing from our collection for Mango were auctioned to raise money for Naomi's NGO.
People don't know Naomi's good heart.
I, as the one who knows her, would tell you that they're not right.
Nevertheless, I will support this good cause in which she is involved.
She asked me to participate in the parade for this generous cause, but if she comes and asks me to make a handstand, I will do the same.
To support women in the Third World, which is also necessary.
Drivers who may relapse due to the alcohol level will have to install the <0x60>Alcolock'.
The authority orders that the driver, who had three official penalties for the alcohol level, installs this system in his car, which prohibits him from starting the car in the drunk state. If he is alcoholic, then the car does not start.
The initiative was announced last month in June and is already part of the report of the Attorney General. According to her, it is a pilot project that will last for a year.
The purpose is the rehabilitation of the driver, which is why he gets a course for retraining the traffic behavior.
In addition to the Public Prosecutor General, experience has shown that the Ministry of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institute for the Safety of Automobiles will also participate.
According to statistics, between 30-75% of drivers who were reported more than once for driving under the influence of alcohol returned to driving.
The ‘alcolock’ would prevent this because it is a system connected to the car, it measures the alcohol content in the exhaled air and prevents autostart when the driver has done an alcohol test; or if an alcohol concentration is found to be higher than allowed.
It costs more than 1 000 euros, the costs are borne by the person imposing the sanction.
In this context, a study conducted in the U.S. in 2007 showed that cars equipped with these devices prevent up to 65% of violations in the first year after their introduction.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 lives could be saved each year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to tackle this behavior before it becomes a criminal offence.
And to facilitate their implementation, a lawful reform can be implemented in the usual way, and yet a reform of the Basic Law, which is necessary for the law enforcement process, is called for.
Still, the device is not available on the Spanish markets, in any store, although it has already been installed in some commercial vehicles and public transport vehicles.
Just tomorrow, the House of Representatives will vote on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers’ Party, which proposes to install this system in school buses, which has already been done in France.
In Mexico and without peep-toes
With British punctuality, at 17:40, at the time set by the program, next to the presidential hangar of Benito Juárez de México DF airport landed the plane of the Spanish Air Force, with the Prince and Princess of Asturias traveling.
The sun went down, but its rays still forced to use the hand as a parasol to see the royal couple coming out of the plane.
Directly on the Gangway: the Spanish Ambassador and other authorities
A few hours before, I had asked a taxi driver on the road if he knew that the prince and princess of Asturias were visiting the city to formalize the official trip.
- Ah, very good, so you can't take people at the airport at this time. They're from here or something.
No, she's the Spaniard, but she lived here for a couple of years.
- Oh, very good.
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the prince and princess of Asturias are and know the importance of the trip.
There are many waiting in the hangar of the airport and at the red carpet, also military protection of 27 soldiers of the navy, giving the salve of honor.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the princess, with long hairs blown by the wind, without ordinary "peep-toes," may have been told that a thunderstorm is expected in DF.
Before entering the hall, they smile and are prepared for the photographers in which the official entourage is waiting.
At the door of the hotel where they are housed, one of the four largest in the city, a reporter from Mexican television is waiting for them who likes to joke.
The best premium of fashion
Probably there was no better place in the world than Paris to present a premium of fashion and there was probably no substantially outstanding fashion designer and bonvivant than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion competition <0x60>el Bóton-Mango Fashion Adwards' for the promotion and international increase of young fashion talent.
This is awarded with a cash prize of 300,000 euros.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, saw her drawings yesterday in the window of the Mango store on Boulevard Haussmann number 54 in Paris and almost cried because of the emotional excitement.
By the way, this is the company’s second-largest business in Europe and was recently opened. It offers a sales area of 1,335 m2.
The largest store is in London.
So many events have happened that one would like to thank the fashion designer Valentino for his chairmanship of the jury at the competition, all ending with a luxury dinner at Opera National de Paris.
In the vicinity of many famous people, the board table organized by Mango seemed to be spectacular.
Nati, with the heavy heart broken by the pain of the recent death of his brother, ripped up. He put on the suit from the fashion house and wore some ELAH jewelry that was breathtaking. He held on to the arm of his son Luis, who is almost two meters tall, and accompanied Valentino at the dinner, in his honor.
Andik, the owner and master of the Mango house, welcomed the guests and was such a cavalier that he ended up with the Baron of Rotschild without jackets, because they borrowed jackets from the ladies.
Mónica Cruz hurried to the store and wore pants and a shirt she modeled herself, and for dinner she wore a long, black sexy dress. During a night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us a room for ballet rehearsals, so she got in excitement, remembered the old times, made a pl<0x60>grane' kind of a pole.
Inés Sastre, did not join the walk through the palace’s premises, but before that she had shown us her son’s photos on her mobile phone.
The next morning we could look forward to the presence of Oliver Martínez, a personality who always evokes a stormy enthusiasm, and Jon Travolta, who after his arrival (with his own bed sheets and towels) at the Hotel Internacional in Paris, asked in advance to have a room without odors.
The stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh la la, that's life.
1001 Advice against stress
There is not a thousand, but one more way to forget the chaotic and fast-paced everyday life.
And even if they are few, they are all gathered in a book that says how to relax, and the book will be in the bookshops on September 30.
The alarm clock is a punishment when it rings at 7 o’clock in the morning, but even worse seems the idea of getting back into the hectic rhythm that demands the current life.
The office is called the tension and the computer that cause the back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there is not one and not two methods to combat the daily exhaustion and the problems of how to disconnect from the world of work.
However, the number is increasing, no more and no less than to 1001.
In addition to yoga positions, the classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott presents in the book the entire list of possibilities adapted to the taste and time of each individual.
The work against stress is called <0x60>1001 ways to relax' and so the peace that the book conveys comes to the bookshops of Pearson Alhambra and DK.
Anyone who thinks that it is impossible to achieve peace in areas such as workplace with the help of personal contacts, this handbook refutes such beliefs.
In addition, the methods are offered, how to stay in contact with nature or suggest the 100% natural recipes that lead to relaxation.
When the adrenaline in your veins stops rising to restore balance and stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the sofa, shut off the brain and focus on reading.
Speaking in sleep
Some children talk at night
I do not mean those who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but the children who speak during sleep.
When it happens to you for the first time, at best you will be scared, but in reality it doesn’t matter.
This is a positive sleep disorder called speaking in sleep.
It is quite common, especially among children and adolescents.
Certainly, more than one of you was told that you talked at night.
This phenomenon can occur occasionally (once in life, for example, during high fever), or regularly (every day, once a week, once a month ), the next day the child can remember nothing.
There is no single reason that causes this phenomenon.
Often, relationships with other phenomena in sleep are sought, such as nightmares, panic anxiety at night, enuresis nocturna (wetting the bed at night), talking in sleep, but there is no reason for this.
As we mentioned earlier, it can be due to very high fiber, stress situations or overload.
In any case, this is a little researched phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is very variable.
It can be quiet speaking in single words, whispering or it can be quite the opposite (crying, crying, long discussions).
In cases where the utterance is very intense, it is recommended to observe the child and seek advice from a specialist to check whether there is a problem that causes anxiety and thus arises.
We’ve said it’s a positive disorder, so it’s not treated, be it, it’s associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, with sleep apnea or with stress).
What you can do is perform a series of simple preventive measures:
Try not to arouse the child before sleeping.
So, choose calm play for the child and avoid stressful television programs that are awful and a little too wild.
In the nervous children who are recommended relaxation, relaxation methods can be used to help them get some inner peace.
This will help the child to sleep quietly.
When speaking occurs in sleep, try to keep calm.
Remember that it is harmless to the child and the next day it will not be able to remember anything that happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake it up.
This is useless, because the child is unconscious, so you will rip it out of sleep.
Although the child speaks, it sleeps, so it rests.
Remember, if after a couple of appearances it seems frightened, it is recommended to get advice or find out what the child is afraid of.
If they understand what it says (which is not so common), the child will not put pressure to conduct an interrogation and get more information out.
So you will not be able to achieve anything with it, because when the child is asleep, he is unconscious and cannot think about it.
Besides, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it is dreaming and why it is saying, so be careful with the interpretation of the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Perhaps, it doesn’t tell the child that you hear it at night and know its secrets.
Not even as a joke.
This causes a lot of fear.
So, don’t worry, it’s nothing bad, it’s a moment that only lasts a few minutes.
Illhouses... finally
After a long stretch of thirst, Illhäusern on the playing field is finally back on track to success.
Without much effort, the Yellow Blacks gained numerous goal chances and managed to implement one of them, thus winning the game.
The pace of this encounter, in which the attackers struggled to show their skills, was not very high.
After a first assault by the guest captain Kauffmann, whose long-distance shot passed close to the corner, illhouses were supposed to dominate the game with ease, and it was possible to challenge Denmark's defence alternately first fonderflick with a long-distance shot, then brain with a high pass, and Romain with a shot with the tip of the foot.
The opposing team blocked in the middle of the field, only letting the lively Riahi through at the head of the storm.
The start of the second half should be decisive with first two goals scored by Riahi and Temporal, and immediately afterwards with the first goal for the Illhäuser by Marais, which was exactly right to retake a ball that had been repelled in a first attempt by Diebold.
However, the illusory goalkeeper should not be able to enjoy his luck for long and be sent to the bench about twelve minutes later, which means his teammates had to continue to lose in numbers.
Denmark, however, was unable to take advantage of this and did not face any major problems with an Illhaeusian eleven, who only withdrew a little to "compress" their defense, except in the very last seconds of the game, when the ball passed very close to the latte after a big mess.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before he flies to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make another detour to Brittany.
Given the determined attitude of the fishermen who blocked access to several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the French president decided to arrive Tuesday morning at the port of Guilvinec in the Finistère to meet with their representatives.
The latter promised to receive him “with a constructive spirit” and hoped that he would come up with “concrete proposals”.
The president’s visit is taking place at the same time as a general meeting of the crisis committee, which was set up by the Breton fishermen to enforce measures in the face of the extreme rise in the price of diesel, which has reached a record value of an average of over <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> 1.14 per liter.
According to the press spokesman of the Elysée Palace David Martinon, "the president will discuss with them possible solutions to help their companies regain competitiveness, and secure working conditions and pay for seafarers."
Sarkozy is expected by the fishermen with determination.
On Tuesday morning, they led protest marches in Morbihan and Calvados that caused congestion of almost ten kilometers in length.
The port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-île did not stop.
The Quiberon peninsula was demarcated by a barrier.
Already on Monday, the sailors expressed their determination by burning tires and pallets in front of the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient from early in the morning, while demonstrations were held in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement expanded to other ports of the Atlantic coast and the English Channel, such as Sables d'Olonne, in Vendée, where the fishing boats did not sail, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the maneuvers of the merchant ships.
In the evening, the fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in the Loire-Atlantique dissolved the blockade of the important Total refinery in Donges.
Those from Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for Wednesday’s meeting in the ministry before deciding on possible measures.
In fact, the crisis committee in Guilvinec must decide on the reactions to the movement and on its participation in the discussion planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the leaders of the National Fisheries Committee, which has not supported their movement.
“The strike will continue,” because “the fishermen will not give in at any point” and “will not go to Paris,” for example, announced Liliane Cariou, president of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
The professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently cost the liter about 50 cents, but they believe that the profitability limit of a boat can only be reached with diesel for less than 30 cents per liter.
Paul Newman the Wonderful
Butch Cassidy and the Kid died at the age of 83 from cancer in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford or Sam Mendes have said goodbye to the movie legend and committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer keeps its supply forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer expects 215 aircraft to be delivered this year, despite the impending recession, as a threat to the global economy.
Embraer, the world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, is meeting its 2008 delivery forecasts with 215 aircraft delivered, its president Frederico Fleury Curado reaffirmed.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer expects a lot from the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft of the size of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider giving up more than 15% of its assets
According to the Sunday issue of the Financial Times, the insurer American International Group, which was financially supported by the U.S. Monetary Authority, is considering giving up more than 15% of its assets to repay the $85 billion that was put forward to it.
AIG is willing to drive the sale of much of its business beyond its international life insurance and retirement provision in the United States.
According to the FT, the board of directors of AIG met on Sunday evening to review possible sales.
No confirmation was obtained with the AIG.
Assets that AIG may be splitting off include its aircraft leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in reinsurer Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate assets and private equity investments, the FT said.
As regards these sales, no final decision has been made, the FT continues.
AIG must make the sales as soon as possible to repay the loans over 85 billion that the Federal Reserve has granted it, including at the risk that the American authorities will receive 80% of their capital and current shareholders will be lost to the same extent.
Analysis Historic Paris of the meeting Historic Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange on Monday, after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson’s plan to save banks, reported a historic fall in prices: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss of nearly 800 points, and the Nasdag 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) has dropped by 777.68 points to 10.365.45 points.
As for the points, the strongest case in its history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on September 17, 2001, the day of the trade decline following the terrorist attacks of September 11.
According to the final kick-off figures, the Nasdag index, mainly relating to technology, has fallen by 199.61 points to 1,983.73, and the Standard&Poors 500 index, widely used, has fallen by 8.81% (106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points.
After the unexpected rejection by the Chamber of Deputies of the plan to save the banks, which was to restore some stability in the markets, Wall Street collapsed, which had already been hit at the beginning of the quarter.
With 228 votes against and 205 in favour, MPs denied finance secretary Henry Paulson the funds he had asked for.
Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
“A bad picture is circulating here that depicts Congress as unable to adopt a plan,” Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial said.
"This shows how much the market counted on this plan," she added, fearing that a project adopted in several days would be "too late."
"If the project is indeed doomed to failure, it will soon be the task of the Fed and other central banks to get the crisis under control, which would limit credit conditions even more," warned Brian Bethune, Global Insight's chief economic officer.
And Miss Piegza, emphasizing even more the feeling of utmost urgency, stressed that “every day that passes brings the ruin of a financial firm” in the United States.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the US authorities planned to buy Wachovia’s banking operations through its competitor Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly accelerated, leading to emergency measures for banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets are facing “not just an American but a global crisis,” the analyst added.
The market for basic necessities has grown sharply.
Income from the Treasury within ten years has fallen from 3.632 percent to 3.827 percent on Friday evening, and revenue within 30 years has fallen from 4.161 percent last night to 4.357 percent.
Obama, winner by points in first TV duel
The first debate between the two candidates for the White House on Friday was followed by another to find out who was the winner, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, the QGs for both Republicans and Democrats announced their own victory in this television duel to be pursued by one-third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain’s performance, although quite significant, was not “brilliant” enough to allow him to stop his decline in polls five weeks before the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, which published an opinion poll on Saturday that said Obama was ahead with five points (49% to 44% for McCain), believes that the Democrat clearly makes the better figure.
Among the indecisive voters, that is, those who now matter, Obama emerged as the winner with 39% from the polls, while according to a CBS survey, 25% of them see McCain as the winner.
Obama should be able to confirm his lead on Thursday with the good performance expected from his competitor Joseph Biden in the first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
“It would be a mistake to underestimate them.
She has good instincts," Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
The seventy-year-old McCain did not cease to put his indisputable experience in the field of foreign policy into the foreground, clearly underlining his opponent’s “naivety” on these issues, which were at the centre of this first television duel.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that..." he stressed several times.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to become president,” he added.
A point of attack that has been preached in Republican election commercials since yesterday.
Obama said he represents the future.
He expressed himself briefly and precisely, without letting himself be distracted.
He emphasized his ability to make good decisions and to renew the image the world has of the United States.
"McCain still hasn't understood, but Obama already has," he said this weekend in a Democratic election commercial accusing Republicans of failing to grasp the full extent of the crisis that weighs on the "American off the street."
"During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama denounced yesterday in front of 20,000 people gathered at an election event in North Carolina in the rain.
He didn’t even mention the words “medium-sized” or “workers.” The financial crisis gives Obama, which Americans consider to be the most suitable, a clear advantage to save the economy even on the brink of the abyss.
“Next week could be a decisive turning point,” said influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama’s “good economic instincts” to those of Bill Clinton during the financial crisis of 1998.
For the Democratic candidate, the current crisis is “the final verdict of an eight-year bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain.”
After emphasizing once again that he would probably even manage to lower taxes for 95% of Americans despite fluctuations on Wall Street, the Illinois senator pointed out that creating a potential energy independence of the country and promoting renewable energy, along with the introduction of a health insurance system, was his top priority.
McCain, on the other hand, wanted to build a plant of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates cautiously avoided the questions surrounding the $700 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>470 billion) plan to save the financial market, which was passed by Congress last night and is extremely unpopular with the people.
"Have you noticed that there was an election in Minsk?"
Young people and opposition leaders demonstrated on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening since the closure of the polling stations in the Minsk marketplace to protest the fraudulent nature of the parliamentary elections.
Although no result had yet been announced, numerous young people had come to demonstrate against the power of Alexander Lukachenko: ‘The dictator should resign’.
Some admit that they haven’t voted at all: ‘What good is it if they do what they want with my voice’, says one youth.
They do not believe that the regime, which has shown itself in the best light to foreign observers in order to resume negotiations with the European Union, is ready to undertake a democratic turnaround.
The sanctions, including failing to grant visas to 40 leading Belarusian figures and putting on hold certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were assessed as clean by observers.
According to the opposition, they were not.
"We were excluded from the election commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the count," Yuri Potemkin, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, said in a statement.
This is a cosmetic change, emphasises Alexander Milinkievich, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-Europe movement, because it is important who counts the votes, and for us that is the executive.
If opposition MPs move into parliament, it is because they have been appointed and not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean broadcasting time on television, meetings in the regions, and legislative proposals.”
The opposition is therefore guilty of interfering in the political game, because ‘dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, gets into a crisis and we do not reform, we risk becoming a protectorate of Russia.
“We want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which followed the elections, will not recognize the election as valid.
She stresses that voter turnout figures seem too high, and that expanding voter turnout in advance (26% of Minsk voters) has paved the way for any kind of manipulation.
“Have you noticed that an election has taken place?” asks the leader of the Social Democrats Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners to be released in August this year.
There was no one in the polls.
And there will be a maximum of five members of the opposition in parliament, and those who are most likely to correspond to the ideas of the government.”
The silence of the night descends again over the Oktoberplatz.
On television, President Lukachenko and the members of the Central Election Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
Conversation - From the Blood That Became Safe Again
Hema-Quebec celebrated the 10th anniversary of its founding yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to rejoice, because Hema-Quebec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood banks in the world.
And most importantly, it has regained public confidence, which had been severely shaken by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, the national blood reserves administered by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Donation Service were infected with the HI virus and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In the face of this drama and public dissatisfaction, in February 1994, the Government of Canada launched a public inquiry led by Judge Horace Krever, aimed at clarifying the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and drawing up guidelines to prevent another disaster of this kind.
While Judge Krever was still hesitant to submit his report, several provinces set up a committee at the time, whose goal was to develop a new system for managing blood cans in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee carried out this task.
According to the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two blood banks were established in Canada: Hema-Quebec, which is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian Blood Society to supply the other provinces and the two territories.
“In 1998, when Hema-Quebec started its work, barely 38% of people had confidence in the blood-conserving system in Quebec,” recalls Dr Décary.
The situation was daunting.
“Through enormous efforts to improve the safety of blood canned food and through work in this field over the following years, we have regained public trust,” she says, before emphasizing proudly that by the beginning of 2008, nearly 94% of Quebec’s population had confidence in Hema-Quebec.
Dr. Décary, however, keeps in mind that “trust is something extremely fragile.”
Since its founding on 28 September 1998, Hema-Quebec has acted according to the principle of caution.
At that time, we witnessed the occurrence of numerous cases of the human form of cattle insanity in Europe, a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says this woman, who has been in charge since its founding in 1998.
“And we had no idea if this disease could be transmitted through the blood.
So we referred to one of the main guidelines of the Krever and Gélineau reports, which states that exclusion measures are applied when one does not know this and when a disease progresses only slowly, as is apparently the case with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is expressed by a degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death.
So in April 1999, no blood was accepted from people who had been in the UK for more than a month since 1980.
Well, a few years ago, without any doubt, it was proven that this disease is transmitted through the blood.
Thus this event has shown us that the principle of caution that we applied has quite a sense.
In 1999, a much more accurate technique for detecting HIV appeared on the market: the nucleic acid tests (NSTs), which make it possible to detect the presence of the virus itself directly in the blood of the donor, and not that of the antibodies against the virus, as was the case with the tests used so far.
The NST made it possible to shorten the incubation period that takes place between the time the person was infected and when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, the specialist explains.
This time could be reduced to less than a week.
Thus, the risk that certain donors could be infected without knowing it, and one could not recognize it, was significantly reduced.
These improvements made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of transmitting AIDS through a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of getting HIV-infected blood.
In other words, you would have to distribute 12 million blood cans before someone gets infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood cans each year, it would take more than 24 years before a case of HIV being transmitted via a blood can.
I believe that these days you can feel comfortable getting a blood transfusion or prescribing it to restore health," says the head of Hema-Quebec.
<0x60>Our challenge for the next ten years is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen can enter the system.
It was only last year that the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted through the blood by insects.
We must monitor continuously," Dr. Décary continues, before stressing that Hema-Quebec must also provide adequate care in addition to safe care.
“The demand is increasing because the population is aging.
Because cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also affects the blood donor network, which, on average, includes only 3% of Quebecers eligible for blood donation.
Every healthy person who is 18 years or older and meets the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who provide their blood are not accepted because they have, for example, AIDS or malaria, and those who have travelled to a country where malaria is spread are excluded from blood donation for one year.
With these 3%, we manage to obtain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Lack of supplies is very rare.
But you have to renew the members of this donor network when they get older and can no longer donate blood.
It’s hard to convince people to donate blood, but above all, to hold them and make them become regular donors.
Life is so hectic these days that you rarely find the time to spend an hour donating blood,” Francine Décary said.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Quebec supplies not only blood preserves, but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs, and skin, which is used almost exclusively for severe burns.
These tissues are examined, processed and frozen before being temporarily stored at Hema-Quebec, which also manages Quebec’s only public umbilical cord blood bank.
In the umbilical cord, which used to be considered biomedical waste, there is blood rich in stem cells, which can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
“A few weeks ago, we celebrated the storage of our thousandth umbilical cord blood sample, and we plan to take off more than a thousand a year.
“We should probably start making it available for transplants at the beginning of next year,” continues Dr. Décary, who describes this program of cord blood removal as very popular.
“Many mothers are convinced not to have access to it,” because Hema-Quebec lacks the means to offer this complex and costly program in all Quebec hospitals.
Soccer - Impact in the semi-finals
Montreal’s Impact yesterday, thanks to a 3 to 1 win (4 to 3 with all goals) against the Sounders from Seattle in the second and decide game of the quarter-final series at Saputo Stadium, where the total goal ratio counted, qualified for the semi-final of the USL First League elimination games.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After a first half without goals for both sides, midfielders David Testo and Rocco Plancentino scored the other goals for the Montreals.
Roger Levesque was the only one who stood in the way of Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Recall that in the first game of the pre- and replay series on Friday Impact, the Starfire Complex in Tukwila in a suburb of Seattle brought a 2 to 1 defeat.
In the semi-finals, Impact will compete with the Whitecaps from Vancouver.
On Saturday evening, Thunder was able to offset a 3 to 1 deficit in the back game in Minnesota by a 4 to 3 win, but the Whitecaps moved into the semi-finals with a total goal ratio of 5 to 4.
Impact will probably face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game series will be set today.
In short - Siegestor by Kovalev
The number 1 trio of the Canadian team is ready to start the season.
Last night, the unit formed from Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrej Kostitsyn advanced the attack on the Panthers from Florida with a stormfire, leading to a 3 to 2 victory.
Kostitsyn, the star of the encounter, scored a goal, Plekanec delivered two assists and Kovalev transformed a pass in this victory game, the fourth of the Tricolore in six preliminary games.
Kovalev scored the victory by scoring the only goal of the entire shooting.
"I'm not ready yet," the Russian warned.
I need another game to make me feel comfortable.”
“He got too fixed on it in the first half,” remarked Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He received stormy applause.”
Charest bets on the North
The Prime Minister does not rule out the possibility of holding elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the General Assembly of the Liberal Party was over, Jean Charest went to Jean-Talon in Quebec yesterday, where the new health minister Yves Bolduc (left) is trying to be elected in today’s sub-election.
“Moving the course of our last great border in the north”: this is the long-term goal presented by Jean Charest yesterday by visual means at the General Assembly of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Levis, fully following the guidelines.
During his lecture, a kind of picture mill was projected behind him.
On three giant screens, spectacular images of hydropower plants, mines, viewed from Quebec into <0x60>Google Maps', maps, etc.
A lot of money, like during the parliamentary term.
To the press, by the way, the Prime Minister refused to rule out that he will hold the elections this autumn, even though he said that his calendar was very full.
The “Plan North” is the fourth element of a “vision” that the prime minister allegedly has for Quebec, namely that of a “new economic area” that provides for an agreement with France on labor, an agreement between Canada and Europe, and agreements with Ontario.
Although it has been frequently mentioned in the Prime Minister’s speeches lately, the opening up of the north – the northern area on the 49th latitude – has never been the subject of a presentation.
The prime minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North was “a jewel with enormous potential,” but did not mention a date, investment sums, or exact priorities for the upcoming projects.
At most, some outlooks on what more could be worked on: mainly on water energy, on forests, but especially on the mining sector, favoured by the growth of emerging markets and the renewal of public infrastructure.
According to Mr. Charest’s list, the north has ‘nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds’.
This <0x60>area twice the size of France' <0x60>is close to us, is in Quebec.
It is not only close to us, it is within us," he stressed, as to show clearly that he seeks to realize a national founding dream.
Quebec has grown greatly through its connection to the north, he emphasized: the road to gold in Abitibi, the technique of Quebec, the James Bay.
“It’s ours, it’s our future,” he added after taking a theatrical break to look at the huge map behind him.
The north, 70% of the territory of Quebec, includes a part of Labrador that Quebec has always demanded, the prime minister told the press.
“This is a traditional stance that all governments pursued.
"There is a boundary line on which there has been no agreement for a very long time, and if the opportunity arises I will take this position again on behalf of the government," he said.
"With climate change, we need to rethink our vision from the north," he said, speaking of the Northwest Passage, which will be passable throughout the year due to the ice melt.
Against this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister believes that it is essentially a duty to occupy this area.
What about the inhabitants of the area, the Native Americans and the Inuit?
The prime minister said that the government of Quebec would be very cautious with them, and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers of various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former pesky MP of Ungava) have already opened consultations with about thirty communities.
A committee of ministers led by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (transport and mineral resources) occupies an important place, has started the work.
The Prime Minister does not rule out a large assembly, “not necessarily a summit,” but an opportunity to “create a common vision.”
Incidentally, the development of the North will take place in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be “discussed, regulated and environmentally friendly,” he promised.
Jean Charest described this “vision” as a continuation of the liberal prime ministers who were in office before him.
“Like the Liberals who were in office before us, we have rethought to turn the challenges into new growth and development opportunities.
This was, by the way, one of the repeated themes of the weekend, which was opened on Friday with a large cocktail party celebrating the 50th anniversary of the takeover of the party leadership by Jean Lesage.
One of the decisions adopted envisages renaming the Beauharnois power plant to Adélard-Godbout Dam.
“From Godbout, who created Hydro Quebec, to Lesage, who achieved the silent revolution and the nationalization of water electricity, to Bourassa, who made James Bay, our party always knew how to determine the future,” Charest said.
To the press, he referred to another, this time conservative project, namely the program "Roads to the North" by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
With regard to the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydropower dam project, Mr Charest stresses that its commissioning is scheduled for 2012.
"This remains among us, but I intend to be there," he entrusted to his party members, which provoked those applause storms.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and certainly also in 2009, has not yet ruled out the possibility of holding an election this autumn, which is possible under the law.
However, he stresses that his schedule is full, mainly because of a mission of the Community Council in China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
This weekend’s General Assembly provided the Liberal Party leader with a platform of nationalist plans, especially from “constitutional goals,” which were readily adopted: The PLQ particularly demands the recognition of the “specialty of Quebec” in the Constitution.
It also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and that they have a veto on decisions made in Quebec.
On the part of the opposition, the guidelines of the North Plan were accepted with skepticism.
The head of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, has rediscovered the policy of development of the North-du-Quebec, which was introduced by the Landry government in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, refrained from applying it.
If she had done so, ‘we would have gone much further today’, Ms Marois judged Françoise Mercure alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election is taking place today).
The ADQ has expressed its support for the adoption of a Plan North by the government.
“But what we want is that this will not just be a big show,” said party leader Sébastien Proulx in representation of Mario Dumont, who is coming back from vacation today.
Letters - A Disgraced Country
Mr. Vic Toews, ex-'Justice' minister (which is ironic) in Harper's cabinet, was the one who last summer allowed himself to say about Louise Arbour that she was a 'disgrace' for Canada.
This woman, who has led a never-ending fight for justice and deserves all our admiration to cover up with shame, says just as much about the people around the prime minister as about Stephen Parker himself.
We are dealing here with a government that is the only one of all the countries concerned that has not brought home its compatriot imprisoned in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that does not even consider that Omar Khadr was a teenager when the things that are being accused of him happened.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, breaks its word and lets a child soldier vegetate under inhumane conditions.
The only one who condescends to a judicial parody to assess the defendant's guilt.
Let us remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian Lawyers in particular are calling for Omar Khadr to be brought home so that he can have a fair trial in Canada.
It is precisely this government that closes its eyes to torture: it is of little interest to them that, after so many years of torment, a young adult will surely be mentally broken forever.
We are not yet aware of this, but we are experiencing an insidious circumcision of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', this word that Harper constantly bears in front of him like a flag, and that sounds so insignificant from his mouth.
So the time has come when there is no morality whatsoever: one can arbitrarily abuse, torture and imprison a Canadian citizen, at the discretion of a head of government who, to this day, is supported only by the minority (may he become a minority after October 14...).
Many voters believe they find salvation in a party that preaches virtue, law and order, but they do not see that this government has renounced what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr. Toews, lies in this dismissal, and nowhere else.
Free Speech - The Orwellian Speech by Barrick Gold
In its September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Deputy Director General of the Canadian Barrick Gold Mine.
This confirms, and follows an Orwellian logic, that the world’s largest gold mining company sought a defamation lawsuit of over six million against three authors and a small mediocre publishing house, with the aim of opening a “public transparent debate.”
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, then they do not judge the truth, especially not in the case of slander charges, but the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely concealed by Mr Garver.
For Barrick Gold, the best way to hold a public debate is to ruin anyone who dares to represent one of their opposing opinions.
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and editors of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums of money to prepare their defenses and fight with very unequal weapons against an army of lawyers paid out of the almost inexhaustible pockets of the gold mine.
The tactic in these unequal struggles is, by the way, often to ruin the defenders in order to enforce a consensual settlement that silences the opposing side and, moreover, deters anyone who dares to deal with the issue again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she would have had to present her view of things before public opinion.
Contrary to what is commonplace in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada are usually carried out through the exchange of ideas and not through battering.
So it would have been enough if the gold mine had exposed its books and files and opened a real debate, through the newspapers, media, publications and funding of independent testing teams that could have brought light on this issue.
But Barrick Gold seems to have no confidence in public opinion and sweeps the petitions and letters in support of the authors of Noir Canada aside with a gesture of the hand.
Could Mr Garver explain how he can at the same time ask for a "public" debate and yet disregard the opinions of that public?
Apparently, in the world of the vice-president, this word covers only the generously paid lawyers, and not the community of all Canadians; a rather narrow view of the term.
In a democracy, even slanderers have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold doesn’t understand – or doesn’t want to understand – is that the public that supports the authors and editors of Noir Canada is doing so mainly because they reject the brutal stance of the gold mine.
This public is ready to listen and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not in a framework that many perceive as a gag complaint (in the course of the ‘public debate’, Barrick Gold has just addressed a demand to the authors of Noir Canada, demanding them to stop using that term...).
Aside from Mr. Garver’s surreal speech, Barrick Gold’s lawsuit is a direct attack on the freedom of academic research and truth-finding that are fundamental to any democratic society.
It completely denies the right to cite credible sources and to discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to explore and discuss topics that the wealthy companies of this world do not like, who else can do that?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could lead it by following the scientific norms used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to answer.
The university environment to which we belong has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s disproportionate lawsuit clearly shows that, contrary to what it claims, she does not want a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world, as well as for the public debate, and it is time for governments to take measures to limit this kind of unjustified lawsuit.
Wall Street Rescue Campaign: Democrats and Republicans Understand
The Bush administration and senior congressmen, Republicans and Democrats alike, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most comprehensive economic recovery plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan to stop the financial crisis that has been shaking Wall Street for months has yet to be adopted by the two chambers of Congress.
The main contents are: better control of MEPs on the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to secure the repayment of the public funds used, new orders to curb the number of houses pledged due to payment arrears, and the right to monitor the salaries paid to the executives of the assisted companies.
U.S. Secretary of Finance Henry Paulson, the president of the Chamber of Deputies Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative present at the negotiations, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, after a two-day negotiating marathon.
"We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be market-effective," said Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
“Everything happened to protect the real economy and the American people from the price crisis on Wall Street,” she said.
“This is the fundamental point: if we don’t do that, the trauma, chaos, and unrest in Americans’ daily lives will be enormous,” said Republican Judd Gregg.
Negotiations had accelerated over the last two hours, fearing the impact that a renewed failure would have had on investors’ mood.
The deadline agreed was the opening of the market this morning.
The two American presidential candidates, who took part late in the negotiations, were more likely to be in favour of the agreement, but did not fail to express their dissatisfaction with the need to meet them in this extreme way.
Democratic Senator Barrack Obama insisted on the addition of certain provisions to the agreement, especially those designed to enable owners to keep their homes, and those that concern the salaries of senior executives of companies rescued by the state.
“If you ask the taxpayers to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of certain persons, that is not something to be congratulated for.
But these measures are necessary," he explained on American television channels.
When asked on another channel if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied, “I’d like to know the details first, but I hope so.
“The principles I’ve read [show] that this is one thing we’re all going to have to digest, and with which we’re going to be able to move forward.
The option of doing nothing at all is simply unacceptable,” he said.
The $700 billion plan is aimed at using taxpayer money
It comes 14 months after a crisis triggered by the bursting of a real estate bubble, which initially led to the collapse of high-risk mortgage loans (subprimes) before expanding to other forms of more widespread bonds (PCAAs), and eventually resulted in a freezing of financial strength and the ruin of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republican MPs who failed last week’s first attempt at an agreement.
Since the Democrats have accepted that certain “toxic” assets of societies in distress should only be secured by the government and should not be bought, it is believed to escape the cul-de-sac.
To round out the viewpoints for everyone in Congress, a decree has also been added, stating that if the government were to make losses with this program within five years, it would then be able to levy new taxes in order to recover its invested capital.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion, to which a further 100 billion may be added if the president deems it necessary.
The payment of another $350 billion must be approved by Congress in a re-vote.
In return for his help, Washington receives shares in the supported companies, which, in the event of profits, bring him dividends, and which it can re-sell when the storm has passed.
The Federal Government will have the opportunity to suspend the seizure procedures regarding the homes linked to the real estate loans affected by this plan, and also set deadlines for repayment and severance payments to the senior employees of the companies concerned.
The developers of the plan would like the Chamber of Deputies to vote on it today, and the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will get the green light.
In fact, more votes rose against this project yesterday, both on the part of Republicans and Democrats.
“Obviously, Washington doesn’t understand us,” Republican Scott Garett, a member of the Chamber’s Finance Commission, told his constituents.
“Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one that consists of asking the taxpayers to cash in.
Democratic MP Brad Sherman, leader of a congressional group called “the caucus of skeptics,” presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred distinguished economics professors, including three Nobel laureates, have written to us to tell us: We ask Congress not to be put under pressure and to carefully consider which path to take,” he said.
At the same time, we were once again shown in Europe that this is a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.2 billion ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it would refrain from buying up its competitor, who is in great trouble since she lost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2 billion ($2.9 billion) in the crisis due to high-risk real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and ten largest insurers.
"This is not a lost money," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said.
To compensate, we get a right to vote and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what savers and households value now that uncertain times are announcing.”
During this time, on the other side of the English Channel, the British government was in the process of nationalizing another bank, which had been hit by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all current loans from Bank Bradford and Bringley, including over 41 billion ($75.5 billion) from real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy up the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, to nationalize the British government since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of a dedicated icon
His beauty with the azure eyes was for a long time his trump, no one would say his weakness.
Did the American actor free himself from the narcissistic mirror with the charming smile?
Yes and no.
His sensitivity, sensitivity, and an obvious talent have probably also kept him away from a position of power that brings the truly awful monsters into the world.
But what a great endurance runner!
Paul Newman, who passed away on Friday at the age of 83 from the consequences of lung cancer on his ranch in Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of his golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and for whom he was for a long time a kind of rival on screen, more meticulous in his acting, certainly also fragile, but equally an apostle of freedom and the bursting of dramaturgical conventions.
Mixed blood often produces wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, the son of a German Jew and a Hungarian mother.
From its European roots, one of the glorious faces of the American dream should emerge.
Without excessive ego, ultimate quality feature.
Because in him, an entire country that was in love with the self-made man was reflected in the fighter who was wounded in battle in the Pacific War, who studied acting in Yale in the early 1950s and then visited the Actor's Studio in New York before he had success in theater, television and soon in cinema.
This man, who fought for civil rights, was also the driver who became second in the 1979 24-hour race of Man's second, and also a sex symbol, although he lived in a flagship relationship with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With him, the unknown facets of this mysterious, restrained, committed and hypersensitive star to the glamour of the show business disappear, whose mystery will never be completely solved.
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word.
Paul Newman’s death tumbled cinema enthusiasts this weekend, while on the dark screen of memories all of his big roles were played.
More than half a century of American film art in constant change is passing by with him.
There, the charming cowboy from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) reappears, and the young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the hot tin roof, which was filmed by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
A much shorter memory is evoked (1990) of his sensitive Mr. Bridge, who is disturbed in his old age by a wedding that did not fulfill all of her promises.
There have been so many other Paul Newmans throughout history.
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Likes Me by Robert Wise, a role meant for James Dean, who was re-recorded after his death and made Newman famous in 1956.
This sympathetic gauntlet in the superb The Sting (The Clou), which was awarded the Oscar for Best Film in 1973.
As a bitter and vengeful billiard player in the wonderful The Hustler by Robert Rossen (1961),
That face through the ages, that was him.
He's still here.
In his CV, epochs unite.
The youth know him mainly from the cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the little orthodox coach of an ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
In 2003, he played the role of the Irish Mafia's godfather in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes.
Unlike several movie legends who have retired early enough from the film world, Newman should stay in the saddle for a long time, betraying Hollywood, his fortune, his splendor, and his concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humor, as a living challenge to ‘underplaying’ when he judged his all too expressive achievements.
The metier was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles flew for a long time.
However, he rarely played Sunnyboys as outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, filthy or desperate, with the perfect representation of which he reflected his slipping away and rebellion.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown sides of his true delicate sensitivity.
His 1968 Rachel (after the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence) starring his wife Joanne Woodward, drew a subtle portrait of a woman full of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott due to an overdose, dedicated his 1984 film Harry and Son, a work full of delicacy and sadness.
During the flood of honors poured out on Newman yesterday, his close friend and former gunman Robert Redford (who had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, “His presence has improved my life and this country.”
Generosity and joy of life were essential characteristics of the deceased actor.
Aside from his legendary career, a great advocate of civil rights, environmentalism and independent cinema, an opponent of Hollywood’s drift, is now going to die.
We have probably seen him often standing with his foot in bowls full of vinaigrette, in sauces, pastries or other foods, and this was thought to be rather tasteless, although we initially found it funny.
The profits from his sales nevertheless flowed into his foundation for children in need.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman committed himself to the shot.
He left a letter to his five daughters with these phrases: "Always and to the very end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was an honor to be here.”
And for us, it was an honor to be able to follow the life of such an intelligent and generous American actor.
An exemplary citizen, in the narrowest and broadest sense.
What was produced in the billing factory of Supplement &amp; Co.?
On 8 October, the trial of Jáno and his accomplices will begin.
The defendants are in particular accused of involvement in organised crime, as well as grossly negligent damage and business fraud, and other criminal offences - including falsification of documents.
According to the prosecution, the funds lucrated from the tenders were used for their own purposes, while the services rendered were often documented with fake invoices.
Government funds and subsidies from the self-government - a total of HUF 65 million - should have been transferred partly to the funds of the organization Fiatal Baloldal, partly to the private funds of individuals.
As the investigating authorities announced, fictitious invoices were submitted when the tender fees were collected, and the associations were also said to have failed to fulfil their obligations.
According to the indictment, most of the bills have been falsified.
The billing blocks were bought at the market of Józsefváros, the circular seals were made in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies to issue the invoices was made on the tour north of Lake Balaton to which István Lados was sent by János.
In the course of this "exploration tour" Lados should locate guesthouses and restaurants.
He demanded bills on consumption in order to later be able to issue bills based on these templates for the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, and the Budapest Self-Administration.
These accounts are said to have been manipulated by István Lados and his accomplice, András <0xC5><0x90>ri, who, according to our information, was responsible for the constitution of the corresponding reports.
One of the goals of Lados' "exploration tour" was a beer bar.
As can be seen from two invoices issued by Zuschlag and Co in 2003, the catering company is said to have hosted the ninety-member group of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
Now, however, the head of the company says that such a large group would not have fit into the restaurant at once.
Another bill, issued in the summer of 2002 to the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation, later known as Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, also showed serious errors of form and content.
In a guesthouse in Badacsonytomaj, which has only three rooms and can accommodate no more than ten people at the same time, according to the bill, 130 guests have stayed.
The imagination of the counterfeiters was also apparently set no limits when it came to Pigal Kft., a catering company, in whose accounting documents of the customers Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért and Hoppá according to the prosecution authorities do not even appear.
As Managing Director Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> Farkas told hvg.hu, he was immediately aware that these were fake documents when documents were presented to him by the prosecutor’s office during an interview.
"Our company name and tax number were incorrectly affixed to the stamp".
And furthermore, besides form defects, the fact that the company is said to have accommodated a hundred people was also wrong, after they had a total of eleven rooms that could not possibly accommodate so many people.
The bill also stated that the restaurant was no longer in operation for a long time.
The eager counterfeiters also failed to verify that the Budapest travel agency they targeted exclusively offers travel abroad, and so they indicated Hungary travel on the cash bill, which also contradicted the company’s accounting practice.
In addition, as the investigation revealed, they have also included VAT on the invoices, although travel agency services relating to a country outside the EU are exempt from VAT.
The total amount of VAT was incorrect on four invoices issued by Hotel Révfülöp Kft. to the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation, since the company only charges 15 percent VAT instead of 25, in addition, only machine invoices are issued by the employees, but the fake documents were handwritten.
Another mistake that had been made by the "reporters" was that in a case they had indicated "goods transport" as a service provided, although this is not offered by the investment consulting firm, the prosecutor's office said.
Further errors in form - incorrect invoice format, wrong stamp - were due to the fact that the invoices issued to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, as well as to XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont could be exposed as counterfeits.
Similarly in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the Kunfehértó sports camp, whose managing directors claimed that they had never issued the bills.
Another "mistake" has been made by the counterfeiters at HIB Kft. from Nyíregyháza: this company was in dissolution at the time (2001), when the group of the Fiatal Városért Egyesulet was supposed to have eaten there - the mass administrator consequently stated that he did not issue the bills himself.
Consciously Fake
The other group of accountants are people who were quite aware that they would have to make fictitious bills.
At the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, the Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation has issued invoices for the Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Foundation, amounting to approximately HUF 4 million.
According to the indictment, the managing director of Collab Kft. was persuaded by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to issue the fictitious bills.
Biogate Kft., currently also in liquidation, is also said to have cooperated with Zuschlag und Co.: In 2003, the GmbH is said to have provided the foundation Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Alapítvány, as well as the associations Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfeny<0xC5><0x91> Egyesület with counterfeit invoices totalling HUF 5 million, which he did not use.
However, there were also few payment transactions, as the invoices were cancelled immediately after their issue, which the parties concerned have forgotten to mention in their documents.
The third group of accountants includes persons who are directly associated with the defendants.
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the postman of the Ukrainian managing director of Delta Trió Kft., a fuel and vehicle trading company based in Budapest, but not found there.
This company is said to have issued several invoices for the sale of computer components worth approximately 18 million HUF in the period from October to December 2005.
According to the investigating authority, Cash Investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas, which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005, is said to have been the buyer of these invoices.
The managing director of this company was a Romanian, to whom the company documents were also to be delivered by Iván Kubatov, between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, during the investigation, Kubatov confessed to have issued invoices on behalf of the GmbH. to the Atlasz and Hoppá associations, as well as to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and to have collected their equivalent.
The companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. are said to have been founded by Romanian masons at the express request of Iván Kubatov.
In reality, however, none of these companies were active, which, according to the defendant, was due to a lack of orders.
Nevertheless, he was able to benefit from the companies: At the request of his accomplice, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was commissioned to prepare the company’s foundation documents, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations associated with the award, such as Atlasz and Y-Generáció.
Kubatov is said to have issued 15 invoices worth HUF 14.2 million on behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade.
The prosecutor’s office assumes that Kubatov could have collected 10% of the invoice amount and VAT in each case.
Kubatov is even said to have abused the company Szi-Beri Bt. for the issuance of fictitious bills - in this case, the bills were attached to the applications of Biztos Pont.
In January 2006, Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért submitted their applications to the non-profit organization of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány ("TMA").
Both received 500,000 forints each, but did not make use of these amounts.
To cover this up, they have submitted five fictitious invoices from Works Team Kft. to the TMA.
Incidentally, these invoices were secured during the search of the office of <0xC3><0x81>rpád Kemecsei in the Ministry of Education.
In the proceedings, some defendants now expect a confession about the procedure of counterfeiting, as they have already been filed before the prosecutor’s office.
A sensation could be if the main defendant János’s award decides to make a comprehensive confession.
His previous statements were less detailed, and although he had already promised to report comprehensively on everything several times, his confession is still pending.
The question remains, then, whether this is in his interest, whether the Socialists have concluded a pact with him to remedy the bulk of the damage incurred of HUF 50 million, and whether, in return, the contract is willing to assume responsibility.
However, it is quite possible that the surcharge now plays the "insulted" after his requests for mitigation of detention and house arrest were met with deaf ears.
While other criminals who have done far greater damage with economic offences and have not compensated for them are at liberty, or at least under house arrest, this possibility remains denied.
The Psychology of Excess Bidding - or Why We're Ready to Pay More
At auctions, buyers tend to spend more and thus overvalue the error bid.
New York University neurologists and economic scientists have now succeeded in discovering the neurological-economic foundations of this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to a study published in the "Science" magazine, people don't want to be beaten in a competition, such as an auction on eBay, and are therefore willing to pay even excessive prices.
The researchers have attempted to explore the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers should play the lottery, while the other participated in a playful action - in both cases, the subjects' active brain regions were examined by means of functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
In both games, participants were able to win money, but an increased activity of the striatum, a complex below the cortex of the brain, was measured in losers of the auction, in which the opponent's overbiding plays a major role.
Among many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the “self-reward” of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore believed that the price increase could be explained by avoiding an overreaction of the striatum.
In order to support their thesis, the economists in the research group have additionally conducted studies to track the money.
In this case, three groups should bid against a partner under different conditions.
The control group was informed of the true value of the product, after which they made their deployments.
Another group was also promised a $15 reward in case they emerged as winners.
The third group received $15 before the auction, which was also lost in the event of a lost game.
So the difference between the two groups was simply that the emphasis on one was on winning, while the other was on losing.
As proof of the hypothesis expressed by neurologists, however, the members of the "against losing" group were willing to take higher stakes than those in the control or "profit" group.
"These findings are not derived from any previous economic theory.
These have so far justified the behaviour observed in auctions only with the joy of winning or avoiding risks.
The contradiction between these two theories has been resolved thanks to imaging neurological procedures, so we now have a third explanation ready" - said Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When to see the doctor?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed among the leading causes of death.
The number of infected people in this country is estimated to be one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand are being treated, because patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the collective term for infectious liver diseases caused by various viruses.
Symptoms are often similar - liver inflammation and jaundice are common, but the pathogens and diseases differ from each other.
Depending on the pathogen, the hepatitis viruses spread in two different ways: in hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (for example, through contaminated food or water), in hepatitis B, C and D, the viruses can be transmitted through blood and other body fluids (such as sperm, vaginal secretions or saliva).
Travelers are recommended to be vaccinated against the viruses A and B in any case, there is no vaccine against the virus C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear about two to three weeks after consuming the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by discomfort, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After that, jaundice appears on the skin and eyes, the stool becomes bright, the urine dark, and recovery can take up to two-three weeks.
Every year around 1 million people worldwide die from hepatitis B, far more serious diseases such as liver cancer and cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that, according to estimates, only one in ten infected people are undergoing drug treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: if not treated, it can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Most infected people do not even know about their disease, as the pathogen insidiously destroys the liver cells - in many cases, the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, such as regular check-ups, is essential.
There are three groups in which this disease is more common: those who underwent a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts, and tattooed people.
Currently, the number of chronic hepatitis C patients worldwide is estimated at 200 million.
Since the disease can already be detected during a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to see the general practitioner at the first signs of unknown origin.
In time, the disease is curable, the virus can be eradicated, thereby eliminating the risk of infection and preventing the development of cancer.
September 30th is the World Day of Hepatitis, organised for the first time by patient representatives worldwide in 2004.
The goal of the action is to increase awareness of this chronic hepatitis caused by viruses, its emergence and the importance of early detection.
Do believers have less pain?
As the latest research shows, religious faith acts as a kind of “pain remedy” that is said to have facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University have conducted an interesting experiment: it investigated how faith in God affects humans' pain, reported the British newspaper Telegraph.
In the course of the rather bizarre investigation, 12 believers and atheists each received electroshocks while studying a painting of the Mother of God.
As the results showed, the believers were able to eliminate most of the pain.
Using brain scanning technology, it was even proven that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for pain control.
The study was the first in a research project in which, in addition to scientists, philosophers and theologians from various departments of the university participated.
During the experiment, the subjects were tied a sparkling device to their left hand, which gave off the electric shocks.
Participants were asked to focus heavily on two paintings: on the one hand a painting of the Mother of God, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and on the other hand Leonardo da Vinci's "Dame with the Hermione".
The researchers hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary among the faithful would evoke some sort of religious trance while selecting da Vinci’s image, because it was hardly different from the other painting and was felt to be reassuring.
The subjects each spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and during that time received a total of 20 electroshocks in four stages, while either watching the religious, or the other painting.
The Catholics reported that they felt “safe” at the sight of the Mother of God, as if they were “cared for,” and they felt “calm and peace.”
While viewing the religious painting, they reported about 12% less pain than when they had Leonardo’s work in mind.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the experiment, said that one could also produce similar effects with other, strong-working images among the atheists, one just had to find the corresponding photo.
“We need to find an image that triggers very positive feelings, such as a mother or a father,” the psychologist said.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"Practicing the faith should change our personality, and does so in many cases," Wright said.
After these excellent results, only the question remains of what effect a Madonna painting by Leonardo or another comparable painter would have on the pain regulation of the faithful.
Would the high-quality Virgin Mary achieve even better results?
You are what you say about yourself
On the occasion of its tenth birthday, Google can rightly claim: it is found in people’s pockets as well as above their heads in the sky: it knows where people spent their holidays, what specialists they go to, and what moves them.
And that’s still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of Google’s CEOs.
In the direction of skeptics plagued by Orwellian horror visions, he lets them align: These would just overlook the essence of Web 2.0.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Schmidt said Google’s main goal was to gather even more personal data about users, thus getting closer to the company’s original goal of “organizing all the information in this world.”
Schmidt explained that after ten years of world-changing work, Google is still only at the beginning of information gathering.
Asked about the status quo in five years, Schmidt said: he wished Google would be able to answer questions like "What should I do tomorrow?" or "Which job really suits me?", but software programs are not yet able to do so because they do not know enough about the users.
Not all Internet users are aware that the search terms, the IP addresses from which the search was made, and the pages visited were registered in the course of their Internet searches.
For example, the "personalized search" introduced two years ago allows the visitor to save his own search history and later access it, so that the hits can be generated much more accurately later, and the same logic is also based on the so-called "recommendations" with which the system recommends customized products and services based on the previous preferences.
However, users wonder what happens in case of data abuse - "When you look at what I do" - some are concerned about the Google data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is more the potential power represented by the company that is fear-inspiring, and less the feeling of guilt or fear of punishment, the pursuit of freedom, or the rebellion against the power that many internet users reject.
However, it is a proven fact that the search terms are not only stored, but also passed on to third parties, and in these legal cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
A prime example of this was recently the action against pedophilia in Brazil, in which Google provided the Brazilian government with information collected from the community site called "Orkut" and also enabled the pedophilia to be identified.
However, users concerned about personal rights were still able to breathe in May, when Google successfully sued the FBI in court together with the civil rights organization EFF: accordingly, Google can still be forced to release information to the FBI on secret request in the future with no point in the constitution.
(However, the federal government has successfully obtained the publication of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms with reference to the youth protection law passed years ago, but it has been retroactively withheld the list of individual users, or their web and search terms list, for two months.)
So Google’s image remains controversial: Those who reluctantly release their personal data because they fear the loss of their privacy and intimacy through the use of Google services are whipping the company with the outrage due to the conservative companies.
However, the American "geek culture", which is present in many countries and brings together enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, sees the next generation of "cool entrepreneurs" in them, unlike Microsoft, which is the market leader thanks to Windows, even though both are struggling for the same goal.
One possible reason for this is that, unlike Microsoft, Google does not require its users to obtain identification codes, and provides its services for free, so an open, constantly updated source code and program package seems far more attractive, youthful, and cool than the giant’s official practices.
On the other hand, the geeks see through the problematic relationship between personal rights and the Internet sharply - a relationship that has come to the fore especially in recent years thanks to the term "Web 2.0".
The "Web 2.0" is about nothing but collaboration, i.e., the users deliberately leave traces and use the available communication channels, and even if the dimensions are individually different, the main thing remains the same, namely to show themselves publicly.
An average teenager can manage his profile on multiple community portals simultaneously - from Facebook through Xanga, can connect them with other services, such as Twitter, or music services such as last.fm, and can eventually integrate all of this into a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. In addition, they can run blogs that automatically display the latest photo galleries that are on Flickr.
And a number of other exemplary cases prove: When looking at the party photos of last night, the girlfriend soon finds out who her unfaithful friend was having fun with, or the employee is fired because he is only too honest in his blog airing his anger about the company management - one thing is certain: the term "privacy" has now been completely interpreted.
Anyone who lives an online life is what he reveals about himself - so, in a way, you could formulate the basic idea behind the behavior of today's youth.
And anyone who tries to keep something secret, or even bypass the Google monopoly, can do so - such as with Scroogle, a tool that accesses Google's search engine, but intentionally leaves no trace.
Many people deliberately do not register on community sites so that they cannot be found, but also the online applications of Google, such as word processing and graphical tools and RSS feeds, can be handled with alternative versions that are not tied to huge server parks and therefore do not generate the best possible profile of the user.
Public opinion, however, is eagerly waiting for Google to show its true face.
With its current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even ahead of IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising space threatens the advertising agencies’ revenues, and the increasingly rapid adoption of services is causing headaches not only to Microsoft, but also to other software developers.
Critical viewers, however, also find the disturbing opposites: For example, the Group management completely rejected a protest of the employees, after the fees of the company's own kindergarten were doubled, the management also felt that the multiple meals of the employees were too expensive. But all this seems to be quite mild against the fact that in 2006 Google was in agreement with the Chinese government even won the
The company's internal regulation is that no new service will be advertised in advance, but only if it is already available. Nevertheless, the events of the coming months and years could change somewhat strongly again: While some think that Google's book and magazine scanning or archiving project is now taking on scales, that the company will soon have to deal with the health profile of the Supreme Court.
And the fact that Google is building a genetic database is already providing the next generation of sci-fi authors with the substance – such as “Scroogled,” the famous novel by Cory Doctorow, describing in the best Orwellian way a future in which a person becomes terribly approachable thanks to Google-based data.
Two Teenagers Help <0xC3><0x93>zd's Double Killer to Clear Trace
In connection with the double murder of <0xC3><0x93>zd, the police have now interrogated two young people who are suspected of helping to clear the tracks, the spokesman for the police commissioner Borsod said on Tuesday.
The young people were indicted and are currently being accused of aid.
According to the MTI news agency, these are two girls who are defending themselves on their own.
Aid is threatened with up to five years imprisonment.
The suspect of the double murder of <0xC3><0x93>zd, a 23-year-old local man, was taken into custody on Sunday.
The man is under urgent suspicion of deliberately murdering several people out of greed for money.
In the course of the investigation, it turned out that the 23-year-old owed a larger amount of money to a 53-year-old.
However, the suspect did not want to pay his debts, so he lured his creditor to a site in <0xC3><0x93>zd last Wednesday, where he murdered him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the man planned the act by long hand - this also proves the fact that he committed the murders with a gun hidden at the crime scene.
Together with experts, the police are now investigating the weapon and the circumstances of its use.
Warsaw Stock Exchange Offers to Purchase Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has offered around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 million, or 5 billion Czech kroner, for the one hundred percent purchase of the share packages of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolevski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, reaffirmed the offer made by the Poles despite the fact that they were previously excluded by the Czechs as potential owners of their stock exchange.
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is entirely owned by the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which, however, wants to sell more than 60% of the papers in the coming months.
According to reports from the Czech daily "E15", the offer from Poland includes the highest purchase price ever offered for the Prague Stock Exchange.
As the newspaper reports, the Vienna Stock Exchange, Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have so far made bids.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that of all the interested parties, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would probably be the worst new owner, and he did not rule out that this could even lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at 5-10 billion kroner.
According to the shareholders’ agreements, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance Investment Bank with a 25 percent stake, followed by Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 percent and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
In their comments dedicated to the ever-increasing international financial crisis, some leading European newspapers already spoke on Tuesday of the "second September 11".
We owe the global financial disaster to the American president, for example, said "La Repubblica" - the president had not even been able to back up his own party for the bill, which should bring some relief to the frightening situation...
Instead of a “new Pearl Harbor,” as billionaire investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate to speak of a “second 9/11.”
Parts of the press in Madrid are also locating the scapegoat in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership is to blame for the fact that the global economy is now on the brink of collapse.
The American financial system is threatening to collapse more and more, and the whole world will suffer.
Bush’s plan was not perfect, but now, after the Congressional vote, there is the danger that Washington will not have a political means of crisis management.
The world economy is hanging in the air at a time when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
You can no longer ignore the threat, for example, the Geneva "Tages-Anzeiger" says.
While some states could still provide their banks with bailout packages and save banks from bankruptcy with taxpayers’ money.
However, if a domino effect is triggered and more banks go bankrupt, then no further financial injections or other immediate measures will help.
In the long term, EU member states would have to jump over their shadows and centralize control of the money markets.
On Monday alone, more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion was paid out to weakening financial institutions, the Viennese "The Standard" recalls. Moreover, the newspaper continues, the concerns are increasingly realistic that, according to the Americans, European taxpayers now also have to grab a little deeper into their pockets to get out of the crisis.
So far, the EU has not seriously addressed the crisis, which is now sweeping the old continents like a tsunami.
The "savers" would not have to "wedge" several hundred billion euros immediately, but it would be advisable to maintain in which case it would be reasonable to touch the taxpayer's money in order to avert even greater damage.
Intelligent car imitates the flight of the bumblebee
What would be the best method for developing new technologies for accident prevention if not to imitate the obstacle sensors from nature?
For example, the bees.
At CEATEC in Japan, an amazing project was unveiled that inspired Nissan engineers to create new accident avoidance systems.
In collaboration with Tokyo University, Nissan has built the auto-robot-controlled biomimetic system BR23C, a mini-car equipped with the characteristics of bees, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that avoids any collisions.
In flight, each bee forms its own oval “private area” very similar to our own “shield,” said Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology PR and research development, at the exhibition.
The composite eye of the bee, which can see in any direction and at an angle of over 300 degrees, plays an important role in this.
To mimic the function of the composite eye, the researchers adopted the idea of the laser-controlled rangefinder.
It identifies obstacles in front of the BR23C in a 180 degree field of view within 2 meters, calculates their distances and sends signals to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately initiates the collision avoidance process.
The obstacle is detected in fractions of a second, and the auto-robot immediately changes the course, similar to the movement of the bees by rotating the tires at the corresponding angle.
Unlike previous systems, this maneuver takes place purely instinctively.
“If it weren’t so, the auto-robot wouldn’t be able to react fast enough to avoid the obstacles,” said Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the auto-robot project.
The system must respond instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the innermost and most vulnerable part of the shield - a layer within which accidents are currently considered unavoidable.
The whole process must reflect the behavior of the bees when they dodge other bees.
And that has to happen in a fraction of a second.
However, in contrast to the bees, dodging can not be done up, down, or even diagonally - it can only be two-dimensional, and only in the direction of the maneuverability of the tires.
While there are endless possibilities for the bees to avoid other bees, the researchers could only use the auto-robot to rotate, or to accelerate and slow down.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and more energy efficient, and therefore have a longer service life than conventional lithium ion batteries.
Andoh explained that it depends on the instinctive, intelligent response, and less on the processing of the data, and even less on the ability to store it.
This device only needs to process a few inputs per second and react to them accordingly.
It does not need to store it, or produce an intuitive, logical response based on previous maneuvers, so that it only uses a handful of KB memory on a continuous basis.
It does not require gigabytes and megabytes of memory.
This is the first step in the development of immediate collision avoidance technology, which Nissan estimates will be in production in the next ten years.
Another application could find the technology in GPS satellite navigation by deliberately guiding the driver around obstacles and thus guiding him to his destination.
A name for the sinful child
Now, the written version of the $700 billion bailout law is available, which will be applied in several stages and aims to purchase banks’ bad loans.
In the first round, half of the money will be spent.
In a meeting that ended on Saturday after midnight local time east coast, congressmen, after several days of debate, have come through to an agreement on the $700 billion rescue package, Reuters reported.
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic president of the House of Representatives, who said that the agreement had to be put on paper.
Both presidential candidates – Barack Obama and John McCain – supported the compromise reached on the bailout package.
As Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said, “The program will be effective and it will be efficient, but you have to do even more. According to Pelosi, this is not about saving Wall Street, but about ripping the helm of the economy around.
The written version of the package was published even before the opening of the Asian markets, so, Washington time Sunday evening 8 a.m. (Central European time Monday 2 a.m.), but has not triggered a high flight on the stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will first vote on the 2008 bill to stabilize the economy, then it will be the Senate’s turn.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday evening, and the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
"We are pleased with the progress made overnight and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our markets and protect our economy," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said in a statement.
The program, however, deviates from the Bush administration’s original recommendation that the $700 billion should be spent at once on the purchase of lazy, credit-loaded securities.
In a first instalment, a maximum of half of the 700 billion is to be spent, with 250 billion immediately available after Congress is expected to vote on the cause on Monday, this amount is to be spent on the purchase of credit-loaded, poorer securities, and the president is to decide on the additional $100 billion.
The program is reviewed by a separate commission, which also belongs to the president of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the $700 billion depends on a further decision by Congress.
In the sense of the law, the Treasury can also apply a combined tactic: it can simultaneously purchase bad loans, mortgages, and mortgage-loaded securities, or other "toxic" loans.
As reported by the Ministry’s officials, the purchase can be made both in an auction and directly.
The law allows the affected companies to participate in an insurance program in which the Treasury Department guarantees the worrying funds and the companies pay the corresponding fees for the expected damages.
Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the necessary funds so that up to $700 billion can be made available as emergency aid to the American financial system, be it for the large-scale purchase of bad funds, their insurance, or the avoidance of systemic risk triggered by the collapse of a major financial institution.
We are taking the necessary steps to be ready to introduce the law as soon as it is signed, Paulson said.
However, the bosses of the banks in trouble and now dependent on state aid can expect their clearances, which are called "Golden Handshake" in the overseas slang salopp, to be shortened by the government.
There will only be a cut in salaries in certain cases, and these cuts will depend on how the Treasury Department helps each.
The cut essentially means that if the ministry purchases as part of an auction, the "Golden Handshake" is taxed, unless the outgoing banker is deported to the pension.
In the event of a direct purchase of the lazy loans, the government will engage aggressively to ensure that manager salaries are not exaggerated.
The picture also includes that the existing Golden Handshake contracts will not be changed - the restrictions only relate to new agreements, so that the more people participate in the program.
This is the first case in American history that cuts to manager salaries are regulated by law, commented Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the Finance Committee, on the measure.
The state gains participation rights in the participating banks, so that the risk for taxpayers decreases, since they can also participate as soon as the economy and thus also the rescued bank are better off.
The bill stipulates that the president must submit a proposal to Congress over the next five years on how taxpayers should recover their lost money from the financial sector.
However, there were skeptics on both sides who expressed their doubts about the plan.
That’s not what American citizens expect from us, the plan will by no means protect taxpayers’ money, according to California Republican Darrell Issa.
His Ohio colleague, Mary Kaptur, said: “The measures were being pushed forward by the same people who are also responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continue to rise
Like the Central Statistical Office, domestic sales prices rose by 0.1 per cent in August 2008 compared to the previous month, and by 12.9 per cent compared to August 2007.
Export prices were 1.1 per cent higher than in July 2008 and fell by 3.9 per cent compared to the previous year.
Due to changes in domestic and export prices, production prices were 0.7% higher than in the previous month, and 3.2 percent higher than in 2007.
Domestic sales prices have only increased slightly compared to the previous month, i.e. by 0.1 per cent.
The sales prices of the manufacturing industry also rose only slightly - 0.1 percent - since July.
The biggest price increase in August 2008 was for leather goods (2.8 percent) - primarily for bags and belts - here the increase was 4.6 percent, while for shoes prices rose by 2.5 percent.
Higher prices for plastics and chemical raw materials drove prices for chemicals and production significantly up (1.6%).
Crude oil processing (1.4 per cent), electrical and technical equipment (0.9 per cent) and timber processing (0.1 per cent) experienced a slight decline in prices.
Prices in papermaking, publishing and printing remained unchanged.
In other branches of the manufacturing industry, a price increase was measured between 0.2 and 0.9%.
In the major domestic sales markets of the industry, such as electricity, gas, steam and water supply, prices rose by 0.3 percent in August, primarily as a result of the increase in gas prices introduced on July 1.
Looking at the domestic sales markets of the manufacturing industry in the year-on-year comparison, prices in crude oil processing have risen the most (32.4 percent).
In the metalworking sector, a 13.2 percent increase was observed, while the increase in food, beverage, and tobacco production was 11 percent.
A decline in prices was observed in the textile industry (2.5 per cent) and in electrical and technical equipment (0.3 per cent).
The level of inflation in the other manufacturing industries ranged from 0.6 to 9.1 percent.
Overall, prices in the manufacturing industry climbed by 10.2 percent last year.
Prices for electricity, gas, steam and water rose by 18.7 percent compared to the previous year.
On the domestic sales market, the highest price increase was recorded in August in the asset sector (0.7 per cent).
In the consumer goods production sectors, prices rose by 0.3 per cent, while in the energy and processing sectors they remained the same compared to the previous month.
The largest price increase in August 2008 was observed in the energy and re-use sector (16.8 per cent) compared to the same period in 2007.
In the consumer goods manufacturing sector, prices rose by 6.8 per cent, while for investment goods, prices fell by 1.4 per cent.
Industry export prices measured in forints rose by 1.1 per cent in August compared to the previous month, but there was a 3.9 per cent decrease in the year-on-year comparison.
The domestic currency weakened by 1.7% compared to the euro, by 7.1 percent compared to the dollar, and by 7.5 percent compared to the euro, and by 15.9% compared to the dollar.
No more visas to the United States from 2009 onwards?
Kinga Göncz sees good chances that the U.S.-Hungarian visa agreement will enter into force around January 12, as the Secretary of State explained to representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
In her view, "it all now depends on whether the electronic immigration or control system will be introduced overseas in a timely manner."
She also stressed that there will be no entry permit in the new system, but tourists would have to register in advance.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy is now conducting negotiations in Washington.
She meets Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who will hand her the Republic of Hungary’s “Middle Merit Cross with Star,” and she is also conducting talks with Democrat Barack Obama’s foreign policy advisers and Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain back bank bailout
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates of the major American parties, on Sunday pledged their support for the $700 billion bailout for banks, but there are also politicians demanding the resignation of the Treasury Secretary.
After days of marathon consultations on Sunday morning, Congress and government representatives announced that they had reached an agreement on the banking rescue package.
The Wall Street crisis, as well as the thawing of the frozen credit market, became the central issues of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain - both claim to be better suited than their respective opponents to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to recent polls, Obama was able to further expand his lead thanks to economic issues, while McCain’s high, which gave him the presentation of vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin after the Republican convention, has simultaneously melted down.
At a campaign event in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress will quickly pass the bill on the $700 billion package.
He stressed that the plan also includes those passages of consumer protection he has supported.
"We need to act now, responsibly (...) - your jobs, your savings, entire industries, and the stability of the entire economy are under threat," he said in front of 35,000 spectators.
He has not failed to call McCain's economic vision "obsolete."
In an interview given to ABC, McCain said: “We will all have a hard time pining on that (...) but doing nothing is certainly no alternative.”
The Republican senator said the plan also prescribed the establishment of a control commission for the Treasurer, as well as the restriction of clearances for top managers — something he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain had not played a definite role in the negotiations, while he, Obama, was in contact with the minister.
Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, said on Sunday that the House of Representatives will probably vote on the bill as early as Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking region
The right camp is intact, only the voters within the camp became more confident - so "Der Spiegel" commented on the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
In Austria, Haider and Co. are ready to rule to prevent a red-black coalition.
The Mirror (mirror.de)
In the online edition of the left-wing German news magazine, Franz Walter analyses the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article "Bayerns Revolution annihilates their fathers".
According to the renowned political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took over their offices.
The Christian socialists have renewed Bavaria for decades – now the modern citizens are turning away from them.
The break of the epoch is at the same time a problem of Christian democracy, as is the case for Angela Merkel.
Surprisingly, the CSU disaster did not come, but on Sunday something came to an end, which, however, was already evident quite exactly ten years ago: the undoubted hegemony of a state party.
After all, ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU landed at 47.7 percent, falling below the 50 percent mark for the first time since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 federal elections, i.e. still in the much-cited Stoiber era.
The modernization consistently carried out by the CSU in the federal state has finally destroyed its own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had already predicted this 40 years ago, but at the same time they were appreciating themselves considerably at the same time, but without consequences, secularization, educational successes, the influx of East and North Germans into the prosperous regions of Bavaria could not remain the fidelity of the CSU voters.
Modernisation always goes hand in hand with the multiplication of options, and this has political consequences.
The right-wing camp is intact - only the voters within the camp became more critical and peculiar.
It is striking that in recent weeks, the classical civic groups have expressed the greatest distance to the CSU: the free professions, the industrial bourgeoisie and voters with a high school diploma such as a university degree.
In this case, the support of the CSU fell to less than 40 percent.
The Press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Wiener Tageszeitung reports in its article entitled "Who with whom? Party leaders reluctantly on coalition issues" about the chaotic domestic policy situation in Austria after the new elections.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP prohibits the interference of the SP<0xC3><0x96> in internal affairs.
The BZ<0xC3><0x96> is open to talks in all directions, while the Greens do not yet want to settle on a coalition.
The new elections are over, and now it’s all about the coalition; in the debates on public television, the party leaders barely looked into their cards.
SP<0xC3><0x96> chief Werner Faymann reaffirmed his desire to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is very possible – this is already the case in some federal states and in the social partnership.
The question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current <0xC3><0x96>VP chief as vice chancellor, left Faymann open.
As he said, voters would have opted out of the Bowl-Morter course.
Repeating this direction would not be possible.
Molterer, however, has reacted cautiously to red offers.
Cooperation cannot be fruitful, he said, if Faymann tries to interfere in internal concerns of the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
Whether his party is going into opposition, or into the coalition, is currently completely open, and these questions should be discussed internally in the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
BZ<0xC3><0x96> chief Jörg Haider showed himself open in all directions.
"To prevent red-black, we are ready to take on government responsibility," Haider said.
Járóka: The vicious cycle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today in Paris, the European Summit on Equal Opportunities, hosted this year by the EU Presidency of the Council, France, has begun.
In her speech to the plenary, Lívia Járóka, Member of the Fidesz Group of the European People’s Party, pointed out in particular the segregation of education, which is one of the most serious violations of the rights of Roma children, and is also the biggest obstacle to their need for validity.
The high-level conference was opened by the French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, Xavier Bertrand, on behalf of the French Presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among the participants were representatives of governments, the European social partners, as well as the most important European legal protection and civil society organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
As the press office of MEPs reports to Fidesz, Járóka has drawn attention to the fact that, in addition to discrimination in job-seeking, Roma are being displaced from the labour market primarily because of their low level of education.
"The vast majority of Roma youth have no middle school education, and thanks to poor primary school education, only a small proportion of them can achieve a college degree".
Járóka also stressed that education is a fundamental human right, which has a key role to play in enforcing other human rights.
Investing in the early education of Roma children could strengthen the economy of EU member states.
MEPs believe that it is important for a broader circle of Roma and non-Roma to be aware of these relationships.
Because the sooner a Roma student starts school, the more chances he has of becoming a productive member of the labour market; and through income and sales tax, he contributes to national spending.
"As a citizen of the European Union, the right of the Roma to high-quality education must be guaranteed - the poor and segregated education must be stopped" - said Lívia Járóka.
As the honourable Member stated, a common, targeted and action-oriented approach of the European Union is necessary to accelerate the process of dissegregation in the education sector, in order to ensure proper compliance with existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
"We need to break the vicious cycle of poverty, segregation, and unemployment and give Roma children the democratic opportunity to contribute to the future of Europe as full citizens," Járóka said.
Since the congress in Berlin last year, the summit is held annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for advancing the goals of equal opportunities and freedom from discrimination at European and national level, in the spirit of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities".
CSU: Grace on time
The fate of the fallen duo Huber-Beckstein will be decided at the end of October
Despite the election debacle, no heads are still rolling, and the staff debates have been postponed at the head of the Bavarian CSU.
Party leader Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein still remain in their offices, the question is just how long this grace lasts.
The fate of the tandem after the disastrous 17% vote loss will be decided on the last weekend of October at the Extraordinary Party Congress.
But the much slandered duo already made it clear that it does not want to stick on their armchairs.
They want to appease the angry faction and the party base, which one day after the "Bayern tsunami" demanded personal consequences in the face of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago – admittedly, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, who is at the height of his career – the Christian Social Union still reached 60.7 percent, but now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, they were only able to secure 43.4 percent of the vote.
For 46 years, the CSU was the "alone government" in Bavaria, which generates 18 percent of German GDP.
Although the Conservatives remain the determining force in the southern state, which is also important for the Hungarian economy, they will in future have to rule in a coalition.
As a first sign of the internal restructuring of the party, the potential successor of Huber, vice-president and Federal Agriculture Minister Horst Seehofer will also be involved in the exploration team, which is conducting exploratory talks with the liberal FDP, or the right-wing "free voters" about a possible Munich coalition.
An irony of fate is that with the list of "free voters" Gabriele Pauli enters the legislature, whose anti-stolen behavior the Huber-Beckstein duo first exploited, then mercilessly serve the determined politician.
The CSU leadership is now concentrating all its forces on the stabilization of Beckstein.
In this transition process, Stoiber, who has hitherto pulled the threads out of the background, will play an active role. The former prime minister and CSU chairman called September 28 the "bitterest day of his political career".
On Monday, Huber made a few toxic remarks towards the CDU - in his opinion, the CSU deserved far more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and thus also to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which also contributed a lot to national success in 2005, is not put back on its feet with a joint force act, Merkel can not again become Chancellor after the Bundestag elections in September 2009.
Merkel, who has made no mistake about her disappointment with the fiasco, believes that the CSU’s loss of terrain will not have a negative impact on the big coalition in Berlin.
What is relative, however, is that the wounded CSU will not be easier to govern, and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
With 18.6 percent, the SPD achieved its best result so far in Bavaria since 1946.
Lukashenko opposition: 110-0
In the elections on Sunday, no member of the opposition managed to enter the Ukrainian parliament.
Russian observers believe that this is due to prosperity and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but the OECD suspects illegalities in the counting of votes.
The OECD, which has sent 450 observers from 43 countries, has not recognised the elections.
The legislature of the 10-million-inhabitant state has been without opposition for decades, yet the opposing party assembled under the name of "United Democratic Forces" (ODS) before yesterday's elections has earnestly hoped that Lukashenko, who in the improper elections and thanks to a constitutional amendment in 2006, would renew his presidential mandate for the fourth time.
That is why the ODS has even distanced itself from the previously planned boycotts.
Ukraine is becoming economically increasingly dependent thanks to the rising prices of natural gas imports from Russia. For the alleviation of the price increases even loans were taken, and the country has also agreed to sell the Beltransgas, the owner of the country-leading gas pipeline, to the Russians. In the background of the expectations of the opposition Lukas was high after the hope that Ukraine would improve its relationship with the EU.
The evaluation report of the OECD elections provided for a temporary relaxation, in which the emphasis was on the positive movements rather than on the shortcomings - such as the exclusion of one third of the opposition candidates from the elections.
However, the OECD’s rapid report on Monday already criticized the campaign – according to which opposition members are not likely to appear in the press – and in particular the fact that the opposition was not allowed to be present when counting the votes.
Despite all this, the opposition is able to see an improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been set free, for example, and Minsk is even prepared for minor confrontations with Moscow by continuing to refuse the recognition of the independence of the renegade Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, although Russia, with which Ukraine on paper has independently considered a federal state, has made one of the two territories.
"We have taken two steps forward and one backward, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," Milinkevich said.
According to the opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election, a continuation is desirable, although "the powerful have become afraid to let even one opposition in parliament".
The opposition does not plan to protest against the results, but rather seeks to clarify the need for economic reform to the voters.
"We are struggling with a lot of problems here - the opposition newspapers have to be printed in Russia, the local authorities are putting stones in our way in the distribution, but nevertheless I see that more and more people are supporting change, even the elderly" - Milinkevich said, alluding to the fact that not even the most supported layer of pensioners agree with the Lukashenko regime, whose only social merit is the production.
"Thanks to the country's debt and the increase in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the "social security" that reminds us of the silence of a cemetery begins to crumble," Milinkevich said.
Unlike opposition politicians, Russian observers have described the elections as democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Community of Independent States, told the news agency Ria Novosti: "People believe in the deeds, not the words". The absence of opposition is therefore proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: “From now on, breakfast will be served before work”
For the first time in the history of Palazzo Chigi, there are rotating doors for officials’ entrances and exits.
From today onwards, the measure will take effect against those scoundrels who first stamp and then go drinking coffee during working hours.
The new "Anti-Lack of Fur Law" was introduced today by Renato Brunetta, Minister of Public Administration, and by Mauro Masi, Secretary-General of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers.
"Revolving doors are a means to increase work efficiency through a higher attendance rate and more services," said Minister Brunetta.
"Now begins a new era of responsibility and transparency.
This is reformism,” Brunetta stresses once again.
The Palazzo Chigi ends in all the buildings of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers.
Masi says: “The choice of rotating doors is also of great symbolic value.”
There was no resistance on the part of the officials, the secretary-general assured: "This process was supported by all, the cooperation came from all sides".
All in all, there is no more breakfast during working hours; end with coffee or croissant.
Brunettas advises with a smile: "A good cappuccino at 7 o'clock works wonders".
During a meeting of the Superior Committee of Public Administration (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione)
From Rome, the minister announced that "within three months the absences of officials have been reduced to 50%, that is, 60,000 more people are present at work per year".
He adds that it is necessary to strengthen the efficiency of the public administration of Italy
"their wage dynamics - according to the minister - have been twice as large as the private sector in the last 8-10 years and far above the inflation rate."
Meanwhile, thousands of officials have joined forces to counter the Brunetta Decree as part of the appeal supported by Codacons.
"While the Minister of Public Service profiles himself with figures about less absenteeism at work - writes the Consumer Centre - the people of 'working lazy furs' are growing continuously.
In fact, thousands of correct and valuable public officials have joined forces to declare war on the unlawful norms of the Decree."
In particular, the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) is fighting for additional financial compensation for work-related illness; so is the planned extension of the mandatory house arrest of the sick worker, during which inspection visits can be made and further aspects of the Minister’s innovations are challenged.
Napolitano: "Prevention of accidents at work is crucial"
Every day in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur at work, three people die and 27 remain incapacitated for life.
For the year 2007, the data of the Inail (Istituto nazionale contro gli infortuni sul lavoro) confirm that the fatal accidents at work were around 1200.
These figures show the severity of a phenomenon that causes almost twice as many deaths as murders.
Today, the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) will celebrate the 58th National Day of the Victims of Work Accidents in all provinces of Italy, in order to draw the attention of social institutions and media to this dramatic situation.
"The worrying data disseminated by Anmil and the tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention in the workplace is," confirmed the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano in his communication to the President of the Amil (Associazione nazionale mutilati ed invalidi del lavoro) Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expresses his "great appreciation for the constant commitment to prevention at the workplace, to protect the injured workers, to support the families of the victims and to raise awareness of public opinion".
"An outrageous "basta" has risen up after this; understandable in tragedies, which, measured by their magnitude, trigger some whirlwind in the media and public sympathy. But the everyday reality often confronts us with dramatic events, which can even repeat themselves in their own dynamics".
Napolitano does not hide that "there is definitely a resource problem: it must be invested decisively in education and information."
The numerous initiatives for a more direct awareness in school frameworks by young people who feed on the world of work are of particular importance.
It is our duty to draw attention to this phenomenon and not to distract it from its social seriousness.
For his part, the President of the Chamber, Gianfranco Fini, stressed "how the phenomenon of work-related deaths constitutes an urgent social emergency, which offends the conscience of all of us and forces all institutions to work towards decisive rules aimed at ending the problem".
"The data on occupational accidents seem to signal a slight improvement, but this does not exclude that the number of occupational deaths is far too high," said Anmil president Pietro Mercandelli.
"We don't want this 'positive tendency' to mean less attention. That's what causes the tragedy in the end."
"How to believe that you are basically doing too little to counter the phenomenon of accidents. You can fight it through various actions.
We believe that stronger controls and inspections are necessary – according to Mercandelli; but also stronger measures to educate the workers who are already starting in school.”
"A further effort is necessary - he adds - as far as communication and public opinion awareness is concerned.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards a phenomenon that constitutes a social emergency is required".
Mercandelli also addressed the “progressive deterioration in protection for the victims of occupational accidents” and denounced the “abolition of the social system we have been fighting against in recent years.”
"The aim is therefore to return to the worker a guarantee on insurance so that the fate of the victim of an accident at work does not depend on voluntary or random donations decided by a legislator from time to time".
Mp3 Player Under Charge: Risk of Hearing Damage
Listening to loud music over a longer period of time with portable music devices, such as MP3 players, can lead to permanent hearing damage.
This is reported by the European Commission, which cites the opinion of the Csrseri (Scientific Committee on Current and Recently Identified Health Risks) of the EU in a report distributed today in Brussels.
“The report makes it clear that 5-10% of those who listen to loud music with portable music devices for at least five years a week for more than one hour a day are at risk of permanent hearing loss.”
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people, who usually place portable music devices and mobile phones at a high volume, will irreparably damage their hearing without knowing it," said Meglena Kuneva.
“The scientific findings – as the EU says – show a clear risk that urges rapid action.
What really matters is to raise awareness among consumers and to make this information a common good.
In view of these scientific findings, we need to re-examine the existing control systems to ensure that they are fully effective and keep up with the new technology."
Brussels had commissioned the independent scientific committee in view of the widespread use of portable music devices among young people.
"The scientists - concludes the EU communication - confirm that they are rightly concerned and that the EU Commission, together with the other EU members and those concerned, will now examine the necessary measures to better protect children and young people from the noise coming from portable music devices and similar devices."
There is already a European standard which limits the level of noise from portable music devices to 100 dB, worrying about the damage that could come from excessive noise pollution.
These damages can be very limited by resorting to solutions such as reducing the volume and length of noise exposure.
In its report, the EU’s Scientific Committee points out that if users of portable music devices listen to loud music only five hours a week (lower than 89 decibels), so that the legal limits that apply to the maximum noise level at the workplace are already exceeded.
Those who exceed this limit risk complete loss of hearing within five years.
This represents 5-10% of the users of such devices, whose number can be estimated at between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Roma, Alemanno give the start to the "Commission for the Future of the Capital"
We start today, it's supposed to be over in March, in June, the balance is drawn.
This is the procedure laid down by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome". The Commission met this morning at the new headquarters behind the Caracalla Thermal Baths.
In six months, President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will work out the guidelines for Rome.
Once the project is completed, the city council and the municipal council will evaluate the analyses and projects in order to be able to present the strategic plan for Rome in June with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and the Mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it," - emphasises Alemanno. "It will present proposals for a development plan for Rome, whose political responsibility will remain with the city councils and the municipal councils.
There is no redistribution of responsibilities, only the will to have a place where one can develop a great project for Rome.
Their task will be completed in March and the Commission will disband again, as such a project must have a timely end point.
In June - the mayor announces - we will present the strategic plan in which we will take advantage of the work done by the Commission".
Anyone who calls into question the Commission's competence, since its opinion is lacking in commitment, replies to Alemanno: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will do and on the quality of its proposals.
If, as in France, the Attali Commission, it delivers quality results – and this will certainly be the case in Rome – then its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often, politics deals with the everyday problems and emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the other hand, want to have a longer period in view, in order to work seriously on the development of Rome and the future of the city in a deeper perspective".
The Mayor of Rome attaches great importance to clarifying the following: "This commission is neither a useless institution nor a wreck: it is absolutely free, it will not cost a cent to the Roman citizens and it will make us think, it will employ the best minds of the capital".
According to Alemanno, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is neither hermetic nor static in order to enable our city to make a quality leap - which it really needs - and thus take a joint step into the future".
A future, according to the Mayor of Rome, which "will not only limit itself to the current municipal boundaries, but will look much further", not only in terms of the role of Rome as a metropolis and political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama – the first anti-American president? Here is a statement
A well-known American politician who cares a lot about being regarded as independent wrote: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, through his decisions, decimated the U.S. economy and cultivated relations with the hostile Islam (and still does so today as a private man).
The attacks against Obama are becoming more and more violent, especially now that the elections are approaching.
A lady from Miami wrote on an internet page: "This person is full of ambition.
Obama is very naughty: he thinks he will get the highest office in a nation that has seen a total of two black governors and five black senators!"
Actually, however, these attacks don’t have much to say; they are racist attacks and they don’t answer voters’ question: will he be a good president? And then there are the polls; all say that Obama will win with a big lead.
Also in this case, there are people who speak with the heart and not with the head.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, wrote in its editorial: Only in the voting booth will we know who the real American patriot will give his voice.
Here comes a mentality of the United States that has been hidden until the last time.
"Tell us what you want, then we'll decide who we're going to make our crows for, whether for Obama or for McCain."
There are people there who swear that if Obama wins, we will emigrate from America.
Something you’ve never heard before – only now, when the success of the black candidate seems so certain.
In any case, despite all these considerations, the final weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1,500 people were asked: What mistakes did Bush make during his tenure? 89% answered: the war in Iraq.
America is changing.
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent home with a kick in the ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
For the majority, Iraq remains Bush’s weak point.
The person who will take his place is faced with a huge task.
USA. The financial collapse also leaves its mark on journalists: You can already feel the cuts in the newspapers. And many blame the Internet, the "killer" of the printing press.
Five hundred American journalists were interviewed by the PEW Research Center about their situation and their mental control regarding the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
Nevertheless, they did not really express concern about the general credibility of the information concerning the persons in charge.
They don’t feel as alone as they used to be.
The problem for American journalists is money.
For these journalists, the 2008 crisis is a crisis of an economic model that has been destroyed.
In addition, the major problems are due to the cuts in the newsroom, i.e. the space in which the editors work to compile the newspaper.
It is a problem that needs to be solved – according to the interviewed journalists – if one wants to prevent traditional journalism, as the general public understands it, from shrinking significantly.
A clear but complicated pessimism fills the American journalist today.
Six out of ten journalists and executive seniors of the printing press believe that journalism at the national level is on the wrong track.
In the local area, it is even 65% for executives.
Printed vs. Broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine in which direction the web is going.
The most important publishing groups are paving the way for the Internet, which is seen by many as the “killer” of the printing press.
The “economic pressure” experienced by journalists has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted to wanting to join the new technology, hoping "they bring something good to journalism."
The biggest rift in American journalism today lies between the editors-in-chief of the newsroom and the reporters who work for it.
56% of national-level editors are confident that their reporters share their values with them, while only 23% are at the local level.
Some think it has to do with “safety at work.”
The company managers, who are afraid of losing their jobs within three years, are 47% at national level.
For journalists, it is 30%.
The topic of "safe work" in the team (our "editor", note) is always a topical topic in the USA.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation like the United States, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV stations and internet operators, employers offer as it pleases them and so it becomes a matter of take it or leave it.
The editors-in-chief get very often very high wages, but the editor can sometimes get only 10,000 euros per month, plus pension and insurance money.
As for the holidays, things get complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, so and so many after the third, finally reaching 15 holiday days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, as they themselves admit, often become “sick” throughout the year.
It is a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: JUDGMENT IN ROME: DANILO COPPOLA STAYS IN GROTTAFERRATA
The President of the Second Penal Chamber of the Court in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the request of the real estate agent, who had asked to be transferred from Grottaferrata to Rome.
It is being investigated against Coppola for bankruptcy in the context of the investigation into the counter-agreement in the case of the acquisition of Unipol-Bnl.
In the course of the trial against him during the last week, his release from house arrest was converted into a residence obligation in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked to allow the real estate agent to be relocated from the provincial city to an apartment in the capital.
According to the court, such transfers (against which the prosecution had spoken out) could give him the opportunity to influence his society and get evidence accusing him.
The elite is in danger.
The phenomenon had already been revealed a few days ago when the House of Representatives voted against the $700 billion White House savings package: a large portion of Americans were and are more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
This is confirmed by yesterday’s New York Times issue, which reports how the crisis is gradually dividing the Republican Party, which is increasingly splitting into its old and moderate East Coast souls, which has always favored the state institutions and the business community, and those neoconservatives who are hostile to “those in Washington” and the financial world, and especially those in the south and the center of voters.
This part of the party owes its rise above all to the voice of the one I mentioned above.
However, this example just mentioned is only a small part of the major changes that the current economic earthquake is announcing or even already representing: not only in the United States, but also throughout the West and perhaps beyond.
Both in the states and in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the long-feared events that are finally taking shape and coming to light under these new conditions.
The first of these phenomena is the rediscovery, the unprecedented renaissance of the state in conjunction with a kind of renationalization of the economy.
In fact, the crisis means a decline in banking and financial institutions, which have close ties to foreign countries and at the same time manage a tremendous amount of wealth from private households living in a single state.
This means an immediate political problem for the governments: namely, how to behave towards the families concerned, which also represent an enormous body of voters.
The crisis thus appears economically global, but politically it is almost purely national.
Political internationalism seems to have strayed so far and lost its right to speak: the clear proof of this has been given by the EU, which, due to its splitting into different national and international conflicts, is unable to find a common path.
Therefore, everyone now expects the intervention of their own state; rescue plans, new rules, and especially distribution of aid funds: Since the crisis became more and more serious, only the US in the economic situation have to save themselves without outside help.
And in addition to the means, they also have the legitimacy to use them: thus two prerequisites not to be overvalued – under certain circumstances – on which no international organization and no market will otherwise be able to rely in a similar way.
The new emphasis placed on the state-national element is, moreover, in perfect harmony with the ever-increasing importance that has recently been associated in the economy with a closely related sector: territoriality.
It is paradoxically right now, when we were so convinced that we had long since entered a networked empire, a realm of ever differentiated technologies, of the intangible, that we must suddenly see how our future will depend more and more on the essentially material things: water, harvest and oil.
Although they can all be transported from one place to another in the world, they are nevertheless linked to a narrowly defined piece of earth – a territory.
Hence, the person who has such a territory is at an advantage over another who lives in an area without yields, waterless or free from oil reserves.
I now come to the second novelty, which, however, requires a brief introduction.
Whoever says territories, governments, politics says leadership.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, there is the knowledge of the need for respected leadership, that is, the need for someone who knows how to manage things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of indignation over the existing leaderships, especially those of the economy, which have turned out to be inadequate and full of shadow zones.
Finally, there is a deeper and, in a sense, more disturbing aspect: a loss of confidence, an intolerance, an image of inappropriateness, a sense of distantness, all directed at a whole class of managers of the Western countries.
It seems to be clearing the way for large sections of the population to believe that it is not only the actions of the social elite, but already their world of ideas, their way of life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose content appears to the majority as ever more foreign and outgoing.
The demand for leadership thus feeds underground a branched but powerful movement of the de-empowerment of the leading class and of the traditional political establishment. This is manifested in unforeseen "revolts" of voters and in the immediate shift of the collective state of mind of recent times: starting with the rise of the conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, the right-wing Labour-Party plays over the collapse in Austria and Bavaria.
You get the impression that the old elite, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, magazines, intellectual creditors, some would say their format, have more and more problems of understanding and therefore less representative value regarding what is going on today in the lower social strata of the West and is being amplified by the financial crisis and driven to overdimensionality.
In the face of all this, it would simply be exaggerated to speak of a “rebellion of the masses.”
Keeping your eyes wide open is certainly not.
The super glue that raises up on walls
To defeat the forces of gravity thanks to an adhesive and to be able to climb up walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four American research centers, one of which has now seemingly almost reached its goal.
With an adhesive applied on an area of only 2.5 sq cm, the researchers succeeded in fixing a 100 kg body on a vertical wall.
The STUDIO – an American journal has published the results of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is a further development of the adhesives already used, which use a special carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
"The principle of adhesive can be imagined as a series of spaghetti-arranged tubes," explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists have been inspired by the feet of the geckos, which are covered in microscopic hairs that give the animal a perfect hold.
Tests conducted with various materials, such as glass teflon and sandpaper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than reptiles’ foot holding ability, while at the same time “removing it from the wall without any problems,” said Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton’s Faculty of Engineering.
"This material could be used as a transient adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Maybe it is, but the researchers are thinking of a less fascinating benefit, such as the connection of electrical devices, because the nanotubes are also conductors of heat and electricity.
Other applications could fall within the field of spaceflight.
So for now, the superheroes have to wait.
THE OTHER ART OF RESEARCH – also the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to a new type of adhesive.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, the California scientists present an adhesive made of microfiber that cleans itself from dust like hair by moving on a surface and thus always maintains a perfect adhesion.
Medicines: never take with fruit juice
Beware of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed due to their refreshing quality and vitamin richness, especially in summer, can cause serious harm to health if they are taken at the same time as certain vital medicines, as they can have an extreme effect on the absorption of these by the body.
David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, has repeatedly pointed out the risk of both packaged and fresh fruit juices associated with drug intake. At the 236th meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he once again sounded the alarm: a glass of apple, orange or grapefruit juice is enough to reduce the absorption capacity of certain vital medicines to such an extent that they are virtually reduced to health.
Grapefruit juice was already suspected to be responsible for increasing the effects of some drugs such as antibiotics, anti-asthmatics, cardiovascular drugs, anxiolytic and neurological agents, up to toxic levels.
DRUGS IN DANGER – The same drug agency had warned doctors and patients about the dangers of this mixture in a report two years ago, stressing to be careful what is being drunk in conjunction with drugs such as diazepan or methadone.
It’s not just grapefruit – according to the experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that can inhibit the drugs.
The list of active ingredients inhibited by fruit juices is long.
Hence the appeal of Michele Carruba, the director of the Università Statale di Milano: "Such results are usually immediately passed on to the various international manufacturers, who are so free to change the consumer information.
Therefore, it is advisable to always read the package leaflet and, if there is still some uncertainty, do not be afraid to ask a pharmacist or doctor," the expert of the Ansa agency emphasizes.
The Nobel Prize in Economics goes to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics is awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the establishment of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a Neokeynesian who teaches at the University of Princeton and is known for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration’s economic and foreign policy.
A few months after the September 11, 2001 attacks, during the days of the Enron collapse, Krugman had claimed in a New York Times editorial that this second event was more decisive for U.S. history than the assassinations.
A prediction that received not little polemic as an answer and was presented to the economist years later, but today proves to be completely correct.
"I am surprised and shocked at how quickly the memory of the scandals in the context of the collapses of Enron or Worldcom has disappeared from the public eye," Krugman said in a statement at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is an "economist of great value," but also a banaliser with a "very aggressive style, particularly directed against the Bush administration's excessive liberalism."
Open Office, the third version of the "Anti-Microsoft" package is released
The day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has come; the open source software is gaining an increasing number of users, both at home and in the office, among freelancers and in the public administration, as a free replacement for Microsoft’s Office.
After a year of intensive work by the volunteer developers, which is supervised by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office now presents itself with some new features to the public: in addition to a revised and now more spartan designed start menu, a completely guaranteed compatibility with Apple's operating system Mac OS x is now finally achieved, as well as support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, i.e. the latest standard IS.
Eight against was also on the compatibility with Microsoft Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice.
Also interesting are some new features, such as the one that allows to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which facilitates e.g. sending via email. This also includes the possibility to import PDF files into graphics editing modules while preserving the original appearance of the page.
Thus, "hybrid" PDF files can now also be generated, which extend the typical graphics of the Adobe format by the elements of a table and a word processing system.
Collaboration is one of the most improved elements of the applications: tables can now be edited with multiple hands by different users, thus avoiding conflicts with changes; in the case of the word processing system, each editor is assigned a Frabe to guarantee a better correction process.
Some companies are about to publish various features of OpenOffice on the web (on the cloud), while the final result is to be made public in the coming weeks.
The Italian version is available for download at the following link: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html. Thus, it follows the English version, which has been on the mirrors since Friday.
Except for Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for the Linux operating system.
Upon request, you can have the installation CD sent to your home or office.
However, while free of charge can be an incentive for the distribution of the program in private households, it is also especially in the area of business where OpenOffice could succeed: after all, various public administration institutions and schools have already switched to OpenOffice.
In fact, there is not even a lack of a training offer, which means an optimal help for small and medium-sized businesses, and thus even opens up business prospects.
OpenOffice consists of five main components: Writer, the Word-related text creation program; Calc, the spreadsheet program that aims to displace Excel; Impress, for creating presentations like with PowerPoint; Dbase for running databases instead of the more familiar Access; and finally Draw, a graphics module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads – a goal that can easily be exceeded at already 3 million and 600 thousand.
Kohl also tested positive and thus the fourth doping case
A new doping case opens up within the framework of the past Tour de France: it is the Austrian athlete Bernhard Kohl of the team Gerolsteiner, who is the third classified and winner of the shirt of the best climber.
The news was published by the daily newspaper L'Equipe on its website.
The 26-year-old Kohl from Team Gerolsteiner is the fourth driver to be tested positive for Cera, the third-generation Epo. Previously, this was already the case with the Italians Riccardo Ricc<0xC3><0xB2> and Leonardo Piepoli as well as the German Stefan Schumacher.
The analyses from the blood samples of cabbage are among those carried out in recent weeks by the laboratories of Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-tests now confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place and be excluded from the races for two years.
The head of the French anti-doping commission, Pierre Bordry, confirmed the positive epotest, and also notified the Austrian authorities, according to the Associated Press.
The 26-year-old Austrian climbed the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans and also claimed the jersey of the best climber.
THEME IMMIGRATION: THE NEW YORK TIMES QUESTION: IS ITALY RACIAL?
Italy, "the former country of emigrants has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants", which are only admitted with reluctance.
This is what the New York Times asks in a long article devoted entirely to the topic of racism in Italy, based on the case of the young Abdul William Guibre, a Burkina Faso native, who was murdered in Milan a month ago after stealing a packet of biscuits.
The case testifies to what the Times calls the “paradox of the North”: the northern regions are those where “most integration and employment opportunities” exist, yet “the highest level of anti-immigrationist sentiments and the greatest support of the League of the North”.
Confirming the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times cites further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just this.
The new legislation introduced by the League against immigration and for the faster expulsion of illegal immigrants is also cited as a sign of climate change in Italy.
A movement that the Pope and the President also underline: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope at a meeting at the Quirinal for a cooperation between the Church and the state to combat racism."
Students Victims of up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>900 per room high rental prices
The housing market for students knows no crises.
According to the latest investigation by Sunia, the tenants’ union, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already taken on very serious significance: entire groups of students are losing their right to study because their families are unable to support them at this level" - according to Sunia's manager, Laura Mariani - "in these cities, the high demand on the part of students leads to a deformation of the market, which has also damaged the other residents.
In addition, most rental offers include a number of violations: free contracts, lack of registrations, no rental price limit, unauthorized sub-rentals.
For Sunia, there is a need for exceptional measures, which lead to lower rental prices by revising the taxation.
A closer look at the investigation reveals that in Milan, a sleeping place in the Brianza district is needed for about 450 euros; a single room starts at 650 euros (in the Bande Nere district) and ends with 800 euros in the Lambiate, Udine and Fiera districts or even 900 euros in the Vittoria district.
In Florence, a sleeping place costs an average of 350/400 euros, a room 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in the neighborhoods around the university, 250/280 euros for a sleeping place of necessities, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, the prices in the districts around the university are about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a sleeping place in a double room.
Rents in the neighborhoods around the other universities in Rome are only a little lower: 550 euros in Ostiense and Cinecittà.
Only those who dodge in outer districts can save money: 300 euros for a sleeping place and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar quarters.
In Naples you need 300-450 euros for a sleeping place, for a room the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive neighborhoods, the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, a sleeping place costs 250-350 euros, a single room at least 350.
In the smallest cities, prices are lower, but they have a greater weight in the urban economy.
In the cities where the phenomenon of renting to non-European students is more common, such as Perugia, there is even another anomaly: renting, which is 25-30% above average, is demanded by foreign students.
Farewell to the old cinema Paradiso – the cities close their historic cinemas
The historic cinemas close due to the favoured multiplex cinemas.
“A city without cinemas is a blind city, like a face without eyes.”
This picture by director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect what is currently happening in the major urban centers of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of exclusion of cinemas, which began with the birth of the large multi-saal complexes in the periphery, means death in the long run for the single-saal cinema in the center. A process that not only seems inevitable and irrevocable, but also bears the traits of a cultural crime.
It’s like losing a friend with whom you’ve travelled a stretch of road full of emotions,” says the director of the film “Nuovo Cinema Paradiso,” which 20 years ago brought him the Oscar and the Grand Prix of Cannes. It’s the story of a suburban cinema and its nostalgia, which consists of living in a probably lost cinema world forever.
The figures provided by the Anec, the central trade association, speak a clear language: over the last five years, the tremendous amount of 316 traditional cinemas have had to close; these mints paid for most of the cinemas in the major cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
The most affected regions include Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41.
This indicates that the main culprits are the multiplex cinemas, because it is precisely these three regions in which the largest number of these modern cinemas has been registered: with 195 in the last 5 years, Lombardy leads the lists, 81 are in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"The business has developed in an irrational way," says Paolo Protti, the president of the Anec, "it is useful that new structures also arise, but the main thing is to preserve the already existing, because closing a hall in the city, not all of its regular customers are willing to visit a multiplex cinema in the periphery instead of the old one.
And here remains the missing budget for the fund of the trade association: the debt burden recorded by the state is about 10 million euros.
It is a disgrace from an ethical and moral point of view that the government does not comply with existing laws.
In order to maintain the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros per year would be necessary".
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, due to fears about the old cinemas, decided to protect them by an agreement between the municipality and the Anec; it is the first agreement of its kind in Italy aimed at protecting and supporting traditional cinemas, both in the historic center and in the periphery.
Among the measures envisaged are also tax advantages for the cinema operators as well as benefits for the public regarding local transport: it will be allowed to drive to the traffic-restricted areas of the center and also to park at cheaper parking fees.
"It is a pleasing initiative," says Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that other cities will follow our example and also develop new concepts.
Certainly, however, we also need better audio and video equipment in order to be able to align with the superpower of the multiplex halls, because after all, the audience today is more demanding.
The defence of traditional cinema has always been an important topic for me: the closure of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the decisive point that led me to found the "Nuovo cinema Paradiso", even though I had been playing with the idea for 10 years.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years; when I pass by the Rialto or the Quirinale in Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn aside to avoid seeing the dust-covered posters.
The links between politics and 'Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was ready to adapt the decisions of the municipality to the interests of the mafia group Piromalli..
The accusations made by the lawyers of the anti-mafia authority of Calabria against Mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy Rosario Schiavone of the municipality of Gioia Tauro, who were arrested this morning for involvement in mafia business, are serious.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the older mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his nephew were also handcuffed: the lawyer, who bears the same name as the boss of the clan, had already been sentenced for involvement in criminal associations of the mafia, at the time to a compensation of 10 million euros.
"In disregard of any kind of moral and legal norm," the lawyers write, "the two local administrations had decided to pay attorney Piromalli money for advisory activities."
"This had made it possible for the mafia group - according to the judges - to officially penetrate the town halls and to co-determine the policy of the public administration."
The President of the Regional Committee of Calabria Agazio Loiero does not deny that in his region "it is anything but an exception to encounter connections of local administrations and organized crime." "There are places where the concentration of the mafia is greater than in others, in which such connections are virtually inevitable.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'Ndrangheta: heroes who get a white vest."
This morning’s arrests follow those of last July, with which, according to the police, the Piromalli clan was beheaded.
Since the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, but already in 1991 – and even then due to alleged links between organised crime and local administration – local politicians had been removed from their municipal offices.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of the Udc, was elected as head of the centre-right coalition after the May 2006 general election.
He shouted scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He complained to Vice Minister of Interior Marco Minniti, whom he accused of having invented everything for political-strategic reasons, but the judges, in connection with this morning’s arrest warrant, declare that the Piromalli clan had even dared to request a change to the A3 project.
From an eavesdropping campaign in connection with the investigation into the Dal Torrione case, the willingness to respond to the wishes of an entrepreneur who is known to be a representative of the large group around the Piromalli - making public administration measures identical to the interests of this clan."
When the energy emanates from the waves, the big ones suddenly come up
It is an unfathomable source of money that covers over 70% of the planet’s surface, and it is only now that this seems to be understood by the world’s major energy companies.
Waves, currents and tides are the new renewable energy sources that everyone is now looking at, and also looking to occupy, such as giants like Chevron.
The possibility of extracting energy from the movements of the sea has been being considered and studied for 70 years; it is not by chance that these studies have intensified considerably since the first oil crisis.
When the price of oil fell in 1980, the idea of marine energy was gassed, but now the environmental organizations and the rising oil price are pushing for new impetus in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the world’s energy needs could be covered by the energy generated by the ocean waves.
This would be equivalent to double the energy currently produced by nuclear power plants.
There are also the currents and tides.
Giants on attack.
The first company to focus on marine energy is Enersis, which in 2005 signed a contract to build a power plant in the north of Portugal.
When this news was published, it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, more and more companies in the traditional energy sector are relying on marine energy production.
“Chevron is investigating these technologies,” said a spokesperson for a company known to the US giant in the Wall Street Journal, “and is considering the possibility of working with us.”
It is about obtaining an approval from the American Energy Commission, which is necessary to launch a project off the coast of Alaska.
This is a sign not to be underestimated, especially considering that especially in Alaska, oil continues to be extracted by the U.S. and President Bush recently launched plans for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey are also investing in the new industry; if the details are not known, observers say there is growing interest.
Even better technologies.
Experts are talking about a technology that is still under development, not least because the last doubts on the part of environmentalists have not yet been clarified.
So far, projects such as those in Portugal and Scotland are of rather small dimensions and do not seem to cause any serious environmental problems.
However, in order to produce energy on a large scale, technologies with a far greater impact on the environment are needed.
There are several options: Ocean Power uses a system of interconnected buoys.
The thrust of the shafts, which moves the buoys up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure within the float via pistons and cylinders.
This drives a turbine, which in turn drives a generator.
The electricity is then sent to the coast via underwater pipes.
So far, there are four planned plants of this type, which are only waiting for state approval. Part of the energy gained could also be used for military facilities.
Verdant Power already produces energy for a department store and a parking lot using subsea turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movements during the tides drive the turbines, which feed the generator due to the resulting rotational movement.
According to Verdant, a long line of potential clients is already waiting for the necessary authorizations to use these energy sources.
First the waves, then the tides.
According to the Institute for Electricity Generation Research, a particular interest immediately deserves the potential that lies in the tides.
Although this is also an irregular phenomenon, the tides are more predictable than wind currents, sunlight and also waves, and therefore a more trustworthy source of current.
The tidal energy in particular is what led states such as New York, Maine and Alaska as well as other coastal states to invest as much as $7.5 million in 2008 – up to 35 million are already planned for 2009.
