Members of the National Assembly for Wales fear confusion with the Muppets
For some members of the National Assembly, the proposal to change their title to "MWP" (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Welsh Parliament) triggers consternation.
The reason for this is plans to change the name of the National Assembly to "Welsh Parliament".
National Assembly members of all political directions fear becoming the target of ridicule.
A Labour Party member of the National Assembly said his group was concerned because the name “rhymes with ‘Twp’ and ‘Pwp’.”
For non-Welsh readers: In Welsh, "twp" stands for "doof" and "pwp" for "Aa".
A member of the Plaid Cymru party’s National Assembly said the entire group was “not happy” and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his group was open to the name change, but pointed out the great similarity between "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similar to the letter u in the English spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting a law for the name changes, said: “The final decision on designations for the members of the National Assembly is, of course, up to the members themselves.”
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 authorized the Welsh National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the panel published the results of a public hearing on the proposals, which gave broad support for the name 'Welsh Parliament' for the National Assembly.
As regards the title of the members of the National Assembly, the body preferred "Welsh Parliament Members" or "WMPs", while the "MWP" option received the greatest support in a public hearing.
National Assembly members seem to be proposing alternative options, but the struggle for consensus for President Elin Jones to submit a bill within weeks could pose a problem.
The law on the reforms will include further changes to the workings of the National Assembly, including rules to disqualify members of the National Assembly and to design the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly may vote on their name in their debate on the law.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on a change of country name
Voters will decide on Sunday whether to change the name of their country to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum was set to settle a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has a province with the similar name of Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour means that it is claiming Greek territory and has repeatedly opposed its accession to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the name change, said he would not recognize the vote.
Supporters of the referendum, however, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's are silent in the face of the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
“The old people I spoke to said there was a bar and a church on every corner in the past,” Adams said.
“Now both are no longer there.”
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“People’s social life is different today,” he said.
“Bars are no longer the neighborhood’s living rooms where people regularly come in.”
With the churches, he fears that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the church leaders assume, and that they will “earlier or later be back at the beginning.”
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums where people live who do not support the remaining havens.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white," he said, "and thus speed up the complete closure of these churches, as it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these condominiums will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist church moved out in the 1930s.
A black community that held its worship services nearby became the owner of the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black community under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers in 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or support blacks.
In a fire in 1939, the building was severely damaged, but when Father Johnson's parishioners planned to rebuild, they commissioned the carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly described the carillon as "the bells of the poor".
The expert who ringed the bell in July used other words: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also found that it was the world’s first glockenspiel played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who had switched to the larger glockenspiel at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said he was not replaced by St. Martin's.
What has taken place in St. Martin’s in recent months is a complicated story with architects and contractors, some of whom have been called in by the church’s lay leaders and some of whom have been called in by the diocese.
In July, the local council – the church’s leadership body consisting of lay leaders – expressed written concerns to the diocese that the diocese would try to pass on the costs to the local council, although it had not been involved in commissioning the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injured in California 13-year-old while diving after lobster
In California, on Saturday, the first day of the lobster season, according to official statements, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy while diving for lobster.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego, he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy’s cry for help and paddled to the boy with several others to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said he first thought the boy was happy to have caught a lobster, but then he realized that the boy was screaming, “I’ve been bitten!
I have been bitten!".
When Hammel arrived at the boy, he noticed that his entire collarbone had been torn open.
“I screamed that everyone should come out of the water, ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” added Hammel.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is in critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack was unknown.
Rescue swimmer Captain Larry Giles told the media that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was concluded that it was not a dangerous species of shark.
Giles added that the victim had suffered traumatic injuries in the upper body area.
For investigative and security reasons, officials blocked beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Encinitas for 48 hours.
According to Giles, there are over 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to launch into the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's attacks departments with department store-like cosmetics staffed with specialized assistants, boots, superdrug and Debenhams.
As part of a large-scale push into the UK’s <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion cosmetics market, which continues to grow as fashion and household goods sales decline, the larger cosmetics departments will be tested in eleven stores across the country and, if successful, will be expanded to more stores next year.
The investment in cosmetics coincides with the supermarkets’ search for ways to reuse store space previously used for televisions, microwaves and household goods.
According to Sainsbury’s, the scope of its cosmetics offering doubles for the first time to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing series from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space and brand areas similar to those in stores like Boots.
In addition, the supermarket is launching a relaunch of its “Boutique” makeup series, so that most of the products are vegan-friendly – an aspect that is increasingly being demanded by younger customers.
In addition, the fragrance retailer will test the Fragrance Shop at two Sainsbury’s stores, the first opening last week in Croydon, south London, and the second opening later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and the transition to daily buying small amounts of food in local grocery stores mean that supermarkets need to do more to get customers to visit them.
According to Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, the outlets will increasingly look like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to battle discounters Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food items.
Since the purchase of the Argos and Habitat chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has established Argos outlets in hundreds of branches and a number of Habitat outlets, increasing food sales and the profitability of the acquisitions.
The supermarket’s previous attempt to reorganize its cosmetics and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but ended after a dispute over the distribution of revenue from the drugstore's stores in the supermarkets.
The new strategy follows Sainsbury’s sale of its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, the owner of Lloyd’s Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
The company stated that Lloyds will play a role in the plan, adding an expanded range of luxury skincare brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director at Sainsbury’s, said: “We’ve redesigned the appearance of our cosmetics departments to create a more attractive environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in specially trained colleagues who are available as consultants.
Our range of brands is tailored to meet all needs, and due to the tempting environment and favourable locations, we are now an attractive destination for cosmetic purchases that challenges the way we have been shopping."
Peter Jones "angry" after Holly Willoughby's withdrawal from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
"Dragons' Den" star Peter Jones is "furious" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdrew from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle brand company to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for the joint homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The business of the two was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop.
This Morning presenter, 37, has announced her withdrawal from Instagram.
Holly Willoughby angered "Dragons' Den" star Peter Jones by her extremely short-term withdrawal from her lucrative lifestyle brand company to focus on her own new follow-up contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones is said to have been "furious" when the "Golden Girl" of television admitted, at a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that due to her new business - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - she could no longer devote enough time to the joint homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s brand Goop and would probably have doubled Willoughby’s estimated assets of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
While Willoughby, 37, announced her withdrawal from Truly on Instagram, Jones left the UK on his way to one of his vacation homes.
A source said: “Truly had by far the highest priority for Holly.
It should secure their future over the next few decades.
Their decision to withdraw came as a complete surprise to all involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
At the headquarters in Marlow, a warehouse full of goods is waiting to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the “This Morning” presenter, one of Britain’s most promising stars, could cost the company millions due to high investments in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and homewear, and potential further delays in market launch.
In addition, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couples spend the holiday together, and Jones holds a 40 percent stake in Baldwin’s TV production company.
Willoughby is to become a brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as the presenter of ITV’s “I’m A Celebrity”.
A source close to Jones said last night, “We’re not commenting on his business affairs.”
Hard words "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he expected from the news media for a comment that some would consider “non-presidential” and for such positive comments about the leader of North Korea.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said, imitating the voice of a news presenter:
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting as the first meeting in Singapore in June was praised by Trump as a major step towards North Korea’s denuclearization.
However, the denuclearisation negotiations have stalled.
Over three months after the June summit in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, North Korea’s top diplomat, told leaders around the world at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North sees no “corresponding response” from the US to North Korea’s first disarmament measures.
Instead, he noted, the United States insisted on sanctions to maintain the pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his rally speech.
“We are very successful with North Korea,” he said.
“We were at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim showed positive results: end of missile tests, support in the release of hostages, and return of the remains of American military personnel.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about the relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people standing outside trying to get into this crowded arena, about 200 people would be standing here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquakes devastate an island in Indonesia and cost hundreds of lives
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told they would not be needed.
Although over 10 percent of the population of Lombok was displaced, no national emergency has been declared, a prerequisite for mobilizing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they are not asking for international support, so that is somewhat difficult," Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain whether foreign staff can work on site.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the civil protection agency, said Indonesian officials were evaluating the situation in Palu on whether international bodies could participate in the relief efforts.
Given the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly struggling with, the country is still unfortunately poorly prepared for natural forces.
While tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, these are not a common sight on other coastal strips.
The apparently missing tsunami warning siren in Palu, despite a warning that came into effect, probably contributed to the deaths.
Travelling between Indonesia’s numerous islands is a challenge even in the best case scenario.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but will reach the site of the new disaster in three days at the earliest.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of Indonesian infrastructure the core of his election campaign, spending a lot of money on roads and railways.
However, the government of Joko, who is aiming for re-election next year, is suffering from financing deficits.
Joko is also under pressure from ongoing religious tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority practice a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands expelled from their homes and homes as gangs of Christians and Muslims fought in the streets with machetes, arrows and bows, and other primitive weapons.
View: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge scores deep offset against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool on Saturday at London's Stamford Bridge Stadium with a hit in the 89th minute before a Premier League loss to Chelsea.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri at a 0:1 gap of his team at about 27 meters from Chelsea’s goal.
He aimed the ball to the left and then shot it in the direction of the rear post.
The shot sailed high over the penalty area and drifted into the top right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball fell over the jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and then into the net.
"I was just trying to get to this position and get to the ball. Players like Shaq always play as much forward as possible, so I was just trying to make as much time for myself as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante coming and had contact with the ball. I didn’t think too much about it and just accepted the shot.”
Chelsea led by Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute after a 1-0 draw.
The Blues striker gave a pass with the heel back to Mateo, then turned off near the midfield and sprinted into Liverpool's half.
Kovacic played a quick double pass in the midfield.
He then shot a good steep pass, so Hazard got into the penalty area.
Hazard left the defenders behind and closed off with a left-hand shot at Liverpool's Alisson Becker past the back of the net.
Liverpool will play in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 15:00 at Stadio San Paolo in Naples.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 15:00 on Thursday in London.
The number of deaths from tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The number of deaths from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the civil protection agency said on Sunday morning.
Many people are said to have been trapped in the rubble of buildings that had collapsed due to the magnitude 7.5 earthquake on Friday, which had triggered waves up to six meters high, authorities spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho reported in a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was dotted with the debris of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed
Following the discovery of a woman's body this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, a murder investigation has been initiated.
The 44-year-old was found with stab wounds in Grayson Mews on John Street at 7:55 p.m. A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are asking residents to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is in an early stage, but I would ask anyone who has stayed near John Street in Birkenhead and has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also ask all people, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something with a dashcam, to contact us, who may have information that is of the utmost importance to our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was living in Birkenhead and was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who believe to know the woman arrived at the scene to inquire where she was found this morning.
Investigations are underway, and police said they are about to inform the victim’s nearest relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews was just trying to get to his apartment, but was informed by police that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he learned what had happened.
Residents are now informed that it will take hours before they can re-enter the building.
It was heard as a police officer told a man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears dissolved at the scene of the event.
She repeatedly said, “This is so terrible.”
At 2:00 p.m., two police vehicles were inside the gate and another vehicle was in front of the gate.
Within the gate were several police officers who were monitoring the apartment block.
Persons who have information are asked to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111 and refer to Minutes 247 dated September 30.
The Cromwell statue in front of Parliament becomes the newest monument to be the subject of the dispute over the rewriting of history
Their exile would be poetic justice for the destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious artifacts by its fanatical Puritan followers, reminiscent of the Taliban.
The Cromwell Society, however, described Crick's proposal as "foolishness" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the current debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell was targeted outside the Westminster Palace.
The picture storm in the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the deeds of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s magnificent depiction of Cromwell is evidence of the 19th century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many still believe is worth celebrating.
Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps at the end of the 19th century more than it is today, as someone who defended Parliament against pressure from the outside, in his case, of course, by the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely true representation is the subject of ongoing history debates.
It is certain that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure that represents one side of this gap.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and remembering them."
Killer pig bites Chinese farmers dead
According to local media reports, a farmer in a market in southwest China was attacked and killed by a pig.
The man, to whom only the surname "Yuan" was given, was found dead with a severed artery blood-flowing near a pigsty in the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, is preparing to inject pig vaccines.
He was reportedly on Wednesday with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and saw that a door to a neighboring pig stable was open.
He said there was a large male pig with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that the 250-kilo-pound pig had bitten the farmer to death.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and mutilated,” the cousin, to whom the surname “Wu” was given, was quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
A security camera shot showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was neither Yuan nor his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent attacks on more people while the police at the crime scene collected evidence.
Yuan’s family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although it is rare for pigs to attack humans, such cases are known.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, where the man suffered serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a 290-kilo-pound pig pinched a Welsh farmer between himself and a tractor until the farmer’s wife could scare the animal away.
After a farmer was eaten by his pigs in Oregon in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a “trigger.”
“They are just playful.
They like twitching and are very curious, ... they are not looking to hurt anyone.
You just have to treat them with the right degree of respect," he said.
Hurricane Rosa Remains Bringing Widespread Heavy Rain to Southwestern U.S.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening along the way across the colder waters on the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring flooding triggering rainfall in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
On Sunday at 5:00 a.m. east coast time, Rosa showed wind speeds of 136 km/h, equivalent to a Category 1 hurricane, and was located 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a trough begins to form over the Pacific Ocean, heading east to the west coast of the United States. When Rosa reaches the peninsula of Baja California as a tropical storm on Monday, high tropical humidity is transported north to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will trigger up to 25 centimeters of precipitation in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, in the coming days, tropical moisture will produce widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest through interactions with the approaching trough.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation can cause dangerous flooding, floating debris in the water, and possibly landslides in the desert.
High tropical humidity sometimes leads to precipitation rates of almost 5 to 7.5 centimeters per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest, especially in a large part of Arizona, up to 5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation is expected.
Due to the scattering of tropical rainfall, there is a possibility of flooding with rapidly deteriorating conditions.
Given the impending tropical rainfall, it is strongly advised not to walk into the desert.
Heavy rainfall can cause torrential streams to flow out of the canyons, and thunderstorms bring local wind gusts as well as winds that carry dust.
The approaching trough brings local heavy rain to parts of the southern California coast.
Total amounts of precipitation of more than one centimeter are possible, which can lead to small amounts of debris floating in the water and to smooth roadways.
This would be the first rainy season in the region.
The first occasional tropical rain showers reach Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning. On Monday evening and Tuesday it rains widely.
On Tuesday, heavy rain spreads into the Four Corners region and stops over Wednesday.
In October, strong temperature fluctuations are possible throughout the United States as the Arctic cools while the tropics remain relatively warm.
This sometimes leads to drastic temperature differences over short distances.
On Sunday, there is a good example of drastic temperature differences in the middle of the United States.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, there is a temperature difference of almost 12 oC.
Over the next few days, the sustained summer heat is trying to develop and expand again.
For much of the middle and east of the United States, a warm beginning of October is expected with widespread temperatures of around 27 oC from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
New York City could reach 27 oC on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast suggests a high probability of above-average temperatures in the east of the United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million viewers watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
Over 20 million viewers on six television networks on Thursday saw the captivating statements of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and his wife, Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political stalemate continued, and the TV channels interrupted their regular program on Friday because of a last-minute twist: an agreement negotiated by Jeff Flake, Arizona Senator, that the FBI should conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100% sure Kavanaugh was drunk at a high school party, harassed her, and tried to remove her clothes.
Kavanaugh said in a passionate statement that he was 100% sure that this had not happened.
It is likely that more than the 20.4 million viewers reported by Nielsen have seen the hearing.
The company determined the average attendance on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other networks such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network that had broadcast the hearing, the figures were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen usually has problems measuring viewer numbers in offices.
To put this into perspective: This corresponds approximately to the number of spectators at a play-off football game or at the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose opinion-oriented presenters strongly support Kavanaugh’s nomination, recorded the highest numbers of all networks, with an average of 5.69 million viewers attending the full-day hearing.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican’s office released a statement stating that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning as protesters loudly harassed him in the elevator on the way to a judicial committee hearing.
He stood with a lowered gaze for minutes while being insulted, and the scene was broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm right here in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?"
“They have power while so many women are powerless,” one woman said.
Flake said his office had published a statement and added before the elevator closed that he would have more to say at the hearing before the committee.
All cable and broadcast networks broadcast live hours later, when the Judiciary Committee was to vote on the forwarding of Kavanaugh’s nomination for voting to the entire Senate.
However, Flake said he would only do so on condition that the FBI investigate the allegations against the candidate next week as demanded by the Democratic minority.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After an interview with Coons and subsequently several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was of great importance, as it was obvious that without the investigation, Republicans would not have enough votes to confirm Kavanaugh.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of using Brexit for political purposes
Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of using Britain’s future for political purposes and undermining the nation’s interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will meet at the Conservative Party Congress in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another interview published alongside the interview with her on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson intensified his attack on her so-called “Chequers plan” for Brexit by calling a proposal that provides for the mutual collection of tariffs by the UK and the EU “totally absurd”.
Deadly shots on Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in connection with LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in connection with the fatal shootings at Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University (LSU).
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned for homicide, according to Baton Rouge police.
The agency released video footage of the clash between Sims and Simpson. According to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
As CBS partner station WAFB reports, police secured the glasses at the scene, saying that Simpson's glasses had DNA found.
Following an interview with Simpson, the police said he had confessed to the deadly shootings on Wayde.
The lawyer said the bail was set at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report on Friday stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The police thank the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the federal state police forensic laboratory, the Southern University Police, and the residents of the area for their support in the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked the regional enforcement agency for “their care and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
He grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne had played basketball for LSU.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "deeply shaken" by Wayde's death and "under shock."
“You’re always afraid of that,” Wade said.
Volcano spits ashes on Mexico City.
Ash ejected from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern quarter of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater increased and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded within 24 hours.
The agency monitored numerous cases of grunts and tremors.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on the windshields of cars in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have seen increased activity at the volcano located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Clashes between police and Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of independence vote
In Barcelona, after clashes between police and pro-independence protesters, six people were arrested on Saturday and thousands took part in other demonstrations to commemorate the first anniversary of the polarizing independence referendum in Catalonia.
A group of masked pro-separatists, detained by the emergency police, threw eggs into them and also threw paint powder, creating dark dust clouds in the streets normally populated by tourists.
Over the course of the day, there were also hand-mixes with the police, who used their batons to contain the fighting.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted “No Forgotten, No Forgive” while facing Unionists shouting “Long live Spain”.
According to the local press, fourteen people were treated for minor injuries in the protests.
A year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid considered illegal, but was celebrated by separatist Catalans, the situation in the independent region remains very tense.
Voters had voted for independence by an overwhelming majority, although the turnout was low, as the anti-secessionists mostly boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when the police tried to prevent the vote in violent clashes in front of the polling stations.
Pro-independence groups had camped outdoors overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration for the national police.
The demonstration took place, but was forced to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who took part with his wife in the protest of the separatists, said he sees the prospects that Catalonia would gain independence no longer with hope.
“Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry for joy because they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite an important, albeit scarce, victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan pro-independence parties had difficulty maintaining the momentum this year. Many of their most famous leaders are either in self-imposed exile or in prison, waiting for their trials for their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in favor of the police on his phone, said the conflict had been fueled by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is becoming more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in custody since the end of last year, announced his candidacy for the European Parliament elections next year.
“Being a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the degradation of democratic values and the repression by the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after house was hit by car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a house in Londonderry had been rammed several times by a car.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself were damaged.
In addition, a crossbow may have been shot at the car.
Menga hit means 1-0 win for Livingston over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the victory.
Livingston FC surprised the Rangers and led to Steven Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's hit proved to be crucial for Gary Holt's team to match Hibernian in the second half.
Gerrard's team will remain in the Premiership without a win this season and will face the Hearts next Sunday, who are eight points behind.
Previously, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston can meanwhile increase his winning series in the division to six games, meaning head coach Holt hasn’t suffered a defeat since taking over from Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses chances against boldly playing guests
Holt’s team should have been in the lead long before the hit, as his directness put the Rangers before a variety of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through, but slowed down in front of the goal. Then Alan Lithgow could only shoot far after he slipped in to hit Craig Halkett's head shot past the goal.
The hosts were content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could hinder the guests in standard situations.
This is how the decisive gate came about.
The Rangers allowed a free kick, and Livingston prepared a chance, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson jointly shooting Menga, who shot the goal with a ball contact from the middle of the penalty area.
At this stage, the Rangers had dominated the possession of the ball, but were unable to overcome the hosts' defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly remained largely undisturbed.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos once forced Kelly to defend.
Scott Pittman was repulsed with his feet by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow passed the ball from another standard situation of Livingston.
Flanks repeatedly entered Livingston’s penalty area and were regularly taken out of the danger area, while two required penalty shots – one from Halkett against the substituted Glenn Middleton and one due to handplay – were denied.
“Phänomenal” by Livingston – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and a strong result for Livingston.
They were excellent without exception and have once again exceeded expectations in this upward trend.
Their way of playing and their team have hardly changed since they returned to the top teams, but Holt deserves great praise for the way he has been waking up the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great, leading an excellently organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on track throughout the game.
However, the Rangers were lacking in inspiration.
As good as they were at times under Gerrard, they could not reach that standard.
Their last ball was insufficient – only once they were able to penetrate the hosts’ team – and that’s kind of like a wake-up call for the Rangers who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received with mixed reactions in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29), smiling faces and blue skies prevailed when the heads of government of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany to repair relations between NATO allies.
There had been disputes over issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Erdogan then travelled to Cologne to open a large new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police cited security reasons for preventing a 25,000-strong crowd from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters found themselves nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, also made themselves heard, condemning Erdogan’s policies as well as the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The opposing protests reflect the polarizing effect of the visitor, who is praised by some German Turks as a hero and slandered by others as an autocrat.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with car
A collision with a car killed a cyclist in London.
The clash occurred around 10:15 AM UK DST near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped, and paramedics took care of the man, who died at the scene of the accident.
Months before the accident, another cyclist had been killed in a driver-evasion accident on Childers Street, about one mile away from Saturday’s accident.
According to the Metropolitan Police, officials were working to identify the man and notify his nearest relatives.
Road closures and diversions for buses have been set up, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long-Lartin prison: Six officials injured in riots
According to the Prison Office, six prison officials were injured in riots in a high-security prison for men.
The riots broke out on Sunday at around 9:30 a.m. UK Summer Time in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and still continue.
Specialized “Tornado” officials have been called in to end the riots involving eight inmates limited to one wing.
Officials were treated on site for minor facial injuries.
A spokesperson for the Prison Service said: “Specially trained prison personnel have been deployed to remedy an ongoing incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and would like to make it clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and will possibly spend longer time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin is home to more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous offenders.
In June, it was reported that the head of the prison was treated in the hospital after an attack by a prisoner.
In October last year, operatives were called to the prison to take action against serious riots, in which staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flood-like flooding (dry areas may benefit)
It’s rare for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that’s likely to happen early next week when the remnants of Hurricane Rosa pull over the desert-ridden southwest and carry the risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings on Monday and Tuesday from the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada as well as southeast of California and Utah including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will approach with rain on Monday evening and pull directly over Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have come close to Phoenix as a tropical storm or tropical depression up to 320 kilometers!
Katrina (1967) was found as a hurricane within 64 kilometers of the Arizona border."
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation with occasional up to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
In other areas of the deserted southwest, including the central Rockies and the Great Basin, 2.5 to 5 centimeters is likely and in some cases a total of up to 10 centimeters is possible.
For those who are not at risk of flooding, the pink-associated rainfall can be a blessing due to the drought in the region.
Although flooding is of great concern, this rain is likely to be partly useful as there is currently drought in the southwest.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, at least extreme drought occurs in just over 40 percent of Arizona, the second-highest category," reported weather.com.
First, the path of the hurricane means that Rosa will meet on land on the peninsula of Baja California in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa will still have hurricane force with maximum winds of 136 kilometers per hour and will be located 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, after which the hurricane will move north at 19 kilometers per hour.
In the Pacific, the storm will hit colder water and thereby weaken.
Therefore, Rosa is expected to hit land on Monday afternoon or evening in Mexico with the strength of a tropical storm.
The rainfall can be severe in parts of Mexico, so there is a significant risk of flooding.
"From Baja California to the northwest of the Sonora Desert, precipitation is expected to be 7.5 to 15 centimeters, with up to 25 centimeters possible," weather.com reported.
Subsequently, Rosa will pull northward as a tropical storm over Mexico, reach the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, and then pull up through Arizona to the south of Utah until late Tuesday night.
“As the main threat associated with Rosa or its remains, very strong precipitation is expected in Baja California, the northwest of the Sonora Desert and the desert-ridden southwest of the United States,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
As a result of these precipitations, life-threatening flooding and waterborne debris are expected in the desert, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted murder
After finding a 16-year-old with stab wounds in Somerset, three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
The teenager was found injured on Saturday at around 4:00 a.m. UK Summer Time in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to a hospital, and his condition is "stable".
According to Avon and Somerset police, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
Officials asked anyone who had records of the events on a mobile phone to report.
Trump said Kavanaugh had “suffered from the vileness, the anger” of the Democrats.
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the unscrupulous and outrageous tactics of the Democrats," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had suffered “under the vileness, the anger” of the Democrats throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, dismissing the accusation made by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually harassed her decades ago when both were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on her allegations.
The president said on Saturday that the American people had seen the brilliance, quality and courage of Kavanaugh on that day.
“A vote for the affirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for the affirmation of one of the most experienced legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an outstanding record in service to the public,” he told the crowd of his followers in West Virginia.
The president was indirectly referring to Kavanaugh’s nomination when he spoke of the importance of the participation of Republican voters in the midterm elections.
“Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our lives.
I’m not going to run, but in reality I’m going to run,” he said.
“That’s why I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere.”
Trump argued that Democrats see their mission as “resisting and blocking.”
The first major procedural vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected to take place in the Senate no later than Friday, a senior GOP leadership official told CNN.
Hundreds killed in earthquake in Indonesia, death toll rises
According to authorities on Saturday, at least 384 people were killed, many of them swam away when huge waves hit the beaches due to a strong earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a feast on the beach of the city of Palu on Friday, when at dawn waves up to six meters high hit the beach, ripping many people to death and destroying everything in their way.
The tsunami was preceded by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
“When the threat of the tsunami rose yesterday, people were still pursuing their activities on the beach and did not immediately run away, and they fell victim to it,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian civil protection agency BNPB at a conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, it flooded cars, tree trunks and houses with it, it hit everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had crossed the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people had climbed trees while fleeing the tsunami and survived, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated and accommodated in 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the Civil Protection Agency showed numerous destroyed buildings and shops, bent and collapsed bridges, as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal town was shaken by further aftershocks.
The earthquake series was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian agency BPPT (Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology) said in a statement that the energy released during the massive earthquake on Friday corresponded to 200 times the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
Due to the city's location at the end of a long, narrow bay, the tsunami could have increased, the authority said.
Nugroho described the damage as “comprehensive” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
According to him, the bodies of some victims were found under the rubble of collapsed buildings, 540 people were injured, and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and damage could have been higher along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
Communication with Donggala was completely paralyzed, according to Nugroho, and there was no information.
According to a statement by the Red Cross, more than 300,000 people live there, and its staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse," the statement said.
On Saturday, the authorities were often criticized for not informing them that a tsunami had hit Palu, despite the waves, according to official reports, arriving at the time of the warning.
Amateur footage published on social media shows a man on the upper floor of a building desperately warning people on the street beneath him of the impending tsunami.
Within minutes, a water wall crashes onto the shore and floats buildings and cars away.
Reuters was unable to immediately verify the authenticity of the footage.
The quake and tsunami caused a massive power outage that interrupted communications around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
According to the authorities, the military has started sending cargo aircraft with support from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuees still urgently need food and other essential goods.
The city's airport will remain closed until October and was reopened only for relief purposes.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of tsunami victims has risen to more than 800.
The location is very bad.
The employees of World Vision from Donggala have safely reached the city of Palu, where the employees are housed in tent accommodations in the courtyard of their office, but according to Dosebas, they passed scenes of devastation along the way.
“They said they had seen many destroyed houses,” he said.
The location is very bad.
Even as the relief groups began with the hard task of launching disaster relief, some agreed that expert foreign helpers would be prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, financial assistance, supplies and staff from abroad are only possible if the location of an accident has been declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened so far.
“At the moment, it’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says 'okay, this is a national disaster', we can accept international support, but so far this status does not apply."
As the second night since the earthquake and tsunami of Friday went down over Palu, friends and family members of the still missing hoped for one of the miracles that lighten up the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small boy was pulled out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been clamped under rubble next to her mother’s body for two days.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding national team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other prisoners at the Roa-Roa Hotel were, as Mandagi added, his students.
“As a senior paraglider, I have my own emotional burden to carry,” he said.
Gendon told how in the hours following the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel among the paragliders, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the contestants from Palu who attended the beach party.
However, instead of blue check marks, his messages only led to gray question marks.
“I think that means the news hasn’t been delivered,” he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 while filling up an ATM in Newport on the Levee
According to a press release from Newport police, on Friday morning in Newport on the Levee, thieves stole a Brink’s employee from filling up an ATM for $26,750.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied an ATM in the entertainment complex and wanted to make more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, "a man ran behind the employee of Brink's" and stole a bag full of money intended for the vending machine.
According to the press release, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not say how many people were involved in the incident.
Persons who have information about the identity of the suspects are asked to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper Changes His Name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
In announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “The being formally known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and has used it as the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change precedes his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where the release of his new album “Yandhi” is expected.
He appears on the show as a replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the producer, has cancelled for "emotional reasons".
The word is not only an abbreviation of its current professional name, but it has, according to its own statement, a religious meaning for West.
"I think 'ye' is the word most commonly used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said this year in a conversation about his album with radio presenter Big Boy.
“So I’m you, I’m us, it’s us.
Kanye, which means ‘the only one’, became just ‘yes’ – simply a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, of everything.
The album is more of a reflection of what we are."
He is one of several famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known by the names Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, with whom West previously worked, has already written his name with and without hyphens and capital letters.
Mexico’s AMLO vows not to use the military against the civilian population
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed never to use military force against the civilian population as the 50th anniversary of bloody retaliation against students in his country approaches.
Lopez Obrador pledged on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to “never use the military to oppress the Mexican people.”
Soldiers had fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people. At that time, left-wing student movements were establishing themselves throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador vowed to support young Mexicans through monthly grants for students and the opening of other free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training opportunities led young people to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its funding for artificial intelligence
Given China’s increased activities in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its spending on research in this field, says investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow AI announcements from various areas of the U.S. government, even though the U.S. generally lacks a formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: The country intends to become the No. 1 in the field of AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start given that all other countries are so far behind the US, and we are looking for the next AI breakthrough,” Lee said.
The doubling of financial resources could double the chances that the next big AI success in the U.S. would be achieved, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that defeated the highest ranked American Othello player, later serving as senior executive at Microsoft Research and president of the Google branch in China.
Lee honored previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge (DARPA) and asked about the time of the next competition, as he wanted to help identify the next visionaries.
According to Lee, researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to receive government subsidies.
"Not China takes away the top academics, but the companies," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have hired alphabets from universities to work on AI.
Lee’s view is that a change in U.S. immigration policy could also be conducive to the U.S.’s AI efforts.
“I think that in the field of AI, people with a PhD should automatically be offered green cards,” he said.
In July 2017, China’s State Council presented its plan for the development of the next generation of AI technologies (Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan).
According to Lee, the National Natural Science Foundation of China is funding individuals at academic institutions similar to the National Science Foundation and other governmental organizations granting funds to U.S. researchers, however, the quality of academic work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which will involve industry and science partners, and the White House announced the creation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in the AI Next initiative this month.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) is currently investing more than $100 million annually in AI research.
In the meantime, nothing has been done about U.S. laws regarding the formation of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia", a measure that would settle a decades-old dispute with Greece that had blocked Macedonia's applications for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour means that it is claiming Greek territory, which is why Greece has vetoed Macedonia’s accession to NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he will not vote in the referendum, and a boycott campaign puts in doubt that the turnout will reach the 50 percent required for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the ballot was: "Do you support membership of NATO and the EU by adopting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, which includes Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, the admission into organisations such as the EU and NATO is worth the price.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have said they would stick to the result so it is decisive.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, in which 66 percent of registered voters had voted.
"I'm here to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko will cast their vote in a referendum on September 30, 2018, in Strumica, Macedonia, on the change of country name, which would open the way for Macedonia to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and presented chairs in front of tents set up by people who wanted to boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join the raised head, not through the back door," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the integration between Europe and Asia.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will result in much-needed investment for Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
"I believe that a large majority will be in favour, as more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," Zaev said.
In his words, a "yes" result would be a "confirmation of our future".
According to a survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
Another survey conducted by Macedonian broadcaster Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
70% of them said they would vote "yes".
For the referendum to be successful, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it took power in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City maneuvered through the entire Brighton defense to score goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton at Etihad Stadium in Manchester on Saturday in the 2-0 win against Manchester City.
Aguero made his goal look ridiculously easy in the 65th minute.
The Argentinian attacker received a pass in the midfield at the beginning of the sequence.
He rushed between three Brighton defenders and then ran into the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green jerseys.
He played around a defender and then overtook several more defenders on the edge of Brighton's penalty area.
He then shot a pass to the left to Sterling.
The English attacker used his first ball contact in the penalty area to play the ball back to Aguero, who with his right shoe overcame Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan and shot into the right side of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with problems in his feet," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked about him playing for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at that moment."
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League duel.
That goal fell in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball on this move far on the side of Brighton.
He shot a good steep pass along the left flank to Leroy Sané.
Sané needed a few trains to steer Sterling to the long corner.
The Sky Blues attacker aimed the ball into the net just before it slipped out.
City will play in the Champions League group game on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim against Hoffenheim.
Scherzer wants to ruin the Rockies game
Since the Nationals have been eliminated from the playoff competition, there was little reason to force a further bet.
However, the always-performing joker hopes to stand on the hill against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if this is relevant to the Rockies, who have a game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West, for the playoffs.
The Rockies scored at least one wildcard with a 5:2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but still want to secure their first division title.
“Although we don’t play for anything, we can at least throw because we know the atmosphere of the spectators here in Denver and the other team would probably play at the highest level that I would encounter this year.
Why shouldn't I want to take part in this competition?"
The Nationals have not yet announced a starting player for Sunday, but are inclined, according to reports, to have jokers thrown in such a situation.
Scherzer, for whom this would be the 34th bet as a starting player, practiced in the bullpen on Thursday and would throw on Sunday on his normal rest day.
The Washington right-hander has a statistic of 18-7 this season, showing an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump holds rally in West Virginia
The president was indirectly referring to the situation in connection with Brett Kavanaugh, whom he selected for the Supreme Court, when he spoke of the importance of the participation of Republican voters in the mid-term elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our lives.
That’s one of the big, big ones – I’m not running, but in reality I’m running, that’s why I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere,” he said.
Trump continued, “You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to take back power by all means, they see the vileness, the abomination.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, we won’t give them.”
The Democrats, he said, saw their mission as “resisting and blocking.”
"And you see this over the last four days," he said, describing the Democrats as "angry and mean and disgusting and dishonest."
He named the highest-ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Dianne Feinstein, which sparked loud shouts in the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you let the document go outside?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh, no, I'm waiting for you one—that was really bad body language—the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour no longer accepts all opinions.
The party is intolerant of those who say their opinion.
When the momentum activists in my local party voted to blame me, this came as little surprise.
After all, I am the last of a number of Labour MPs to be told they are not welcome – just because we say our opinion.
My fellow Member of Parliament Joan Ryan was treated similarly because she had been vigorously opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for having a different opinion than Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically on similar issues that Jeremy disagreed with former top politicians.
The announcement at Nottingham East Labour’s meeting on Friday said “the meetings should involve all and be productive.”
Most of the Friday evening GC meetings in my eight years as a local Labour MP were just that.
Today, unfortunately, most meetings are not shaped by this tone, and the promised "more friendly, more cautious" policy has long been forgotten, if ever begun.
It is becoming increasingly clear that divergent views in the Labour Party are not tolerated and that any opinion is judged according to whether it is accepted by the party’s leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became the party leader, and colleagues with whom I previously thought I would share similar political views were now expecting me to reverse and take positions that I would otherwise never have agreed with – be it on national security or the European internal market.
Whenever I speak in public – no matter what I say – a slander triad follows on social media that calls for my resignation, denounces the political center, and says I shouldn’t be a member of the Labour Party.
And with this experience, I am not alone.
In fact, I know that I feel better than some of my colleagues, as the comments I make are mostly political in nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a flood of sexist or racist insults on a daily basis and never give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political age is that insults have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn called last week for the Labour Party to promote a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we no longer accept all opinions, and with every motion of censure and every change in the electoral rules, the party becomes more narrow-minded.
In the last two years, I have often been advised to retract my mind and not express my opinion so clearly, so that I would have "no problems".
But I didn’t go into politics for that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, prompted by the neglect of the Thatcher government, which literally caused my classroom in the general school to break apart, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most – as a municipal councillor as well as as a cabinet minister.
I have never made a hollow out of my political views, even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be in any way unclear about my political positions and about areas in which I disagree with the current leadership.
To the supporters of Friday’s motion, I just want to say the following: Given that the country is rushing to a Brexit that will harm households, businesses and our public service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
In fact, however, I am not addressing this one message to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether or not they are Labour members: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that so many dismissal threats or political intent will not stop me from acting in my opinion in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr vs Melrose 38:17: Undefeated Ayr team rises to the top
Two late attempts may have slightly distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr earned the victory in this extremely entertaining game of the day in the Tennent's Premiership.
They are now the only of the ten teams to be unbeaten at the top of the table.
In the end, the success of the home team was due to their superior defense as well as their better utilization of chances, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
“We’ve been put to the test in our games so far, and we’re still unbeaten, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Acknowledgement for Ayr, they took advantage of their chances better than we did."
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, which was raised by Frazier Clima, brought Ayr in the lead, however, Melrose was able to let the numbers speak, and Jason Baggot caught a non-raised attempt, due to a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who had been exempted for the game by the Warriors.
Clima expanded Ayr's lead with a penalty kick before scoring a goal directly at halftime and then scoring an increased try on his own, making it 17:5 for Ayr.
However, Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was increased by Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
After a prolonged interruption due to a severe injury from Ruaridh Knott, Ayr expanded his lead by a Clima-raised attempt by Stafford McDowall.
Then, acting as Captain of Ayr, Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, and again, at the end of a phase of enormous pressure, Melrose had the extra man pay by a non-increased attempt by Bruce Colvine.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tackling without a ball against Clima, MacPherson scored a touchdown from the penalty alley behind the advancing Ayr package.
Clima increased almost since the interruption, after Kyle Rowe intercepted David Armstrong's boxing kick and sent flank player Gregor Henry off for the fifth try of the home team.
Still Game Star Seems Ready for New Career in Gastronomy
“Still Game” star Ford Kieran seems ready for a change into the hospitality industry after it turned out that he was named as the managing director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC broadcast, whose screenplays he writes and in which he plays one of the leading roles alongside his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last of the show, and Kiernan seems to be planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is managing director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a source in the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan was interested in entering Glasgow's "flooring restaurant business."
“The sea belongs to us”: Bolivia enclosed by land hopes that a court will open its way to the Pacific
Sailors patroll in front of the Navy headquarters in La Paz, decorated with rope.
A blue flag is floating on public buildings.
Fleet bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon have the motto: “The sea is our rightful property.
To regain it is a duty.”
Throughout Bolivia, surrounded by land, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in a bloody conflict over resources in the 19th century is as alive as the desire to cross the Pacific again.
These hopes may be as strong as they have not been in decades, as Bolivia is waiting for a ruling by the International Court of Justice to be delivered on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the impetus, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, expects the result with a positive attitude,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Across the country, many Bolivians will follow the ICC’s verdict on large screens, hoping that the Hague court will decide in favor of Bolivia’s demand, according to which Chile, after decades of sporadic talks, is obliged to negotiate a sovereign access of Bolivia to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president, who is about to face a controversial fight for his re-election next year, is also heavily at stake in the verdict on Monday.
“We are about to return to the Pacific,” he pledged at the end of August.
However, some analysts consider it unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia, and believe that doing so would change little.
The UN body, based in the Netherlands, is not authorized to grant Chilean territory, and has stated that it will not decide on the outcome of possible talks.
According to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law, the fact that the ICC’s verdict is already available six months after the final plea, suggests that the case was “not complicated”.
Far from supporting the Bolivian case, the last four years could also mean a setback.
“The current Bolivian government has raised the issue of access to the sea,” Zárate said.
She suggested that Morales's belligerent rhetoric has suffocated any remaining goodwill of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their talks at some point, but after these events, it becomes extremely difficult.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, dismissed the view that the court’s decision had taken place unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia has “an extraordinary opportunity to usher in a new era of relations with Chile” and an opportunity to “put an end to the 139 years of disputes for the mutual benefit of each other,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – used the theme of the sea as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific,” he added.
“The verdict is a chance to realize that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will only happen if it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his nation would never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke before the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to implement the promises made during a summit between the heads of state of the rivals in Singapore.
His remarks come at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of releasing a stalled nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the summit with North Korean head of state Kim Jong-un in Singapore.
Ri described the notion that further sanctions and US resistance to a declaration ending the Korean War would ever bring the North to its knees as “brain-spinned.”
Washington is skeptical and refuses to agree to the statement without Pyongyang taking significant disarmament steps first.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up an arsenal in which the country probably sees the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris Fashion Shows showcase the latest collections of huge headgear that will soon be available in the shopping streets near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely shield the sun, you don’t have to look any longer.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed a range of crazy oversized headwear on the runway for their 2019 summer collection, which fascinated the fashion world at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their eye-catching creations across the catwalk.
The most outstanding piece of Valentino was an extravagant beige hat with a feather-like wide edge that squeezed the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories featured jeweled watermelons, a magic hat, and even a pineapple, but are not meant to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also unveiled a series of bizarre masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks were provided with stitched lips and had more resemblance to Hannibal Lecter than to Haute Couture.
One creation resembled a diving gear, including snorkel and diving goggles, while another looked like a melted ice bag.
And if you want to put another huge fashion statement, you’re in luck.
Fashion observers predict that the giant headgear could find its way into shopping streets near you.
The oversized hats follow directly to "La Bomba", the straw hat with 60 centimeters wide border, all wearing from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely impractical hat, which hit big waves on social media, sent another big creation across the runway: a straw beach bag that was almost the size of the swimsuit-wearing model holding the bag.
The bast bag in reddish orange with bast fringes and a white leather handle was the striking piece of Jacquemus' summer 2019 collection "La Riviera" at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: “I expect large hats and beach bags to be available in the shopping streets for next summer, and the designer has caused so much excitement that the demand for oversized accessories will be hard to ignore.”
John Edward: Language skills essential for world citizens
Scotland’s independent schools continue to excel in academic excellence, which continued with further outstanding exam results in 2018 and is only underpinned by individual and joint achievements in sports, arts, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students from all over Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to care for their students and their parents at the highest level possible.
Independent schools pursue the goal of preparing their students for further education and higher education, the profession of their choice and their place as world citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we see that modern languages are still popular and sought after in schools as electives.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to someone in a language he understands, you reach his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will reach his heart.”
This is an impressive reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year’s results show that languages with the highest admission rates are at the top of the rankings of independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learned foreign languages scored A in the higher exams.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students in Mandarin scored A in the higher exams, while 72 percent of students learning German, 69 percent of students learning French, and 63 percent of students learning Spanish also scored A.
This illustrates that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now considered electives as well as STEM subjects (natural sciences, engineering, and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere.
According to a survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014, 17 percent of the reasons employers cited for the problems in filling vacancies were related to a lack of language skills.
As a result, language skills are becoming increasingly essential when it comes to preparing young people for their future profession.
As more and more open jobs require languages, this knowledge is essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the profession chosen, young people who have learned a second language will have a real advantage in the future through such a lifelong ability.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give multilingual people an edge over competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage (15 percent).
For this reason, it is important for the children of today that we now invest in language teaching.
Children who speak several languages, especially languages of developing countries, will have better chances of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, different languages are taught at all schools.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other languages will teach, which are considered most important for the UK with a view to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Wherever your child’s interests are, independent schools will always have a range of languages available with appropriately specialized teachers.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills necessary for their success, whatever the future may look like.
At this point in a global economic environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still of fundamental importance for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should actually be regarded as "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this choice, diversity and excellence.
I'm fine with the fair.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron ahead of Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego
For fans who want to see LeBron James compete for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time, the wait is about to end.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the opening game of the pre-season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
How many minutes he will play, however, is not yet determined.
“There will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play just a few minutes.
Earlier this week, after training, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers’ six-game pre-season schedule.
“I don’t need any pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare,” he said.
Time for Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump’s five rallies scheduled for next week, including in well-meaning places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
Given the pending vote on confirming his election for vacancy at the Supreme Court, Trump wants to build support for the upcoming midterm elections in November, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress.
When is Trump’s rally in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for today, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7:00 p.m. (East Coast Time).
You can follow Trump’s rally in West Virginia below as a live stream on YouTube online.
Trump is likely to address the hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on allegations of sexual misconduct that were conducted in a tense atmosphere this week. The expected Senate vote on the confirmation remains on hold for up to a week while the FBI conducts investigations.
However, the main goal of this rally series is to support Republicans who have to face up to a difficult November election.
As a result, President Trump’s campaign team told Reuters that these five rallies next week will serve to “mobilize volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to maintain and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
"Control over Congress is so important to his plans that the president will travel to as many states as possible as the busy campaign season approaches," a Trump campaign spokesperson told Reuters.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania could attend the rally scheduled for tonight at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, "and report media from Pittsburgh."
The visit on Saturday is Trump’s second visit this month to West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to support the West Virginia Republican Senate candidate, Patrick Morrisey, backed in polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to try to give him a boost in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. Team Shows Combat Willingness to Maintain Hope for Individuals on Sunday
After three one-sided laps, the four-games on Saturday afternoon may have been exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of the momentum as a sports concept is a pure invention, but one that players really believe in, and especially in competitions like this one.
Where, in your opinion, is the momentum now?
"They were in the lead with six points, and now they are four, so I think that means a little momentum for us," Jordan Spieth said.
Europe, of course, has an advantage and is four points ahead, while twelve more follow.
However, according to Spieth, Americans feel some wind in their sails and have reason to feel encouraged, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have been playing together all day and have three out of four points each.
Spieth was incredibly strong from the tee to the green and sets a good example.
The guttural screams of enthusiasm grew louder in the course of his round as he lowered an important putt to decide the fourth match with four points for both of them after he and Thomas had gone back after two holes with two points.
His putt, who decided the match on the 15th hole for her, triggered a similar scream, suggesting that the American team is not out of the game yet.
"I really need to kneel and take care of my own game," Spieth said.
That is all that remains for the individual players.
18 holes to set a sign.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood are the only players to have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days, making the Ryder Cup history a reality.
Europe’s unequal but sympathetic duo is at four out of four points and can do nothing wrong.
“Moliwood” wasn’t the only couple that didn’t hit a Bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided Bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and at the rear nine holes on Friday morning.
This series and the seemingly flowing energy between them and the exuberant crowd underscores that they are the players to beat on Sunday. Fleetwood and Molinari would be the most popular players to seal a possible European victory at sunset over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at different holes simultaneously.
Speaking of European fame, however, would be premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made brief trials with Sergio Garcia, the morning's four-man who played alongside Alex Noren.
A Bogey and two doubles at the front nine holes put the Spaniard and the Swedes in a clamp they couldn’t nearly overcome.
On Sunday, however, no one can help them out.
The four and four pairs are so fascinating to look at from close-up due to the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give or don’t give, and the way a strategy can change at lightning speed.
The Europeans have played better as a team so far and are clearly in the lead on the last day, but this round of four has also shown that the US team is ready to fight, which some, especially in the US, had doubted.
Europe takes the lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup with 10:6
Europe is ahead of Saturday’s four-and-quarters against the United States with a 10-6 lead and a solid lead into the final day of the Ryder Cup.
The brilliantly playing duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari went ahead with two victories over the troubled Tiger Woods and was able to earn four points in Le Golf National.
The European team led by Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, who wants to regain the trophy lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated in the four in the morning against the flawed American team and won the series by 3:1.
In the four games, the U.S. faced more resistance and won two matches, but was unable to catch up.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points in the twelve singles played on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European newcomer to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who were christened after a sensational “Molliwood” weekend, won four points as the second duo in Ryder Cup history in their four opening matches.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fours, they harmonized excellently, beating the disenchanted Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who had towed through two matches on Saturday, occasionally flashed his brilliance, but has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fours and fours and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested during the four in the morning, returned and played the four games as partner of Henrik Stenson. They won 2&1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the number one and three in the world.
For Europe, however, on this pleasant windy day southwest of Paris, not everything ran as they imagined.
Triple Major winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They scored a tough 2&1 victory over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter, playing for Spain, and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the 4&3 after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, it has only happened twice that a team came back after going singles with a four-point draw, but as the title holder, a tie is enough for Furyk's team to keep the trophy.
Having only been in second place for two days, it doesn’t look like they could launch a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea rejects unilateral disarmament without confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions deepened its distrust of the United States and under these circumstances the country would by no means unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization’s Annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “essential measures last year out of goodwill,” for example, stopping nuclear and missile testing, demolishing the nuclear test site, and committing to not proliferating nuclear weapons and technologies.
"But we do not see a corresponding response from the United States," he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances we will by no means unilaterally disarm first.”
While Ri relied on North Korean complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phased” approach to denuclearization, where North Korea would be rewarded for successive steps, his statement seemed significant in that it did not reject unilateral denuclearization from the outset, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri pointed to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit meeting between an incumbent US president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, in which Kim had promised to work towards “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” while Trump pledged guarantees for North Korea’s security.
North Korea is seeking an official end to the 1950-1953 Korean War, while the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
In addition, Washington opposes demands for a loosening of the strict international sanctions against North Korea.
“The U.S. insists on ‘first denuclearization’ and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal by coercion, and is even opposed to the ‘declaration of the end of the war’,” Ri said.
“The assumption that sanctions can put us on our knees is a fantasy of people who don’t know anything about us.
The problem, however, is that the continued sanctions deepen our distrust."
Ri did not address plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. head of state had highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean head of state Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If South Korea were the other party in the denuclearization issue instead of the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to this standstill.”
Nevertheless, the tone of Ris speech differed tremendously from his speech last year when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target the mainland of the United States with North Korea’s missiles after “evil President” Trump referred to Kim as a “missile man” on a suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who had threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea last year, praised Kim at the United Nations for his courage in disarmament, but said there was still a lot of work to be done and that sanctions would have to remain in place until North Korea’s denuclearization.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timeframe for it: “Whether it takes two years, three years or five months – it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council must reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday, “Enforcement of the Security Council’s sanctions must in any case continue vigorously until we have reached full, final and verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened the sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to financially dry out Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the outskirts of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was unsuccessful.
In July, he said on his departure from Pyongyang that progress had been made, only to be accused hours later by North Korea of making “gangster-like demands”.
North Korea pledged this month at a meeting with Moon to dismantle a missile base and a nuclear complex if the United States took “corresponding measures.”
He said Kim had told him that the “corresponding measures” sought were security guarantees given by Trump in Singapore, as well as steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Learn to Sleep Enough in a Course
A new course at Harvard University ensures that all undergraduate students get more sleep this year, a measure against the spreading macho culture of staying awake with caffeine and learning all night long.
One scientist has found that students at the world’s leading university are often unnecessary when it comes to caring for themselves.
The course was conceived by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and he believes it to be the first such course in the United States.
He was inspired to launch the course after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At the end, a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why am I only learning about this now, in my last year?’
According to her words, no one had ever told her how important sleep is, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
This year’s course for the first time explained to students how the basics of good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic performance and also improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university had opted to introduce the course after finding that students suffered severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a range of interactive tasks.
In a section, students see the image of a room in a dorm room and click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the effects of sleep deprivation on athletic performance and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another section, participants learn that long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and cancer.
They are then encouraged to think about their daily routine using a map of the campus with interactive symbols.
“We know that it will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know this – just as you have the right to know how the choice to smoke affects your health,” added Professor Czeisler.
The pride in “sliding a night shift” is still widespread, he said, adding that modern technologies and the ever-increasing pressure on students made sleep deprivation a growing problem.
Ensuring enough good sleep should be the “secret weapon” of all students against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, and weight gain could be avoided as sleep deprivation puts the brain into starvation mode so that they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, having taken one of his courses last year in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to push for a university-wide course.
He hopes that in the next step, all postgraduate students will be encouraged to complete a similar study program before starting their studies at the competitive university.
As recommended by Professor Czeisler, students should set up an alarm clock for the time to sleep and wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light", which emanates from electronic screens and LED lighting, and can disrupt the circadian rhythm, leading to problems falling asleep.
Livingston vs Rangers 1:0: Menga-Tor defeats Gerrard's player
The Rangers lost another away game when Dolly Menga's goal for Steven Gerrard's disagreeing team meant a 0-1 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to record their first away win since the 4-1 triumph at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt’s team added Gerrard the first second defeat in 18 games as manager, leaving his team eight points behind the hearts leading in the Ladbrokes Premiership by far.
Menga scored seven minutes ahead of the half, and the low-inspiration Rangers didn’t seem to have a chance to balance.
While the Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston rises to third place and is just behind Hibernian in the goal difference.
The Rangers are also threatened with further trouble after Line Judge Calum Spence had to be treated due to a head wound by an apparently thrown object from the guest block.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, overtaking Ayr and reaching the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, stayed with the same eleven Livingston players who lost the Hearts a point last week, and would be thrilled to see how his well-trained team kept their opponents under pressure.
The Rangers dominated the possession of the ball, but Livingston achieved more when they had the ball.
They should have scored a goal in just two minutes when Menga's first defeat led Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his chance and missed the shot.
Then a long free kick from Keaghan Jacobs reached captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only shoot past the rear pole.
The Rangers took control, but their game seemed more hopeful than convinced in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos was obviously of the opinion that he should have received a penalty kick after a quarter of an hour due to a clash between him and Steven Lawless, but arbitrator Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's complaints.
The Rangers only scored two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little trouble with Lassana Coulibaly’s headball and a tame shot from Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston’s hit in the 34th minute may not have matched the game’s progress, there’s no denying that they earned him for their hard work alone.
Again, the Rangers could not handle a ball shot by Jacobs in a standard situation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher shot the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept calm and chose Menga for an easy finish.
Gerrard traded Coulibaly to Ryan Kent at halftime, and the change was almost instantaneous when the winger brought Morelos into position, but the impressive Kelly rushed from his line to block the ball.
However, Livingston continued to get the guests to play exactly the game they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett getting one long ball after another.
Holt's team could have expanded their lead in the final stage, but McGregor held up well and deterred Jacobs before Lithgow shot a header from the corner.
Rangers exchange player Glenn Middleton also called for a penalty kick late after a batch with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanach: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning"-Almanach: On September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter, which has since become the standard element of science, also became a standard element of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film “Bells of Coronado” with the seemingly unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What the hell is that?”
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter used to search for radioactive minerals such as uranium.
If you put on these headphones, you can hear the effects of radioactive radiation in the minerals."
Evans: “In fact, I hear a crack!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
The invention, which bears its name, however, lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Immune System to “See” Degenerated Cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” and destroy degenerate cells.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine helps the immune system to detect degenerate cells.
In the method, a patient's immune cells are taken, which are altered in the laboratory.
These cells can "see" a common protein of many cancers and are then injected again.
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
The ovarian cancer of a woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to detect degenerate cells disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method takes immune cells from a patient, which are modified in the laboratory so that they can "see" the many cancers common protein HER2 and then inject the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our findings suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “promotes the growth of various types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancers, as Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar method in which patients are taken immune cells and taught to attack cancer cells has helped in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West released a pro-Trump tirade after his appearance at SNL, wearing a MAGA cap ("Make America Great Again").
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was bounced at Saturday Night Live in the studio after he widely praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he wants to run for president in 2020.
After singing his third title of the evening, "Ghost Town," wearing a make-America great-again cap, he continued with a smear cannon against the Democrats, emphasizing once again his support for Trump.
“I’m so often asked by whites, ‘How can you like Trump? He’s a racist.’
So if I were worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the allegations of sexual harassment made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the recording of West’s sham tirade was not broadcast, it was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It’s not clear whether Rock wanted to make fun of West by publishing it.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had trouble behind the scenes because of his head covering.
“They harassed me behind the scenes.
They said, ‘Don’t go out with the cap.’
They harassed me!
And then they say I'm in a sunk area," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continues, “Do you want to see the submerged area?” He said he will “put on my supermancape, because that means you can’t tell me what I have to do. You want it to go ahead with the world?
Try it with love.”
His remarks sparked at least two shouts from the audience, and SNL contributors were embarrassed, Variety reported. One person told the magazine: "It was dead silent in the studio."
West was later hired as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many with a talk titled "I Love It", in which he was dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by Candace Turner, the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, who tweeted: “To one of the most courageous ghosts: THANK YOU THANK YOU THAT YOU HAVE DEMANDED THE MASS.”
Talk show presenter Karen Hunter, however, tweeted that West was just himself and that was absolutely wonderful.
“But I don’t want to reward anyone who, in my opinion, adopts and gives up an ideology harmful to my community (by buying his music or his clothes or supporting his ‘art’).
He's free.
The same goes for us,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and is now "The being formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name, following in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
His rapper colleague Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion, and of course Prince, the deceased music legend, changed his name to a symbol and then to "The Artist Formerly Known As Prince" (The Artist Formerly Known As Prince).
Accused of attempted murder in connection with stab injury in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was injured with a knife in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred, according to police in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is scheduled to appear before the arbitration court in Belfast on Monday.
The allegations are being reviewed by the prosecutor’s office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in HBO’s violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor has attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such roles on the screen would often make boys feel like they have to be strong to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Harington said he believes something has gone wrong and asked how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Harington, who recently married Rose Leslie, also a 31-year-old actress, admitted that the solution to the problem was “very important.”
"I personally find the question very important at the moment, what went wrong with masculinity," he said.
“What have we taught growing men in terms of the problem we are now observing?”
Harington believes that because of the very masculine characters, television may be partly responsible for the increasing toxic masculinity.
He continued: “What is innate, and what is learned?
What is being taught on television and on the streets that makes boys feel like they have to embody this particular side of a man?
I think this is really one of the big questions of our time: how do we change that?
For the young men, something has clearly gone wrong.”
In addition, he admitted in the interview that after the end of the series next summer, he will not be participating in prequels or sequels of "Game of Thrones"; he has "enough of battlefields and horses."
From November, Harington will be featured in a reissue of Sam Shepard's True West, the story of a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently revealed that for him the best thing about "Game of Thrones" was that he met his wife Rose.
"I met my wife on this show, so that's how I got my future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose Leslie starred in the Emmy-winning fantasy series Ygritte, the lover of Harington's character Jon Snow.
The two married in June 2018 on Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced an increase of 14 percent in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, approximately 40,000 new cases were reported.
Unlike in the past, transmission occurred in the vast majority of new cases through sexual intercourse.
So far, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 in China.
HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is an acute problem in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against members of the LGBT community is said to be widespread.
Based on the conservative values of the country, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many of the disease transmissions are due to insufficient protection during sexual intercourse in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised, among other things, universal access to HIV drugs to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies employees have leaked data from GOP senators, criticizing “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
U.S. Senator Maxine Waters denied allegations on Saturday that a member of her staff posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. Senators on MPs' Wikipedia pages.
The Democrat from Los Angeles believed that the claims were being disseminated by “ultra-right” experts and websites.
"Lies, lies, and even more vile lies," Waters said in a statement.
The information is said to contain the private addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday and was published during the hearing of a Senate committee on the allegations of sexual misconduct made against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh by an unknown person in the government district.
The publication took place after the three senators had interviewed Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was assigned to Waters’ office, and published the information of a member of Waters’ staff, The Hill reported.
“This unfounded allegation is completely false and an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my staff – whose identity, personal data and security were compromised by these fraudulent and false accusations – was in no way responsible for the leaking of this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie."
Waters’ statement quickly sparked criticism online, including that of Ari Fleischer, a former White House press spokesman.
"This denial is angry," Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that she doesn’t have the right temperament to be a member of Congress.
People who are accused of something they haven’t done shouldn’t be angry.
You must not be defiant.
You must not question the motives of the prosecutor.
You have to be calm and calm.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters’ reaction to Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of appearing too angry during Thursday’s hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is running in the midterm elections to replace Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“Great thing, if that’s true,” he tweeted.
Waters said in her statement that her office had informed the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities about these fraudulent allegations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed," she continued, "and that they are held accountable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all members of my staff."
Johnny English – You only live three times – faint spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to look for references to Brexit in every British-colored new film, as does the revival of the action comedy parody franchise “Johnny English”, which began in 2003 with “Johnny English – The Spy Who Sept It” and resurfaced stuttering in 2011 with “Johnny English – Right Now”.
Will an ironic self-parody on the subject of how obviously stupid we are become a new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, the license of the gloomy, cute and incompetent Johnny English was renewed for the second time, and his name signals more than anything else that he is a general comic creation for cinemagoers in the non-English-speaking space.
Of course, he is again the crazy secret agent who bizarrely thinks himself to be cool and worldly, while in reality he consists of a little clouseau, a pinch of Mr. Bean and a little of this guy who contributed a single note to the title tune of “The Hour of the Winner” at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
In addition, the character was originally based on the chaos left behind by travelers and international secret agents that Atkinson played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard television commercials.
Johnny English's last adventure has one or two nice moments.
I liked how Johnny English approached a helicopter in a medieval armor and the rotor blades briefly pinched his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy comes to light, but the humor seems rather weak and strangely superfluous, especially because the "serious" film series such as "007" and "Mission Impossible" now confidently offer comedic elements.
The humor seems to be directed more at children than adults, and to me Johnny English’s crazy misfortunes aren’t as imaginative and focused as Atkinson’s silent movie gag in the role of Bean.
The ever-present premise now is that Britain is in great danger.
A cyberhacker has infiltrated the super-secret British spy network and uncovered the identities of all British agents in deployment, much to the displeasure of the serving agent, a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the Prime Minister, an inflated and oppressed figure already facing complete collapse due to her political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best with this quasi-Teresa May character, but the script doesn’t give much to work with
Her intelligence advisers inform her that all the active spies have been exposed and she must therefore bring someone out of retirement.
This includes the silly Johnny English himself, who now works as a teacher at a chic institution, but gives unofficial lessons in working as an undercover agent. There are a few gags, because English offers a school of spying academy reminiscent of "School of Rock".
English is taken back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with his former hard-tested buddy Bough, who is once again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, an annoying woman of the higher society, in whose role Vicki Pepperdine is somewhat wasted.
So Batman and Robin, who are always doing everything terribly wrong in Your Majesty's secret service, are back in action, meeting Olga Kurylenko's beautiful Femme Fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously captivated by a charismatic tech billionaire, Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy, who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of grotesque fun: dressed as waiters, they set a chic French restaurant on fire, smuggle themselves aboard Volta’s luxury yacht into chaos, and English sparks pure anarchy as he tries to familiarize himself with the inside of Volta’s house using a virtual reality headset.
In this last sequence all registers are drawn, but as sympathetic and funny as it is, the topic is already dealt with in detail in children's television.
Pretty moderate fabric.
As with the other Johnny English films, I had to ask myself, “Can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really matches his talent?”
Labour denies working on a plan to allow Britain to work four days a week but be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is to consider a radical plan that will allow the British to work four days a week but be paid for five days.
The party reportedly wants corporate leaders to pass on the savings made by the AI revolution (artificial intelligence) to employees in the form of an additional free day.
The employees would have a three-day weekend, but would still receive the same pay.
According to sources, the idea "fits" the party's economic agenda and its plans to postpone the balance in the country for the benefit of workers.
The transition to a four-day week was advocated by the Trades Union Congress as an opportunity for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told the Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"A change will not occur overnight, but a four-day working week is an endeavour consistent with the Party's approach to restoring economic balance in favour of workers, as well as with the Party's general industrial policy strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first party to support such an idea; the Green Party already promised to introduce a 4-day week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party does not support this approach at all.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: “A four-day week is not a party policy and it is not considered by the party.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell made his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy at the Labour conference last week.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of “anonymous directors” and “profit makers” in public utilities.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders of water utilities may not be able to recover their entire share, as a Labour government could make "deductions" due to alleged misconduct.
He also confirmed the appropriate plans to appoint employees to the boards of directors of companies and set up Inclusive Ownership Funds to pass 10% of the equity of private companies to employees who receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy comment in 60 Minutes news magazine on whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh's case could change their minds
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court by at least one week, raising the question whether the agency’s findings could influence Republican senators to win their support.
In an interview on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could uncover anything that could ultimately change their minds.
Kennedy seemed to be more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I announced in the hearing that I had spoken with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him afterwards, this claim was made, and asked if he did.
He was determined, determined, and unmistakable.”
Graham’s voice, however, seems to be carved in stone.
"My opinion is clear as far as Brett Kavanaugh is concerned, and it would have to blow up a bomb," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett vehemently denied this," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And all who called her could not confirm it.”
It's been 36 years now.
And I can't see any changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it helped to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York City hosts the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival with an impressive lineup of stars and an equally impressive mission – to fight poverty in the world.
Tens of thousands will attend the Global Citizen Festival, which will take place this year for the 7th time, not only to witness the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event’s real goal: to combat extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which took place for the first time in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international interest group that seeks to fight poverty by encouraging more and more people to actively participate in poverty alleviation.
To get a free ticket to the event (the other option would be to buy a VIP ticket), you have to complete a number of tasks, including actions such as volunteering, communicating with a leading politician worldwide (by email or phone), or similar actions to raise awareness of the goal – combating poverty.
How successful is the project, considering that Global Citizen remains 12 years to reach the goal?
Is the idea of offering a cool free concert a meaningful way to convince others that it’s time to act, or just another case of so-called clicktivism – if you think you can change something by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen said that since 2011, the project has received more than 19 million actions from its supporters and has achieved various goals.
These actions are said to have helped encourage leaders around the world to announce commitments and strategies worth more than $37 billion that will impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the Group cited 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or raised through fundraising.
According to the group’s estimates, the secured funds so far have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the most important commitments include The Power of Nutrition project, a partnership of UK-based investors and implementers committed to supporting children in their optimal development and pledged to help Rwanda with $35 million to fight malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history,” Tracey Ullman, ambassador to The Power of Nutrition, told the audience during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also announced that after more than 5,000 actions urging the UK to improve the nutritional situation of mothers and children, the government announced funding for the project The Power of Nutrition, which aims to reach 5 million women and children and provides nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, namely, what are the reasons why Global Citizen can fight extreme poverty,
They replied, “It will be a long and strenuous journey with highs and lows.
But similar to the big civil rights and anti-apartheid movements ahead of us, we will succeed because together we are stronger and more influential.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe will perform at this year’s New York event, with Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman as presenters.
The U.S. could use the Navy for blockade purposes to block Russian energy exports – Interior Ministry
According to Washington Examine, Washington can resort to the Navy if needed to prevent energy from Russia from reaching markets including the Middle East, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s deployment in Syria is a pretext for exploring new energy markets. Russia is currently operating in these areas at the invitation of the legitimate government.
“I think the real reason for Russia’s deployment in the Middle East is to negotiate new sales markets in the field of energy, just like in Eastern Europe,” he allegedly said.
And according to the official, there are ways to tackle this.
"The United States, together with the Navy, can ensure that the sea routes remain open and block them if necessary to ensure that the energy from Russia does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants at the Consumer Energy Alliance event, a non-profit group that sees itself as the “voice of electricity consumers” in the United States.
He made a comparison between Washington’s approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are practically identical.
“The use and replacement of fuels is more or less the economic option in Iran and Russia,” he said, while describing Russia as a “one trick pony” with a fossil fuel-dependent economy.
The statements were made when the Trump administration was expanding liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, the much cheaper option for consumers in Europe.
To this end, government officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project that, according to Trump, turned Berlin into Moscow’s “prisoner.”
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline worth $11 billion, which is to double existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is an exclusively economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s massive opposition to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we all believe that energy should not be used as a means of exerting pressure, and that consumers can choose suppliers themselves,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. has received headwinds from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industry organisation, the Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI), has urged the US to stay out of EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“It’s a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, CEO of BDI, after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Wants to “Examine” a 2020 Presidential Candidate, Massachusetts Senator Says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would be "examining closely" a presidential candidacy after the midterm elections.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering a candidacy.
According to The Hill, Warren said it was time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and that includes women at the top.
Warren plans to "examine" a presidential nomination after November 6.
Warren said during the meeting that President Trump is driving this country in the wrong direction.
“I’m extremely concerned about how Donald Trump handles our democracy,” she said.
Warren has not taken a leaf in his criticism of Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, she announced that, of course, an FBI investigation is required before the vote.
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren voters do not believe they should run for 2020.
According to the survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center and the Boston Globe, 58 percent of potential voters in Massachusetts stated that the senator should not run.
32% of voters supported such a candidacy.
The poll showed more support for a candidacy from former governor Deval Patrick; with 38 percent in favor of a potential candidacy, and 48 percent opposed.
Other names of prominent Democrats eligible for a possible 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would officially decide by January.
Sarah Palin speaks at the Donald Trump Ralley on the post-traumatic stress disorder track Palin suffers
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“What my son is going through, what he is going through when he comes back, all of this can be felt by other families who feel the effects of PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers are returning with,” she told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described his arrest as an “elephant in the room” and said about her son and other war veterans that they are coming back changed, that they are coming back more abruptly, that they are coming back and wondering if there is that respect for what other soldiers and pilots and every other member of the military have given to the country.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, said Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and D.C. support a legal remedy for the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a remedy to the new U.S. policy of denying asylum to victims of gang activity or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the district filed a court expert statement in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker who is questioning the policy, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff's full name in the grace-against-sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy in August was not disclosed.
She said her partner “and his violent gang sons” were abusing her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The prosecutors who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where very many people apply for asylum in the United States, as nations struggling with major problems with criminal gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy repealed a 2014 Board of Immigrant Appeals decision that allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of legislation at the state, federal, and international level.”
“The federal law stipulates that all asylum applications are assessed based on the respective facts and circumstances of the application, and this court violates this principle,” the court’s statement said.
Furthermore, the lawyers argued in the statement that policies denying immigrants access to the country would have an adverse effect on the US economy, as immigrants could be more likely to work as entrepreneurs and provide the necessary workforce.
In June, Federal Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and the violence of criminal gangs.
“Asylum is available to anyone who leaves their home country because they are being persecuted or for fear of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political belief,” Sessions said in his June 11 announcement of the policy.
It was never the plan to defuse all the problems by granting asylum, even all the serious problems people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palu as the number of deaths in the race doubles over time
For the survivors, the situation became increasingly worse.
“It’s all very tense,” says the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, calming her little feverish son in a rescue center in the devastated downtown of Palu.
“Every minute a new ambulance arrives with the dead.
Clean drinking water is scarce.”
Residents returned to their destroyed homes to collect their watered-down belongings, while recovering everything they could find.
Hundreds were injured, and the staff of the hospitals, who were damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, were completely overburdened.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who contracted vertebral fractures and a broken shoulder, remained outside the Palu military hospital, where patients were treated in the outdoors due to the ongoing strong aftershocks.
With tears in his eyes, he told how the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“Everything went way too fast.
I think I was stuck under the collapsed walls," he told the Associated Press, adding that the reason for staying in the city was a wedding.
“I heard my wife’s cry for help, but then there was peace.
I don’t know what happened to my wife and child.
I can only hope they are in a safe place."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of Tyranny with “Propaganda Ads”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page advertisement in an American daily announcing the mutual benefits of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused the state capital of Beijing of exploiting the American press for propaganda purposes.
US Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to the paid supplement of the China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the best-selling magazine in Iowa, after accusing China of interfering in the US congressional elections on November 6, a charge that China denies.
Trump’s allegations that Beijing has tried to interfere in the U.S. elections are in line with US officials’ announcement to Reuters; a new phase of an escalating campaign triggered by Washington to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise for the promotion of the economy, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a rampant trade war, with tariffs on imports for both countries.
The Chinese retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war should hit exporters in states like Iowa who supported Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former longtime Governor of Iowa, who exports large-scale agricultural products to China, said that Beijing has harmed workers, farm owners and businesses.
China, Branstad said in a statement in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, is now doubling this tyranny by posting propaganda ads in its own free press in the United States.
“By spreading their propaganda, the Chinese government is claiming the American tradition of free speech and the independent press by placing paid advertising on the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, you will find only a limited number of votes against at the newsstands here in Beijing and will not find any real reflection of the differences of opinion that the Chinese might have about China’s disturbing economic development, given the fact that the media is firmly in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that one of China’s most famous newspapers did not accept the offer to publish his article, but did not mention the name of the newspaper.
Republicans banish voters before midterm elections with debacle around Kavanaugh, observers warn
Since many of the most influential Republicans support and defend the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, in the face of multiple allegations of sexual violence, observers have warned of a counter-reaction during the upcoming midterm elections, which could come from women in particular.
The mood in this regard was extremely tense, and most Republicans have already stated that they are proceeding with a vote.
"You can't undo things like that," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake’s last-minute push is sufficient for an FBI investigation to appease angry voters.
"Women don't forget what was yesterday, they won't forget tomorrow and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, first adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the daily in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters in the Senate corridor shouted “November is coming!” when Republicans controlling the Justice Committee decided to hold on to Kavanaugh’s nomination, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony, Mic reported.
Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are an extremely important topic, Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political observer of the news site, said.
“People say it’s already high, that’s true.
But it could be higher, especially with suburban voters and younger voters, people aged 18 to 29 who, although they don't like the president, often don't vote."
Even before Ford’s public statement, detailing her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidate, observers indicated that a counter-reaction could result if Republicans advance confirmation.
“This situation is a mess for the GOP,” said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, NBC News.
“It’s not just about voting for the committee, the final vote, or the review of Kavanaugh; it’s also about how Republicans handled it and how they treated it,” Guy Cecil, director at Priorities USA, a group that supports the election of Democrats, told the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to disagree on who to believe on the basis of the statements of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a slightly larger proportion on the side of the latter.
A new YouGov survey showed that 41% of respondents were definitely or probably convinced of Ford’s statement, while 35% said they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
Additionally, 38% said they believe Kavanaugh was likely or definitely lying in his statement, while 30% said the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford made a sworn statement last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was attacked by drunken Kavanaugh at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court had exposed his genitals to her when they were at a party during their studies in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to counter Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is currently launching a startup with the aim of establishing a competition with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
With Solid, users can choose where their data is stored and who gets access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee said that the intention behind Inrupt was “world domination”.
“We need to take action now,” he said about the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology, allowing users to create their own personal online data store or POD.
It can include contact lists, task lists, a calendar, a music library, and other tools for the home and business.
Similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all content is in one browser and available at the same time.
The special thing about the personal online data store is that the user can decide who can access which data.
The company describes this concept as personal reinforcement and development through data.
According to the company’s CEO John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company uses resources, processes, and appropriate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, some developers hired to work on this project, a community of volunteer programmers, and a security platform acquired from IBM.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team will not discuss with Facebook and Google whether to make a comprehensive change that will completely reshape their entire business models overnight.
“We are not asking for your permission.”
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt has the task of providing commercial energy generation and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new, solid-based web.
In 1994, Berners-Lee redesigned the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been instrumental in the debate on net neutrality.
Even with the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I am extremely confident about this new era of the web,” he added.
Priest Bernard Vann, winner of the Victorian Cross in World War I, was honored
The only Church of England clergyman to have been awarded the Victorian Cross during World War I was honored 100 years later in his hometown.
Lieutenant Colonel and Priest Bernard Vann won the award for his contribution to the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he had won the highest British war award.
His two grandchildren unveiled a memorial stone on Sunday at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of the grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that this act was full of symbolic power, as the memorial stone was unveiled exactly 100 years after the heroic act for which his grandfather was awarded.
According to The London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin; through dense fog and under heavy shelling of field guns and machine guns.
Later, he advanced to the line of fire and led the line forward with the "greatest bravery", before heading ahead with a field weapon alone and eliminating three of the military units.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather’s actions were something he could never do justice to, and at the same time, something that makes one humble.
Together with his brother Dr. James Vann, he laid down a wreath after the parade under the leadership of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann stated that he feels very honored to be able to participate in the parade, adding that the bravery of a real hero becomes visible above all through the support of many people.
MMA fans stayed up all night watching Bellator 206, instead there was Peppa Pig
Imagine you’ve stayed awake all night watching an exciting Bellator 206, and then you can’t watch the main event.
The San Jose bill included 13 fights, including 6 on the main map, and was broadcast live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for their fight, the spectators in the UK were not badly surprised when suddenly Peppa Pig was seen.
Some remained untouched after staying awake until the early hours of the morning to see specifically the fight.
A fan on Twitter described the move to the cartoon character as a kind of bad joke.
"Due to a government regulation, this content is classified as non-adolescent, so it had to be switched to a children's show at 6 a.m.," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when asked about the transmission.
“Peppa, the pig.”
The Board of Directors at Bellator, Scott Coker, announced that the company will edit the schedule to take into account viewers from the UK in the future.
“I think the problem could have been solved by the repetition,” he said.
“But it’s 6 a.m. on a Sunday with the spectators in the UK, and we won’t resolve the incident until Sunday our time, Monday local time there.
But we'll stick with it.
There was a lot of communication during the change. It was quite confusing and it wasn't always all nice.
We tried to solve the problem and assumed it was a technical failure.
Which was not the case, it was a problem on the part of the government.
I promise that won't happen again.
We're going to reduce the total to 5 instead of 6 fights, as usual, and we've been trying to give fans the best experience possible.
The whole situation is quite unfortunate."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels “lower” on the subject of sexuality
Tom Daley, who has participated as a water jumper at various Olympic Games, says that he grew up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality. But that feeling had motivated him to become so successful.
The 24-year-old said that he had only realized in high school that he was different from others.
In the first Radio 4 Desert Island discs with Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out on gay rights to encourage others.
He also said that since he became a father, the victories at the Olympics are no longer so important to him.
The actual host of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, pauses for a few months due to illness.
In Laverne’s first show, he said he used to consider himself inferior compared to others, as love for boys and girls was socially completely unacceptable.
He said: “To this day, the feeling of being inferior to others and different from others is the reason for my power and strength and ultimately for my success.”
He wanted to prove that he is a very special personality, so as not to disappoint anyone when his sexual orientation became known.
The two-time bronze medalist at the Olympics is now a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to advance the decriminalization of homosexuality in other countries.
He said he spoke on this issue because, fortunately, he can live without restrictions and without discrimination and wants to encourage others.
The three-time world champion fell in love with the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013. The realization of falling in love with a man was an absolute surprise for him.
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he shared that the age difference had never been an issue.
He thinks that if you had to go through so much as a child and adolescent – he took part in the Olympics for the first time at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later, it’s hard to find someone the same age with similar experiences.
The couple have had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley since June, and Daley believes that his entire view has changed since then.
Last year, it was all about gold medals.
But for him, there is now more important than Olympic gold medals.
His son Robbie is now his main winner.
He bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain tumor.
Daley said his father did not accept the impending death, and one of the last things he asked for was the tickets for London 2012 because he wanted to be at the forefront.
“I couldn’t tell him he wouldn’t be there anymore,” he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it was only after that that I finally realized that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley won the bronze medal at the 2012 Olympics.
“All I knew was that it was always my dream to dive in front of my home audience at the Olympics – that was insane,” he said.
His first selection of songs – Proud by Heather Small – was also influenced by the song, which he heard in the run-up to the Olympic Games and still caused goosebumps.

Mickelson, who is currently not in shape, sits on the replacement bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record for his 47th Ryder Cup game on Sunday, but he has to make a lot of effort so that it doesn’t turn into a debacle.
Mickelson, who plays at the event for the 12th time, was sent to the substitute bench by Captain Jim Furyk for the Fourballs and Foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as usual, the five-time major winner spent his day cheering others up and working on his game, hoping to fix the problems that weigh on him.
Even at the peak of his career, 48-year-old Mickelson was never the most direct golfer and therefore not an ideal cast for the tight Le Golf National golf course, where misguided balls are regularly penalized.
And as if the pitch itself wasn’t discouraging enough, Mickelson will meet perfectionist British Open champion Francesco Molinari in the ninth game on Sunday, who has teamed up with Tommy Fleetwood, newcomer to these tournaments, to win all four games this week.
If the Americans lag four points behind in the 12 singles games, Mickelson’s game could prove to be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in Mickelson and could not add much to it.
"He was perfectly clear about his role today, gave me a slap on the back and put his arm around me, saying he was ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has a lot of self-confidence.
He is one of the world-renowned personalities and he has done so much for these teams in the past and this week.
I didn’t expect him to be in two games.
I had imagined more, but that’s how it went and that’s what we expected.
He wants to be there like everyone else.”
Mickelson will reach the Nick Faldo record for the most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It could be the end of a Ryder Cup run that never quite matched the peaks of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, had 20 defeats and reached seven halves, although Furyk said that his presence alone has enriched the team.
“He’s funny and sarcastic, original and likes to make a few jokes, and he’s a great person who’s popular with the whole team,” he said.
“I think the younger players were happy to get to know him a bit more this week. It was fun watching them.
He’s a really interesting person who gives a lot of impulses.”
Captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn knows that it may soon be over with the lead
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a big lead leading to the last singles in the Ryder Cup can quickly become an unpleasant situation.
The Dane made his debut in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead against the Americans, but came just above the finish line and took the lead with the smallest possible lead, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2–131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"The thought remains that we had a big lead in Valderrama, we had a big lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but that was scarce," said Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn (pictured in the photo) after seeing the victory 5-3 of the Class of 2018 both on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The experience shows me and all the team members that it’s not over.
Tomorrow, it's going to be real.
Put yourself in the stuff and do exactly the right thing.
The whole thing is not over until the points are on the billboard.
We have a goal. We want to win this trophy, and that’s where our focus is.
I’ve always said it, I’m focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we’re fully aware of what’s facing us on the other side: the best players in the world.”
Glad for the performance his players have done on a difficult golf course, Bjorn went on to say: “I would never rush this.
Tomorrow will be another caliber.
Tomorrow the individual services will be in the foreground and that is a completely different thing.
It’s great to work with a partner when things are going well, but when you’re alone out there, you’re tested to the limits of your golfing skills.
You have to make it clear to the players: get the best out of you tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind you and he also needs to get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk will make sure his players perform better individually than in the team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have won three out of four points.
Furyk himself was on both sides of those big turnarounds on the last day of the tournament. He was on the winning side in Brookline before he was on the losers side after Europe's "miracle of Medinah".
"I remember every damn word," he replied to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, motivated his players before the last day.
“We’ve got 12 important games tomorrow, but you’d like to pull off the quick start you’ve seen in Brookline and Medinah.
If the momentum strikes in one direction, it puts the middle games under a lot of pressure.
We're setting up our team accordingly and sending our guys out as we feel, you know, we're trying to conjure up tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned the task of catching up, he must compete in the top game against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as other Europeans in the top half of the rankings.
"I chose the guys in this order because I think it covers everything," said Bjorn about his selection for the individual matches.
Germany's new warship again delayed
The latest frigate of the German Navy should have been put into service as early as 2014 to replace the Cold War-era warships, but according to local media it will not be delivered until at the earliest next year due to faulty systems and rapidly growing costs.
The commissioning of the “Rheinland-Pfalz”, the guiding ship of the brand new frigates of the “Baden-Württemberg” class, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the time, which referred to a military spokesman.
The ship should have been put into service as early as 2014, but the ambitious project was plagued by worrying problems after delivery.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg-Class, which had already been ordered by the Navy in 2007, are to replace the old Bremen-Class frigates.
They will include a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft missiles and sea-target missiles, as well as camouflage technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic reflection.
Another important feature is longer maintenance periods. It should be possible that the latest frigates do not have to return to their home ports for up to two years.
However, the ongoing delays may lead to the fact that the state-of-the-art warships, which are supposed to represent Germany as a naval power, will already be obsolete at the time of their commissioning, according to Die Zeit.
The frigate F125, which was persecuted by the accident, hit the headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take off the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the shipyard after it was delivered.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of significant "software and hardware faults" that would have rendered the new ship unusable in a battle situation.
Software problems are particularly serious, as ships of the Baden-Württemberg-class are served by a crew of only 120 sailors, only about half as many as on the older frigates of the Bremen-class.
It has also been known that the ship is far too heavy, leading to loss of performance and preventing the Navy from taking upgrading measures in the future.
The 7,000-ton "Rhineland-Palatinate" was apparently twice as heavy as ships of a similar class used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project, including the training costs of the crew, also became a problem.
Apparently, the cost rose to a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion, compared to the originally planned <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates are particularly significant given the recent warnings that Germany’s naval power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Defence Commissioner of the German Bundestag, confirmed that the navy "are leaving the operational ships".
Bartels said the problem increased over time as old ships were taken out of service but no replacement ships were provided.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could be taken off the navy.
National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of Bats
A property in the Scottish Highlands is conducting new research aimed at showing how bats use the landscape in food searching.
It is hoped that the results will provide further insights into the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland, will track down dwarf and mosquito bats, as well as the brown long ear and water bats in Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices are placed at key positions on the property to record bat activities throughout the season.
NHS employees and volunteers will also conduct mobile investigations using portable detectors.
A sound analysis of all recordings by experts determines the frequency of bat calls and determines which species does what.
Subsequently, a map and a report of the habitat is created to create a detailed picture of their behavior at the landscape level.
Rob Dewar, conservation consultant for the NTS, hopes that the results will show which areas of the habitat are most important to the bats and how these are used by each species.
This data will help determine the benefits of habitat management measures, such as the creation of meadows, and show how to preserve forest areas for bats and other related species.
Bat stocks in Scotland and the whole of the United Kingdom have declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects sleeping places and leads to the loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can flycatchers and the chemical treatment of building materials or attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not really blind.
However, their ears are more useful than their eyes because of their nightly hunting habits when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echo mapping to detect insects and obstacles in their trajectory.
The NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across Scotland, takes the issue of bats very seriously.
It has 10 trained experts who regularly carry out investigations, inspections of sleeping places and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization has even established Scotland’s first and only bat reserve at the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland’s 10 bat species.
Goodman David Thompson explains that the property is the ideal habitat for them.
“Here in Threave, we have a great area for bats,” he explains.
“We have the old buildings, many old trees and an excellent habitat.
But there’s a lot we don’t know about bats yet, so we’re doing these work here and on other goods that will help us learn more about what bats need to feel comfortable.”
He stresses the importance of first excluding the presence of bats before maintenance work in the goods, as it is possible that the involuntary destruction of a single nesting site could kill up to 400 females and young animals and wipe out the entire population on site.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, harass them, or destroy their nest sites.
Elizabeth Ferrell, Scottish official of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the population to help.
She explains: “We still have a lot to learn about bats and we don’t know what their populations are like for many of our species.”
Ronaldo denies rape allegations while his lawyers want to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described rape allegations against him as “fake news” and said that people want to “be famous” by using his name.
His lawyers plan to sue the news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The striker of the national team of Portugal and Juventus Turin was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to buy her silence from the incident, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
In an Instagram live video of his 142 million followers, 33-year-old Ronaldo called the reports “fake news” just hours after they were released.
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they reported today: fake news," said the five-time winner of the Ballon d'Or.
“They want to profile themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
You want to be famous with my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine," the player added smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue the Mirror on the grounds of accusations they described as “inadmissible reporting on privacy suspicions,” according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player demanded compensation for "moral damages in an amount equal to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personality rights in recent years."
The alleged incident occurred in 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After they met in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player’s room, where he allegedly raped them anally, according to documents filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo got down on his knees after the alleged incident and she said he was "99 percent a good guy" who succumbed to "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sex, but say it was consensual.
Mayorga also claimed that she had gone to the police and had taken photographs of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court agreement because she was “fearful of retaliation” and worried about being “publicly humiliated”.
The 34-year-old said she is now trying to cancel the agreement as it is still traumatized due to the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of switching from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged incident and switched to Italian giant Juve this summer in a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: The UK would ‘forever regret the loss of car manufacturers’
The UK would “ever regret” losing its status as a world-leading car manufacturer after Brexit, according to Economy Secretary Greg Clark.
He went on to say that it was “concerning” that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would temporarily interrupt production at the Burnaston plant near Derby should Britain leave the EU.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer stated that the impact of delays at the border could lead to job losses in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
The factory in Burnaston, where Toyota’s Auris and Avensis product lines are produced, produced nearly 150,000 vehicles last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I am convinced that in the event of an uncontrolled Brexit at the end of March, we will see production stops at our plant,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s Managing Director at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also raised concerns about a tough EU withdrawal without an agreement and its impact on cross-border trade.
For example, BMW says it will close its mini-works in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
According to the car manufacturers, the main concerns are related to risks within the supply chain in the event of a hard Brexit.
Toyota’s manufacturing facility operates on a “just-in-time” basis, which means that parts are delivered every 37 minutes by suppliers from both the UK and the EU to produce the cars on-demand.
If the UK leaves the EU on March 29 without an agreement, there could be interruptions at the borders, which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and bottlenecks in parts.
It was impossible for Toyota to maintain stocks at the plant in Derbyshire that would last longer than one day, the company explained, which is why production should be interrupted.
Clark explained that Theresa May's Chequers plan on future relations with the EU "is precisely designed to avoid such border controls."
“We need a deal, we want the best deal that, as I said, will allow us not only to enjoy the current success, but also to seize this opportunity,” he said on BBC Radio 4.
“The findings not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers show that we need to be able to continue the very successful supply chains so far.”
Toyota could not specify how long production would have to be interrupted, but warned in the long run that additional costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been employed in Burnaston for 24 years and is the highest-ranking employee of the Unite union in the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, these jobs never come back once they are gone.
A government spokesman said: “We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump's planned meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House
Donald Trump’s important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “postponed by another week,” while the dispute over the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein has overseen the work of Special Investigator Robert Mueller, who is investigating election interference by Russia, ties between Trump’s advisers and Russia, as well as possible judicial obstruction by the president.
The question of whether Trump would fire the Deputy Attorney General and thereby endanger Mueller’s independence has been the subject of rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein addressed the possibility of secretly recording his talks with Trump as well as the president’s impeachment using the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
However, he went to the White House last Monday, while new reports of his alleged resignation became known.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, which was at that time at the UN General Assembly in New York, was announced for next Thursday.
Trump said he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein, but then postponed the meeting to avoid colliding with the hearing before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, in which both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
In response to a question about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “It could be this week, but I can also imagine that it will be postponed by another week, given all the things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
It will turn out, but I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters would probably disagree with this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Moderator Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders explained that the low frequency of press conferences did not mean a dislike for the TV reporters' "effect hacking," but admitted: "But I wouldn't deny that they're doing effect hacking."
She then claimed that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
The president makes more question-and-answer rounds than any president before him," she explained, without providing any exact evidence, "We've looked at these numbers."
There will still be press conferences, however, Sanders said, “if the press has the opportunity to directly ask questions to the President of the United States, but far better than talking to me.
We try to do this often, and you have seen that we have done it many times in the last few weeks, which will take the place of the press conference if you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York, the president may have shown why this is so when he made an unruly and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of assembled reporters.
Health Minister writes to Scottish NHS workers about Brexit concerns
The Minister of Health is addressing people from abroad who work in Scotland’s National Health Service (NHS) to express the country’s gratitude and wish that they remain in the country after Brexit.
Member of the Scottish Parliament, Jeane Freeman, sent a letter less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already agreed to bear the costs of applications for residence permits for EU citizens working in Scotland’s decentralised public service.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer, UK-EU withdrawal negotiations continued and decisions are expected this fall.
However, the UK government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I am aware of what disturbing times this must be for all of you.
That is why I wanted to express once again how much I value the contribution of each and every employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and thus benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is completely your home and we would be very happy if you would stay here."
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie was reportedly undergoing emergency surgery following a head injury he suffered on Saturday in the 31-27 defeat of the Vanderbilt Commodores.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before the half-time break.
“He came to the sideline and just collapsed there,” Reed said.
Trainers and medical staff supplied Abercrombie with oxygen on the sideline before being placed on a stretcher and transported for further examination.
A Tennessee State spokesperson told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had left surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no details are yet known about the nature or extent of the injury" and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a so-called red shirt, plays in his first season at Tennessee State after switching over from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he recorded a total of 5 tackles, increasing his total to 18 tackles during the season.
Foreign investors will have to pay higher stamp tax for buying property in the UK
In the future, foreign investors will have to pay a higher stamp tax on the purchase of real estate in the UK. The additional revenues will benefit the homeless, according to the new plans of the Conservative Party.
This move aims to curb the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign for young voters
The increase in the stamp fee will affect all those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects additional revenues of up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year to help homeless people
Theresa May will announce today that foreign investors will have to pay a higher stamp fee when buying real estate in the United Kingdom, with the surplus revenues aimed at benefiting the homeless.
This move represents an attempt to curb Jeremy Corbyn’s success among young voters who promise to provide more affordable housing and target top earners.
The increase in stamp tax will be levied on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK and the additional revenues will be added to the government campaign against homelessness.
The surcharge, which is charged in addition to the current stamp tax and including the increase introduced two years ago on second homes and residential properties for rent, could be up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects additional revenues of up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
An estimated 13% of newly built properties in London are bought by investors not based in the UK, pushing prices up and making it harder for first-time buyers to get a foothold in the real estate business.
Many prosperous areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the United Kingdom.
The new strategy follows just a few weeks after Boris Johnson spoke out for a reduction in stamp tax to enable more young people to own their first home.
He accused construction companies of keeping real estate prices high by buying up land without using it, and urged Theresa May to abandon quotas on affordable homes to end Britain's "residential disgrace."
Opposition leader Corbyn announced a striking set of proposals for housing reforms ranging from a lease price tie to a ban on evictions for no valid reason.
He also wants to give city councils more powers in the construction of new apartments.
May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream, according to which life would be better from generation to generation.
And that means repairing our broken housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who live and work here and want to build a life.
However, it may not be right that it is just as easy for people who do not live in the UK as it is for companies based abroad to buy real estate as it is for hard-working British citizens.
The dream of home has become too distant for too many people and the indignity of homelessness continues to be a too big problem.”
Jack Ross: ‘My biggest goal is to manage Scotland’
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland, says his “biggest goal” is to become the manager of the Scottish team at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotsman enjoys the challenge to breathe new life into the club from the north-east of England, which is just in third place in the League One and is missing three points to the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St. Mirren back to the first Scottish league last season.
“I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I made it to the bench and that's it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
“But as a child, I’ve often seen Scotland play in Hampden with my father and that’s something that always pulls me back.
However, this opportunity would only come if I were successful in club management."
Ross's predecessors in the role as manager of Sunderland include Dock Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic said he was not afraid to follow in the footsteps of such an established name at such a club after he previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
My success will be measured at the moment by whether I can bring the club back to the Premier League.
Given the structure and possibilities of this club, he is undoubtedly part of the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not an easy task to get him there, but I would probably only consider my time here a success if I brought the club back there.”
Ross has a three-year management career, after a period as a deputy boss at Dumbarton and a 15-month job as a coach in Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third league and helped St. Mirren from the edge of the relegation to winning the championship the following season.
Ross says he is now feeling more comfortable than ever in his player career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“That was probably a real crossroads,” he recalls when he took responsibility for Alloa.
“I really believe that management was the right thing for me, more than just playing.
It sounds weird, since I was not bad at it, could live well from it and experienced some very pleasant high phases.
But playing can be hard.
There are a lot of things that you have to go through every week.
I still do this through in terms of the stress and pressure in my job, but management feels right.
I’ve always wanted to manage and now I’m doing it. I’ve never felt so comfortable in my entire life as an adult.”
You can listen to the entire interview on Sunday September 30th between 12:00 and 13:00 BST on Sportsound on Radio Scotland.
The perfect time for a glass of beer is Saturday at 5:30 p.m., according to a study
The summer heatwave has missed out on the revenues of Britain’s crippling pubs, while restaurant chains have been under greater pressure.
Pub and bar companies recorded revenue growth of 2.7 percent in July, but restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 percent, according to statistics.
Peter Martin of CGA, which compiled the figures, said: “Sustained sunshine and England’s longer-than-expected participation in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern to the previous June, when pubs saw sales increases of 2.8 percent, but restaurant hit even harder.
The decline of 1.8 percent recorded by the restaurant industry in June continued to increase in July.
Pubs and bars focused on beverages by far showed the best performance, with area-adjusted revenues rising higher than they dropped at restaurants.
Pubs with a focus on food also suffered in the sun, but not as drastic as the restaurant operators.
It seems like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In managed pubs and bars, beverage sales rose by 6.6 percent a month, while food sales declined by three percent.”
Paul Newman, of the analysts for the leisure and restaurant industry RSM, said: “These results continue the trend we have been observing since the end of April.
The weather and the influence of important social or sporting events remain the biggest factors for sales in the out-of-home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle with problems, but sales losses of 4.8 percent year-on-year will be particularly painful in addition to the ongoing cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food-focused operators, and it remains to be seen whether the more temperate temperatures in August will provide the much-needed breathing break.”
Overall revenue growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the decline in brand rollouts.

One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
One study shows that one in five children, some just 11 years old, has secret social media accounts that they keep secret from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 students at secondary schools found an increase in so-called "Fake Insta" pages
The message fuels fears that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of students said they own a “main account” to show it to their parents
One in five children, some just 11 years old, create social media accounts that can keep it secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students at secondary schools showed a rapid increase in so-called “fake insta” accounts, a reference to the photo-sharing website Instagram.
The news fuels fears that sexual content will be shared.
Twenty percent of students said they own a clean “main account” that they can show to their parents, but also have private accounts.
A mother who stumbled onto the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who urged others to “rape me.”
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-olds had two profiles, with half admitting to owning private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, chairman of the HMC, said: “It’s disturbing that so many teenagers are being lured into creating online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle becomes "Voice of Athletes" in Scottish Sports Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected as a non-executive member of the Council of the Scottish Athletics Federation at its annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland’s most award-winning athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the choice as a great opportunity for sports officials to benefit from their far-reaching international experience over the last decade.
"Eilidh is respected in the athletics community of Scotland, the UK and the world and we are sure that athletics in Scotland would benefit greatly from their election to the Council," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I look forward to acting as the voice of the athletes and hope that I can make a real contribution and lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the distance over 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, mentions a total of four Olympic gold medals of his own and today often appears as a BBC expert, could no longer walk after a temporary circulatory disorder.
He tweeted: “A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors say no one can say if or how far I will recover.
It was hard work, but I completely recovered, learned to walk again and do mobility exercises today!
Thank you for the encouraging news!"
An advertisement for breast pumps, which compares mothers with cows, creates excitement on the net
A manufacturer of breast pumps caused excitement on the net with an advertising clip comparing breastfeeding mothers to milking cows.
For the launch of the world's first low-noise portable milk pump, the manufacturer of consumer technology Elvie is publishing a not very serious music video to emphasize the freedom that the pump gives breastfeeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled barn with cows in the background to a song that contains lines like, "Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see a dick on me" or "if you haven't noticed, these aren't udders but my breasts."
The chorus continues: “Pump it out, pump it out, I feed the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies.”
However, the advertising posted on the company’s Facebook page has sparked controversy on the web.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video encountered mixed reactions from viewers, many of whom say it eases the dairy industry’s “horrors.”
“It was a very bad decision to promote this product with cows.
Just like us, they must become pregnant and give birth to a calf to produce milk, with the difference that their cubs will be taken away to them within a few days of giving birth,” the statement said.
Elvie's breast pump fits discreetly into a breastfeeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment was: “Comprehensibly traumatic for mother and baby.
But hey, why don't we use them to promote a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?"
Another person added: “Such a non-realistic advertisement.”
Others defended the advertisement and a woman admitted that she found the song "urcomfortable."
“I think that’s a brilliant idea.
I would have bought one if I were still breastfeeding.
When I was pumping, I felt like a cow.
The clip is a little crazy, but I’m not trying to over-interpret it.
This is a brilliant product," one person wrote.
Another person commented: “This is a funny advertisement aimed at mothers who use breast pumps (often at the workplace or on toilets) and feel like ‘cows’.
This is not advertising for or against the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the group reveals to women that everyone danced with the discreet pumps in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the realization that many women using breast pumps say they feel like dairy cows.
However, Elvie’s pump is completely silent, has no wires or hoses, and discreetly fits into a breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies or even go out during the pumping process.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, said: “Elvie’s pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By comparing breastfeeding mothers to dairy cows, we wanted to focus on breastfeeding pumps and all the challenges they pose, while at the same time presenting in an entertaining and comprehensible way the incredible feeling of freedom that the new pump enables.
This is not the first time Elvie’s pump has hit the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a double mother appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were quietly taken to a tent town on the Texas border
The number of immigrant children detained is as high as never before, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively the same, among other things as heightened Trump administration rhetoric and measures have made it more difficult to accommodate children with caregivers.
Traditionally, most caregivers themselves were illegal immigrants and are now afraid of becoming themselves the target of deportation when they report to take in a child.
The risk increased in June when federal agencies announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their households would have to hand in their fingerprints and share that data with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to care for unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no previous criminal records.
“Almost 80 percent of people who are either caregivers themselves or members of a caregiver’s household are illegally staying in the country and a large proportion of them are criminal aliens.
That’s why we will continue to pursue these people,” Albence said.
In order to process the cases of the children more quickly, officials introduced new rules that, according to staff of the shelters, require some children to appear in court within a month rather than 60 days after detention, which was previously the standard.
Many will appear on video, not in person, to appeal to an immigration judge for their legal status.
In the case of negative decisions, the person is quickly deported.
The longer these children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious and depressed, which can lead to violent outbreaks or attempts to erupt, according to accommodation staff, as well as reports from the system that became known in the last month.
Defenders say these concerns are exacerbated at a larger facility like Tornillo, where signs that a child is having problems are more easily overlooked due to the size.
They also explained that it can aggravate trauma that many of the children are already suffering from if they are taken to a tent town without emotional preparation or enough time to say goodbye to friends.
Syria calls on US, French and Turkish “occupation forces” to withdraw immediately
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the civil war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said that the foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and were “treated accordingly”.
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terror” was almost over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus "will continue to fight this sacred battle until all Syrian territories are cleansed" from both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers stationed in Syria, training and advising mainly both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground troops in the war-torn country.
Regarding the refugees, Moualem stated that the conditions for their return are in place and he accused "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that keep refugees from going home.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to make it possible to return home,” he said.
“They are politicizing a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union warned that no reconstruction aid will be provided to Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib provided the opportunity to advance political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey turned a broad-based offensive of Russia-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and expressed his hope that military action against jihadists, including fighters of the al-Qaeda-allied Nusra Front, which will be "extinguished," will be carried out.
UN representative Staffan de Mistura hopes to be able to convene soon the first meeting of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem called the conditions of the Syrian government for participation in the committee and stated that its work should be limited to “revising the articles of the current constitution” and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win his re-election
With this logic, Trump would win his re-election in 2020 should not, as many liberal viewers presumably hope, a impeachment or scandal end his presidency prematurely.
This would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic final of a presidency ever”.
So far, there are no signs that the audience is tired.
Since 2014, CNN’s best-time activation rates have more than doubled to 1.05 million and almost tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News averaged 2.4 million viewers at the best time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" led the turn-on to 3.5 million viewers in evenings with important news.
“It’s like a fire that magically attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Bear, showrunner of the ABC TV drama series Designated Survivor, about a cabinet member who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an old-fashioned comedy writer and author of the book “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club,” has a different theory.
She recalls a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Trump.
She asked him the reason.
"He said 'because he makes me laugh'," Scovell told me.
Chaos has entertainment value.
Of course, unlike anything on television, the stories from Washington can determine the future of the principle decision on abortions Roe v. Wade, the possible merger of families, and the health of the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.

When I reached Fleiss this week, it was sunny 27 degrees in front of his house on the north coast of the Hawaiian island of Kauai, but he crawled inside and watched MSNBC while he was recording CNN at the same time.
He simply couldn’t get away from the screen, not when Judge Candidate Brett Kavanaugh was about to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
“I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows back then and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was kind of a joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Donations flood the narrowest races for seats in Congress in mid-elections
It’s not surprising that Pennsylvania’s 17th electoral district is flooded with donations, thanks to the newly drawn boundaries of the electoral districts that resulted in two officials running for the same seat in the race.
The recently re-drawn suburban district in Pittsburg is taking on Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in the course of a special election last spring.
Lamb competes against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th District of Pennsylvania, which greatly overlaps with the new 17th District.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania State Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts violated the Constitution and were manipulated in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district sparked an exchange of campaign funding between the major financial arms of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a much-regarded special election in March around the state's 18th electoral district.
This seat was held by a Republican for over a decade and Trump won there by 20 percentage points.
Political experts give the Democrats an easy lead.
The U.S. reviewed El Salvador’s punishment for its support for China, but then shunned
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing without encountering major opposition from Washington.
Trump held a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Valero of Panama in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until partners evicted the Trump Organization’s management team.
U.S. State Department officials have decided to withdraw the heads of all U.S. foreign missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to “the recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan,” said Heather Nauert, the ministry’s spokeswoman in a statement earlier this month.
However, only in the case of El Salvador was thought of punitive measures, which in 2017 received an estimated $140 million in US aid, including for drug controls, development and economic aid.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which was to follow a similar meeting in the previous year and represent a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from moving towards the United States.
However, in mid-September, senior government officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, effectively ending the contemplation of punitive measures for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to speak at the conference scheduled for mid-October, according to diplomatic statements, to signal the importance the government is giving to the Assembly.
The three U.S. diplomats have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new harsh notifications or punitive measures from Washington.
A government spokesman for John Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to comment on the internal meetings on condition of anonymity.
Their comments were reaffirmed by an external analyst close to the government, who also spoke under the condition of anonymity.
Learning from history
The next big surprise could be Special Investigator Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible judicial obstruction, for which there is now sufficient public evidence.
Mueller is now purportedly also investigating whether Trump’s campaign team has conspired with Russia in its attack on the US elections.
Should the Congressional majority change, Trump would face an organ that would force him to account, precisely at the time when he’s riding past to appear before the voters again; and possibly before a jury.
That’s a lot of ‘if’ and I don’t want to say that the case of Donald Trump, or that of his European counterparts, is inevitable.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we must make decisions that will influence how long the battle will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup d’état against Hitler if the West had only resisted him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and missed a way to avoid the years of barbarism that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and the unstoppable march of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
Americans are facing several such turning points.
What will we do if Trump dismisses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who decides the future of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein got into Devil’s Kitchen since this newspaper reported last year that he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated whether he was unfit for office.
Rosenstein denies the New York Times.
“How will we respond if the newly ordered FBI investigation by Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or it is confirmed despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony in office?
And most importantly, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will force Trump to account?
If we fail in these tests, we will have a long winter ahead of us.
But I don’t think we will fail because of what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light Sabbath candles on the table with the swastika.
How can I not be optimistic about this legacy?”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistic before the game against Vienna
The Rangers will receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the knowledge that a victory against the Austrians after the impressive draw against Villareal in Spain earlier this month will put them in a good position for the qualification of Group G of the Europa League.
Due to a knee injury, Graham Dorrans could not appear until the 2-2 draw against Villareal, but he believes the Rangers can use this result as a springboard for bigger ones.
“That was an important point for us, because Villareal is very good,” said the 31-year-old.
We went into the game with the conviction that we can make something out of it and we drove home with a point.
Maybe we could have won in the end, but overall a draw was probably a fair result.
They probably dominated in the first half, but we worked hard in the second half and were the better team.
Thursday will be another great European evening.
Hopefully we’ll get three points, but it will be a tough game because they scored a good result in the last game, but I’m sure we can go through with the audience behind us and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult, with everything that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there’s a kind of feel-good factor.
The team is good and the guys are really good; the training is good.
Hopefully we can now look ahead, leave the last season behind and be successful."
Fear of retirement benefits leads to sleepless nights in women.
Although the respondents of the survey knew exactly how to care for them, few talked to their family members about it.
Approximately half of the participants in Nationwide’s study reported talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t take the necessary steps to lead the conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance division.
You should start with this.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to care for you if you don’t express your wishes in time.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how you want to be cared for, as these decisions can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Bring your financial advisor on board: Your consultant can also help you find a way to finance these expenses.
Your financial decisions for long-term care may include traditional nursing insurance, hybrid capital-forming life insurance to help cover those costs, or self-insurance with your own assets—as long as you own the money.
Work out your legal documents: deal with legal disputes at the last minute.
Establish a precautionary power of attorney so that you can hire a trusted person to monitor your medical care and ensure that the health professionals comply with your wishes should you be unable to express them yourself.
Also consider a power of attorney for your finances.
You choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and make sure your bills are paid if you are not able to.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication intake or allergies?
Write down these details in a written plan so that you are ready.
“It’s not just the financial issues that matter. Who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
“What is the medical treatment?”
Who takes care of the dog?
You already have this plan.”
Man shot several times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle when he went home after working among friends.
The victim, a man in his forties, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Officials described the shootings, which occurred around 2:30 a.m. British time, as "an arbitrary act".
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries were not life-threatening and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said. The number of deaths is expected to increase.
Due to the outdated communication systems, aid workers were unable to obtain information from the Donggala government district, an area north of Palu, located closer to the epicentre of the earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was just celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a government district located in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi over a stretch of coastline of over 300 km (180 miles) in length.
In the administrative district, an administrative unit below the province, an estimated 299,200 people lived in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of income for the Central Sulawesi economy, especially the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is mainly focused on Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesis.
Palu and Donggala have been victims of earthquakes and tsunamis several times over the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Civil Protection Agency.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
West Donggala was hit by a tsunami in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Fire Ring, and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami on December 26 that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people in the coastal areas of the Indian Ocean, almost half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes rocked the west coast of Sumatra between the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on the Nias Islands off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake shook the southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that hit the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 hit the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
Over 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake rocked one of the Mentawai islands off Sumatra, triggering a tsunami up to 10 meters high that destroyed dozens of villages and claimed about 300 lives.
2016: A mild earthquake shook the Pidie Jaya government district in Aceh, causing destruction and panic when people were reminded of the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people died from collapsed buildings.
2018: Severe earthquakes hit the tourist-popular Indonesian island of Lombok and claimed more than 500 lives, especially on the north side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded on the island.
Sarah Palin's son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former governor of Alaska and former candidate for vice president, was arrested on charges of bodily harm.
The 29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, hampering the reporting of domestic violence, and resisting state violence, according to a report released by Alaska police on Saturday.
According to the police report, he picked up a friend's phone when they wanted to contact the police.
According to KTUU, Palin is in custody at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and a $500 bail has been levied.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where, when asked about his plea, he replied, "Not guilty, for sure," according to the network.
Palin is accused of committing three Class A offences, which can be punished with up to a year’s imprisonment and a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which can be punished with a day in prison and a fine of 2,000 dollars.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Veteran’s Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, obstruction of reporting a crime and possession of weapons under the influence of narcotics in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of hitting her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran organizations in 2016 after she attributed her son’s behavior to a post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of his time in Iraq.
Tsunami after earthquake in Indonesia kills hundreds
At least 384 people died after an earthquake that rocked the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude quake triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are interrupted and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just off the coast of Central Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia’s capital Jakarta.
On social networks, videos circulate from the time the wave hit the country.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal Prosecutor Calls for Rare Death Penalty for Suspects in New York Terrorist Attack
The federal prosecutor’s office in New York is demanding the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the defendant in the terrorist attack in New York City, which killed eight people. This is a rare punishment that has not been imposed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, has been accused of using a rented pick-up truck from Home Depot for a terrorist attack in October, during which he ran onto a cycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, crossing pedestrians and cyclists.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "targetedly" killed the eight ofers and "consciously" inflicted serious bodily harm, according to the letter of intent for the death penalty claim filed in the southern New York district.
Both charges could, according to the court document, be punishable by death.
Weeks after the attack, a federal investigative court filed a 22-point indictment against Saipov, which includes eight charges of murder against the backdrop of organized crime, usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, as well as a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “fundamental planning and intent,” according to the prosecutors, who described the manner in which Saipov carried out the act as “disgusting, cruel and depraved.”
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov inflicted damage, pain and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the statement said.
Five of the victims were Argentinian tourists.
For more than a decade, the southern district of New York has not pursued any case with the aim of demanding the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers and eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in New York City in a federal offense was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who two years before were found guilty of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union.
Both Rosenbergs were executed with the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, witnessed a lack of remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He said in front of investigators that he felt good about what he did, police said.
Saipov explained to the authorities that he was inspired to act after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also called for the flag of ISIS to be hanged in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty in all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "of course disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty, instead of accepting a confession of guilt in exchange for a life imprisonment without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma suffered by all those involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked the indictment not to demand the death penalty.
A Conservative Party MP calls for NIGEL FARAGE to transfer Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to mobilize “the power of the people” today during a protest campaign in the framework of the Tories Conference.
The former Ukip party leader said politicians “must feel the pressure” of the Eurosceptics, while a member of Theresa May’s party suggested that Farage should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbone Peter Bone told protesters in Birmingham that the UK would be “already out” if Farage were Brexit minister.
The challenge facing May in reconciling her deeply disputed parties has been exacerbated by the fact that members of your party who are in favour of staying in the EU took part in a separate demonstration against Brexit that took place in the city.
The Prime Minister has trouble keeping Chequers’ compromise plan on track despite attacks by Brexit proponents, Brexit opponents and the EU.
Allies insisted that despite the counter-reactions, it should continue to try to negotiate a deal with Brussels, thus forcing Eurosceptics and the opposition Labour Party to choose between their package and the "chaos".
Bone explained at the ‘Leave Means Leave’ demonstration in Solihull that ‘Chequers belongs to the garbage’.
He suggested that Farage should have been appointed as a peer and should have been given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was responsible, we would be out,” he said.
Wellingborough MP added: ‘I will stand up for Brexit, but Chequers is on the rubbish.’
Emphasizing his opposition to the EU, he declared: ‘We did not fight in world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone dismissed allegations that public opinion has changed since the 2016 referendum: “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and now want to stay in the EU is completely wrong.”
The Brexit supporter of Conservative Andrea Jenkyns was also at the demonstration, explaining to reporters: ‘I’m just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The compromise is unpopular in the public eye, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and among our activists who are actually walking the streets and making sure that we are elected.
Please give up Chequers and start listening.”
In a sharp message to May, she continued: ‘Prime Ministers will keep their jobs if you keep their promises.’
Farage stated in a speech that politicians must “feel the pressure” if they are just about to cheat on the 2016 referendum decision.
“This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” Farage said.
“They’re trying to cheat on Brexit and that’s why we’re here today to tell them, ‘You’re not getting away with that.’
In front of an enthusiastic crowd, he went on to say, “I want you to let our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel the pressure.
“We are mobilizing the power of the people of this country, which has helped us win the referendum and will never come to rest unless we are an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.”
At the same time, Brexit opponents marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A few activists waved banners of the Tories Against Brexit group, a group of Brexit opponents within May’s party that was launched on the weekend.
Lord Adonis, Labour party peer, made fun of the Tories who had security issues with a party app at the opening of the conference.
“These are the people who tell us they can make sure that the IT systems, like all the technology for Canada Plus, for the smooth border, for free trade without borders in Ireland, are there,” Adonis said.
“This is a farce.
There is simply no good Brexit,” he added.
Warren Plans to ‘Examine’ Presidential Candidacy
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would “examine the presidential nomination closely” after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democrats from Massachusetts talked about their future at a meeting with voters in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, an outspoken critic of President Donald Trump, is currently in the race for re-election to the Senate against Massachusetts Republican MP Geoff Diehl, who was vice chairman of Trump’s campaign team in Massachusetts in 2016.
She was at the center of speculation that she could challenge Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in the so-called Town Hall format since Trump took office.
One of the people present asked her if you would like to run for the presidency.
Warren replied that it was time for women to “go to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes women at the top.”
Arrest after gunshot death on LSU players Sims
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, police announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested in the case of Friday's fatal shots at LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced at a press conference that it had arrested 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11 a.m. Eastern Time.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man seen on the footage.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot dead on Friday morning near the campus of Southern University.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died as a result of this injury," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, according to the sports media portal 247sports.
Wayde wanted to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being at the scene and possessing a weapon and shooting at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested and detained in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The two-metre Sims grew up in Baton Rouge and played in 32 games with 10 starting line-ups last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after his team left him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas landed in qualifying ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that Mercedes' stable lords would play a major role in the race.
From the pole position, Bottas made a good start and it was almost as if he was leading Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into the box first and put Hamilton in traffic at the end of the driver's field, a decision that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went into the box a lap later and landed behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook him after a tight wheel-to-wheel maneuver in which the Ferrari pilot reluctantly released the inside to persist at risk after two moves to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen started in the back of the field and finished seventh on his 21st birthday after the end of the first round.
He was then the fastest for much of the race, holding on to his tires to finish fast and overtaking Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He finally went into the box in the 44th lap and failed to make one step in the remaining eight laps, while Raikkonen finished fourth.
It was a difficult day because Valtteri has been doing an excellent job all weekend and acted like a real gentleman when he was supposed to leave me behind.
The team has done an excellent job of achieving a double win," said Hamilton.
A case of really bad body language
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Dianne Feinstein at an election campaign event on Saturday, insisting on not passing on the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, accusing the candidate for the Supreme Court of sexual abuse Brett Kavanaugh.
At the event in West Virginia, President Ford did not directly address the statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that the events in the Senate show that people are “bad, malicious and dishonest.”
"One thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that has happened in the Senate in the last few days is when you see the anger of seeing people who are angry and mean and malicious and dishonest," he said.
“If you look at the leaks and you say, ‘Oh, I wasn’t.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, were you responsible for the leak?
Think of your answer... Did you publish the document – “Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn’t publish it.”
Okay, just a minute, please.
Did we... No, we didn't publish it," he added, mimicking the senator's voice.
Feinstein's letter was credited with Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh in July and was released in early September, but Feinstein denies that the leak came from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusations, I didn’t publish your story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep the letter secret and I responded to her request for secrecy.”
Her denial did not seem to be well received by the president, who said on Saturday evening at the campaign event: “I tell you one thing, that was very bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but that was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
In his ongoing defense of the judge candidate, who is accused of sexual assault by three women, the Democrats claimed that they would use the accusations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by all means.
You see the meanness, the wickedness, they don’t care who they hurt when they get under the wheels to maintain power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made up for Friday's Elite League defeat to the Belfast Giants by a 5-3 win in the back game in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took the lead early with two goals, after hits by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie offset the home team before Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard came out for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald secured Nielsen's victory with two goals.
This was for the men of Adam Keefe, who unexpectedly beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night, the third defeat in the Elite League in the season.
This was the fourth encounter of the season between the two teams, with the Giant winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute after 3:35 minutes after a submission by Kendall McFaull. Four minutes later, David Rutherford delivered the submission as Beauvillier expanded the lead.
In this exciting opening phase, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game after 13:10 minutes, before Matt Marquardt helped Cownie to his goal after 15:16 minutes.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead before the halftime break when he scored his second goal of the evening shortly before the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard again balanced with a power-play hit in the 28th minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen bring Dundee into the lead for the first time in the game late in the second half. Nielsen then secured his team the victory with a fifth goal after almost half of the second half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play at home at Milton Keynes Stadium next Friday.
Air traffic controller died after he made sure that hundreds of people in an airplane escaped the earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after he found the death to have a plane safely take off with hundreds of people on board.
More than 800 people died and many are missing after the island of Sulawesi was shaken by a devastating earthquake that triggered a tsunami on Friday.
Strong aftershocks are still felt in the region and many people are trapped under rubble in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues have fled to save your lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the highly fluctuating control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed to make sure that Flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
He then jumped out of the tower when he thought he was collapsing.
Agung died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for the Indonesian air security service, explained that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australia’s ABC News.
“We have deployed a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to bring him a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter could arrive in Palu.
We are deeply concerned about this news," he added.
At the same time, authorities fear that the number of deaths could rise to several thousand, and the country’s civil protection agency said that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number is expected to increase as many bodies are still under the rubble, while others cannot be reached," said a spokesman for the agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves of up to 6 meters high have devastated Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft carry supplies and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute a new ambulance arrives with dead.
Clean drinking water is scarce.
Supermarkets are being looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday, saying in a speech to the country’s military: “I ask you all to work day and night to do all the tasks associated with the evacuation.
Have you been ready?" said CNN.
Indonesia was devastated this year by earthquakes in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini reports missing after plane crash in lagoon in Micronesia
The airline, which operated the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now reports of a missing person after initially claiming that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that they could not say anything about the whereabouts of a passenger until Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew members after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, but were in stable condition.
The cause and exact sequence of the accident remained unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both stated that the plane landed in the lagoon just before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane flew beyond the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was flying very flat.
“That’s a very good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes explained that he and others could wade through hip-deep water to the emergency exits on the sides of the sinking aircraft.
He said the flight attendants panicked and screamed and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy stated that sailors working nearby to improve a jetty ran to help with an inflatable boat to bring people to the coast before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of deep water.
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people were killed in crashes of airlines registered in Papua New Guinea, but none of them affected Air Niugini.
Analyst reconstructs the sequence of the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution ended its testimony on Saturday in the retrial of a case in which a man is accused of banishing a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
US Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett spoke for hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone calls to reconstruct the movements of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on their death night.
Rowlett said he received location data from various mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death, contrary to his previous statements, according to the Clarion Ledger newspaper.
When the data showed that his phone was with Chambers during the period in which he reportedly was with his friend Michael Sanford, police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford stepped into the witness stand on Saturday and said he had not been in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis had told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's pickup that night, Sandford said he had lied "when my pickup was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis said she knew Chambers for two weeks at the time of her death.
Cell phone records, however, indicated that they knew each other for a week.
Rowlett explained that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted their messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
“He took it out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense is expected to begin its pleadings on Sunday.
The judge assumes that the trial will then go before the jury that day.
The High Breed: What Is Conscious Hip Hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling its music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol claim that hip hop has moved away from its roots of political message and social engagement.
They want to get back to his roots and make socially conscious hip hop again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently experienced a renaissance in the United Kingdom by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
New York nanny sues couple for dismissal after "racist" text message
A New York nanny sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misdirected message from her mother complaining that she was “another black.”
The couple denied being racist and compared the legal dispute to “extortion.”
Two-time mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed her dismay when she found out that the new midwife, Giselle Maurice, was black when she began her first day of work in 2016.
“NEEEEEEEEIN, ANY BLACK,” Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent the message to Maurice twice.
After recognizing her fauxpas, the "embarrassed" Plasco flaxman dismissed Maurice, claiming that the open-minded African-American nanny had done a bad job and was expecting a Filipina instead, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for her working day and then sent home with an Uber.
Now Maurice sues the couple for compensation for their dismissal, claiming compensation for the $350 a day she had been booked for over six months, the job for which she had originally been booked, but without a contract, and for which she would have lived with the couple.
“I want to show them, look, you don’t do that,” she told the newspaper on Friday, “I know that’s discrimination.”
The couple dismissed the racism allegations, arguing that the dismissal was the reasonable step, as they feared Maurice after insulting them could no longer trust.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," Joel Plasco, a husband, told the Post.
“But would you entrust your children to a person who was rude to them, even if it was accidental?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the lawsuit to a “extortion” and explained that his wife is expecting a baby in just two months and is “in a difficult situation”.
“Do you want to arrest such a person?
That's not very nice," the investment banker added.
As the litigation continues, the couple was quickly condemned in public and denounced on social media, where they were criticized for their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers feared readers wouldn’t identify with a talking bear, reveals new letter
Karen Jankel, daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after accepting the book, said about the letter: “It’s hard to get into someone who reads it for the first time before it’s published.
Today, it’s very funny with our knowledge today about Paddington’s huge success.”
She said that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he was inspired by a little toy bear to write the children's book, had no problem with it, his work had been rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the publication after his death last year was "bitter sweet".
She explained that her father was secretly proud of Paddington's success, which she described as "a very important family member."
"He was a very quiet man and did not boast," said Jankel.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who does something special: you’re proud, even if it wasn’t really your own performance.
I think he's seen Paddington's success like that.
Although he invented and created it, he always gave Paddington himself responsibility for his success."
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone
After landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“Nad called regularly to say that it looks really bad and that the doctors gave her little chance,” said Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I received the call from Nad, in which he told me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And that's what I did.
I told her, "Tashi, I love you so much, my darling."
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping slowly sounded down and left her body.
She had died shortly before and this was the moment when everything went down.
I couldn’t do anything but wait while I knew what was going on.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and other people.
I really had to pull myself together.”
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, went aboard the plane with the other passengers, who did not know what she was going through.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
I had lowered my head and tears were running over my cheeks all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt this overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Grieving Women Hang Up Cards to Prevent Suicide on Bridges
Two women who have lost loved ones by suicide are trying to keep others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelley Humphreys hung cards on a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and phone numbers for counselling centers.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he started suffering from depression and was just 18 when he committed suicide.
“I don’t want parents to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
The 45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lydney, explained that her son was about to have a promising career as a cook and he had a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
Everyone said that his smile could brighten a room.”
However, he quit his job before his death because he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler's body was found by his 11-year-old brother after he committed suicide.
Davis said, “I always fear that this could have a consequence.”
Davis designed the maps “to show people that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t be silent: you have to talk about it.”
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost her partner Mark, with whom she was dating for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed or depressed,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas Day, he was at the low point, and when the children unpacked their gifts, he didn't look them in the eye or anything."
She said that his death was a big trauma for her, but that had to go through it: “There’s a huge hole in the family.
It tears us apart.
But we all have to keep going and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future in suspense as FBI begins investigation
"I thought if we could actually get something like this, a timely and limited investigation, then we could maybe get a little bit of harmony," Flake said on Saturday, fearing that the committee would "break apart" in the party political stalemate.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want an investigation by the FBI?
Their reluctance can be traced back to timing alone.
The midterm elections on November 6 are only five weeks away, and if the Republicans were to perform poorly as expected, they would be significantly weakened in their attempts to elect their husband to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush seized the telephone to call senators and convince them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for Bush at the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There is a vote in the Senate, which currently seats 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can unite at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to decide on equality of votes, and confirm him for the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean defectors ‘sinks’ under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean politician.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Reunification, stated that last year, 1,127 overruns were registered, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park cited stricter border controls between North Korea and China, as well as higher prices of human smugglers as the main factors.
Pyongyang did not publicly comment on this.
The overwhelming majority of North Korean renegades will eventually be offered South Korean citizenship.
Since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally.
Most flee over China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the highly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China considers the defectors as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often returns them by force.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the two heads of state met in Pyongyang to discuss the discontinued denuclearization negotiations.
This came as a result of the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June in Singapore, during which they generally agreed to work towards a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US sanctions for the lack of progress.
“Without being able to rely on the United States, we have no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to disarm ourselves unilaterally first,” Mir Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and says he’s not fit for the office at the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi called judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and said he was character-inappropriate for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t deny the impression that a woman who acted in this way would have been described as ‘hysterical’,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied all allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both were teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional. Sometimes he almost screamed and stood in tears as he talked about his family and high school time.
He has also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the allegations against him a “grotesque and coordinated call-murder” organized by liberals angry at Hillary Clinton’s lost 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh’s statement proves he can’t serve on the Supreme Court, as she shows he’s biased toward Democrats.
"I believe that with these statements and the way he dealt with the Clintons and the Democrats, he himself declared himself unfit," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to remove Kavanaugh from office should he be confirmed and the Democrats win the majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’m going to say so much: if he doesn’t tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then he’s not only unsuitable for the Supreme Court, but also for his current post of judge,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi went on to say that as a Democrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade abortion principle decision, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In his hearings, Kavanaugh evaded questions as to whether he would revise certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"We don't need a hysterical, biased person who goes to this court and expects us to say, 'Oh, that's not wonderful,'" Pelosi said.
Women need to use it as a weapon.
It’s a sincere hate speech, months and years of overboiling anger and she can’t get it out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s rare, and you?”
She went on to say: “I was helped a lot by a woman who was manager somewhere and said that she also cried when she got angry but developed a technique. When she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to: “You might think that it’s sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then just keep talking.
I thought that was awesome.”
Tears are allowed as a valve for anger, partly because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories is of a former job, in a men-dominated office, where one day I was crying because of an indescribable anger and was caught by an elderly woman, an undercooled manager I was always a little scared of, and pulled into a staircase.
“Never let her see you cry,” she told me.
“They don’t know you’re mad.
They believe that you are sad and will be satisfied with yourself because they believe that you have gone to the substance."
Patricia Schroeder, then a congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential nominations.
In 1987, when Hart was caught on board a ship called Monkey Business in an extramarital affair and subsequently withdrew his candidacy, the deeply frustrated Schroeder thought that there was no reason not to consider the idea of the presidential candidacy himself.
“That wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me 30 years later with a laugh.
There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the situation ‘Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs’.
Since the campaign had already advanced, she lagged behind in raising funds and vowed not to run if she didn’t get $2 million.
It was a hopeless struggle.
She found that some of her supporters, who donated $1,000 to men, only supported her campaign with $250.
“Do they think I’ll get a discount?” she asked herself.
In the speech in which she announced she was not launching an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by her emotions, gratitude for her supporters, frustration with the system that made raising funds and direct addressing voters so difficult instead of delegates, and the anger over sexism, so overwhelmed that she was close to tears.
"You could have assumed that I suffered a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls the press reactions.
“You could have believed that the handkerchief manufacturer Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember wondering what they would write on my tombstone.
“She was crying?”
Why Beijing Could Benefit From U.S.-China Trade War
The opening salves of the trade war between the US and China were deafening. Although the battle is far from over, Beijing could benefit from a trench between the countries in the long run, my experts say.
US President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year when he imposed punitive tariffs on key Chinese exports, including solar cells, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with new 200 billion dollar tariffs on goods, effectively affecting half of all goods imported from China to the U.S.
Beijing retaliated in the same way each time and recently imposed penalties of five to ten percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China vowed to respond to any US action and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economic power will soon stumble.
Moving Washington to incline would mean giving in, but a public glance at the US would be far too disgraceful for China’s President Xi Jinping.
Nevertheless, experts believe that if Beijing plays its cards well, China could benefit from the long-term effects of the trade war by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for economic turmoil in both countries is actually much more dangerous than many observers have realized before,” says Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security think tank.
Syria is 'ready' for the return of refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country devastated by the seven-year war.
In an address to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government is rebuilding the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
All conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government welcomes assistance in the reconstruction of the devastated country.
However, he stressed that it would not accept conditional aid from countries that had supported the uprising.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europa won the 2018 Ryder Cup and defeated Team USA with an end score of 16.5 to 10.5 in the Le Golf National near Paris.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown after the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had problems over much of the tournament, sunk his tee on the 16th track (Par 3) in the water and lost to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was able to shine in all his laps and became one of 4 players to score a 5-0-0 since the tournament began in its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5:4 by the player with the lowest ranking in Team Europe, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The player with the best ranking in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 against the Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Sergio Garcia, a veteran from eight Ryder Cups, became the best European Ryder Cup player of all time with 25.5 career points.
“Normally I don’t cry, but today I couldn’t restrain myself.
It was a difficult year.
I am so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm so infinitely happy to win back the trophy.
It’s about the team and I’m glad to have contributed,” said Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the torch on to his compatriot John Rahm, who won 2-1 in the singles matches against American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday.
I’m so incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, whom I’ve been watching on television since childhood,” said the 23-year-old.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and now has a Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.
A strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 important titles and is only surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA had trouble finding the fairways all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have performed top-class throughout the tournament.
American captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance of his team: “I’m proud of the guys, they fought.
There was a time this morning when we had put pressure on Europe.
We didn't make anything out of it.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players performed well.
We will regroup, I will talk to the PGA America and our Ryder Cup committee and we will look forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to pull the hat.
We were defeated."
