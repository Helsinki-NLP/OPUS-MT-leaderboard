Barack Obama is the fourth President of the United States to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
US President Barack Obama comes to Oslo, Norway for 26 hours to receive the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth US President in history.
In addition, he receives the diploma as well as the medal and a cheque of $1.4 million for his extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among the peoples.
The White House chief arrives tomorrow with his wife Michelle in the Northwestern metropolis and will be busy all the time.
First, he visits the Nobel Institute, where he meets for the first time with the five committee members who elected him in October from 172 people and 33 organizations.
The presidential couple then scheduled a meeting with the Norwegian King Harald V and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit reaches its peak with the ceremony at which Obama takes over the Prestige Prize.
He is the fourth President of the United States, but only the third to receive the prize directly in office.
The White House has already announced that Obama will talk about the war in Afghanistan when the prize is taken over.
The president does not want to evade this issue because he knows he is taking the prize as a president who is currently at war in two countries.
He intensified the war effort a few days ago by sending more troops to Afghanistan, which none of his critics forget to highlight.
At the ceremony, Obama also received the gold medal, diploma and cheque for ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
The money he intends to donate to charity, but he has not yet decided on a concrete charitable work.
The event programme will then include a banquet with the President and his wife, attended by the King and Queen of Norway, the Prime Minister and 250 invited guests.
Obama was very reticent about the price from the beginning.
For example, he said he feels he doesn’t deserve the prize.
He also repeated several times that the price is not just for him, but for all those who strive for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he stated that for him this is "call to action".
Conservationists accused of blackmail
The Leitmeritz police accused the chairman of the civil society "Naturschutzgemeinschaft Leitmeritz" of blackmail.
In several cases he filed appeals last year against some construction procedures, for the withdrawal of his appeals he demanded money from the investors in his favor, said the Leitmeritz police spokeswoman, Alena Romova.
The chairman of the Leitmeritz-Naturschutzgemeinschaft is Lubomir Studnicka.
He is now in custody and faces up to three years in prison.
The sorting trash containers in Brno do not smell good
In Prague, people can sort the beverage packaging, in the South Moravian villages you will find the sorting trash containers.
And in Brno?
There you would have to reserve a few minutes to find the suitable garbage cans.
I do not want to argue that the waste separation in Brno would not work at all.
But it seems to me that the councillors are insufficiently concerned with this problem, even though we are the second largest city in the republic.
Brno is located in the waste separation in the jungle league, not only because we as citizens here are always allowed to dispose of only paper, glass and plastics in the sorting containers, but above all because of the number of trash cans for such waste.
Have they ever tried to dispose of the PET bottles in a collector’s basket in the center, for example?
This is art, and above all, it takes time and strong nerves.
The only place I have found so far by chance is the Moravian square opposite the Goose.
Mr Onderka's colleagues should not be annoyed, but that seems far too little to me.
Apart from the fact that the waste separation is also not a honey slice in other parts.
Therefore, whole rows of my friends prefer not to sort the waste at all.
Out of laziness.
They are too far away from the garbage cans.
I'm not surprised.
Even after the celebration, I offered to dispose of a few glass and plastic bottles.
But on the Konicova street, I have not seen any coloured garbage cans in sight.
Fortunately, I got to the right place when driving the tram.
The rubbish almost ran over.
This is still the center of Brno, which represents the whole city, isn’t it?!
However, ecology and some kind of aesthetics probably leave the Brno Socialists cold.
They prefer to buy the city an ice hockey league that shames us all over the Republic, instead of buying a few more garbage cans and offering the sorting of other raw materials for a cleaner brunch.
I am glad that I was able to confirm my assumption even with official statistics after I searched the internet for a while.
According to the data of the company EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the entire district of South Moravia.
The "Paroubek" budget has withdrawn the money for pensions and sickness benefits
After the Left Party gave more money to farmers and officials despite the government’s view, there is no more money in the budget for pensions, health benefits and housing savings business.
But also not for the interest rates of government debt or for the international court disputes.
This is causing even more problems for those who will be in government in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists enforced the salary increase for some groups, they expected the government to borrow additional money for the delicate expenses, retirement pensions or health benefits. "This is just a postponement of the problems into the future, mining," says Janota.
Of the loans, more and more interest is paid, and you have to repay the money at some point.
Too much to choose from, the treasury is empty.
If the social benefits or costs for the state enterprise are not reduced, the tax must be increased.
For all those to whom the Left Party now gave more money: the fire department, the teachers, the farmers.
And later for their children.
In order to get the pensions or the sickness allowance, from whose account 1.8 billion have disappeared, people need not be afraid, they get this money.
But at the price that the state is indebted even more - next year, not only 163 billion will be missing in the treasury, but much more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will increase faster and faster, and together with this, the costs and interest.
The state will need the money to compensate, then it will no longer be enough to increase the VAT only slightly or to cut the maternity allowance, as the government did in its counter-deficit package.
Due to the money transfer in favor of some electoral groups, five billion will also be missing next year for the expansion of motorways and railways.
These are mainly the sections won in the competition, which can no longer be re-projected and possibly discounted.
At most, get it, which is also not free.
This means delay or discontinuation of thirty large buildings, Europe’s money creation is also at risk, warns the spokesman for the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanselka.
The CSSD has suggested that it solves the outflow of money salomonically - it attacks the CEZ share dividends, in which the state is the owner of the majority, and from which the money is then poured into the transport fund.
The problem is that the amount of the dividend is never certain and it is by no means an infinite source.
Last year, 18 billion CEZ went into the budget.
Every year, the dividends are paid for environmental damage liquidations, the pension account is replenished and this money also serves as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
With this trick, the real budget deficit rises to the level of 5.7 percent of GDP according to the EU rules.
But the carnival of the upheavals does not end with this.
Almost three billion decreased the budget for various compensations for victims of communism and crime, or for expenses in court, even for building savings.
Whether the state will be able to cope without this money is not certain.
This is pure gambling.
If we lose an international court case, we have to pay for it anyway, Janota clarifies.
The minister must then save the money within the department or, in the worst case, attack the government budget reserve.
One hundred million is also missing for the already begun two billion project "Staatskasse", which is supposed to enable on-line monitoring of what the individual authorities spend the money for.
The first stage starts in January.
If the finance minister does not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and in this case, sanctions would come, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will dominate two operating systems
Americans expect to have a mobile phone in the future, on which the user can switch between different operating systems by pressing a single button.
The plans presented look promising.
It is enough to press just one button, and from Windows Mobile to Android in a matter of seconds.
This is exactly what the American company wants to introduce VMware, which focuses primarily on the development of virtual software for computers.
We enable you to run two user profiles simultaneously on your mobile phone.
You can switch between them, you can separate them into two home and work profiles.
Both will work in parallel, according to Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware in an interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and was shown for the first time a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
The virtualization of smart phones is not fiction.
VMware already successfully presented the smartphone test pattern with two operating systems to the journalists.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a RAM of 128 MB, on which the mentioned systems Windows Mobile and Android were running simultaneously.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
Now the company VMware is working with the European and American operators on the smartphone virtualization and the devices are expected to arrive to the customer within 2012.
Lack of snow on the mountains torments hotel owners
Snowless slopes worry not only the Giant Mountains residents.
The lack of snow also discourages people from ordering ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
That is why you can still get free rooms for all winter dates incl. Christmas and New Year’s Eve in Giant Mountains.
Our pages are frequently visited.
People go through the offers, fix the prices, but meanwhile they are afraid to order bindingly.
And when they call us, they immediately ask if in our opinion this year's Christmas will be on snow or "on mud", the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura, led.
If you want to spend the New Year’s Eve in the spindle mill exactly as you imagine, you should not hesitate to place your order.
If you prefer saving and the quality of the stay comes second, you can try to wait a few more days.
The spindle mill hotel owners now only offer weekly stays for New Year’s Eve.
I think they will try to sell these for a while, but then they too will have to give in, and respond to shorter times.
And then the free rooms will quickly disappear, appreciated Jandura.
Free beds on all winter dates are always offered by the travel agency Ingtours in Vrchlabi.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which is not yet sold out.
In our offer, about half of the seats are still free.
That is why we have already prepared some cheaper Christmas stays for the last moment, said the director of the travel agency Ingtours, Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabi travel agency can also offer the New Year’s Eve in the Giant Mountains, but there are fewer places available here.
Good sales also find the first fourteen days in February, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year, the interest in winter stays is also negatively affected by the fact that there is always no snow in the Giant Mountains.
People are waiting for snow to fall.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowed within a week, Christmas will also be sold out, says Schiefert.
Conversely, and somewhat better than last year, it manages to occupy the rooms at the Hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou.
We are about five percent better than last year.
On New Year’s Day and Christmas we only have a few free rooms.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in Janua, and in February the business will also run well, informed the director of the best Pec hotel, Karel Rada.
80 percent for New Year’s Eve stays, the Hotel Omnia is also occupied by the central parking lot in Janske Lazne.
On the other hand, half of the beds remain free at Christmas in the newest hotel in Janske Lazne.
We were pleasantly surprised in this year of January, for which we are already about 60 percent occupied.
A little weaker is now February, but the moment when the snow comes, interest in the stays in the Giant Mountains will certainly increase, the director of the hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch, said.
The Giant Mountains hotel owners are now waiting for a larger snow cover.
On Thursday it should cool down and if there is rain, it should be snow on the mountains.
But after that, another warming is expected, Jiri Jakubsky informed from the location of the Czech Weather Office in Hradec Kralove.
USA: Repetition is the Mother of Wisdom
It is almost weird with what student ambition Barack Obama, the president with his reputation of the smartest, repeats his predecessor’s strategy on the Afghanistan issue, which he himself considered the stupidest.
When he finally sweated out his eagerly-anticipated Afghanistan doctrine, it turned out that he wrote it off using the copy paper from the Bush Iraq scenario three years ago.
Not only does he use the phrase "as in Iraq" several times in the text himself, he even uses the name of the Bush Declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New way forward" without hesitation.
Even three years ago, he criticized the Bush idea of sending fresh contingents to Iraq, which was plagued by the civil war, as an "irresponsible and, in its consequence, catastrophic decision."
However, the following months showed that the Bush strategy, based on military recommendations, was the only possible and very successful one, so that today the news about Iraq is no longer being talked about at all.
This did not improve Bush’s reputation, as he objectively left his successor with a much more appreciative initial situation than expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will repeat itself.
The military once again asked him to increase the contingent, especially the commander-in-chief of Afghanistan Operation General Stanley McCristal, who, despite the habits of subordination, harshly criticized the timid gunmen in the White House.
He called for 40,000 soldiers to reverse the situation for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but came up with no better idea and so he cheated the general by 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe, he has squeezed the promise for another 5,000, even if he himself originally expected at least 10,000.
Most problematic about the entire Obama strategy is his plan to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 18 months, and to complete this process within three years. The entire Obama doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the halved increase will have the same effect as the measure in Iraq.
Despite the brotherly war of recent years, the Iraqi society is relatively well-structured, and its leaders honor the values.
The Afghan situation is characterized by the contraindication - no one can be trusted and no agreements are kept.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, who are accustomed to changing their minds every day.
The political institutions, even if they were formally established correctly, remain only fictitious structures behind which patriarchal tribal relations will continue to grow.
The balancing of interests between the different ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of the unclearness of the circumstances, which further complicates the influences of Pakistan and Iran.
The establishment of a "capable state", which is the minimalistic goal of the whole operation, is also very unrealistic.
Time horizon of Obama’s strategy stunned by his voluntarism
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only deteriorated further and now it is on the verge of explosion.
Believe that the little soldiers who have broken out in the war cry about the "early return" can create a miracle here, only a truly romantic soul who is not impressed by facts.
From a political point of view, the date for the withdrawal of troops is pure irresponsibility, because the Taliban will accept this as the indirect confession of the American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that Europeans’ willingness to participate in the fighting in Afghanistan is diminishing.
Europe’s politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their voters in what way the security of Germany or Italy is related to the war in the Hindu Kush mountain foreland.
Another possible factor that can radically influence the situation is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions do not affect Iranians, the United States will face a very serious question as to whether the problem can not be solved with troops.
This question must be answered in the period in which America moves after Obama to withdraw victoriously from Afghanistan.
Any solution will also mean a dramatic change in the Afghan situation.
The only consolation for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years to go until the presidential election, and so there is still enough time for him to resort to a different strategy if it turns out to be a total failure.
Goldman Sachs managers no longer receive bonus bonuses in cash
The senior executives of the American bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive bonuses in cash this year.
This has been announced by the company, which reacts to the sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers get shares instead of money, but you can only sell them in five years.
In addition, the shares may be withdrawn from managers in the event they act excessively risky.
Goldman Sachs is thus at the forefront of efforts to combine Wall Street’s premium bonuses with long-term performance, according to Reuters.
I believe Wall Street is aware of the further direction in which it has to go, JPMorgan’s former banker, Douglas Elliott, led.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs became the target of criticism after she put aside nearly $17 billion for premium bonuses for the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of premium bonuses over the course of this year is likely to exceed $20 billion, according to the agency Reuters, despite the measure indicated today.
The high premium bonuses in the banking sector have become the hottest political topic in a number of countries with the onset of the financial crisis.
The UK reported on Wednesday that it intends to charge the bankers’ bonuses, which exceed <0xC2><0xA3>25,000, once with a 50 percent tax.
Similar steps are being taken by France.
This year, women won the Nobel Prizes in all disciplines except physics.
Five record-breaking women took over this year’s Nobel Prizes in literary and technical categories from the hands of King Carl XVI Gustaf in Stockholm today.
In addition to the four scientists, the German writer of Romanian descent, Herta Müller, was among them.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with their compatriot Jack Szostak, have received the Nobel Prize in Medicine for research in the field of chromosomes.
Israeli chemist Ada Jonath, along with the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, has been awarded the prize for elucidating the ribosome structure and function.
The last laureate awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics, which American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson received for analyses of the economic report.
The only category in which no woman won a Nobel Prize this year was physics.
Today, scientists Charles Kao and George Smith, together with Willard Boyl, have won this award for the CCD chip invention, which is the basis of all digital cameras, fax machines or astronomical telescopes.
Each of these laureates has received the diploma, the Nobel Medals and a certificate of acquisition of the money prize.
This amounts to ten million Swedish kronor in each category.
If there are multiple prize winners in each category, the cash prize will be divided among them.
Traditionally, the American President, Barak Obama, has already received the most anticipated Nobel Peace Prize this afternoon in Oslo.
He has acknowledged in his speech the controversies of his appointment because he is only at the beginning of his path, and beyond that, at the head of the country that is waging two wars - in Iraq and in Afghanistan.
In keeping with his policy, however, he added that wars are necessary in certain situations for the achievement of world peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota is considering his resignation. Klaus has invited him to the castle
President Vaclav Klaus will receive the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, on Friday morning, who is thinking about his stay in the government because he disagrees with the execution of the state budget for next year in the form approved by the parliamentary assembly on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and perhaps Janota’s stay in the cabinet will be the topics of the Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the budget deficit is too high, which also deepens the crisis of public finances.
The presidential spokesman, Radim Ochvat, informed about the meeting.
Janota wants to negotiate with the prime minister, Jan Fischer, on Monday.
According to the budget law, which now gets Klaus to sign, the Czech Republic should operate with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
In Parliament, however, on Wednesday, the Left Party proposals on the money circulation were voted on and the money for state official salaries, for the maintenance of social benefits and direct wages of farmers increased.
The government has opposed the proposals of Social Democracy that they covertly increase the budget deficit.
A sharp domestic dispute has arisen between the left party on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right-wing party, on the other hand, as a result of which the question mark arises about the further work of the Fischer Cabinet of Officials, on whose design the ODS, CSSD and the Green Party agreed in the spring.
Critics argue that the budget, as adopted by Parliament, practically liquidates the package of austerity measures enforced by the Fisheries Government in the autumn, and that, in their understanding, is to end the national debt.
Klaus, who can, but does not have to, sign the law on the state budget, explained today at the discussion breakfast with the entrepreneurs that the politicians have been neglecting the “serious problem” that represents “the unsustainable deficit” of public finances for a long time.
In his opinion, there is no good solution anymore.
An improvement could only bring a strong government that could build on a broader consensus of the political parties.
The ODS chairman, Mirek Topolanek, pointed out that the budget is horrendous, and the government should weigh its continued existence.
The ODS chairman, Petr Necas, told the CTK that the Cabinet of Officials concept with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Green Party apparently no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer described similar words in the editorial as "strong statements".
The CSSD chief, Jiri Paroubek, responded to Topolanek’s words that the budget deficit was horrendous, that the former government of Topolanek had prepared for this year, and that exceeds 200 billion crowns.
Already on Wednesday, the CSSD rated the approval of the state budget for next year as a success.
The People’s Party was also pleased.
Mandela was played in the new movie by Clint Eastwood by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Undefeated" shows the world much of the country, of its struggle and victories despite some criticisms that the lead role was occupied by an American actor.
The story tells about sports, race and Nelson Mandela.
The relentless fighter against the racist apartheid government system in the South African Republic, as well as its first black president, Nelson Mandela, portrays in his life story the American Oscar actor, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said he was asked by ninety-one-year-old Mandela if he could portray him in the Eastwood film.
Another important role is played by Matt Damon.
I told him, "If I'm going to play you, I have to meet you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who had received the award for his role in the Eastwood drama from the boxing section "Million Dollar Baby", already represented the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, which has eventually become a slaveholder, a fictitious U.S. president, and also God in "Evan Almighty", but rarely is someone as important as many people still live and mandeal.
The former South African statesman was in prison for 27 years for his active activity in ending apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was set free in 1990 and for four years he became president of the country.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "unbeaten", and at the same time it is the name of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The requirement was how he spoke
The film portrays a true event in which Nelson Mandela joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to unite the country. The new President Mandela knows that his people remain racially and economically divided even after apartheid.
He believes he can unite his people through the sport, so he decides to unite the rugby players who are outsiders worldwide.
Finally, the South African team rises to the World Cup of 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to bring the Mandela story to the cinema screen.
He had no other goal than to play this role in order to bring it as close as possible to reality, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge, of course, was to talk like him.
The actor said if he and the world politician were in the same country, he would try to meet with Mandela, have dinner with him, and be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake Mandela’s hand.
I found that when I shake your hand, I take over your energy, it’s being transferred, and I had the feeling that I know what you’re feeling, he said.
It’s important for me to become a different person.
In the film, Matt Damon portrays François Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team, in which the white players have dominated.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for the role in the tough rugby world.
It was a big surprise for him when he first met Pienaar in his house.
I remember when I rang the doorbell, it opened and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, 'In the movie I look much bigger.'
Despite the obvious differences in the stature of the actors compared to their actual role models, he has received positive reviews under the direction of director Eastwood "Invictus: Unbeaten" and it is also spoken of prospects for an Oscar.
The film critic of the Daily Variety magazine, Todd McCarthy, summarized his evaluation in the following words: "This was very good story, very well-executed film."
In the film reviews on the web-pages rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive evaluations.
Light secret over Norway dissolved: Russians have tested a rocket
A special light effect of unknown origin was observed over Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence admitted yesterday that an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested near the Norwegian border.
But the launch was again unsuccessful and the rocket, referred to as the "Bulava" type, which was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian army, will slowly become the nightmare of the Russian generality as well as of the Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin.
Even his repeated presence on site at the rocket tests had no positive effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava has usually not been launched at all or damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspapers it is already written about "Bulava" as about a "missile that does not fly".
A rocket that doesn’t fly but lights
The 13th attempt was normal at the beginning.
Only at the end of the flight did technical damage to the rocket occur again.
The engine probably exploded in the third rocket stage.
This time, "Bulava" launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donsky, which drove under the waters of the White Sea.
This type of rocket allows the launch from the submarine.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light caused by an indeterminate flying object over the North Roads was actually the damaged "Bulava".
In addition, the Norwegians have not doubted since the first moment that it is a Russian missile.
This time the generality has held back against it, claiming that one cannot clearly speak of a failure.
The first two stages of the missile did not fail and the accident affected only the third stage.
In the previous cases, the engines in the first stage were immediately damaged.
Even if no test start was made without error, the Ministry of Defence’s leadership considers only six out of thirteen to be unsuccessful.
The almost fifty percent success therefore fills the generality with optimism and so it continues to be argued that the "Bulava" will fly once without problems and will even carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear warheads with a total weight of no more than 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov has signed an annual contract with the CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
The legendary defensive player Vjaceslav Fetisov once again introduces himself in a professional ice hockey game at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup owner is helping his team CSKA Moscow out of trouble, and is likely to compete in the Friday match KHL against Petersburg already.
Fetisov, who completed his career at the age of forty, in 1998, is currently President of the CSKA.
After Denis Kulja's injury, we urgently need another defensive player.
Fetisov has regularly trained and agreed that he will support the team.
We just need to clarify some remaining formalities, the agency AP quoted the coach of the Moscow club of Sergei Nemcinov.
Meanwhile, it is not clear whether the comeback of the famous hockey player will only concern one game.
I think that Fetisov is one of those who can raise the morale of other players, co-player Nemcinov performed.
When Fetisov gets back on the ice surface, he will be the oldest Russian professional ice hockey game after AP.
In the NHL, legendary striker Gordie Howe played an entire season for Hartford at the age of fifty-one, earning 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous Five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful ice hockey players in history.
In the dress of the Soviet Union he has won two Olympic gold medals, seven world champion titles and he has also triumphed in the Canada Cup and in the Junior World Cup.
In the second part of his career, he also earned success in the NHL, where he twice raised the Stanley Cup over his head in the Detroit Dress.
He has been a member of the Ice Hockey Star Room since 2001.
Hyundai surrendered to trade unions. All overtime hours will be lifted
The management of the Nosovice automotive factory Hyundai agreed with the union on the lifting of all overtime hours.
Due to frequent overtime orders, the union announced on Monday that it was ready to strike.
This was confirmed by Hyundai’s spokesman Petr Vanek.
However, the management wants to reach an agreement with the unionists on a Saturday shift this week.
We must not abandon our manufacturing plan, which is a principle, so on Saturday, December 19, volunteer overtime was proposed for the reason that two shifts would be worked, Vanek said.
The website Sedmicka.cz wrote that the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to the employees who would work the Saturday shift.
The employees will also receive it in retrospect for the Saturday shift of November 28.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change the way employees are motivated for the proposed overtime hours.
Either they get paid the overtime surcharge or they can take replacement leave on December 28th and thus extend the Christmas holidays, Vanek performed.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday shift are paid the fare and lunch.
Given that overtime was the most pressing and ardent issue with regard to the demands and complaints of the unionists who had stopped production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect to cancel all overtime hours for the month of December, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
Until last week, the employees of the automotive factory had been forced to work 2 overtime hours virtually every day after the eight-hour shift.
From the signing of the agreement, the trade unions will revoke their willingness to strike.
Further negotiations between the management of the automotive factory and the trade unionists are scheduled to take place on Friday afternoon.
The union leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that if they can agree to meet the demands and sign a joint document, they are ready to lift the strike.
The situation at the automotive factory sharpened last week, on Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously went on strike due to constant overtime.
They also protested against the poor payment terms and alleged harassment.
The management, on the other hand, held that the employees had to do the overtime to meet the automotive supply requirements.
The unionists also called for no sanctions on workers who had interrupted production on Wednesday.
In the area of overtime, trade unions are calling for a reduction of overtime work to a minimum.
In addition, this year they are demanding the payment of 5,000 crowns.
The Hyundai Nosovice automotive plant now employs 2,000 people.
Serial production was started at the company in November last year.
By this September, approximately 80,000 vehicles were produced here, the current production capacity is 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also works in 'stealed' HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds to prevent the spread of HIV viruses in the organism.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also acts on viruses that are already resistant to drugs.
This fact outweighs the disadvantage that the compound does not act as strongly on common virus variants as one of the already existing drugs.
The disease AIDS cannot be cured.
However, patients can prolong their life and prevent the spread of HIV viruses in the body.
However, their intake is accompanied by a number of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of the virus propagation also leads to the development of so-called resistant viruses, against which no medicines are more effective.
The work of experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, from the VSCHT (Chemical-Technological University) Prague and from the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with virus resistance.
They have demonstrated that the substances called metalocarboranes act on the protein responsible for the propagation of the HIV virus.
The metalocarboranes are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block virus propagation in a different way than all drugs used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists come up with new ‘improved’ compounds, which have been prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to the virus protein.
The metalocarboranes have a unique three-dimensional structure: two diverse cages composed of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms coupled by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Insidious and resistant virus
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV-virus cleavage caused by the HIV protease, no mature infectious virus particles would arise.
If we turn off the HIV protease, we also turn off the propagation of the virus in the patient's body, the scientists explain in the press report published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the paper, published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe whole series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are coupled by a short organic chain, which is then systematically further modified.
A little weaker but more reliable
The effect of this series of substances against HIV protease was tested in the test tube, also against their resistant variants obtained from HIV-infected patients.
The effect of the metalocarboranes on the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as with the clinically used drugs, but it does not lose its effect on the resistant variants against which the drugs used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action, as well as its other properties, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical designs, makes the metalocarboranes interesting compounds for further research aimed at the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlina Rezacova, Head of the Laboratory of Structural Biology of the Institutes of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics.
Dispute over budget. ODS started on Fischer, who is resisting
The chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, described the approved budget for next year as “horrible” and Jan Fischer’s government, in his opinion, should consider its continued existence.
The statement of the ODS was described by the Prime Minister as "strong statements".
It is supposed to be time for analysis.
The deputy chairman of the ODS, Petr Necas, said that the Cabinet of Officials concept with the support of the CSSD, the ODS and the Green Party apparently no longer works.
According to Necas, the prime minister must decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in parliament when it comes to the fight against the rising deficit, or whether he intends to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats to the problem of public deficits is diametrically different, Necas has pointed out.
On Wednesday, Parliament approved the budget for 2010, albeit with amendments by the Left Party of more than 12 billion kroner.
Parliament has increased the money for state official salaries, for the maintenance of social benefits and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has opposed the proposals of the Social Democracy that they covertly increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should be operating with a backlog of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS has left the Chamber before the vote, so it has complied with the government's wishes, because even the amended budget is only a less bad variant of the budget provisional.
Disappointment and senselessness
The Finance Minister, Eduard Janota, spoke of his disappointment and sense of senselessness, while Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government is still assessing the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened his resignation in the event that the amendments were adopted, the situation would be different.
According to Czech television, Janota has signed up with the Premier for Monday after the government's affairs.
He said he was considering staying in office.
The reason for this is his disappointment at the disbursement of the budget.
To what extent Fischer is in favour of the continued struggle with the budget deficit, according to Necas, the nominees of Social Democracy (CSSD), who had enforced the changes in the budget, have nothing to do with the government.
The prime minister should also say clearly that he will resign if parliament continues to adopt deficit-increasing laws, such as those relating to sickness benefits and pensions or the service law novel.
Topolanek: The ministers nominated by ODS were not mistaken
This is the business of Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS have made no mistakes, Topolanek has highlighted in a text message from the US.
It has mentioned that in some ministries there are people sitting in deputy positions who profess to be TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if Fischer decides to renounce the fight against the deficit-high of public finances, "it is perfectly logical and correct that he relies on the left majority that is currently in Parliament".
Then he allegedly can’t count on the support and tolerance of the citizen Democrats.
I haven't thought about it, and if it's going to be relevant, then I'll deal with it," Defense Minister Martin Bartak, nominated by the Democrats, told journalists in Parliament.
In the afternoon, Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels to attend the European Council.
The ODS resigned at the request of the Prime Minister
Necas also stressed that the ODS would probably vote against the revised budget in parliament on Wednesday if the prime minister explicitly asked the MPs of the Citizen Democrats to allow the budget to be adopted.
We do not think of ourselves as orphans, we are not small children, he then responded to the question whether the ODS was not pushed back in the political negotiation on the budget by the absence of the party chairman in Parliament and in the Czech Republic.
I didn’t realize that my voice was missing.
Even when I renounced the mandate, I knew that in the coming months it would be mainly about the Bolshevikisation of Parliament and the destruction of everything positive, Topolanek himself responded.
According to the new timetable of the CD (Czech Railway), fewer trains will travel for approximately the same fare.
From 13 December, the Czech Railways will terminate or restrict some less busy high-speed and local trains, while other connections will be strengthened.
The total volume of traffic will be reduced by 2% from the date of validity of the new timetable compared to today.
Most fares incl. basic and customer fare will not be changed.
Several connections to the capital, for example, are provided to the inhabitants of the Ostrava area, the railway uses trains of the type Pendolino for this route.
The express train will no longer travel to Bratislava (Pressburg).
Fewer high-speed trains will also travel on the route Prague - Pisek - Budweis, basically the direct connections from Prague to Letohrad are reduced.
The biggest reduction is planned for the railway in the district of Hradec Kralove (Königsgraz), a total of eight percent, but Prague and the surrounding area can look forward to an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tabor - Budweis route will also be cancelled and the operation of some high-speed trains on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route will be reduced to a few days a week.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of the new direct route from Milovice to Prague, at the moment the inhabitants of Milovice have to switch to Lysa nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth route of the Esko suburban transport system, which is opened thanks to the railway electrification from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The long-distance routes to the capital will end at the destination station Prague - Central Station.
The CD introduces more connecting lines SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and the trains to Sumperk/Jesenik will travel in a time interval of two hours.
With the Pendolino, passengers can no longer travel to Bratislava since 13 December.
This year’s regional railway bill: increase by 200 million
The high-speed trains are ordered and paid for by the Ministry of Transport, in total the railway will receive four billion crowns to pay for the so-called liquidity loss in the next year, just as this year. The local trains will supply the districts, in total they will pay eight billion crowns in the next year, with the state shooting three billion.
This year, regional trains are 200 million Czech crowns more expensive.
For the local trains as well as the high-speed trains, the railway has re-contracted a ten-year contract, until now the contract was always concluded for only one year.
The railway praises the system, and perhaps that is why it has not resorted to price increases for the vast majority of tickets.
Changes will only occur for one-day online tickets CD Net and for cheap online tickets eLiska.
For passengers without the customer card, the price CD Net is increased from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price eLiska will then depend on the driven plug, until now it was uniform for the journey between any district cities and cost 160 crowns.
Philippine militants arrested more than 50 people, the children were released.
Millitants kidnapped 75 people in the south of the Philippines today, including some elementary school students and their teachers.
According to AFP, only 65 abductees were initially reported.
All 17 children detained were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Approximately 19 militants allegedly used the hostages as a living shield when fleeing the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to release the rest of the hostages.
According to the agency AFP, the Militants belong to the New People’s Army (NPA), which is the arms faction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP, the police were pursuing the kidnappers for the violence that called for revenge between the two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, the right to stand was enforced because of the recent massacre, in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre, which was related to the election to the governorship, were 30 journalists.
On suspicion of participation in the massacre, the governor of this southern Philippine province and his father, Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan clan, were arrested.
Muslim separatists are also active on the island of Mindanao.
On Tuesday, the Philippine government resumed peace talks.
The history of South Africa affects everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Nelson Mandela
In the next few days, Clint Eastwood’s new Hollywood film “Invictus: The Undefeated” will be released in American cinemas, which includes a part of the life story of former president of the Republic of South Africa, Nelsona Mandela.
The role of the world-famous fighter against apartheid has been given to Morgan Freeman, who had already been allegedly selected by Mandela himself a few years ago.
The supporting role of the legendary South African rugby champion, François Pienaar, has been awarded to Matt Damon.
With the film’s cinematic launch, reactions from critics as well as the public will also be noisy.
Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born July 18, 1918 in Mvez, South Africa.
In 1988, he received the Sakhar Prize, and in 1993, together with de Klerk, the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was elected President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
Great expectations are set in the film because it comes to the cinemas at a time when South Africa’s preparations for the World Cup on the one hand are culminating, but at the same time the media are shaking the world’s public with frightening news about the rising racial hatred and discrimination of residents on the part of the black ruling majority.
According to the news agency AP, the reactions to the new film in South Africa are consistently positive for the time being, despite numerous reservations about the cast of the lead roles with American Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is proud of his new film.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and have prepared myself well for it.
Several times I also met Nelson Mandela in person, so that I can - as it is said - receive his energy, he performed in the interview after the film's festival premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it’s good if we can recall Mandela’s personality and his message with this film.
This is a history of South Africa, but it affects every human being, he added.
In the rugby national team dress
The film is based on the book template by British writer John Carlin, freely translated 'In the Role of the Enemy': Nelson Mandela and the game that unites the people portrays the South African advocate of human rights within his first presidential term.
In the course of the film, Morgan Freeman strives to bring together two racially distinct populations and, like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also appears in the South African national rugby suit, which South Africa won at the time.
For entering the lawn in dress, which is almost like a sacred act in South Africa, Mandela harvested large ovations fourteen years ago, mostly from the white public, and has thus gained the recognition of the white population.
The rugby championship may be able to bring people together into a single people, led rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa will improve will only be apparent.
But the white South Africans are skeptical, as, for example, in a recent interview for LN, the rugby fan Christopher Dawson betrayed, who fled the country to Britain.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
In the Louny area, transformers burn for several 10 million crowns
The fire broke out in the morning at the transformer of the company Ceps in the switchgear near the municipality of Vyskov in the Louny area.
According to the spokesman of the district fire department Usti nad Labem, Lukas Marvan, six units intervened in the fire.
Originally, the fire department wanted to have the transformers burned out, but later it changed the view and now the fire is extinguished with a mixture of water - foam and special extinguishing agents.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformer internal short circuit.
No one was injured, the accident did not endanger the security operation of the pipeline, according to the company’s spokeswoman, Pavla Mandatova.
The damage was estimated at several 10 million crowns, more precisely the damage will only be quantified after the fire.
According to Mandatova, the damaged transformer must be replaced by a new one.
For more than 10 years nothing similar has happened with the company Ceps, errors of this kind are rare, she added.
According to the spokeswoman of the company CEZ for Northern Bohemia, Sona Holingerova, the power supply was not interrupted, the fire of the transformer station did not affect the functioning of households, authorities and companies.
A.G. Ceps operates in the Czech Republic as the sole operator of the 400 kV and 220 kV electrical wiring system.
It maintains, renovates and develops 39 switchgears with 67 transformers, with which the electrical energy is transferred into the distribution system and line line with a length of 4339 kilometers.
Jancura filed a criminal complaint for libel against three heads of the CSSD.
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jancura, has filed a criminal complaint today for libel against three social-democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the district of South Moravia, Radko Martinek from the district of Pardubice and the head of the district of Olomouc, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a twenty-minute inteview in the radio journal.
The lawsuit relates to the company’s efforts to operate regional rail services in some districts.
However, all regions have ultimately signed the long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three ladders attack us and say that we take out the raisins, but we have only submitted the offer beyond the scope as it was coordinated with them.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways because we would know the prices of the Czech Railways, which were closed last week.
So we have nothing left but to defend ourselves.
Because of this slander of the Student Agency company, Jancura told the radio journal.
At the same time, he pointed out that he has evidence from all districts that they have taken their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing an indictment for the European Commission.
Hasek considers the collection of the criminal complaint to be the continuation of Jancura’s media show, which serves him as free advertising for his society as well as for his own person.
I am, of course, ready to defend my good name and the good reputation of my district, and I also encourage other leaders to do so.
I assume that even on this issue, it will become clear that it is Jancura who manipulates the public in the matter of regional railways and uses false and untrue arguments, Hasek said.
Jancura reported last week that he had invested several million crowns in advertising, which will point to the adverse step taken by the districts.
He told the radio journal that he wants to interrupt the campaign after Christmas and continue it after New Year.
He clarified that he will lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign was launched by Jancura after the districts agreed to operate regional rail services with the Czech Railways and had not tendered for the contract at a high of 150 billion kroner.
According to Vancura, such conduct is unlawful and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
Due to the criticism of train traffic in the districts, according to Jancura, he was also already threatened by a member of the CSSD.
The only threat was if we didn’t give up, we could lose the bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a member of the CSSD, I know who it is, I do not say his name, Jancura told the radio journal today.
Vaccination against pneumococcus free and voluntary
Pneumococcal vaccination changes habits from January onwards.
It should be the first to be free and voluntary for the families.
But even now, voices are reporting that the mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of the free vaccination against pneumococcus culminate.
The Institute of Medicine already sets the maximum prices of vaccines that the health insurance companies have to pay.
Experts are also aware of the vaccination procedure.
New Vaccination
Vaccines free for August children
Starting in January, children can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcus, which was born on August 2nd last year and later.
The condition is that you have not yet received a dose of vaccine.
Those who have already started the vaccination in the last year or earlier, also have to pay for further repeat vaccination themselves.
The first dose of vaccine must be given between the 3rd and 5th month of life of the child.
Already last year, a quarter of families had their children vaccinated against pneumococcus.
The parents paid 1600 crowns and more for a dose.
Four doses are required for the vaccination of the youngest children.
Overall, the experts estimate that health insurance for the vaccine doses spends 300,000 to 450,000 crowns per year.
However, they save on the treatment that the children would need without vaccination.
So far, the state has spent about 500,000 per year on all children’s area vaccinations.
The mandatory vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococci cause otitis media, but also serious infections including meningitis and blood poisoning.
Pneumococcal infections kill up to 28 children aged up to 10 years per year after examination in hospitals.
Outside the Czech Republic, the mandatory vaccination of children against pneumococcal has been introduced in about 40 countries.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination could be mandatory in the future.
From January onwards, this will be paid by the insurance companies and will be voluntary.
That the compulsory vaccination would be better, for example, mentioned the head of the civil association Nahlas, Rudolf Kalovsky.
Its association is already promoting pneumococcal vaccination in the long term.
The experts at the international conference in which our association was involved were not very satisfied with the fact that we have voluntary vaccination.
That's not quite ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that we have succeeded in enforcing at least that.
I think that’s the way we have to go now, Kalovsky led.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococcus.
At this moment, we are not considering this at all, his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen said.
Voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, doctors claim.
The chairman of the Society of Practical Pediatricians, Hana Cabrnochova, admits that voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
“In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination was started as a voluntary one,” says Cabrnochova.
Experts expect more than 80 percent of parents to have their infants vaccinated against pneumococcal from next year.
Vaccination against pneumococcus is also groundbreaking in that it is the first area vaccination paid by health insurance and not by the state.
The insurance companies should spend the money on prevention, saving them for further treatment, explains Cabrnochova.
Doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
However, this is associated with a concern of practical pediatricians regarding the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original plan, the vaccines should be purchased by the insurance companies and the doctors then receive them in the same way as other vaccines issued to them by the state.
However, some MEPs feared that the insurance companies could "export the money from health insurance."
Therefore, doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves and wait for the insurance companies to pay them.
According to estimates, the individual practical doctors will have to invest 40,000 crowns per month, which is a significant sum.
This will not be easy, says Cabrnochova.
U.S. artist's son involved in "museum theft"
The son of famous American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of attempting to steal $20 million worth of paintings from his father’s museum.
According to Pennsylvania police, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught loading 90 paintings into his vehicle with trailers.
It is said that Frank Frazetta junior and another man used an excavator to penetrate the museum into the Pocono Mountains.
The 81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for his portrayal of figures such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
As the Associated Press reported, the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP quoted an unnamed police officer as saying that Frank Frazetta Junior may have been motivated by a family feud.
The agency reported, according to a police affidavit, Frazetta Junior claimed he was instructed by his father "that he should penetrate the museum by all means to bring all the paintings into a camp."
The agency reported that Frank Frazetta Senior denied any permission to do so.
Labour defends budget and tax increases
Ministers have defended the tax increases and spending halts announced in the previous budget report against the criticism of the opposition, the economy and the trade unions.
Conservatives said Alistair Darling had "passed" an opportunity to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by delaying the decisions until after the election.
The Chancellor of the Treasury was also under fire for targeting low- and middle-income workers.
His main proposals include a 0.5% increase in social security and a 1% cap on public payroll for 2011.
Social security offenders
The unions have protested that low-wage recipients are being punished for a recession that they have not caused and warned of impending “problems.”
The rise in social security – to about <0xC2><0xA3>3 billion a year – has upset the private sector, which says this is a tax on jobs, although attention should be paid to the economic recovery.
The increase, which is limited to those earning more than <0xC2><0xA3>20,000 per year, will affect about 10 million workers.
SPECIFICATIONS OF THE PRELIMINARY STATEMENT REPORT
Increase in social security by another 0.5% from April 2011
This year, the economy shrinks by more than the expected 4.75%
New 50% tax on banker bonuses
1 percent increase in corporate tax for small businesses rejected
Tax discounts for electric vehicles and wind turbines
Increase in state pensions by 2.5%
According to Treasury estimates, someone with an annual income of <0xC2><0xA3>30,000 will be poorer by <0xC2><0xA3>90 per year, and someone with <0xC2><0xA3>40,000 per year will be poorer by <0xC2><0xA3>190, while a person with <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 annual income will be richer by <0xC2><0xA3>110.
Ministers said their goal of halving the deficit by 2013 meant “difficult decisions,” but they also said that 60% of the burden of additional taxes would be on the 5% of top earners.
Treasury Secretary Stephen Timms denied that the outlined tax increases and spending halts compared to the necessary measures would be "a drop on the hot stone."
"These are big figures, they're going to bring us the deficit halving and this is absolutely necessary over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that the economy would return to growth by the end of the year.
Labour’s predictions of future economic growth — affecting the scale of new debt and the speed of deficit removal — have been challenged after the Chancellor of the Treasury was forced to revise earlier figures.
He said in his statement that the economy is likely to shrink by 4.75% this year—far more than the 3.5% decline predicted in April—while debt would be <0xC2><0xA3>3 billion higher than previously estimated.
"Missed opportunity"
Conservatives, who want to launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn of Labour’s “debt crisis,” said the planned <0xC2><0xA3>789 billion in debt over the next six years is untenable.
They added that the ministers have failed to present a credible plan on how to repay this and squeeze themselves “cynically” before difficult decisions until after the election – which must take place no later than June 2010.
"They didn't say anything significant about what they're going to do," said Shadow Finance Minister Philip Hammond. "They had their opportunity to do this, and they let them pass by."
"The significant announcements will only be made after the election, whoever wins them."
Deloitte Roger Bootle
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police be protected from future cuts, unlike the Conservatives’ proposals, which see the deficit capping coming faster and faster.
But the Liberal Democrats said that the money gained by the tax increases and spending halts is being used to cover next year’s spending, not to reduce the deficit, and therefore argue that the plans are “built on sand.”
BBC political editor Nick Robinson said that at the time of the announcements – like the above inflation adjustment for some disability pensions in next April – some would expose the Chancellor of the Treasury to the accusation of voting, as the money could simply be recovered next year.
Labour insists on providing extra aid when people most need it and that the situation be re-examined in September 2010.
"Hollow State"
Although the ministers have not announced any budget details beyond 2011, economists say the pressure on public spending will only come to bear in the medium term.
The recognized Institute for Tax Investigations said the Chancellor’s figures would mean strong cuts in many areas, possibly in the future as well in the areas of transport, higher education, science and defense.
"It only shifts the pain to later," his head Robert Chote said.
“The important announcements are only made after the election, whoever wins them,” added Roger Bootle, an economics consultant at Deloitte.
"This was just the hollow preliminary report, and the markets recognize that."
FBI investigates arrest of U.S. citizens in Pakistan
The FBI is investigating the arrest of five reported U.S. citizens on suspicion of extremist ties in Pakistan.
The men were arrested in a raid on a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern Punjab province, the American embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it is investigating whether these are the same men who were reported missing in the U.S. state of Virginia last month.
The U.S. State Department said they were also looking for information about the men.
Three of them are said to be of Pakistani descent, one is of Egyptian origin and the other has a Yemeni background.
"If they are American citizens, of course, we are very interested in the charges they are accused of and the circumstances under which they are detained," Ian Kelly said.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was informed of the arrests and was in touch with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to find out their identities and the purpose of their stay there, in case they are actually the missing students," she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men were arrested in a house belonging to the uncle of one of the students.
He said the local police had previously been interested in the house and that no charges had been filed against the arrested men.
The Reuters news agency reported that it refused to comment on the arrests, but she said the U.S. must "work more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan to eradicate the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and educate people."
The five students were reported missing by their families in Northern Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty convicts 'abuse' in Iran
According to a report by the human rights organisation Amnesty International, human rights in Iran are still as bad as they have been in the last 20 years.
The report details “abuse patterns” by the regime, both before and after the contested presidential elections in June.
One man quoted in the report said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, while another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran rejected earlier criticism of its human rights record.
Officials said such criticism was politically motivated.
Following the contested election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, thousands of people were arrested and dozens killed in Iran, leading to the largest street protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens received imprisonment and prosecutors said at least five people were sentenced to death.
BBC Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne, now in London, said that at the start of the protests, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the abuse allegations and ordered the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, there has been no tolerance on the part of the authorities for criticism, our correspondent said.
"False Confession"
Amnesty International cited the report of 26-year-old computer science student Ebrahim Mehtari, who said he was charged with "working with Facebook networks" and protesting against the election results.
"They often hit me in the face," he was quoted as saying.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, on my head ... they threatened me with death and they humiliated me".
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released on the street, still bleeding and half unconscious, Amnesty International said.
The defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some protesters who had been arrested after the election were tortured to death in prison in August and others raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the rape allegations, but admitted that abuses took place.
Amnesty International also called the case of a former prisoner who said he and 75 others had been detained in a container in a prison in Kahrizak for more than eight weeks.
Amnesty International acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and judicial authorities had set up a committee to investigate the post-election unrest and the government’s response to it, but that Amnesty International, the mandates and the powers of these bodies were unclear and the results obtained by the parliamentary committees had not been published.
The group said at least 90 people were arrested in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
Ski slope was set up in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a landmark in Bristol into a competitive slope.
The ski slope of this park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who fought for cash prizes.
At the top of the slope in Brandon Hill Park there was a short jump at the beginning of a 100 meter long slope.
Student John Hickman, who was studying medicine in his fourth year, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the slope, but it was also quite intimidating.
It is a great view with all the lights of the city glittering below.
He added: “There are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country here – some real talents.”
Prizes were awarded for the best tricks or tricks performed on the slope.
After the event on Thursday night, the snow is left to melt.
Still she and we
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters have voted for a ban on building minarets and concerns about the alleged Islamization of Europe are widespread, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a sound and well-considered report on whether Muslims can be integrated — and integrated — into one of Europe’s declared most secularized societies.
Some readers will read this new book out of admiration for the author's last work: "Why the French Don't Like Headscarves" (2006), an elegant and densely argued study of a dispute that the country shared and occupied over a decade and whose effects can still be felt today.
Bowen’s latest book offers a broader and bolder spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is really happening in the field.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now offer the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls "Islamic freedoms."
He’s a good listener, he retells debates between teachers and students about the issues that worries them the most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or a town hall (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it permissible for a Muslim to use an interest-oriented banking system to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly profane affairs, he claims, that make up everyday life, quite in contrast to the political dramas that the media employ.
The author recognizes a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a known name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, a Swiss-born Arab-Muslim scholar and academic.
This new generation is trying to open up the debate about how it is possible to be a good Muslim on the one hand and a good citizen on the other hand in a modern secular society.
They don’t have all the arguments on their side.
The conservatives are suspicious of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists who interviewed Bowen mostly disagree with their Salafist counterparts – supporters of purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia – who today show a small but influential presence among Europe’s Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But an agreement requires giving and taking on both sides.
He questions the extent to which French political decision-makers (and the intellectual elite who so passionately guard the separation of church and state) really feel committed to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may experience harsher treatment than Catholics, Protestants, and Jews, who in turn had to make their historic compromise with secular republicanism.
He recognizes a "tightening of the value screws" rather than a growing pragmatism.
After reading this book, one is inclined to say "Yes, but not yet".
The most desolate view in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other environmental region on Earth.
The ice that characterizes it melts at an alarming rate and takes life with it that can’t survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have gone into the recently open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now also writers in their wake.
Richard Ellis, an author and illustrator, draws a natural history of the icon of the north, the polar bear, in "On thin ice" (original title: "On thin ice").
Experienced in the complicated history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who have proven themselves in hunting for polar bears.
Admiral Nelson’s encounter with a polar bear as a brave 14-year-old seafarer who fought only with the rifle piston of his musketeer is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears caught swimming behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were brought to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance at the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 polar bears at a performance.
Even today, zoos still typically hold a millionth of the life area of a wild old animal. The climate is rarely suitable: The polar bear in Singapore became completely green from the algae that grow in the hollow hairs of its fur.

Ellis refers to the reports of other authors and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters pose for the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and sled-driving Inuit use powerful assault rifles to trap their prey.
Ironically, in the waters in the north of these two hunting nations, the ice will last the longest.
In his new book "After the Ice", Alun Anderson, a former editor of the science magazine New Scientist, provides a clear and disturbing description of the science of the Arctic and a compelling insight into how the future might evolve.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of the changes.
This is not due to a lack of explanation.
The pioneering journeys of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and early 20th century for the first time allowed the swirling of the pack ice to be guessed.
In the Cold War, submarines measured the shifting ridges while underwater.
A useful addition are satellite surveys and the large-scale deployment of measuring probes on icebergs, but still much is achieved by fearless people camping outside in the cold.
Anderson takes a look at the peculiar, tiny world of the influx system within the Arctic ice formed by saltwater troughs compressed during freezing.
But from the bear on the ice to the microscopic wonders in the ice, everyone is threatened by the summer ice that is expected to pass between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months ... it could be us"
Marines were among the 6,000 who laid down wreaths in Arlington
De'Angello Robinson traveled by bus for seven hours to lay a single wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who undertook the journey from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National Cemetery in Arlington to decorate graves, the day was a tribute to the men and women in whose footsteps they stepped.
In a few months, wherever we are brought back from, we could be," Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I wish someone would do the same for me, so I try to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered on Saturday morning to lay wreaths on the graves of veterans in several sections of the Arlington Cemetery.
Morrill Worcester, owner of the Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, founded this tradition in 1992 when he and some others decided to decorate several hundred graves at the Arlington Cemetery.
It’s now an 18-year-old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, who make this journey every year, stop in various cities along the way to conduct events dedicated to people in the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which extended the event to other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 wreaths on the graves at Arlington Cemetery, in areas at the Pentagon, on the graves of Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, at Battery Park in New York, and at the United Airlines Flight 93 Memorial site in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
The Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 for the purchase and transport of the wreaths for the second time.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a deceased professional soldier.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said, this is her way of giving back to those who made sacrifices.
She said this is a small contribution on how we can support civilians with our soldiers.
It’s like visiting a family burial site.
Wrapped in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers wandered across the extensive lawns and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers were targeted by older graves from World War I and World War II and the Vietnam War, as these are not visited as often as the newer graves, according to the organizers.
The mood was cheerful, children were playing and couples held hands while carrying the fresh pine branches to the graying tombstones.
Each round wreath was dark green with a small red loop attached to the upper part.
Section 60, which is located nearby and where mainly veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, remained almost quiet.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 wreaths to decorate this section, but the gloomy mood of current wars filled this area.
Individuals wept openly, others prayed, and families and friends held each other in the icy air.
Some read out loud the names carved in stone, while others bowed down to small black-and-white space cards that had been put in the wet mud for those whose tombstones had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who shed bitter tears in front of her son’s grave.
She drove 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the tomb of Naval Infrastructure Sergeant David Shane Spicer, who fell in battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free... my son paid for it, she said.
“If I haven’t been around for a long time, I want someone to remember him.”
U.S. government contractor arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a US government contractor who sold mobile phones and notebook computers in the country, foreign ministry officials said on Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for clients such as USAID, the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
U.S. consular officials in Havana are trying to gain access to the detainee who was arrested on December 5.
The special charges have not yet been made public, although under Cuban law a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be arrested for almost anything, under the accusation of "threatening".
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, which include light protests and critical writings, carry a risk of arrest.
Counter-government graffiti and statements are considered a serious crime.
Cuba has a growing blogger community led by popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who often describes how she and her husband are being persecuted and attacked by government officials.
Sánchez has repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country to accept prizes, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor is likely to increase tensions between the Castro Brother’s communist government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which had sought a “slow” approach to improving relations with the island.
The news of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times on Friday night.
The new U.S. policy emphasizes that the United States will make a return if the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and creating more room for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and coveted products in a country where the average salary of a government employee is $15 per month.
The Cuban government has only allowed ordinary citizens to buy a mobile phone since this year, they are mainly used to send text messages, as a 15-minute phone call would cost a day’s wage.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is accessible in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and at some government offices, such as universities.
Cubans who want to log in often have to report their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
In Cuba, the arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few U.S. citizens imprisoned in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berbena, the press spokeswoman for the U.S. Representative of Interest in Havana.
Berbena said she could not provide any further information on the arrest.
The arrest and imprisonment are clearly wrong.
An activity that would be legal in any other free society - the supply of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the Human Rights Watch group, which recently released a hard report on freedom in Cuba entitled "New Castro, same Cuba", a hint at the appointment of Raul Fi's older brother as leader of the country.
Vivanco said the defendants were very often arrested, convicted and imprisoned within a day.
He said that probably any solution would be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just at the time when both countries are moving toward more dialogue.
Pakistani government officials reveal plan to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities discovered Saturday a supposedly leading head of a conspiracy aimed at sending five men from Northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill US soldiers, and said they hope this case could help uncover an extensive network of terrorist recruits searching the Internet for radicalized young men.
Investigators said they were looking for an opaque insurgent, known as Saifullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after finding them because one of them had made comments about terrorist attacks on the Internet video site YouTube.
Saifullah became the leader of these men after arriving in Pakistan and tried to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan’s tribal belt, which is home to Al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official informed about the matter said on Saturday that Saifullah could not convince al-Qaeda leaders that the men are not part of a CIA conspiracy to undermine the terrorist network.
As a result, they were held for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the inhospitable mountains in the northwest, which have become a terrorist refuge.
They were seen as part of a covert operation.
That’s why they were rejected, the government official said, who wanted to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The government official said the men were by no means discouraged and continued to try to get the right recommendations to gain access to al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested by Pakistani prison authorities.
The case of the five men – who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI – underscores the crucial role of recruiters in identifying future terrorists and, perhaps more importantly, in deciding who is trustworthy.
Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, U.S. intelligence has made it a matter of utmost urgency to house human assets within Al Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as gatekeepers who do not let in those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and those who could be spies.
American potential recruits are undergoing a special audit by A Kaida, analysts said.
However, due to their potential access to U.S. targets and their propaganda value, they are also seen as tremendously attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst for the US-based NEFA Foundation, said that terrorist groups have also become much more cautious about who they allow access in recent years, as U.S. intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruitment methods.
“If you’re trying to get someone into these groups, what better way to go than following the recruitment model that so many have already followed?”
The model is now much more based on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of protesters call for climate "action" in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of protesters marched through the streets here on Saturday, demanding more bold action on climate protection from the negotiators at the city’s Bella Congress Center.
Protesters said that 100,000 people had joined the event, while police estimates were more likely to be about 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists set fire to small explosive devices near some government buildings in downtown.
On a day when little happened in the UN-sponsored climate negotiations, thousands of activists wandered through the city with banners that said in English "There is no Planet B" and one in Spanish that declared "The Earth says "enough".
Some stars joined the protest, such as the Danish model, photographer Helena Christensen, who said that travel to Peru, her mother’s birth country, makes her aware of the heartbreaking problems the country is facing due to the already noticeable effects of climate change.
That’s part of why I decided to take part in the big demonstration – to pass on the word and appeal to world leaders to achieve a fair, ambitious and binding agreement,” she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be done now and there is no way around it.
Police stopped the protesters from getting too close to the Bella Center and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because they were either masked or carrying pocket knives.
Under Danish law, these actions are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to a spectator who did not want to be named, as he is involved in the climate negotiations, masked protesters in black clothing detonated several explosive devices near Copenhagen’s main canal, where several ministries are located.
They threw them near the buildings, he said, adding that they began as lightning missiles, but were then followed by "a few major explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered in front of TV screens to watch the demonstration all afternoon.
But the protest has apparently not reached the awareness of key officials, such as Su Wie, China’s chief climate negotiator.
When asked if he thinks the demonstration would have a constructive effect on international considerations, he replied in English: "That's something I wasn't even aware of."
He then went on in Mandarin and said, "Because the venue is big, I can't hear what's happening outside."
He noted that it depends on the perspective of the individual whether the demonstration would hurt or help.
It shows the concentration of the general public and various sectors on the issue of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they interfere with the negotiations or the freedom of other people."
Examination data show stubborn racial divide
The math performance testimonies last week were welcome good news for public schools in Washington D.C.
Although the Washington district is still far behind the country’s schools that produce peak performance, evidence shows that fourth and eighth graders have made faster progress over the past two years than cities that include Atlanta, Chicago, and New York.
But what is included in the latest figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is the persistent performance gap between African-American and white students, both at local and national levels.
The average score of white fourth graders from Washington D.C. rose from 262 to 270 in the last two years (on a scale of 500), but the score of their African-American peers rose only three points from 209 to 212.
The performance gap actually rose from 53 to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of African-American eighth graders remained basically the same, falling by a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average score of white students was not included in the test data because the sample size was not large enough.
The picture over a six-year period is also not encouraging.
The gap that separated white and black fourth graders in 2003 when the first NAEP was recorded in this district was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
And although the score that children of both groups have achieved has grown during this period, the difference has hardly decreased with now 58 points.
Some of the district’s education advocates expressed their concern last week that the results celebrated by school chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and Democratic mayor Adrian M. Fenty were largely driven by white students who are already powerful children anyway.
This suggests that we raised the overall score by treating those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, a board member of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit group that advocates for education equality in Washington D.C.
I’m not jumping up and down for a span of two or three points, said Democratic Washington City Council member Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth grade of Eaton elementary school.
Brown, a frequent critic of Rhee’s management style, said the message of exam scores is that the city’s middle schools urgently need attention.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs, I respect that.
What scares me, however, is that we don’t spend the time and energy that we would have to devote to our middle school.
Rhee said the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of low-performance students.
This fall, for example, some teachers are being trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at students in the upper grades of primary and middle school who have not mastered basic reading skills at the beginning of their school career and who are significantly behind their classmates.
Everyday mathematics, a curriculum that brings from kindergarten to sixth grade games and lifelike experiences, has been brought to Washington under former senior school inspector Clifford Janey, and this curriculum is attributed to some of the NAEP progress reported last week.
I think we need to continue to work to bring the best measures to the benefit of students who are below grade level, Rhee said.
Others say the NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system while continuing to provide the additional money and resources for the low-performance schools needed to narrow the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, who is investigating urban exam results.
The conventional remedy is to direct its resources and management reforms to the schools located in the poorest areas of Washington, D.C.
The objective could produce political repercussions that work against this important item on the agenda.
The weakness, of course, as with other city school inspectors, is that they are trying to keep the white and black middle class.
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the neighborhoods so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive excellent public education.
Janey, now a school inspector in Newark, said in an interview this week that one of the most significant elements in closing the performance gap is to extend the traditional public school year, which is currently 180 days in Washington, to compete with charter schools.
One has to raise the school year to nearly 200 days to have the power to change, Janey, who came to an agreement with his teachers’ union last year on 185 days a year, which he sees as “a milestone” on the way to a bigger boost in the next contract.
Higher education for more people than future prospects
The bus reaches Gettysburg College with a loud whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, gets out and blinks for a moment at the sight of the white columns, the brick facades and the emerald green lawn.
Graciela’s parents barely finished high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was recovered in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Their attitude and that of the other eighth graders of the group exploring Gettysburg, where lessons cost $38,690 a year, was that of an awe-inspiring visitor rather than that of an enthusiastic future student.
"Yes, here I will be soon!" cried Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the leader announced that they had now entered the building for natural sciences.
"Wow, really?" she thoughtfully said when she was told of the school's low professor-to-student ratio.
College in Pennsylvania was the 7th that the kids visited on their three-day tour and now they have fully absorbed the intended message: the question is not whether to go to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is growing concern about the large number of children of Hispanic immigrants born in the U.S. who do not finish high school or become pregnant as a teenager, but on the other hand, there are also hundreds of thousands who receive the college education necessary to ascend to the middle class.
In fact, one in five of this “second generation” of Hispanic Americans graduates from college – which is a remarkable feat as many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the United States without completing high school.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they show the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the country’s workforce.
Those who examine powerful children say they often have a natural affinity for school and a drive to success inherent in them.
Many of them also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But counseling programs also play a big role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to college, especially if those efforts persist over a long period of time.
If you look at low-income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them find their way through the system, then a single measure at some point will not solve the problem either, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California in Davis who studied Hispano-American students.
We need to think about providing a supportive network for these children from preschool to high school.
The federal program that had funded Graciela’s college tour is a useful example.
It’s known as GEAR UP—A Gang Up—and provides more than $300 million a year for local school systems to launch college preparation programs that start when low-income students are in middle school and continue running until they graduate high school.
According to the U.S. Department of Education, the program has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, of whom more than 60% have gone to college.
Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum Signs Contracts with 10 Foreign Oil Companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has been able to force major oil companies to rebuild its damaged infrastructure in two auctions closed on Saturday.
The 10 contracts signed with foreign oil companies by the Iraqi oil ministry suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are willing to play an important role in renovating the Iraqi oil industry, which has been paralyzed by war and economic sanctions for decades.
American companies could only post shares in two of the 10 auctioned fields for themselves.
Seven American companies had paid for participating in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only company that made a bid has pulled the shorter one.
Two American companies were able to sign contracts for fields auctioned in June.
The thinly-seeded representatives of American oil multis at the opening of the Iraqi oil industry surprised the analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after 6 years of war, and instead of US companies, Asian and European are leading the way, said Ruba Husari, the editor of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
There will be no more offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns underscored by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday and political instability caused by the withdrawal of the U.S. military have likely discouraged U.S. oil companies from engaging more heavily in Iraq, which holds the world’s third-largest proven crude oil reserves, analysts said.
US companies were disadvantaged in some cases because competitors, especially the Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower wage costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not have to account for shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies to sign contracts with the ministry.
Larger U.S. companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which maintain close relations with the Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum and have been assisted with technical advice in recent years, have gone empty.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation has bid for more contracts than any other company and could go home with large packages of contracts for two major fields.
We all know, Assam Jihad, the spokesman for the oil ministry, said that China is on its way to becoming one of the greats of the world economy as well as a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company will be able to compete with its competitors and will meet its obligations to Iraq.
Pre-selected bid companies made bids, which were then compared to the fee per barrel of oil that the ministry was willing to pay to increase the output of each field beyond the current level.
Al Qaeda's top planner apparently killed in Pakistan
In an apparent U.S. missile attack along the Pakistani border with Afghanistan, a top al-Qaeda deployment planner is said to have been killed this week, U.S. counter-terrorism officials reported on Friday.
This, if confirmed, would be the second deadly attack on a high-ranking terrorist organization this autumn.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arabs who, according to US sources and Pakistani authorities, were reportedly killed by a number of rockets that hit their vehicle near the city of Miran Shah in the province of North Waziristan on Tuesday.
Local authorities reported that the missiles were fired by a drone type used by the CIA in Pakistan’s outlaw tribal belt.
They drove in a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, an official from a Pakistani civilian intelligence agency from Miran Shah said by phone.
Locals, suspected of being among the militants, ran to the site and quickly took over all that was left of the "completely destroyed bodies".
Local authorities were unable to confirm the identity of the victims, but two U.S. counterterrorism officials cited indefinite evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali has been described as the leading military planner of Al Qaeda, who led operations of terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in conspiracies around the world, noted a senior official who wanted to remain anonymous, pointing to the delicate nature of US airstrikes on Pakistani soil.
Assuming its central role as a given, this included planning attacks against the US and Europe.
He accepted strategic instructions from al-Qaeda’s top leaders and implemented them in operational planning for possible terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said Somali had risen rapidly in the al-Qaeda hierarchy and maintained best links with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to some Americans, the second official said, but this in no way reduces the danger he posed to us and our allies.
If his death was confirmed, Somali would be the second leading al-Qaeda or Taliban leader to be killed since September when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area and three other top activists.
The rate of CIA drone attacks has declined since the summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a non-profit website, from an average of six operations per month to two.
The decline may be based on improved tactics by terrorist groups that have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability while brutally killing suspected informants, the site reported.
Leading UN envoy to Kabul resigns
UN chief envoy Kai Eide said on Friday he would resign in March, ending a stormy term clouded by allegations of widespread corruption in the UN-backed Afghan presidential election.
The Obama administration has decided to send an additional 30,000 U.S. soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he supports the troop increase, but he also expressed concerns that the U.S. timetable for the military withdrawal, which is due to begin in 18 months, could cause other NATO governments to withdraw their armed forces.
"We need to accelerate the build-up of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to Afghans that they can trust the international community," Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
Commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian aid workers to assist in the political transformation of Afghanistan.
The increase in troops on the military side must correspond to an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning from office, but only fulfilling an agreement made in March 2008 with his family to stay in Kabul for only two years.
He said he wanted to notify the UN.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon will now be redirected so that he has time to arrange for a replacement.
What I've said is that he's better off starting to look for a successor, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between my predecessor’s departure and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban has begun searching for a replacement.
The UN representatives say that he has considered the Swedish-Italian-born Staffan di Mistura, who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad and the French Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who previously led UN peacekeeping operations.
Oath’s position in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the country’s presidential elections and covering up evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide dismissed all the accusations, but he also said that Galbraith's accusations - who was fired - "unquestionably harmed the mission because there was already a great deal of skepticism regarding international interference in the election."
Eide said he recommended the appointment of a leading civilian representative to coordinate the relief efforts of the U.S.-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged that the UN leadership allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries to donate to the Afghan mission, saying that this would strengthen their confidence in the proper use of their money.
Eide expressed his disappointment at the limitation of his forces in Afghanistan, saying that the cumbersome UN hiring regulations have undermined his ability to bring in capable people.
The UN rules are designed in such a way that since May, he said, I could hire only one person.
This is disastrous and should not continue.
US Secretary of Defense Gates: Iran Must Expect Additional Sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran for not taking part in talks on its nuclear plans.
Gates spoke to a group of about 300 U.S. soldiers in northern Iraq during a 7-day trip through the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, denigrating the prospect of a military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
There are no good options in Iran, he said in response to a soldier’s question about the likelihood of such a development.
"One of the things that is on my mind, if we have learned anything from Iraq in the last six years, is the war's own unpredictability."
The Obama administration is considering a sanctions package aimed at Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average Iranian.
He said that a "package of positive and negative incentives" is needed "to convince the Iranian government that it is actually less protected with nuclear weapons" because "your people will suffer tremendously" under the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the US government joined European leaders in warning that Iran must face "credible" consequences if its nuclear program fails to meet the demands of the UN Security Council and its nuclear surveillance agency, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran continues to claim that nuclear technology knowledge should only be acquired for peaceful purposes.
At talks in Geneva on October 1, Iran said it would resume talks on limiting its nuclear program and would renounce a substantial portion of its stockpile of enriched uranium in exchange for much-needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The U.S. government has pushed for this kind of agreement to build trust between the two parties and gain time for negotiations.
However, Iran seems to have abandoned negotiations on the provisional agreements since then -- in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership disagrees on whether to commit to the United States.
That Iran has simply left the international community in terms of some of the proposals it had already agreed to in early October has, frankly, brought the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, together in a way they have never been in connection with important additional sanctions on Iran, Gates said.
President Obama has set Dec. 31 as the deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before pursuing other options, including those that Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “suppressive sanctions.”
In a statement issued in New York, the Iranian representation at the United Nations condemned what it called “baseless and unfounded allegations” by some members of the Security Council on Iranian nuclear activities on Thursday, saying that they are ready to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers “to reach an appropriate long-term solution.”
Gates, who was scheduled to return to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before flying to Iraq’s oil-rich Kurdish region to meet with soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish authorities in Irbil.
Tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq remain high, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and the distribution of public revenue.
Gates urged both sides to lower the conflict potential to prevent delays in U.S. plans to reduce U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
U.S. officials quoted Gates as saying to Masud Barzani, president of the Kurdish regional government: “We will maintain your security, prosperity and autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave you."
A change of course in the ageing China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters giving them lectures that "Mother Earth is too tired to entertain more children" and "A baby more means a grave more."
These lessons they learned so well that, as government officials in Shanghai, who, due to the low birth rate and the ageing population this summer, suddenly began to change course and encourage young couples to have more than one child, their answer was immediate and definitive: "No way."
We have already invested all our time and energy in a child.
For a second child, nothing is left, said Wang, 31, a HR manager with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, which has produced two generations of notoriously fat, deformed single children, affectionately called “little emperors,” a population crisis is stirring up in the country.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 at the time this policy came into force, the UN says.
Department of Population, while the number of the population aged 60 and older is expected to explode from 16.7 percent of the population by 2050 to 31.1 percent, far above the global average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is stronger in rich coastal cities with educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and older people accounted for nearly 22 percent of Shanghai’s reported residents, while the birth rate was below one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai City Population and Family Planning Commission, said that couples in procreative age must have babies to "help reduce the ratio of aging population and alleviate the labour shortage of the future."
Shanghai will soon be "as old -- but not as rich -- as developed countries, like Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual relaxation
Enshrined in the country’s 1978 constitution, China’s one-child policy is arguably the most controversial decree introduced by the ruling Communist Party to this day.
Couples who violate this policy face enormous fines -- up to three times their annual salary in some regions -- and discrimination in their workplaces.
Chinese officials have attributed to this policy that the critical use of natural land resources could be avoided, whereas human rights representatives have condemned abuses in enforcing the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women who have already had a child to aborte.
Many couples also had sex-selective abortions performed, creating an unnaturally high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, government officials for the population have gradually weakened their stance on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule -- including city dwellers, members of ethnic minorities, and cases where both husband and wife were single children -- and in 2007 the tone of many harsh slogans was mitigated.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at the University of Beijing, said that government officials have recently even discussed more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children with a single partner.
Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to promote more births in July.
Posters that taught families to have only one child were replaced almost overnight by guidelines detailing who is eligible for a second child and how to apply for approval.
The city administration has sent municipal employees and volunteers for family planning to visit couples at home and push information sheets under the doors.
She also asked to provide psychological and financial advice for those who have more than one child.
The response was not exactly encouraging, family planning representatives said.
Disappointing reaction
Although officials from a rural small town in the outskirts of Shanghai said that there was a boom in applications from couples who want a second child after the campaign started, the urban districts, on the other hand, report no change.
In the municipality of Huinan with a population of 115,000, as an example, only four to five applications are still received per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say the expected number of births in the city for 2010 will still be around 165,000 despite the campaign -- slightly higher than 2009, but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of the Shanghai municipality of Caolu, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
They want to give their first one the best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would like to have two children and that this is legally permitted.
But they, like many Chinese, only have a small amount of government health and life insurance.
Without a social network, they say, this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West mistakenly view the one-child policy as a human rights issue, said Yang, a civil engineer whose wife is pregnant with her first child in her seventh month.
Yes, we are being robbed of the possibility of having more than one child.
The problem is not just politics.
The problem is money.
Other couples give psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, the HR manager, said she only wants a child because she was also a single child. "We were the center of the family and used to have everyone take care of us.
We’re not used to taking care of others and we don’t really want to.”
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old who owns a translation company, said it bluntly.
For middle-class parents with a double career, which lowers the birth rate, he said, it’s all about being successful and you have to be selfish for it.
The age group of today’s 20- to 39-year-olds grew up watching their parents struggle during the early days of the Chinese capitalism experiment and they don’t want such a life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child, he said, poses huge demands on the time of the parents.
A mother must give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there's the space question -- "You have to rebuild your apartment" -- and life planning -- "When the child is 9 months old, you must already have a resume ready for the best preschools."
Most of his friends are willing to go through this once, Chen said, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to reach a higher standard of living, he said.
We do not want to make too many sacrifices.
UN Group Drafts Plan to Reduce Emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- which has so far been characterized by wild poses and mutual accusations -- has re-established a focus on Friday with the publication of a document that records an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gases for the next 40 years, with the industrialized nations having to bear the greatest burdens in the near future.
The text, which could provide the basis for a definitive political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases, has highlighted both the remaining obstacles and the way forward.
But it was seen as important progress in a negotiation that runs out of time as next week more than 100 top politicians from all over the world will arrive in Copenhagen.
The text, formulated by a specially created UN working group, is silent about the amount of money that rich countries should give to poor countries so that they can cope with global warming in the short and long term.
It also offers a range of options for key issues, including how industrialized and emerging economies can limit their carbon emissions and how high the upper limit of global temperature rise should be that policy makers would support.
The process is given a great deal of flexibility, according to John Coequyt, senior representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, summarized a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what UN climate change leader Yvo de Boer called “the big picture.”
It shows the outline of a possible agreement in which the developed nations would jointly reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020, compared to the 1990 limits, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent in the same period.
Together, the countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Community has also boosted Friday’s talks by promising to provide $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the effects of climate change – from mastering floods and droughts to preventing deforestation.
Friday nevertheless brought the same verbal fireworks that had determined the talks last week.
U.S. Special Envoy for Climate Change Todd Stern has rejected formulations calling for mandatory greenhouse gas emission reductions for developed countries, compared to voluntary reductions for major emerging economies, if these are not funded by the industrialized nations.
This move announced that the Obama administration is running a tougher line with China than the Bush administration did not even two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without major emerging countries rising up and taking action, Stern, who also complained that the text does not go far enough to ensure that the cuts could be confirmed by outsiders as well.
Stern made his statement an hour after China’s Deputy Foreign Secretary He Yafei’s statement, stating that the leading American climate negotiator either lacked “reason” or was “highly irresponsible” by him, saying earlier this week that the United States would not help China financially to cope with global warming.
Due to the future economic direction of the major world powers at stake, breaking lines have opened up both within the industrialized nations and between the industrialized nations and the emerging markets.
The current struggle relates equally to the saving of individual economies, as well as the saving of the planet, with China and the United States fighting for their corresponding commitments, while poorer countries claim that the two dozen most influential countries would ignore the scientific necessity to take bolder action.
Ricardo Ulate, a Costa Rican delegate, said it is not surprising that the big powers are fighting to determine who should bear the cost of curbing greenhouse gas emissions, as even affected countries have moved to act more aggressively to hold the countries with very high greenhouse gas levies accountable for their actions.
This is clearly a game that will lead to a new economic hegemony, according to Ulate, who also serves as a regional climate change advisor for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries most exposed to the effects of climate change stated that they would continue to fight for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although leading participants say the talks will lead at best to a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island Countries, with 43 members, presented a 24-page draft treaty early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the small island states' offensive "exerts political pressure on the entire political process," partly because they are now united and demand action from emerging markets, such as China and India.
The talks got a new urgency as the delegates focused on the fact that most open issues still need to be clarified before the arrival of the leaders in order to reach an agreement.
High-ranking representatives, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister, got off their planes and rushed through the Bella Center corridors to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences to mark claims being negotiated during next week.
The sheer scale of the gathering -- 13,000 people going in and out of the convention center every day, guitar-playing activists hosting nighttime shows mocking the countries they think are betraying and selling, and drafting contracts hand-to-hand rather than email -- is already a challenge.
The intensity is only just building up: Almost all the important ministers are here now and from Wednesday 60 government leaders will be in Copenhagen.
We’re coming to the upper league,” said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president of global politics at Conservation International.
The heavyweights are coming.
Britain’s first 225 km/h fast train redefines the feeling of Monday
Monday morning at 5 a.m., a pipe will pierce the darkness to announce a train departure that represents a revolution in traffic in the UK.
The first high-speed commuter train in the country will travel 225 km/h from Ashfort, Kent, to London St. Pancras and travel 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lady Kelly Holmes will then board the first Javelin commuter service from London to Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport.
He hopes that the new service will eventually connect Britain to an international rail network of fast, reliable trains and connect the major metropolitan areas of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become vibrant commuter cities, working hours would be radically reduced, and switching from plane and car to rail would reduce national carbon emissions and traffic jams on the roads.
In theory, the three major parties believe in this vision.
But the many billions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable planning battle, and fears of environmental damage could still brake the British high-speed rail.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company founded in January to submit a feasibility study to the government, will hand Lord Adonis the report on December 30, according to the Times.
As a result, it receives a detailed route map of the next planned stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new railway line, which will connect London to the West Midlands, will pass urban areas and places where the environmental impact is controversial, with a span of five meters.
In the open grounds, the plan will showcase the concept within a distance of 25 meters from the final track.
HS2 will also create three options for a larger, north-leading high-speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred suggested option is a Y-shaped route in which a single high-speed route would lead to the West Midlands.
The route would split in or near Birmingham and one branch west of the Pennines would lead to Manchester and Scotland and another northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the best working option," said a railroad insider.
Upon completion, the journey time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first sub-route, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow travellers to cover the London-Birmingham route in 49 minutes, compared to just over an hour today.
The designs offered the trains the opportunity to travel at a speed of 400 km/h, making the British rail network the fastest in Europe.
The first route was planned so that 400-metre-long trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people can travel on it.
Up to 18 trains per hour could operate on the London-Birmingham route.
This, in turn, would mean that a terminal in London would be needed, where 20,000 passengers per hour could be processed.
Given the spatial constraints in the capital, it is expected that an existing railway station would be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Railway experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he believes this plan should be continued or not, but the lengthy public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision will not be made until after the parliamentary elections.
But even if it sets the wheels in motion, the rail network must be built in sections.
The trains would first have to switch from the high-speed lines to existing rail lines in the north of Birmingham, which would keep the journey time between London and Scotland at more than three hours.
This is considered to be a decisive knock-off point in order to ensure a change from the aircraft to the railway, a guideline for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers Arrive for Mortgage for <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 Orange of a Conservative
Alan Duncan, the leading Conservative lower house member, has billed the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orangery he had built himself in his home in his constituency.
The party's prison spokesman, who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that lower house members had to live "on lean rations," has raised his mortgage by <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 to build an oak half-timbered plant to his second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge the taxpayer the additional interest income, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
The House of Commons officials approved the motions at the time and they were also not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who is conducting a review of the spending of the members of the House of Commons. Last night, Duncan said the motions could not have been "never cleaner or more understandable".
Duncan, one of the richest members of the House of Commons, owns a two-storey house in a village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses have reached a purchase price of almost one million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living room and dining room, but the Fees Office, a House of Commons spending checkpoint, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year, he cultivated a winter garden, which is referred to as "orangery" in the plans.
Neighbors described it as a "glass house for entertainment".
Duncan was also not prompted to comment on increased borrowing during a recent inquiry into his previous mortgage contracts by the Committee on Standards and Privileges.
The committee acquitted him last month after an examination of his spending from the breach of the rules.
In 2004, Duncan transferred the collateral for a mortgage of <0xC2><0xA3>271,406 (<0xC2><0xA3>300,000) from his London home to his constituency house, which he had bought in 1991, a year before his election as a Member of Parliament.
Documents published this week show that Duncan was reimbursed about <0xC2><0xA3>1,400 per month as a mortgage interest until March last year.
In April, his claims rose to more than <0xC2><0xA3>1,800 (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2,000) per month.
The interest rate of Duncan’s RBS mortgage has not changed during this time, suggesting that the overall increase was used to finance the <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>85,000) cash take-up.
The normal stepless RBS mortgage rate dropped from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, where it still stands.
The latest documents published by the House of Commons show that Duncan continued to claim his right to 1,250 pounds (1,400 euros) per month this May.
Duncan lost his post as opposition leader of the House of Commons in September after an undercover reporter filmed him as he said after the spending scandal that members of parliament would live “on lean rations.”
"Basically, working for the state means living on lean rations and being treated like shit."
He said, "I have spent my money on my garden and claim a very small portion, measured by what belongs.
And I could have demanded the whole damn sum, but I don't."
The MP, a millionaire from his previous career as an oil wholesaler, was attacked for the first time in May because of his spending when it became clear that he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden before he clarified with the Fees Office that this “could be viewed as an exaggerated demand.”
An activist dug a hole in Duncan’s lawn in the form of a pound mark in protest after it became known that he had claimed 4,000 pounds (4,500 euros) over three years.
When questioned about the raised mortgage last night, Duncan said, "This had been approved by both the Fees Office, and subsequently by Legg to raise value."
He added: “There is no debate about dodging and winding through or bending the rules or the like.
Everything is perfectly transparent and moves strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It couldn't be cleaner and clearer."
Come all of you believers to admire Brighton’s Beach Cabins Advent Calendar
Beach huts in Brighton have found a new life for the winter months as an interactive Advent calendar.
"Beyond", an alternative church group that encourages spiritual discoveries through creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their huts for each December day with Christmas songs as a theme.
The event started on December 1st and visitors were allowed to watch the newest hut every day from 5:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. with free mulled wine and traditional mince pies, filled with dried fruits pastries.
The Christmas songs selected so far are "I saw three ships", "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first No<0xC3><0xAB>l", where the hat decoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is a voluntary clergyman of the Chichester Diocese and head of Beyond.
He said: “We want to make religion more important for people in a post-Christian society.
Why do we, as a church, expect people to come into a strange old building? I think the church should go to people and organize enthusiastic celebrations.
The idea for the beach hut advent calendar started as a conversation with some friends at dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastic creative and vibrant place and we try to express this through our spirituality."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world for the climate.
Tens of thousands of people around the world and in Copenhagen demonstrated on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against climate warming, where the police have made several hundred arrests.
At least thirty thousand people, according to police, one hundred thousand, according to the organizers, have marched in the cold of the Danish capital, on the margins of the United Nations climate conference, which should lead to a conclusion by Friday, which could enter into force in 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish chairman of the climate conference, increasing mobilization in the world for the climate contributes to what these demonstrations illustrate that the “political price” of a failure in Copenhagen would be very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place shortly after the train passed by, when a group of 300 protesters, all dressed in black, had smashed windows with paving stones and hammers, an AFP journalist noted.
Anti-disturbance police officers intervened immediately and without consideration.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people, in your opinion mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, this extremely violent fragmentation group that has already made itself famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, has harshly criticized the conditions under which hundreds of militant supporters had been arrested "without distinction", and has underlined that about a hundred of them "were still held in the streets on Saturday evening", despite the extreme cold with handcuffs and inseated position.
The rather peaceful train went from Parliament to the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without attempting to enter.
A stage was installed to welcome the speakers for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
The majority of the protesters came by buses and trains from the major European cities, but also many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, as well as some Africans were present.
About 3,000 people, most of them wearing sky-blue raincoats, have made a first run in Copenhagen in the morning as they have followed the call of the Friends of the Earth to form "blue tides" for the "climate justice".
Today, we are taking to the streets to demand reparation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, said Lidy Nacpil, Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot go on like this and say to ourselves: we have time, said Angelique Kidjo, singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that dry out, watercourses where you can walk, like it has never been the case in the past.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, founded in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of globalization critics has approached the environmental organizations.
European MEP José Bové, figure of the globalization critics, announced that he came to Copenhagen to link "climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no difference between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world."
The Asia-Pacific region, where many islands are located, which are particularly endangered as a result of warming, has given the start to the demonstrations.
Around 50,000 people took to the streets in Australia, according to the organizers.
In Manila, there were a few hundred people, mostly students, who marched in red and hoisted bandanas in which they boasted the solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, but also in Canada, marches of a few hundred protesters took place to demand an energetic approach to climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network "350" have gathered a few hundred people, namely in Paris, in Marseille (south), in Lille (north), in Bordeaux (west) and in Lyon (east).
A few people gathered in Geneva.
The separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, Georgia denounces that this is a "strike".
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, a little more than a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist Georgian territory as independent, Tbilisi denounced the "stroke".
Approximately 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election following the August 2008 Russian-Georgian War for control of the South Ossetian territory, another Georgian secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations are closed at 5 p.m. GMT.
Voter turnout was about 58% a few hours before the closure of the polling station, according to the Abkhazian Electoral Commission.
The first preliminary results should be announced on the night of Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including former president Serguei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemns the election.
These elections are a farce.
On the other hand, Georgian President Mikheil Saakachvili regrets that Abkhazia is now under Russian occupation, his press spokeswoman Manana Manjgaladze said.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this area with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world perceives it as part of Georgia, which is illegally occupied by Russia.
After separating from Georgia during the conflict of 1992-1993, with several thousand people dying, Abkhazia wants to prove by this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claims to have voted for Mr. Bagapch, has explained.
She was one of the electors who went to vote for a polling station located in a school in the capital Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is at the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscapes on the Black Sea.
Large signs showing Bagapch alongside the Russian president and head of government, Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are everywhere in this small area that has 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, which is located in the east of the country, the district chief, Beslan Archba, has prepared a warm welcome to the Russian representatives who have come to oversee the elections.
We, the people of Abkhazia, are grateful, he said at a small celebration, as an allusion to Moscow’s support, especially regarding the decision to recognize Abkhazia’s independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, replied Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, raising a glass of vodka.
The opposition, for its part, represented by the former vice-president and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, has criticized the agreements made with Moscow last year, as the one in which Abkhazia leaves Russia in control of the railway for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims to support neither the current government nor the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is needed to win the election.
If none of the candidates reaches this threshold, a second round of elections must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: Demos Worldwide, Incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people around the world demonstrated on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding treaty from the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where the police, at any time ready for action, arrested about 700 people on the edge of an important demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to police, one hundred thousand, according to the organizers, have demonstrated in the afternoon cold in the Danish capital, which by December 18, welcomes delegates from 193 countries in search of an agreement to enter into force on January 1, 2013.
From Parliament, the peaceful train marched towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations take place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the center and did not attempt to invade.
A stage was set up to welcome the speakers for an evening of candlelight, with the participation of former South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the train passed, a group of protesters who were all dressed in black and armed with bricks and hammers began to smash discs, an AFP journalist noted.
Anti-disturbance policemen immediately surrounded you and intervened recklessly by throwing some of them on the ground.
Police have announced that between 600 and 700 people have been arrested and have made it clear that they are mainly members of the "Blacks Blocs", these extremely violent fragmented groups that have already made themselves famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
In the evening, during the incidents, where, according to police, about twenty people were provisionally arrested, a police officer suffered an injury to the chin due to a pavement stone.
"We have the extreme groups under control," said police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen, while the law enforcement helicopters circled in the air.
Most of the protesters who arrived by train or by private vehicle from major German cities, from London, Amsterdam or Milan, were Europeans.
However, there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, and Africans.
Almost 3,000 people, mostly in a sky blue raincoat, formed in Copenhagen in the morning following the call of the "Friends of the Earth" to form a first group to represent the "blue seas" for "climate justice".
"Today we are going to the streets to demand that the ecological debts be repaid to the people of the South," activist Lidy Nacpil of the Jubilee South Coalition of the Philippines in Copenhagen said in a statement.
“We can’t say to ourselves anymore: we still have time,” said singer Angélique Kidjo from Benin.
“In Africa there are rivers that are draining, there are watercourses through which you can walk, which was never the case before.”
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was launched in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of anti-globalization has approached the environmental organizations.
French MP José Bové, a critic of globalisation, told AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to “combine climate justice and social justice” and that “there is no longer any difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world.”
The organization Oxfam has mobilized several figures, such as Danish model Helena Christensen or former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who are turning to the masses.
The Asia-Pacific region, where there are many islands that are particularly vulnerable to global warming, has given the impetus to the demonstrations.
In Australia, according to the organizers, about 50,000 people took to the streets.
In Manila, several hundred people, most of them students, dressed in red bandanas, have advertised solar energy in front of the city council of the Philippine capital.
Hundreds of protesters in Hong Kong and Jakarta have also gathered in an action against climate change.
In France, during the demonstrations organized by the "Network of the 350", several hundred people gathered, especially in Paris, Marseille in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and Lyon in the east.
Several people gathered in Geneva.
According to Chatel, the subjects of geography and history are strengthened by the school reform of the lycées.
National Minister of Education Luc Chatel explained in an interview published in the Sunday newspaper "Journal du dimanche" that the subjects of geography and history emerged strengthened from the school reform of the lycées, even if they are not taught mandatory in the terminal (12th school year).
"The students of the Première (11th year of school) now have every four hours of the week and the same program," Mr Chatel confirms.
For the minister "this hypocrisy must be overcome", because according to him "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile", but rather a concentration of "the best students".
"The economic-social profile and the literary profile (ES and L) must not become a sub-profile of the scientific one," he continued, underlining: "I have also not heard many historians and intellectuals who have been outraged by the lack of historical-geographical education in the terminals on technical lycees."
On Saturday, an IFOP survey published in Humanité found that nearly seven out of ten French people (69%) criticize the state project of abolishing compulsory history and geography lessons in Terminale S (12th school year with a scientific profile). Many teachers and intellectuals also complained about this project, as well as the Left and some representatives of the Right.
The Minister replied that there was no question about limiting the philosophy of the Terminale S program.
Luc Chatel also defended education reform for teachers, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) called for protests on Tuesday against the project, which they believe will fall victim to the pedagogical training of future teachers.
The Minister stated that they undergo a subject-specific aptitude test in Master 2 (M2) at the beginning of the year and an admissions test at the end of the year, during which their teaching skills are examined.
In addition, they conduct internships during the year in the M2 and then teach one year before the students as teachers in the internship.
He went on to say, “If you add all the internships offered before the performance exam, you’ll reach even more hours spent in front of the students, i.e. more than 300 hours.”
The minister finally stated that he wanted to offer "the individual right to education" - a "thing that does not exist in public education."
He confirmed once again that he wants to abolish the school card "by 2012".
15 minutes for the climate at the "Ecole Normale Supérieure"
Fifteen minutes to talk about the deployment at the Copenhagen summit: this is the challenge Jean Jouzel, vice-president of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, faced on Saturday morning at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Rue d'Ulm in Paris.
As one AFP journalist noted, Nobel Peace Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, at which experts turn to the audience with filmed contributions for fifteen minutes each.
One wants to do something to reach people and make them feel like they want to learn more, explained Edouard Hannezo, 22 years old and one of the organizers of that day, on the edge of the conference. The name of this event goes back to the name that the students gave the fish in the school's pool.
"Among the experts, around twenty participants were selected, also according to their charisma," he clarified.
"You can talk about climate warming for hours, but the core goals can also be outlined in a few minutes," said Jean Jouzel of AFP, who spoke freely in front of about 50 people only with the help of foils.
"This is part of our role as scientists," he underlined, hoping that the audience might conclude that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an absolutely serious scientific dossier."
The videos filmed by these conferences will be available online on the school’s website from December 15.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February and will take place every two months thereafter.
Payment delay : angry prison guards, actions planned
The unions of prison officials called for a general day of action on Friday to ensure that the premiums and overtime, whose payments were postponed for budget reasons to January, are transferred before the Christmas holidays.
The 2nd Union of Penitentiary Officers (FO-Penitentiaire) called on employees who have no service to demonstrate in front of the detention centre on Tuesday morning and to block it in order to draw attention to the "theft of what belongs to them".
The Third Union of Prisoners (CGT-Penitentiaire) called for "a strong mobilization in the various prisons", on which the non-payment of overtime, night allowances and Sunday and holiday allowances in December is branded as "disgraceful and unacceptable".
The first union of prison officials, the Autonomous Federal Penitentiary Union (UFAP/UNSA), called for "general mobilizations (...) to show dissatisfaction and anger."
The heads of the prison and the Ministry of Justice said that overtime had increased sharply in 2009 and not all of them were included in the budget, but they guarantee that the remaining receivables will be paid in January.
As the Ministry of Justice announced in the evening, Michèle Alliot-Marie sent a letter to the unions of prison officials guaranteeing that the payment will be made next month.
"I am well aware of the efforts of the staff to keep our prison system functioning and to modernize it," the Minister of Justice said in a statement.
"I have instructed the management of the detention centre to take immediate action so that such a situation, caused by a lack of appreciation of the overtime incurred, does not repeat in the future," Ms Alliot-Marie added.
The December salary is therefore low, except for the management staff, who receive high service and target premiums, explains the UFAP / UNSA, for which the "budget constraints" must be maintained.
"This is an absolute scandal," the inter-regional trade union FO in Marseille is outraged, announcing to boycott "all meetings and summons" up to new instructions.
"The staff do not go to work on Sundays and public holidays when the hours of October in December are still not paid, as is their overtime," the FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne also threatens.
“At a time when we are being burdened with more and more tasks without more staff being hired, trying to enrich ourselves with the money of the staff is more than inappropriate,” the CGT union of Bordeaux said.
According to trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, with some less affected than others.
In any case, however, it is wrong, observes the Secretary-General of the UFAP, Jean-François Forget.
Obama thinks he’s always giving Christmas better gifts than he gets.
US President Barack Obama, who will spend Christmas with his family in the White House for the first time, has told TV talk master Oprah Winfrey that he is always distributing better gifts than he gets himself.
During a special broadcast broadcast on ABC on Sunday night, the president and his wife Michelle gave insight into how they will spend the holidays in their new illustrious home.
Even Bo, the family’s little four-legged companion, will be in the game.
"Santa Claus also loves Bo," Michelle Obama reaffirms, adding that the dog will of course also get a gift.
Michelle Obama firmly dismissed her husband's claims about the quality of the gifts: "I made you beautiful gifts last year," she teases the president.
"Please," he scolded her, pointing to the first lady's pearl necklace, "And who gave you this?"
During this one-hour broadcast in a casual atmosphere with the well-known television presenter who had so vehemently supported Barack Obama during his campaign, the president and his wife also talked about gifts they had loved the most as a child.
Barack Obama remembered a ten-speed bike and also a basketball that his father, whom he rarely saw, had brought with him from Kenya for Christmas.
"I remember when my father visited us one Christmas and brought me a basketball," the president said.
“It wasn’t until much later in my life that I understood that I had this ball from him.”
The first lady, for her part, remembered her dollhouse.
"I didn't know how to arrange the furniture in a house at all, so I put them all on the wall instead of grouping them around the fireplace, but I loved this little dollhouse," Michelle told Obama.
Johnny Hallyday operates again, RTL confirms that he has been placed in an artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was again operated on in Los Angeles for significant "damage" after an operation in France. According to the people surrounding him, the situation is "under control", although RTL confirms that the singer has been placed in an artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician was re-operated in the night from Wednesday to Thursday at Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> Hospital in Los Angeles after American doctors identified "damages resulting from surgery of a herniated disc" he had suffered in Paris on November 26, according to his production company in Paris, which added that those damages required a re-operation.
The singer's production company nevertheless wanted to clarify that the situation was "under control" and announced that a new medical opinion would be available within 48 hours at the latest.
However, according to RTL, the partner during the singer’s last tour, Johnny Hallyday was put into an artificial coma to avoid “pain and complications.”
However, it was only after 48 hours that a little more certainty about the patient’s condition than he opened his eyes, RTL added.
At the request of AFP, there was no confirmation or comment from the production company.
RTL also confirms that "certain sources indicate" that after its first operation in Paris, "no drainage" was placed.
The rocker had been operated on in the international clinic of Parc Monceau because of a herniated disc.
The procedure, planned for several days, was performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor who had already treated many stars.
This was not available on Thursday night for comments on RTL.
After Johnny Hallyday's surgery, the singer was hospitalized at Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday due to a follow-up infection after the procedure.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, who is very close to Johnny Hallyday, told RTL on Thursday that his friend is just going through a "deep valley", but he assured that you need "no worries" about the rock musician, as he is "a good fighter".
“He had called me before he left for Los Angeles and I told him it was nonsense to sit on a plane for 12 hours after such an operation,” Mitchell said.
On Wednesday evening, the producer of the singer, Jean-Claude Camus, confirmed that Johnny Hallyday "reacts well to the antibiotics" and that "the infection is contained".
Mr Camus also stated that he had spoken with Laeticia, the singer’s wife, and that he had not felt any particular concern.
Nevertheless, the singer’s concern for his health had grown ever greater since he spent nine days in a hospital in July after crashing on his yacht.
Two months later, to the general amazement, Johnny Hallyday had a “small bowel cancer surgery,” leading to a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer recorded his long "Tour 66" as a farewell tour.
Fans and journalists have not escaped the fact that the singer on stage has struggled to move.
It was not until mid-November that the people around him had to deny a readmission to the hospital.
Euro-2009/Kurzbahn: First place for Bousquet over his favorite distance
The Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, three times medalist at the 2009 World Swimming Championships, won an international title over his favorite distance, 50m freestyle, at the Euro-2009 on the short track in Istanbul on Thursday.
On the first day of the competition, when polyurethane suits were allowed for the last time, there were only three world records, while a real record flood was expected.
One record was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 4 x 200 m and the other two by Russia at 4 x 50 m.
Too bad for Bousquet, who wanted to grab after the world record at the 50m freestyle, whose record he holds in the big basin (20.94).
At one of the two royal distances in swimming, 50m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman claimed himself in 20.53 sec. in a final with ten swimmers at the start (usually eight) - a premiere at international level.
Bousquet defeated Croatian Duje Dragania (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but failed to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
"You can believe in ever greater and in this case I have said, if the world record is in my reach, I will try."
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers started in polyurethane suits, which are banned from January 1, 2010.
With 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations finish their epic in Istanbul, which began in 1999 at the same competition.
The use of the combination has not paid off this time for the German Paul Biedermann, two-time world champion in the basin this summer in Rome and world record, in the end.
The young swimmer has failed to improve his best time over 400m freestyle (3:32.77), yet he has prevailed with the second best time in his career (3:34.55), ahead of the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
“I didn’t give everything this time.
I knew I couldn't reach a world record today, but I defended my title and did my job."
"Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future," Biedermann said.
U.S.: Grave plate at Zola estimated at $1.5 million
A Roman grave plate, which appeared just before the French writer Emile Zola, was estimated on Thursday at $1.5 million above its value, according to art dealer Sotheby's.
This plate is two meters long and 63 cm high. It dates back to the 3rd century AD and was always valued at 150,000 to 250,000 dollars.
The marble, on which "four scenes of Dionysus are depicted in a sophisticated architectural decor, surrounded by satyrs and Bacchus figures, is a rare piece; there are only four or five of them in the world," said Florent Heintz, vice president of auctioning Roman and Egyptian antiques at Sotheby's, to AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold among hundreds of pieces.
"The sale is still going on, but this part is certainly what buyers have been bidding for most of it so far," Sotheby's spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
The discovery of this acquisition of the marble part by Emile Zola goes back a long way.
The record was housed in Rome for almost 300 years in the famous collection of the Borghese family, after which it appeared piece by piece with the French actress Cécile Sorel, used in her bathroom of her Paris hotel, and with Paul Reynaud, Minister of the Third French Republic and President of the Council, before Marshal Pétain came to power.
The next fifty years are in the dark.
While searching the Louvre database, Florent Heintz discovered that this record was part of a "heritage of Emile Zola", which was opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of the "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco "Rougon-Macquart".
Zelaya’s attempt to leave Honduras for Mexico has been thwarted
On Thursday, Mexico had declared the conditions for the transfer of the overthrown Honduran President Manuel Zelaya to domestic soil as no longer compatible after the coup government rejected the conditions as unacceptable.
After a phone conversation with President Zelaya that took place in the night, everything seems to indicate that there is disagreement about the possibility of carrying out this transfer, said the Mexican Minister of Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa.
According to the immigration authority, the plane provided by the Mexican government, which arrived in Salvador on Wednesday for the purpose of transferring M. Zelaya, had returned to its place of departure.
The coup government wanted to force M. Zelaya to abdicate and to request political asylum for him abroad.
However, the overthrown president declined to do so, desiring to return to Mexico as the welcoming, acting head of state.
The coup regime "has suffered a renewed failure by trying to get me to give up at my expense (...), they wanted me to abdicate," Zelaya told Radio Globo on Thursday, in which he often speaks since the beginning of the political crisis that has been going on for five months in the Central American country.
I can stay here for ten years, here I have my guitar,” added the overthrown president, who had fled to the Brazilian embassy of Tegucigalpa two and a half months ago, with a few chords.
The Mexican embassy has sent us a request for guidance, which we unfortunately cannot accept because it does not include a request for asylum, Oscar Raul Matute, Interior Minister of the coup government, told Honduran Radio HRN on Wednesday.
I am not seeking asylum in any country at all, Manuel Zelaya had replied in an interview with the channel Telesur, whose headquarters are in Caracas.
A possible exit from Honduras, he had underlined, would he only undertake as president of the Honduran people.
Rumors of Mr. Zelaya’s departure had mobilized supporters of the overthrown president on Wednesday, who had set out to the Brazilian embassy and gathered around it, whereupon the military there had intensified its deployment.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the government’s position.
This, according to his assessment, reveals the marginal character of this government in the face of international norms.
Zelaya, who had approached socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, had been overthrown on June 28, on the day of the referendum he organised to prepare for his re-election, contrary to the advice of the Supreme Court, the Army and Congress.
He had returned from his exile in Costa Rica on September 21st and had fled to the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be imprisoned for treason, of which he is accused by the judiciary, according to the coup government.
The coup president Roberto Micheletti has managed to organise a presidential election on 29 November to replace Mr. Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo had been recognized by the United States in the course of the controversial election, but rejected by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, the Kogress had massively voted against M. Zelaya’s return to office until the end of his mandate on January 27.
Wall Street on the rise, U.S. trade balance feeds optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed with a high on Thursday, the figures of the US trade balance testify to a recovery of the shares of the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones has risen by 0.67%, the Nasdaq by 0.33%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose from 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points, while the Nasdaq, which is dominated by technology, rose from 7.13 points to 2,190.06 points.
The Standard & Poor <0xCC><0x81>s 500 Extended Index scored at 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1,102.35.
There is good news from various industries, Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial judged.
However, this remains anecdotal under the premise that the market focuses only on "half-full glasses", she moderated.
According to Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, the investors are mainly fixed on the figures of the US trade balance, "which shows an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter".
The United States trade deficit fell by 7.6% in October compared to September to $32.9 billion.
Analysts, on the other hand, had anticipated a deficit growth.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is the increase in the total volume of trade, especially in goods exports, which reflects the economic growth of the United States’ main trading partners, said Christopher Cornell of corporate research Economy.com.
In return, unemployment reports in the United States have risen against all expectations in the past week and have now reached the level of 474,000 requests.
However, the average of new job seekers during the last four weeks has fallen “to the low point of the year,” Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors emphasized.
The bond market has fallen.
The 10-year profitability of government bonds rose to 3,482% compared to 3,432% on Tuesday night, and the 30-year profitability of bonds to 4,492% compared to 4,408% on the previous night.
Cuba: Hundreds of partisans in power whistle out 'ladies in white'
Several hundred Cuban-powered partisans on Thursday whipped out political prisoners’ wives gathered in Havana for the purpose of World Human Rights Day and also thwarted another rally that resulted in the temporary arrest of a good dozen dissidents.
Around the forty "ladies in white", wives or close political prisoners, were whistled out in the open streets by partisans of the government under Raul Castro just as they were walking into the center of the capital to demand the release of the political prisoners, an AFP journalist confirmed.
Down with the Yankies!, “Soldiers!”, “The street belongs to the revolutionaries!”, “Live Fidel and Raul!”, shouted the empowered partisans with an uplifted fist to the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilian agents who had appeared to “ensure their protection.”
A similar demonstration against the "Ladies in White" had taken place in Havana on the eve, in which there were neither injuries nor arrests.
In the Vedado district of Havana, on the other hand, a dozen dissidents who were also involved in the demonstration held on Thursday in light of the International Human Rights Day were temporarily arrested by civilian police, an AFP reporter confirmed.
According to this report, the police have forced the dissidents, who have been exploited by the partisans of the government, to embark on civilian vehicles under the use of force.
Temporary detention of dissidents in such circumstances is usually limited to a few hours.
As candidates for the Sakharov Prize awarded by the European Parliament in 2005, the "Women in White" have organized an unauthorized march for the purpose of "please release all political prisoners", whose number according to the dissident list is around 200 people, Laura Pollan, one of the leaders, whose husband Hector Maceda has been sentenced to 20 years in prison.
M. Maceda belongs to the group of 75 Cuban dissidents imprisoned in March 2003, 53 of whom are still behind bars.
The Cuban authorities perceive the opponents of the regime as "mercenaries" or "agents" in the service of the declared archenemy, the United States.
A rarity in itself is that Cuban television reported on the demonstration events that took place on Thursday between militant pro-government fighters and “counter-revolutionaries.”
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of denigrating rights and freedoms, in particular freedom of expression.
Insane kills eighty-year-old with a knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
A maniac armed with two knives killed an eighty-year-old and injured five more people on Friday in Clichy-la-Garenne, Hauts-de-Seine.
According to the first data of the survey, the 28-year-old attacker had injured the eighty-year-old with two knives in or in front of a pharmacy on the boulevard Jean-Jaures for an unexplained cause and this, according to police reports, in the presence of witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929, is reported to have succumbed to the consequences of his injuries in the hospital, according to a officer of the police syndicate Alliance.
In or in front of the same pharmacy, he had a couple with a pregnant woman.
The man, about in his thirties, intervened and was injured.
The first two victims were hospitalized, where the eighty-year-old died.
The other injured person is in danger of death, as he appears to have been affected by vital organs, according to police sources.
The pregnant woman has become ill as a result of the events and she is said to have been hospitalized in a "shock state", according to a police source.
The armed man, who, according to police reports, appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, is said to have immediately escaped to the street, the same boulevard Jean Jaures.
He had injured two other passers-by, apparently accidentally: a thirty-year-old and a forty-year-old, the latter of which was severe.
The scenario remained in the dark in the evening.
He had been armed with two butcher knives, which he carried crossed behind his back, said locally Arnaud Pressé, a member of the Alliance of the Hauts-de-Seine region.
Several passers-by, including young people, are reported to have tried to curb the insane, according to witnesses identified by the AFP.
I saw a guy in his thirties wearing a green vest.
Three young people tried to intervene.
They didn’t make it because the guy was well-built, Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar, reported.
A horde has fallen over him, he added, including a city police officer who broke his wrist in the process.
Still on the boulevard Jean-Jaures, at the level of house number 61, two city police officers, including her superior, have tried to arrest the armed man and were wounded with knife stabbings, according to police reports.
The event took place in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where a number of shops are located.
Passengers have approached me to tell me that there is an injured person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old person lying on the floor, I put her in first aid position and noticed a flapping wound in the stomach area, Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, told AFP.
Five minutes later, a second, about thirty-year-old person, is injured by cuts.
State police officers have finally arrested the man who did not carry any identity papers.
The Prosecutor’s Office of Nanterre has commissioned the District Office of the Hauts-de Seine Criminal Police (SDPJ 92) to investigate the case.
The insane man was hospitalized on Thursday night.
Given his condition, he has not yet been heard in court.
A police source does not rule out his being taken to a mental hospital.
According to another police source, six police officers were smeared in order to restrain him at the police commissariat in Clichy, where he had been taken.
He was "in a state of overexcitement" like "all the mentally confused of this kind, in which the forces release themselves during the act."
USA: Polanski's lawyer calls for end of prosecution
French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski’s lawyer has repeatedly called on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, Western United States) to drop the prosecution of his client, who is currently on trial at his residence in Switzerland for a moral offence of more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, attorney to the director of the "Pianist," has denounced in front of three judges of the Appeals Court in the second district of California gross trial error at the time of the hearing in 1977.
I am immediately demanding remission, Mr. Hummel explained, before adding that the conduct of Judge Laurence Rittenband, who was commissioned at the time of the trial, "was coldly letting one run down their backs."
According to him, the now-deceased Judge Rittenband had discussed his verdict with a prosecutor who allegedly told him that Roman Polanski deserved a prison -- which constituted a serious procedural error.
This discussion had been raised in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski: pursued and desired), specifically by the questioning prosecutor David Wells.
M. Wells had finally declared at the end of September that the authors of the documentary had "mented."
Should the Court refuse to terminate the criminal proceedings, Mr. Hummel demands the conduct of a trial that would allow him to provide the evidence for his argument.
For its part, the prosecution has repeated the evidence already explained in the first instance, i.e. that a discussion on the suspension of the charges against the defendant cannot be seriously considered until Roman Polanski appears in court.
The 76-year-old director had fled the United States in 1978, even before the promulgation of the sentence for "illegal sexual relations" with a 13-year-old minor.
Since then, he has not traveled to the United States.
The Deputy Prosecutor of Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, had stated that Roman Polanski "must be there to attend the trial."
Do you want to spread the message in this matter, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, that escape is a way out?, asks Ms. Asayma.
In her opinion, "the filmmaker asks the court for a favor and thus despises his authority."
One of the three judges – who now have 90 days to announce their decision – even highlighted “that there are other escape alternatives.”
Hummel was not the only one who had applied for the cessation of prosecution of Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer’s lawyer, the victim, also demanded once again the suspension of the criminal proceedings.
She recalled that her client would no longer tolerate being harassed by any resurgence of Polanski's affair, adding: "No one in this room can say that this procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough.”
Roman Polanski was arrested in Switzerland on September 26 at the request of an American arrest warrant.
After spending two months behind bars, he was then sentenced to house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad, in anticipation of a possible extradition.
Wall Street is slowed by the rise of the dollar and closes without a price.
The New York Stock Exchange closed without a price on Friday in a market torn between better indicators than expected in the US and a rise in the dollar: The Dow Jones won 0.63%, while the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
Based on the final figures available at closing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the technologically dominated Nasdaq scored 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The Extended Index Standard & Poor's 500 has increased by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
"Honestly, the market is pretty quiet," Mace noted Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
"It remains narrowly limited, the trading volume has become very small and I think it will remain so until the end of the year."
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators than planned, which “contributed to improving the market view on the solidity of the economy’s recovery,” summarized Charles Schwab’s analysts.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November, two months in a row and far more than expected.
In addition, U.S. consumers’ confidence improved significantly in December to 73.4 compared to 67.4 in the previous month, according to the University of Michigan index preview.
However, the indices have been slowed by a new rise in the dollar rate, which has reached its highest level against the euro in two months, pushing down “the sectors vulnerable to the economic situation,” said Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
Technological values have thus lost some ground.
The bond market has declined.
The return on the Treasury bond over 10 years rose by 3,540% over 3,482% on Wednesday evening, and that of the bond over 30 years to 4,497% over 4,492% the previous day.
Miss World Election Again in South Africa
After a month of touring South Africa, the 112 candidates for the Miss World title on Saturday will cross the last hurdle to realize their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world and to do so in front of a billion television viewers.
During this major beauty fair, held for the second time in a row in the Johannesburg area, five of them have already won their ticket to the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were named Miss Sportive or Miss Topmodel during their African stay.
This was a true swirl of pleasures.
Visiting beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Horn was just extraordinary.
I’ve seen a lot of things and had a lot of experience!, said Miss Sierra Leone with full enthusiasm.
This competition will take place for the ninth time in South Africa and will be broadcast live from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, on Saturday, from 5 p.m. to 3 p.m.
I couldn't imagine a better country to hand over my crown.
This experience was simply fascinating.
I am happy to have had this experience twice, underlined Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the South African summer.
For the young Russian woman, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges of experience with candidates and the rediscovery of "breathtaking landscapes".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, meetings with the press and safari, the Miss now focuses on the competition.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected in 2000 and will also be present at this election, as well as imitate Aishwarya Rai, who was elected in 1994 and both became Bollywood stars.
Of course, every woman’s dream is to be crowned the most beautiful woman in the world, but it’s not just about appearance.
We are ambassadors of our country and I want to come home with the crown, Miss India throws in with a broad smile.
According to the organizers, this 59th edition is underlined with music and dance.
The candidates defiled in traditional costumes and not to forget in swimsuit.
The performance will be presented by a television presenter, the Chinese Angela Chow, by the ex-beauty queen from South Africa, Michelle McLean, and by a director of the Miss World Committee, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it knows how to receive the world with an unsurpassed warmth and pride, assures Julia Morley, chair of Miss World.
The candidates, like last year, took a safari, visited the famous township in Soweto, but this time they tasted the local cuisine by bike.
However, the meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who gave them a hand, was quite extraordinary.
Not usual for a head of state, Miss Sierra Leone remarked.
Their most beautiful memory, however, undoubtedly remains the draw in Cape Town (southwest) to the World Cup in June 2010, a kind of the country to advertise for this event a little more.
I'm with people I probably wouldn't be able to get close to.
I will certainly return to the 2010 World Cup, promised enthusiastically Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
Johnny Hallyday’s news is “very positive,” according to his son David.
The news for Johnny Hallyday is "very positive," his son David assured on Friday on his arrival at Los Angeles airport, where he visited his father, who has been in hospital for several days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, everything is going very well, David Hallyday told the press when he got off the plane, arriving from Paris shortly after 13:00 local time (21:00 CET).
The singer's son, who made a relaxed impression, assured that he would "quickly" go to Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> Hospital, where Johnny Hallyday was hospitalized on Monday for a bacterial consequence infection following surgery on a herniated disc on November 26 in Paris.
The singer was "put into an artificial coma that night in Los Angeles to alleviate his severe pain and be able to carry out his treatment," the press service announced.
Johnny Hallyday was placed in an artificial coma by doctors at Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted to Paris on Monday due to a bacterial consequence of disc surgery on November 26.
The singer had to undergo surgery again in the night from Wednesday to Thursday due to the pathological changes caused by the last procedure.
His wife, Laeticia, attended a school event at the French high school in Los Angeles on Friday morning, where her daughter Jade goes to school, an AFP photographer noted.
The head of the orthopaedic and traumatological surgery department at the Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer at the hospital in Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer weighed heavily on the neurosurgeon Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who operated on the singer on November 26 at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told that he had committed the purest massacre.
The surgeons of Los Angeles said they were completely upset, Mr. Camus explained.
I have heard of the possibility of a court proceeding, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus is of the opinion that Johnny Hallyday "was traveling to Los Angeles far too fast and this with the permission of the Paris surgeon".
I personally spoke to this doctor, who assured me that he sees this trip as completely unproblematic, which surprised me very much, since I already have two disc surgeries behind me, he added.
Shortly before, he announced to RTL that the singer had apparently left the hospital "without drainage, without everything" after the operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic environment.
He had operated on actress Marie Trintignant, a few days before her death in Vilnius, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he was practicing at that time.
In 2007, he had also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to resorb a hematoma after a brain hemorrhage.
But he is also a doctor with a dubious reputation, who has already been convicted several times for failed operations and not to forget, for tax evasion and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, a lawyer for the Medical Association, has described him as "a man without scruples" who is "regularly" to answer before the Board of Directors and is "anything other than recommendable".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux made a statement on Friday about his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
He explained that the intervention had “perfectly proceeded” and the post-operative examinations had been “normal.”
The operation "provoked no bleeding and therefore does not require drainage," he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have been popping up since the last summer, seems questioned.
It is quite obvious that it is a bit too short for a continuation of the tour on 8 January (in Amiens), Mr Camus explained.
The UDF (Union for French Democracy) is becoming energetic and calls on the Nouveau Centre party to stop using its seal
The party alliance, overseen by François Bayrou's MoDem party, on Friday reacted vehemently to an attempted takeover of the seal, the party once founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, by the chairman of the Nouveau Centre party, Hervé Morin, and urged him no longer to use this seal under threat of judicial prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to adopt this UDF seal, believing that François Bayrou would not be worthy of defending this political legacy after reaching out to the Left.
By the way, the Minister of Defence, whose party partner is the UMP, wanted to reaffirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
In reaffirming his efforts, he had received the support of MEP Hervé de Charette (formerly UMP, now NC), who claims to be the proprietor of the UDF trade mark, since he was the first to apply for this trade mark in 2004 at the "Institut national de la propriété industrielle".
However, the branch of the party alliance UDF, supervised by François Bayrous's friends, broke the silence and clearly indicated that they could not be expropriated, and set a time limit for the Minister and the MP, under threat of judicial prosecution, to stop using this seal and to transfer the trademark's ownership rights to it.
You have made numerous statements in recent days that you would propose to your political movement to take over the UDF seal, wrote the party alliance in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 office members, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the party MoDem and Senator Jean Arthuis of the centrist alliance.
You probably also thought you had the right to have the name of this movement +Nouveau centre+, the slogan + of today’s UDF +, printed on their political material as well as on the homepage of your website.
As you know, you are not entitled to the use of this seal, UDF's office stated, and urges NC to "immediately remove the mention of the name UDF from any material as well as from (your) website".
In addition, Hervé de Charette was required "to transfer the trademark's ownership rights to its legal claimants".
If you refuse to do so, we will file a lawsuit against you in order to comply with the law and to defend the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warned.
In their letter, they emphasize that "UDF "has been a full-fledged political movement since 1978 and recall that Morin and his friends "have made the choice" to leave this in 2007 to establish a competing movement, as others had already done in 2002 to establish the party "UMP".
According to the undersigned, the Nouveau centre party therefore has no right to use the UDF seal (Union pour la démocratie française).
They also recall that the last Congress of the UDF in 2007 approved the three-year membership of the MoDem Party and the establishment of a branch for the defence of "material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "at the time he applied for the brand name, he was no longer a member of the UDF for three years" but the UMP.
He profits in a scandalous and fraudulent way from the lack of depositing the acronym UDF to do this for himself.
Furthermore, you state that this recklessness is the best way to turn into a crime, and ironize the NC's strategy: "It seems to us, in politics as well as in life, more dignified to make a name for yourself, rather than to try to get out of anonymity by fraudulently acquiring a name to which one has not gotten a right".
Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier convicted of exploitation of weakness
The Court of Nanterre decided on Friday to judge the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, he has exploited a weak moment of the eighty-year-old to sneak up some of her wealth.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star photos, will face trial on 15 and 16 April 2010 for exploiting weakness, a crime punishable by a maximum of three years imprisonment and a fine of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>375,000.
This decision means that there will in fact be a trial in this affair worthy of the saga of one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter wrestle together and at the same time have the reins of the cosmetic empire L'Oréal in hand.
However, the 15th Penal Chamber also ordered a medical examination of 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt, which is jointly conducted by three doctors.
The heiress and principal shareholder of L’Oréal has so far refused to undergo such an investigation, notably under the conditions presented by the Nanterre Prosecutor’s Office during the investigation.
The doctors appointed on Friday are to submit a report before March 10, 2010, in which they clearly state whether and at what times Liliane Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness.
I think she will undergo these investigations.
I will talk to her, Mrs. Bettencourt’s lawyer, Me Georges Kiejman, explained after the trial.
As for the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, he is very pleased with the court’s decision.
This is excellent news (...). The report will prove that he (Banier) has manipulated this old lady, which you need to protect, he affirmed.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt’s only daughter has filed a criminal lawsuit against François-Marie Banier, photographer and all-round artist, accusing him of exploiting her mother’s weakness for years to obtain donations totalling a billion euros in the form of bank cheques, insurance policies or paintings.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt had always refuted being manipulated by the photographer she sees as a longtime friend.
Although the court would have to examine the admissibility of the lawsuit initiated by Ms Bettencourt-Meyers, the plaidoyers of the lawyers led to a major family debacle on Friday.
Liliane Bettencourt’s lawyer cited three letters sent to her notary by his client (1999, 2003 and 2005) in which she wrote that she distrusts the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt added: “Please explain to my daughter that for fifteen years, once or twice a day, I wrote to Banner.
I have never been able to speak to Françoise since her marriage.”
The Nanterre Public Prosecutor’s Office is again of the opinion that the plaintiff had no right to respond in this way, in particular because a guardianship judge has in the last few days rejected her request to initiate a judicial protection procedure against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully legally capable, is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one has the right to act in their place,” the prosecutor’s representative, Marie-Christine Daubigney, said.
The court has now decided to issue a verdict after the trial on the admissibility of Mme Bettencourt-Meyers took place.
Manager Revolution or the End of Strategic Early Enlightenment?
If nothing changes in the leadership of the great French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been in vain ...
For over a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies in relation to its employees, said the position of the companies vis-à-vis the consumers before the marketing revolution: It is determined for the staff to join "values" to impose the best, as it used to be on the consumer products designed by the technicians in the factory.
By putting the customer at the center of the company, the marketing revolution has given the strategies of conquering the markets in the place ... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products separately factors the preferences of the customers again regularly!
A demobilization of employees can lead to fatal demoralization.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the tip of a much larger phenomenon that affects employees in particular.
This demobilization has a negative impact on the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially those of R&D and, more importantly, those of economic intelligence.
In fact, the IE (Intelligence Economique <0x3D> Economic Intelligence) calls for "a proactive approach and a forward-looking view from all parties involved"; it claims from the employees a commitment that completely contradicts the instructions of authoritarian management.
That is why we call for an operational revolution, which would be to place employees at the center of the company’s concerns on an equal footing with customers.
The very conditional benefit of internal opinion polls
Will the internal opinion polls, such as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its wage earners, stimulate this revolution in terms of management practice?
I'm afraid not.
- First, because I was able to find that, in the face of a new situation, after many detours, the whole structure finally gets to do first and foremost what it has always done.
Also because authoritarianism – one of the pathologies of power – increases proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
And finally, because most leaders have a greatly simplified idea of human behavior.
Their interpretation of psychology has emerged from the major engineering schools.
They adopt, through intellectual comfort, the old behaviorist theory recently reactivated by the American “neurosciences” and unknowingly widely disseminated by research institutes and the media.
Thus, and by suggesting that it is possible to use the "lever" (sic) for employee engagement, a recent survey by Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr strengthens the leadership in an attitude towards a mechanistic control system unsuitable for today’s world.
Identify and measure the mobilization factors
Instead, an operational revolution necessary for the smooth functioning of modern enterprises presupposes the adoption of a definitive view of human behavior.
It consists in integrating a fundamental protocol into any consideration or practice of governance: for wage earners, commitment to the company is only possible if it appears clearly as a means to realize part of their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Currently, only the studies from the multifunctional analysis adopt this concept of employee motivation.
These studies have shown that they assess their company on the basis of a predetermined Doxa, which allows them to assess what it offers to achieve their life goals through their perceived image of the company.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, corporate executives can control, predict and anticipate their “social performance” and put their human resource management back in the right place.
In this way, they create a fertile soil that is favorable for the coordinated development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
Oslo Speech: The “Justice War” Brings Obama Praise from the Right
On Friday, the American Right welcomed Barack Obama’s speech in Oslo and was pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize had defended the notion of “just war” against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who mocked Obama’s award on October 9, applauded this time the president’s speech, following the example of former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin in the 2008 election.
I liked what he said, Palin explained, the face of the right wing of the Republican Party in USA Today, adding that she herself had raised the topic of a “sometimes necessary” war in her memoirs recently published.
The war is, of course, the last thing I think the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We need to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, on Thursday in Oslo endeavoured to justify the use of force; a way to explain his decision nine days ago to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, expressed the opinion that the president had done “very good work” in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, the former president of the House of Representatives rejoiced, especially recognizing the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in the words of Obama.
In some parts, I felt this speech was entirely historical, Ginrich explained, who was interviewed in the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former MP, who is considered by some to be a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he was pleased to have seen a “left-wing president” reminding members of the Nobel Committee that they “are not free and could not hand out a price for peace if the use of force did not exist.”
For Michael Gerson, former writer of George W. Bush and now editor of the Washington Post, Obama made “a very American speech.”
In addition to portraying himself as a "cosmopolitan" as "he always does," he has "spoken like an American president" when he pointed out that Europeans "live like a security bubble they didn't create themselves and don't do much to protect it," Gerson said.
Among the few, unconvinced right, former UN ambassador John Bolton, a Bush-era falcon, described the speech on the National Review Online website as "boring, high-profile and uninspired."
To the left of the president, Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is concerned about how Barack Obama is defending the use of the armed forces.
If you wrap the war under the guise of justice, the massacre of the innocent can easily be justified, he warns.
The moderate left’s press, however, remains commendable alongside the president.
The Los Angeles Times, which still believes that the Nobel Prize was awarded prematurely to Obama, called the speech itself a "monumental work" for a speaker like him who is known for his talent.
The speech in Oslo "offers a timetable to steer international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression," the California daily said.
The New York Times believes that Obama “proclaimed the necessary discourse” and describes his speech as “dark and exemplary at the same time.”
Long-distance drivers: Three marathons for a deal to secure Christmas supplies
After a three-week negotiating marathon, the trade unions of the street association and the TLF - the only employers' organisation that remained until the end - reached an agreement on Friday evening that puts an end to the strike order and the impending severe supply shortage at Christmas.
At the signing session on Friday evening, State Secretary for Transport Dominique Bussereau "welcomed" the agreement, which was initiated on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiations.
After a second night of negotiations, the negotiators separated early Friday morning in the hope of signing the agreement quickly in the late morning.
And this despite the fact that the three employers' associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting.
However, more than six hours passed from the beginning of the meeting at 11:00 until the conclusion of the agreement, and the agreement was signed only at 18:00.
The conflict "would have caused a lot of damage to the companies" and "it was to be feared that it would interfere with the holidays at the end of the year," said Bussereau.
The agreement provides for a 4% increase in wages for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and a 2.9% increase for the highest wage groups (international transport).
The hourly rate for workers with the lowest wages thus increases from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros.
"That's not much, but we're starting small," said Patrice Clos (FO).
Activists are now instructed to stop blocking the supply centers.
"However, there will probably always be some opposing parties who are not satisfied with the agreement," he adds.
TLF chairman Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good deal" although it was "difficult to admit these wage increases in the face of international competition".
According to him, the increase is 170 euros per month for the low and 100 to 120 euros for the high pay groups.
“This agreement is based on common sense and respect for employees,” said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of “a historic agreement.”
Richard Jaubert (CGT) said in this regard "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for a 3% increase in travel costs and the maintenance of the total road transport budget in the first half of 2010, which will make it possible in particular to address the issue of 13th monthly salary and the modernisation of collective agreements.
M. Bussereau recalled that "the drop in levies for employers of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million" was the subject of a government amendment to the 2009 bill of corrected finances, which was passed by the National Assembly on the night of Thursday to Friday.
The government is calling for an “identical” vote by the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows the agreement to apply first to the companies affiliated to that organization and then, in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour, to the entire profession.
This will be the case "in the shortest possible time", Bussereau assures.
The opposition of employers' associations can only delay the proceedings.
The FNTR denounced a “fraudulent trade” because the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million had already been promised to the sector to offset part of the carbon tax.
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but in order not to overwhelm the goose eaters on the approaching Christmas days, the Unostra laments.
For the association Otre, the agreement threatens "to shovel a big grave to the small and medium-sized enterprises of the industry over the next 12 months".
Line RER A: Disruptions this weekend, trade unions dissatisfied with RATP proposals
Disruptions on the RER A line, the largest high-speed rail network in France for the Greater Paris and the <0xC3><0x8E>le-de-France, continued on the weekend, while a meeting on Friday, the 2nd strike day between the trade unions and the management of the RATP (Independent Paris Passenger Transport Administration), left strikers waiting with their demands for wage increases.
On the central line (between La Défense and Nation), only one of two trains was operational and only one of four trains was operational outside the central line.
The connection to the SNCF trains was interrupted in Nanterre Prefecture, forcing the passengers to switch.
The department store chain Galeries Lafayette, which counts 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "the RATP is endeavouring to connect the major stores in terms of traffic technology".
The RER A line runs through the Paris metropolitan area from west to east.
The RATP route connects the towns of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre, as well as Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains ran on schedule at peak time, and almost none during the low-traffic time.
As on Thursday, there was no crowd on the railway platforms, as the inhabitants of <0xC3><0x8E>le-de-France had adjusted to the situation.
So early in the morning, the train station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less crowded than usual, mainly because of the lack of high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer, said that he had “wasn’t up an hour and a half earlier to get to work on time.”
The SNCF, which had planned to take care of the passengers by staff and law enforcement officials, pointed out that there were no bottlenecks at Saint-Lazare railway station.
The trains operated by the SNCF on the RER A line or in the direction of Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed via Saint-Lazare station to ensure access to the metros.
On Saturday and Sunday, general meetings of the strikers were held again, during which the results were reviewed, which the associations had classified as "necessary" after meeting with the leadership on Friday afternoon.
The RER Managing Director proposed the specific drafting of a protocol for the RER A line with regard to all relevant aspects, working hours, careers, etc.
However, this is not what the drivers want, according to Thierry Garon (Sud), they are demanding a wage surcharge that has long been due.
The CGT was indignant that the RATP itself puts its wage increase proposals in brackets, stressing that the leadership "is unable to solve a problem, while this was also possible with the long-distance drivers and the SNCF."
The RATP made it clear that a re-meeting was planned for Monday for the “comprehensive review of working conditions”.
This also shows the associations that the company "ignores the weekend drivers".
In the morning, about 150 drivers visited the branch of a committee in Paris.
Once again, it was the leadership that rejected any discussion during the strike and suggested a meeting after calming the situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to expand to the RER B line after a pre-announcement by Unsa and Indépendants.
The associations demand a wage surcharge of 120 (USA) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants), and they also complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this route, on which millions of travellers travel daily.
The drivers of the RER line, who have years of professional experience, receive a gross wage of 2,200 to 2,700 euros and a wage surcharge of 600 to 650 euros for shift services as well as Sundays and public holidays.
Turkish Constitutional Court dissolves pro-Kurdish party. Decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court on Friday announced the dissolution of the country’s pro-Kurdish main party; a decision immediately followed by angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens to make the work of the government enormously difficult, which is trying to reach out to the Kurdish community in order to put an end to the conflicts that have been going on for 25 years.
The "Party for a Democratic Society" (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a "site for activities that are detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," said Hasim Kiliç, president of the Constitutional Court, four days after the decision.
According to Kiliç, the decision was taken unanimously by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes required to impose the dissolution, and he noted that 37 of the party’s leaders, including chairman Ahmet Türk and parliamentarian Aysel Tugluk, were excluded from political events for a period of five years.
Furthermore, the judge announced the lifting of parliamentary immunity, which Turkish and Tugluk enjoy, as well as the confiscation of the party's goods.
The DTP now has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
Before the verdict, the party leaders said that the parliamentarians would rather leave Parliament than meet like partyless parliamentarians.
The decision followed a trial initiated in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Turkish Federal Court, Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accused the DTP of following the “instructions” of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which Ankara and many other countries consider to be a terrorist organization.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party assures that it has “no connection” to the PKK, but refuses to call it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate.
The verdict of the Constitutional Court interferes with the government, which seeks to meet the Kurdish community and propose a series of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds in order to drain the support of the PKK by the Kurds and put an end to the conflicts.
The leaders of the DTP reaffirm that a dissolution could lead to a resurgence of tensions in southeastern Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against the detention conditions of PKK chief Abdullah <0xC3><0x96>calan have led to clashes with police in recent weeks.
Since the court’s announcement, thousands of protesters have gathered in front of the DTP premises in the million-dollar city of Diyarbakir in the southeast, which is predominantly populated by Kurds.
The law enforcement forces used tear gas grenades and water cannons as the protesters began to throw Molotov cocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Türk assumed that the court's decision will "deepen the despair even further".
"Turkey cannot clarify this (Kurdish, annotated) question by means of a party's ban," he told the press.
The government, consisting of a party that emerged from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
"We oppose, in principle, the closure of the parties.
That does not solve the problems," said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
"This decision is a torpedo to the democratic openness promoted by the government," said political market observer Ahmet Insel.
"One can obviously be prepared for a reaction from the PKK," he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK announced that it had committed an attack that killed seven soldiers in northern Turkey three days earlier, one of the most brutal attacks in recent months.
The snow can come
A really crisp winter, that’s what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to harass the citizens, says the winter service director of the FES.
But so that his employees can try and master the entire vehicle technology.
According to meteorologists, this could be the first time this weekend.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
The FES proceeds according to a precise plan.
As soon as it snows all over Frankfurt and the temperatures are below zero degrees, 20 so-called A-tracks will be departed with large-scale scattering vehicles, Brauburger explains.
These include main traffic and transit roads such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also fire service accesses, public transport routes, pedestrian zones and routes with slopes, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The service of the FES starts at three o'clock in the morning
The approximately 1040 kilometers would have to be scattered in a maximum of three hours with moist salt, which adheres better.
That is why FES starts at three o'clock in the morning, "so that the routes are free until the professional traffic starts".
It will be difficult if it does not snow until 7.30 p.m.
Then we have a problem, says the winter service manager, "because then no one is willing to make room for the scattering vehicles."
Only afterwards, if it does not snow further, it is the turn of supply and development roads, which also includes the Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority are side and side roads.
There will be complaints, Brauburger knows.
At five o’clock in the morning, the foot people of the FES set out on their way, points of danger and crossings are cleared primarily.
The FES can usually not take care of all cycle paths.
There is a special service in Frankfurt that mainly keeps the bridges in mind from 10 p.m. to 4:30 p.m., says Brauburger.
Since this fast smoothness occurs, as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees, the scatterer is on the way.
If necessary, they will also be called by the police.
The Cradle of Dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other carnivorous dinosaurs: The two-metre-long and 1.50-metre-sized animal ran on two strong hind legs, had an elongated skull with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with sickle claws and a long tail.
Had the species lived a few million years later, it would have been nothing special.
But Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body characteristics, Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues report in the journal Science on Thursday.
The animal lived around 215 million years ago in present-day New Mexico, then in a dry zone of the Pangea supercontinent on the equator.
Tawa opens a new window on the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It shows us a lot about the relationships, spread and characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began excavating Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
We sometimes found a dozen dinosaur bones in one day, which is unprecedented for deposits from the Triassic, reports team member Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the bones quickly identified the researchers as a new species.
In the course of the excavation, they collected the remains of a total of five individuals.
Find confirms theories about Dino early history
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it is an extraordinary find: "Dinosaur fossils from the Triassic are extremely rare, usually you find only individual fragments."
Other dinosaur experts do not necessarily share the enthusiasm.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to the current theory, the dinosaurs appeared for the first time about 230 million years ago.
However, many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, which is why the allocation of these primitive dinosaurs is mostly controversial.
For example, the experts debate when the lizards split into their three main lines of development: the carnivorous theropods, which later included the tyrannosaurus rex, the velociraptor and also the birds, known as the "long-hals" four-legged sauropods and their relatives, and the plants eating the species of species of species of species of species.
According to the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is an original theropod.
It has an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
On the skull of Tawa hallae, for example, the researchers found evidence of air bags, as they also possess the descendants of theropods, the birds.
Thanks to the air bags, the breathing of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
In Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were also partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related line of the giant sauropods later also possessed air bags and lightweight bones, the common ancestor of both groups had probably already produced this useful innovation.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, the researchers conclude that the lizards appeared there for the first time.
Accordingly, the three lines of development separated early and spread from South America over all continents, which at that time still formed a single land mass as the supercontinent Pangea.
This is supported by the fact that the team, together with Tawa hallae, found the remains of two other not very closely related theropods.
The three cannot be descended from a common immigrant ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe there were at least three waves of migration to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the science study.
Of course, there are also contradictions.
An even older species, Silesaurus, belonging to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in present-day Poland, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
In his opinion, a distorted picture could arise because in South America there are simply many primitive dinosaur fossils preserved, while on other continents there is hardly anything to be found.
How the dinosaurs managed to evolve from a relatively rare sideline of the reptilian tribe to the dominant agricultural vertebrates of the Earth's Middle Ages is still mysterious.
During the Triassic, the dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of today's crocodiles and fly saurs, and with numerous other lizards.
Towards the end of the Triassic, the dinosaurs spread all over the world, developing many new species, while the kinship on the border from the Triassic to the Jura became extinct.
Success story did not last forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There may have been a mass extinction that the dinosaurs accidentally survived, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted so they could beat the competition out of the field.
The success story did not last forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact helped a group of animals to flourish, which had also developed in the Triassic and since then has tempted a shadowy existence: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
Professors at the University of Toronto, University of Cambridge, University of Vienna or Berkeley, California.
Teachers from Naples are from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police evacuation of the occupied casino of Frankfurt’s Goethe University is hitting waves worldwide.
278 professors and teachers from the Goethe University, but also from universities throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America are solidarizing with the protesting students on Campus Westend.
In a statement written in German and English, they "disapproved" of the police operation initiated by the Bureau.
University President Werner Müller-Estler had the building occupied by students and lecturers in the educational strike evacuated last week because walls and works of art had been smeared.
Five students were injured.
The material damages, the signatories judge, did not justify "the violent dissolution of self-organized courses of students and teachers by a police command".
The eviction constitutes an "unacceptable interference" in the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves to “delegitimize and criminalize the protest” and distract from the content.
The Presidency has eluded the necessary discourse.
Teachers demand the immediate cessation of criminal prosecution.
The majority of the occupiers did not support the property damage, it said.
Legitimate protest
The youth of the union Verdi and the German Confederation of Trade Unions are also in solidarity with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern about one’s own future, says Verdi youth secretary Alexander Klein.
Hessen’s science minister Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) defended the actions of the uni president and the police.
We are grateful to the President.
Destruction and occupation are completely unacceptable means, she said in a recent hour on Thursday in the Wiesbaden Landtag.
We understand the protest, but we do not understand vandalism, according to CDU MP Peter Beuth.
The opposition factions SPD, Greens and Left saw this differently.
The CDU takes painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (left).
Instead of dealing with the arguments and demands of the students, it was cleared.
The Left has filed a motion asking the Minister of the Interior to report on the police operation.
New Silicon Valley
For many years it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of ten districts of the capital Moscow, was in the Soviet Union a strictly guarded site for secret arms research.
Today, the municipality with its 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometers from Moscow's center, is considered "Russian Silicon Valley".
Important research and production facilities for micro- and nanoelectronics are located here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd have established contacts with the Frankfurt-based science site Riedberg – with the university institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Center (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday Selenograd and Riedberg now signed a "protocol for closer cooperation" in Frankfurt.
The Russian delegation was headed by Moscow Deputy Mayor Yuri Roslyak and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd, for whom Planning Deputy Edwin Schwarz signed for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises of the scientific research focus will travel to Selenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
It is about continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
FIZ companies will be able to gain a foothold in the growing Russian market.
On the other hand, Russian science firms want to get orders in Germany.
Selenograd is the headquarters of important Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electron Engineering, the large corporations Sitronics and Rosssijskaya Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planning city" for arms research.
Selenograd (literally translated "green city") got its name from the wooded hilly landscape in which the research facilities are embedded.
Stuttgarter Bremsklotz
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be set high enough.
For the supporters of the project, it is simply about "the new heart of Europe".
S21 is much more than the demise of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project that will plunge the city of the Baden-Württemberg state capital into a deadly construction site chaos for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 was born out of the spirit of the 1980s.
Head railway stations with tracks ending in the middle of the city were then considered 19th-century transport fossils, which acted like brake pads of modern rail transport, as it once took an enormous amount of time to retract locomotives from the back to the front.
Getting in, staying short, driving on - that's how it should go.
And that is why the main railway stations should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a transit station located about halfway between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - hence the slogan of the "heart of Europe".
S21 is now actually being tackled, although the visions of the 80s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have realized that it is almost invaluable to implement the lowering in the Hessian and Bavarian cities.
Head railway stations, however, no longer have an entry and exit problem, since there are modern reversing trains with trains and steering cars at both ends.
Nevertheless, Stuttgart 21 and the ICE new construction line to Ulm are now being tackled.
State and local politicians have enforced it.
The railway also participates, because the risks of the largest single infrastructure project of the Republic are borne by taxpayers and not by the state corporation.
In terms of urban planning, the project is still reasonably justified.
New urban space is being created, which - it is believed the computer-generated graphics of the planners - is equipped with plenty of greenery.
For the rail transport system, S21 is harmful.
The transit station and the extension of the line are intended for passenger traffic, to which - typically the 80s - huge growth was attributed.
At the time, there was no competition for low-cost airlines.
However, modern transport policy must first focus on strengthening freight transport, since rail transport is considerably more environmentally friendly than road transport by truck.
However, the new construction line is not suitable for freight trains due to heavy slopes.
Even more serious is the fact that S21 indirectly affects many other railway projects.
About six billion euros are to be banned in Swabian.
This is the official number.
Experts believe 10 to 15 billion is realistic.
It is certain that in the next decade the money will be missing at other junctions and bottlenecks in the network.
A total of sixty major projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the extension of the 180 km long route through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987 it has been built at a slow pace on the track.
It would be imperative to press the tube properly.
But S21 will act as a brake pad.
The Rhine Valley route becomes the bottleneck for international freight transport: right in the heart of Europe.
Government examines verdict on airport
The state government has left open in the Wiesbadener Landtag whether it will go against the ruling of the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH) on the night flight ban in revision.
The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to have the more than 400-page VGH ruling legally examined, said Minister of Economic Affairs Dieter Posch (FDP).
The VGH in Kassel had on those days explained in writing that in the case of the construction of the planned Northwest Landebahn at Frankfurt Airport, the country had to re-regulate the night flight ban.
The permitting of 17 flights between 11 p.m. and 5 p.m., as the state government provides, is not compatible with the statutory protection of the population from nocturnal air noise.
The coalition must decide by January 4 if it will go against the ruling in revision.
The opposition criticized this postponement and urged the representatives of the government to refrain from a revision at the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD group leader Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called on the CDU and FDP to return to their promises made before the election to a night flight ban.
It’s damn hard if you can keep your word, said Green leader Tarek Al-Wazir, alluding to the FDP election slogan “We keep our word”.
Minister Posch rejected the accusation by Schäfer-Gümbel that the state government is still trying to get to its night flights with "right-wing distortion and trickery".
An accurate legal examination will take your time.
The coalition does not want to operate on the basis of a "rapid first impression".
We need a legally secure decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As they represent the opposition, his group’s statements on the night flight ban have never been.
U.S. banks pay back aid
The crisis-shaken U.S. major banks are stripping off their state chains.
The Bank of America on Wednesday repaid the aid from the Bank Rescue Fund Tarp totaling $45 billion (around 30 billion euros) in one blow.
And Citigroup is also planning to reimburse state aid, according to a report by the US broadcaster CNBC.
The institutions want to get rid of the restrictions that have come with accepting the money – such as the limitation on the payment of manager bonuses and the payment of high fees.
Bank of America had raised $19 billion of fresh money from investors through convertible bonds.
She took the rest from her own cash register, which was well-stocked, among other things, by division sales.
Bank chief Kenneth Lewis expressly thanked the American taxpayer on Wednesday evening: The money injection helped over a very difficult time.
The money house had peaked at the height of the financial crisis with the acquisition of investment bank Merrill Lynch.
Citigroup also wants to raise money on the capital market to relieve itself of its liabilities to the state.
As early as Thursday, the U.S. bank could announce a $20 billion increase in its capital, CNBC reported citing circles.
A Citigroup spokesperson did not want to comment.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already repaid their aid.
Quick choice
Everything went faster than I thought.
Almost two weeks after the ZDF Board of Directors had pushed the incumbent editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender out of office, the broadcaster can present a successor.
Last night, the committee wanted to vote on the personality.
Peter Frey, head of the ZDF-Hauptstadtstudio in Berlin, was a favourite.
However, there was no confirmation from the broadcaster - officially, in order not to prejudge the procedure.
However, it is also likely that it has played a role in preventing further damage to the ZDF-intendant Markus Schächter, should this proposal also not be passed by the Board of Directors.
Frey, Schachter’s candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 board members.
The result of the vote was not yet determined at the time of the closing of this issue.
Two weeks ago, Schächter had failed on the Board of Directors with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Only seven members spoke out for Brender, seven voted against him, but Brender's resignation was a harsh defeat for the fighters, but one expected.
After all, the majority of the Union in the Board of Directors had already signalled weeks before the election that Brender did not want to confirm in office.
The opposition had been organized against the editor-in-chief of the Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch.
By arguing that under Brender the news broadcasts of the ZDF had lost in turn-on rates, he refused another term of office of the highly regarded editor-in-chief.
Until shortly before the election there were therefore protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was scourged.
Recently, even 35 state lawmakers interfered in the debate, who considered Koch’s action unconstitutional.
It has nothing to do with it.
To the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and romance.
He then worked for Südwestfunk and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983, Frey moved to the ZDF, initially to the "today-journal".
Subsequent positions: 1988 to 1990 personal speaker of the editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 head and moderator of the "Morgenmagazin"; until 2001 head of the ZDF foreign policy; since then head of the ZDF capital studio.
The Greens announced a constitutional lawsuit after Brender’s resignation, who was elected Journalist of the Year by Medium Magazine on Wednesday.
Koch’s counterpart on the board of directors, the Rhineland-Palatinate Prime Minister Kurt Beck, stated last week that the countries should change the ZDF State Treaty in such a way that the candidate’s staff proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, an excerpt of party politicians from the supervisory boards of the ZDF also excluded Beck.
Brender’s likely successor, Peter Frey, had recommended the Board of Directors with a wise move – by harshly criticizing the board immediately after the Brender election.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, he was able to nominate both Schachter without loss of face for the post of editor-in-chief and the board of directors without being suspected of raising a party-goer to office.
In party arithmetic, Frey is already attributed to the left-liberals.
Studies are being dismantled
Partial success for the students: After a year of the education strike, the ministers of culture of the countries finally intervened on Thursday: At a meeting of the ministers of culture and university rectors conference, both sides agreed to want to improve the study conditions for bachelor's and master's degrees.
Students should also be able to complete their studies in the future.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the exam burden: basically, each study module should only complete with a single exam.
In addition, the workload of students should be reviewed and "a realistic and justifiable measure" should be ensured.
Politics and universities also want to simplify the recognition of exams between universities within and outside Germany.
The countries undertook to make common structural requirements for bachelor’s and master’s degree programmes more flexible.
Moreover, there should be no deviating country regulations.
Less exams
Since the start of the student protests in June, ministers of culture and university rectors have put the winged word of better studyability in their mouths.
Now, for the first time, it was filled with a specific content.
The so-called Accreditation Council decided to drastically reduce the number of examinations: "Each module usually ends with just one examination," says a 30-page paper, which is to partly re-regulate the admission of courses of study.
With the "significant reduction of the exam burden," the accreditation board chairman Reinhold Grimm explained, the aim was to "stop a misdevelopment that significantly impaired studyability."
In addition, "studyability" should in future be "the decisive criterion" in the design.
Modules such as content should be "strictly checked" whether "unnecessary constraints of students in the choice of
“Events” were avoided.
Students would have "entitlement to receive scope that enables and promotes self-initiative".
The rules should apply in the admission of new, but also in the review of existing courses of study.
These must be “reaccredited” every five years – which means, however, that it will take until 2015 for all degree programs to be reviewed.
Responsible for this are ten accreditation agencies nationwide, which are subject to the accreditation council established by the countries.
In October, the ministers of culture had urged the countries to act on the agencies in such a way that the material load is not too large and the testing regime is not too strict.
In individual federal states, universities and universities of applied sciences have already agreed with the state ministries on appropriate measures.
As the only country to date, Rhineland-Palatinate pledged additional funds for the further development of the Bologna process.
Of the money, the universities are primarily to set up tutoring programs and strengthen student counselling as well as examination and foreign offices.
The country and universities want to spend ten million euros on this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to bring a novelty of the Higher Education Act to Parliament.
According to this, only one examination is required for the completion of a study model.
The study design should be more flexible, in addition to ensuring the recognition of certificates of achievement at other universities and facilitating access to the master's degree.
By the end of next year, all courses of study in the country will be reviewed for their studyability.
The government and opposition had again argued on Thursday about the conditions of study in the country.
In addition to praise, there were also criticisms of the decisions.
The Federal Executive Board of the Juso University Groups demanded that the design of the education policy should no longer take place "behind closed doors" of the ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the educational strikes, the students should now also be "represented a word".
The future academics received support from the president of the University Rectors' Conference (HRC), Margret Wintermantel: "We need the experience of the students," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Culture, with whom the HRC discussed a joint reform paper.
The Bonn Education and Science (GEW) union did not go far enough: it demands a legal claim that allows every graduate with a bachelor’s degree to access a further master’s degree program.
On the other hand, the countries must ensure that there are sufficient master’s degree places with the best possible study conditions for today’s generation of bachelor students tomorrow, says GEW board member Andreas Keller.
Countries need to hire significantly more teachers.
However, the ministers of culture did not comment on a freer access to the master.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
Going in and out of Germany is pretty much no control..." is the starting line of a poem by the poet Werner Söllner, in which he discusses in disturbing language fragments the arrival experience of a dissident who has gained freedom but at the same time lost his language space.
Born in 1951 in the Romanian Banat, Werner Söllner had first worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as an editor in a children's book publishing house, before moving to Frankfurt in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded various literary awards, in 1993 he gave the legendary Frankfurt poetic lectures at the Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been the head of the Hessian Literature Forum in the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He caused considerable extra-literary upheaval last Tuesday during a conference in Munich, which dealt with "German literature in Romania in the mirror and disintegrating mirror of its security records".
Visibly insecure and embarrassed, Söllner read a statement in which he confessed to Romanian German writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer, his collaboration as IM for the Romanian secret service Securitate.
Together with some of the attendees, Söllner received the German Language Prize in 1989.
The recruitment attempts had begun sneakingly, first in 1971.
I am, Söllner concluded, "someone who has not resisted enough intimidation attempts of the Securitate."
The poet Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and its unprecedented literary confrontation with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene and especially the community of German authors originating in Romania is shaken by a case that marks the abysses and contempt of a political system based on surveillance and spying.
Werner Söllner is, as far as one can say according to previous knowledge, not only the perpetrator, but also the victim.
In his Securitate file, IM Walter played a role, said after Söllner's confession the literary scholar Michael Markel and referred to the positive influence of IM Walter for him.
He "cut him out" in all the points that were difficult for him at the time, according to Markel.
It is a moral need for him to make this remark.
Söllner’s statement was in the form and in front of this audience unexpected, but completely surprising is not the confession of a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian intelligence service.
Germany had been a cozy reserve for securitate spices, Herta Müller had already written in July in the time after she had read her own file, 914 pages.
The affected, one may suspect, have been speculated and in some cases probably also knew which plain name was hidden behind the pseudonyms Sorin, Voicu and even Walter.
Unlike in the case of the now very procedural inspection of the Stasi files in this country, the handling of the legacies of the Securitate surveillance is still very diffuse.
Systematic enlightenment has been undermined and hindered in recent years.
A National Council for the Preparation of the Securitate Files (CNSAS) corresponding to the Birthler Authority was established only in 1999, but the release of the files has been rather slow since then.
Only since 2005 has there been a law regulating the administration of the files.
The fact that the influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still very large was evidenced by the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller in an interview in which a former Securitate chief from Temesvar spoke defiantly about the laureate.
She has a psychosis, after all, she has only been interrogated once.
The Infamy of Power thought to be able to express itself here quite openly in the form of freedom of expression.
Certainly, as so often in connection with concealed guilt, inevitable questions arise from the case of Söllner.
The thoughtful response of the listeners to Söllner’s confession gives hope that the continuation of this chapter will be driven by knowledge rather than by blame and shame.
To the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Saturation supplement Champions League
It seemed as if a nicely dressed salesman was coming from a very nice Christmas party, where a sports goods manufacturer had distributed goodies, when the new VfB coach Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag of the equipment company, climbed into a summoned C-Class a quarter of an hour after midnight.
The man with the striking baldness was allowed to drive because of the city that was still strange to him.
Otherwise, he could have driven on his own - after all, alcohol was not in the game, and the 55-year-old was not drunk with luck either.
Had been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow the work will continue.
Or start right off.
In the words of the Swiss only three days earlier: "We have reached the eighth-finals", namely in the Champions League thanks to the 3:1 success against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not let ourselves be blinded by the success: it will be a brutal hard fight against the descent."
The "much more important task" is ahead on Sunday.
Then it is important to repeat the royal class performance in the league everyday in Mainz.
And to put off the weaknesses again revealed after the fast three goals by Marica (5th), Träsch (8th) and Pogrebnyak (11th).
Draw
The Champions League semi-finals (games 16/17 + 23/24 February/ replays 9/10 + 16/17 March) will be drawn in Nyon on 18 December.
So the joy over the fulminant successor of Babbel remained subdued.
Not only in the case of the supposed savior, who had imparted self-confidence, dedication and playfulness to the uncertain Stuttgart professionals in the short time.
I approached the players and told them to think about their strengths, and urged them to be more courageous, Gross explained the simple-sounding recipe for success that had no effect under therapist Babbel.
He has sparked some magic, Babbel advocate Jens Lehmann admitted, "when a new impulse comes in football, sometimes things happen that one would not have thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after weeks of injury break thanks to his dynamism, immediately became the best player on the pitch, tried to describe the established "phenomena" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the way the new supervisor works: "He is a man who goes through and demands discipline.
That’s what we need in the current situation.”
Under Babbel it was obviously lacking.
VfB Stuttgart is not over the mountain yet, warns sports director Horst Heldt
However, VfB Stuttgart needs Constantz above all else.
Just like Gross, players and managers also avoided overestimating the victory against a weakened and completely overwhelmed defence of Romanian guests.
They would also have won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen in the 0:4 came the bad awakening, Khedira said.
And sports director Horst Heldt warned that although one season goal was achieved, the other was still far away.
We're not over the mountain yet.
The fact that Heldt was not happy to celebrate on his 40th birthday even after the first home win in three months was due to the events of the weekend, which revived in the form of a TV interview by goalkeeper Jens Lehmann broadcast immediately before the start of the game.
There are decisions that others make and not Jens, Heldt countered Lehmann’s harsh criticism.
He had accused the board of directors of leadership weakness and had decided to change coaches under the pressure of puberty fans.
Lehmann also considered that his day off had been cancelled after matches as a sign of lack of sovereignty and resentment.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by pure egoism," Heldt bounced back and announced consequences for the final man.
I don't think they'll be friends for life anymore, the two forty-year-olds.
After all, they agreed with everyone else that without the preliminary work by the replaced coaching team, the playful and combative performance would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a large share of the success," Heldt and Lehmann said unison - and the man with the plastic bag also agreed.
World Heavyweight Fighting
Heated duel in Bern: Again and again challenger Kevin Johnson provoked world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve tough laps, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title according to the WBC version.
The judges’ verdict was unanimous.
Vitali Klitschko remains World Heavyweight Boxing Champion.
The 38-year-old champion, according to the version of the association WBC, defeated American Kevin Johnson unanimously by points on the night of Saturday in Bern (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko, it was the third successful title defense after his comeback in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was already twice world champion of the associations WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it didn’t work with the K.O. that everyone was expecting.
Klitschko expanded his record to 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice having to surrender due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept the first defeat in the 24th fight.
In front of around 17,000 spectators in the Bern Arena, the 2.02-metre-tall Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight, especially with his left leading hand.
The eleven-centimeter-smaller Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, repeatedly eluded the beats of the world champion, so that Klitschko could not bring his dangerous rights decisively to the goal.
Overall, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and only tried to get over the laps.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his beatings rarely met the world champion.
After all, he is only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who went over the full distance of twelve laps with Klitschko.
The challenger had caused some swirls before the fight in the Swiss capital.
He insulted Klitschko as a "ugly zombie" who "can't do anything right."
While weighing, the champion then got provoked on Friday to push Johnson’s sunglasses off his nose “to see his eyes.”
Fourth win after Klitschko's return
Klitschko also remained victorious in his fourth fight after his comeback on October 11, 2008.
After almost four years off, he had beaten the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered "his" WBC belt, which he had previously had to surrender battlelessly.
This year he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and Chris Arreola from the United States in September.
I only got a shot in this fight and am physically in very good shape, Klitschko had justified the quick return to the ring.
His dream, however, remains the unification of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is world champion of the associations WBO and IBF.
The belt of the WBA, however, is worn by the British David Haye, after he was able to dethrone the 2.13-metre-sized Nikolai Waluyev in November.
Haye had previously cancelled a fight scheduled for September against Vitali Klitschko.
His promotion company is already planning to fight Klitschko at London’s Wembley Stadium.
Fall of Kunduz
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green Group leader Jürgen Trittin has called Defense Minister Guttenberg a liar for misinformation about the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and the Left demand clarification from the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest findings on the airstrike of Kunduz, the opposition defence minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has alleged a deliberate deception.
The minister has said about the deadly bombing of two tanker trucks in September "knowingly the untruth", said Green Group leader Jürgen Trittin on Saturday in the ARD news broadcast "Tagesschau".
It’s called a lie: he lied.
The order to kill was issued in violation of the rules of the International Protection Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is the substance of the report that NATO had read by Mr Guttenberg, Trittin said.
On Friday, it was announced that the attack was not only about destroying the abducted trucks, but also about targeting the killing of two Taliban leaders.
In the US airstrike requested by German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein, up to 142 people had been killed or injured, according to a NATO investigation report.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left called on Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to speak immediately before the Bundestag and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Merkel must clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the government's Afghanistan policy - and whether the Chancellery, the Bundeswehr and the intelligence service have approved this new strategy, demanded Jürgen Trittin and Green colleague Renate Künast.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm firmly rejected the criticism.
The chancellery had not influenced concrete operations of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts about the Ministry’s account of the background of the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert had also become loud.
According to information from the SPIEGEL, the two Guttenberg have correctly and completely informed about the background of the tanker truck attack.
Officials had said they had denied the existence of NATO reports and withheld sensitive details from the minister.
However, the two senior officials reported that they had even pointed out several reports to the Department of Defense, including a two-page document from the commanding Colonel Klein and a field fighter report.
In the meantime, Wichert is reported to have asked in a letter for clarification of the facts, reports the "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung".
He has not received an answer so far, he said.
The ministry did not comment on the allegations on Saturday and pointed out that this will be clarified in the investigation committee of the Bundestag, which wants to constitute itself next Wednesday.
Dream worlds
Some see images and hear voices that others don’t see or hear when they are awake.
Not only mentally ill people and the drug addiction blur the boundaries between imagination and reality.
As long as it happens in sleep, everything is fine.
When we lie in our dark rooms with our eyes closed, we are free to surrender to the wildest ideas and imaginations.
However, those who experience traumatic states in waking up, see and hear things that others do not see or hear, are usually considered crazy or drug-addicted in the modern Western world, at least as a stranger.
But such images and voices are created not only in the case of mentally ill or in the drug rush.
The same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels sometimes make the boundaries between dream, delusion and reality blur.
Traumatically altered wakefulness states can occur in a variety of forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case madness.
Although triggers and effects may differ, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, shamanic rapture states, psychoses and hallucinations can be traced back to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions occur when the balance of the brain's neuronal messengers - especially dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and acetylcholine - derails and the interaction of different brain parts is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts very often occur during a schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity no longer has power over him.
The connection between delusion and dream has engaged philosophers and physicians since antiquity.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of dream in the waking state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, stated in 1861 a "great resemblance of misbehavior with dream states", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis, with all the inconsistencies, delusions, deceptions of such".
It is autumn 2001 when Henning T. turns into a comic character.
His body is two-dimensional and squeaky-colored.
Gravity no longer has power over him, he floats on the ceiling.
He feels a kick.
Behind him winged devil figures with blood-red, distorted frostbite, tooth-flashing.
They chase him, kick him with heavy, flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels the pain all over his body.
Loud, vicious voices roar from walls and radio.
He can no longer bear them, the voices that insult and insult him.
Henning T. pulls two cables from the stereo system, knots them to a loop and fastens them to a hook on the ceiling.
He climbs onto a loudspeaker and lays the loop around his neck.
Jump, jump.
The sling is loosened.
This is supposed to be a lesson for you, the voices scream in drum-feel ripping choir, "Go to the clinic and let yourself be healed!"
Today, Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychoses, the last two years ago, the first almost 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffective-paranoid psychosis, besides, he is manic-depressive, he is taking medications for depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
In psychosis, I have experienced the worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
The illusions are cruel reality
About one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in their lives, and in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, those affected are usually no longer able to differentiate between the internal and external worlds, they get into an overexcited state, which can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship or pursuit delusions.
Particularly common is hearing voices – voices that command, comment, or dialogue.
Even optical hallucinations are not uncommon.
The person affected can no longer separate important from unimportant, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like the dream, psychosis opens the gates to a flood of ideas and fantasies that originate in the deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is subject-centered, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, senior physician at the Department of General Psychiatry at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is at the center of the action, everything has a meaning directed at him.
At the same time, he gets into a passive role, he is, like in the dream, overwhelmed by the events and cannot actively shape them.
Schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A comparison of reality is usually not possible for them, the deceptions are cruel reality, awakening excluded.
Having experienced a hallucination once in a lifetime
Unlike in the dream, Fuchs says, "but the sensual and spatial structure of reality, which is perceived in psychosis, remains fundamentally preserved."
The delusional thoughts and hallucinations are rooted in reality, the alienation of the experience takes place in the real framework.
Why exactly our brain strikes caprioles, researchers still pose puzzles.
Exceptional conditions can cause any person to lose the relation to reality for a short time, says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that genes are not the sole determining factors.
Researchers assume that there is minimal brain damage in those affected.
We suspect that the neuronal maturation of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development, by a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, for example, explains Fox.
But it remains a mystery how the disorder of the neural system comes about, which also initially does not manifest itself for many years at all.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be triggers for psychosis if the disposition is present.
Also, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychoses as they interfere with the transmitter system.
When Our Brain Is Running Hot
The crazy thing is, psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive drugs to get rid of them, while others spend money on drugs to get some, says Lübeckian psychology professor Erich Kasten.
Whether deceptive images are perceived as pleasant or unpleasant is often just a matter of point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and deceptive phenomena for ten years, last year he evaluated his results in the book "The irreal world in our head".
Hallucinations are among the typical concomitant symptoms of psychoses, but also of surprisingly many other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as borderline or depression, these often also include diseases such as migraines, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer’s and skull traumas.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, even the brain of healthy people hallucinates.
Hallucinations, according to Box, are composed of memory contents that are usually held back.
They arise when brain areas where sensory perceptions are processed are overactive or inhibited; when our brain is running hot or even when stimulation is lacking.
Drugs can trigger this condition just as much as brain damage or psychosis.
But also stimuli withdrawal, stress, love sorrow or other mental states of exception.
In recent studies, up to one-third of respondents reported having experienced hallucination at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005 Sarah K. is 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and attends the high school there.
A normal girl, actually.
If it weren't for the pictures and the voices.
During the break, it can happen that a sloppy boy with long, dark hair appeals to it.
When it answers him, the classmates look at it with surprise – no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think the shy girl is a shabby daydreamer, but Sarah K. doesn’t dream, she knows that.
She is awake, she hears and sees this boy, just as she hears and sees the girl in the bench next to her.
She can even feel his presence, at least for a moment.
A pleasant feeling is that she likes the boy.
Am I crazy? she asks sometimes.
But she knows that this boy and the other deceptives are not real and disappear again.
At night, the phenomena are usually frightening
Often, the deceptions are also a burden.
When she sits in the classroom, she can sometimes not follow the teaching material because the teacher is presenting a new classmate in her eyes and ears, while he explains mathematical equations to everyone else, both audible and visible on the table.
At night, the phenomena are usually frightening.
When she waits in her dark room for the sleep that comes far too rarely and far too late, she often cannot distinguish whether she is awake or already dreaming, whether the images she sees, the frills or the girl with the bleeding cuts on her arms and legs, arise in front of her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, she screams at the figures.
Parents and friends don’t tell her about it, they would think she’s crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She passed high school last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since she contacted the psychologist on the internet, she knows very well that she is not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art of despair
If someone is socially isolated or suffers from stimulus deprivation, they are highly likely to have hallucinations after a while, says Kasten.
I suspect the brain is then underemployed and provides its own entertainment.
Sarah K., a single child, was scared of other children as a little girl, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13 that the man she calls father since she can think is not her bodily father.
Because in visual and acoustic hallucinations, the same brain areas are active, which also process real impressions and sounds, it is difficult for those affected, such as Sarah K., to differentiate between deceptive images and reality.
Hallucinations are also images that create the brain, which is why they seem so real.”
Even nighttime dream images value caste as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to recognize their delusion as irreal.
Kasten therefore advises his patients to appreciate the hallucinations as a special ability.
The boundary between dream and hallucination
In our too conscious world, imaginary experience is unfortunately most often pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief physician of the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at the Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a serious, painful disease, but it also contains positive, creative - delusion is also a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has explored the so-called oneiroid form of experience, a special form of traumatically altered awake consciousness.
Oneiroids are highly complex, detailed quasi-dreams that the experiencer considers real and which he cannot distinguish from the waking state even in retrospect.
The oneiroid state of consciousness arises in trauma- or disease-related extreme situations, for example in polyradiculitis patients who experience motor paralysis with full consciousness.
When a person is threatened by self-loss and world loss, for example by persistent, complete inability to move, he replaces the life-threatening real situation with his own, imaginary world, which is decoupled from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of boundary state between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to cope with a situation in reality, a change in the world takes place, but the real situation is present in the imagination.
An intense form of meaning and meaning in an intrinsically unbearable situation that enables us human beings to create our own ability not to perish in a state of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
The Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his oneiroid experiences in his book "Heart change" as a rescue action of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness travels for days after a heart valve operation with subsequent heart transplantation, while his body is doomed to immobility in the intensive care unit.
Claussen dives into a self-made world, visits strange times and places: he experiences himself as a bedridden, old man, aboard a train sanatorium, a robot watches over his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among nobles who make drugs from blood.
Abducted by a Greek on a motorcycle in his homeland, he surfs with his hospital bed in the snow of the Alps and meets a Korean mafioso.
It is completely absorbed in the imaginary event, everything is real, even later in memory.
For Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dream is a different state, he describes his experience.
In contrast, the memories from mental travels are still clear to me after years and in minor details.
Clearer and more intense even than really experienced.
The intensity of this experience blows the horizon of our other life-world experiences, says the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Ultimately, oneiroids, psychoses, hallucinations and drug abuse show how fragile our inner images of external reality are even in waking.
Any change in the state of consciousness, the psychologist sums up caste, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be enriching.
The snow can come
Burda
Children to take over the publishing house at the age of 27
The new publishing director Kallen is an intermediate solution: in the long term, Hubert Burda wants to give his company into the hands of his two children, he told SPIEGEL.
The holding company will continue to be 100% of the family in the future.
Hamburg - Publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the long term in the hands of his children.
Both children inherit at the age of 27 and have the firm will to enter the company, the 69-year-old told SPIEGEL.
We have regulated the details of this as a precaution.
The question of whether they are also active in the company arises only afterwards.
Also the question of whether they are able to do so.
You can't put 7,500 employees in front of your children if they're not sufficiently skilled.
This kills the children and the company as well.
Burda had announced on Thursday that he would resign from the chairmanship of the board from January, and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen has been a board member of Burda since 1999.
He was initially responsible for technology.
Later, the Treasury division added responsibility for the company’s assets and, after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer, also for direct marketing, abroad, printing and finance.
For the first time, no family member is at the head of the publishing house.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who was now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
The naming of calves also serves to "bridge 10, 15 years", according to Burda.
The holding should continue to belong to 100 percent of the family, Burda said.
With regard to the Schickedanz and Schaeffler cases, Burda said that even family businesses are not safe from the downfall: "This always concerned families who were infected by an addiction to capital, who have completely speculated and thought that they could thus rise to the very big player.
My strategy was never that.
He never had a world power dream, Burda said.
I don’t see myself as the political preceptor of this country, as it was Springer, and I don’t want to play in the World League with ‘Time’, these stores have become too big.
Perfect Beauty
Everything you want in terms of beauty and well-being is at your disposal now.
At least that’s what El Corte Inglés has undertaken, which recently opened a shop with an area of more than 1000 m2 in the shopping center in Callao (Madrid), where everything is all about personal care.
The wellness area, located on the eighth floor, is home to prestigious companies such as Hedonai, which provide depilation with laser; Spaxión, with rooms for relaxing and beauty treatments; the hairdressers Luis & Tachi, Marina d'Or with a gym or L'Occitane with their natural cosmetics.
But there is also a food department that stands out through its tea house with more than 130 different types of tea.
Enjoying a relaxing massage together with your partner while having a fantastic view of the capital, or renting the relaxation area for two hours to set up your own "beauty party" with eight friends and then relax in the whirlpool or with massages and a glass of champagne, these are just some of the many possibilities that Spaxión offers.
The total area is 250 m2, divided into 12 rooms for the latest facial and body treatments as well as for hydrotherapy.
For example, for cavitation in the fight against cellulite or with vibrating surfaces.
The gym also has this type of equipment, there are also virtual trainers who take care of the training sessions of the customers and thus offer them a completely personal training.
You start a training session by entering a personal password on a touchscreen located opposite the devices.
After that, different videos will show you how to perform your training sessions correctly.
The head of the gym assures that 15 minutes (including warm-up and stretching exercises) are completely enough to train the body muscles.
And if, after exercising your body, you still want to visit the hairdressing salon, the company Luis & Tachi has a room where treatments to regain the beauty, shine and health of your hair are offered in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to be the key words for this wellness area in the middle of the city, which is open 365 days a year from 10:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m.
The most diverse décolletés
Christmas is getting closer and closer and that is why it is once again a good opportunity to copy the look of the stars and bring their party dresses into our wardrobe.
The shape of the décolleté, which is very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the points that needs to be considered.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie has chosen an exaggerated and very complicated décolleté, one can only discourage.
Endesa and Barcelona by electric car
The electricity company Endesa has created the "LIVE Office" together with the city of Barcelona.
This is a project for the development and promotion of the electric car in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE Office" (logistics for the introduction of the electric car) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the introduction of the electric car in the city and make agreements regarding mobility by managing, coordinating, subsidizing, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVELE project is being developed to promote the electric car and should summarize opinions and measures of the areas involved.
This is an attempt to advance the means of transport of the future.
3 "Electric Cities"
However, Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are also participating in this project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government in the MOVELE project to accelerate the introduction of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
This framework agreement aims to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These activities are, among other things, activities related to energy and, in particular, to its performance.
However, it is by no means the only initiative Endesa is taking part in with regard to the promotion of the electric car.
The company participates in standardization groups across Europe and has and maintains a whole range of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees "a horizon of calm" for the automotive sector
The president of the government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, predicts the Spanish automotive industry, which is the country's largest exporter, "a horizon of calm".
During the presentation of the 2009 economic report by the Prime Minister, Zapatero recalled the measures taken by the government to support the automotive sector during the year.
"Without the plan for the competitiveness of the automotive industry, we would have a panorama of neglect and the closure of some of our main production plants today," he said.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of automotive manufacturers to continue to produce in Spain in a highly competitive industry, we can see a calm horizon for the future of this industry, which is our largest export industry," he added.
He also recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, which is part of the Global Plan for the Automotive Industry (PIA), has provided <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>800 million for projects by 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which in turn provided investments of more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 billion.
The head of government stated that these investments are intended both for the development of new models, as well as for the modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also underlined the government's measures to boost demand, in reference to Plan 2000E, which is being implemented in cooperation with the autonomous communities and the automotive manufacturers.
According to the head of government, this plan allows to reduce the emissions of new vehicles sold on the Spanish market by an average of 6%, which in turn led to a "strong increase" in registrations, which increased "by 40 percent" in November.

Mazda3 i-Stop: Eco-friendly sportiness
Mazda wants to prove that sportiness is perfectly compatible with the protection of the environment.
For this reason, Mazda recently introduced the engine’s automatic stop and start-up system, named i-Stop, on the Mazda3 model, a device that is currently only available for the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
This second generation of the Mazda 3 stands out with its good scores on the overall picture.
The finishing, the execution of the vehicle, the comfort, its road behaviour, the mechanics, the i-Stop system ...
All these aspects are "very good" on the new Mazda3.
Starting with the front seats, you can find that the front seats offer excellent ergonomics and good hold.
Furthermore, the game of the steering wheel is excellent.
Looking further at the unit consisting of the dashboard and dashboard, one can see that Mazda is on the same line as the Japanese trend towards a futuristic interior design with a variety of buttons and switches in the eye-catching colors red and blue.
This style reminds us in part of the style of the Honda Civic.
Therefore, it can be easily said that both the Mazda 3 and the Civic, both Japanese models, stand out from the sobriety of German automobiles, especially the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to outperform.
The passenger compartment of these two Japanese compact cars offers more than ever the appropriate comfort for four adults to be able to drive comfortably.
In addition to all this, there is a large and clearly shaped trunk.
The stop-and-start system is currently only available for the 2-litre petrol engine with 150 hp and a 6-speed transmission.
This engine is a real pleasure. It stands out by its subtlety, its quiet noise, its performance and its low consumption.
And for those who don’t drive many kilometers a year, this i-Stop with petrol engine should be considered because of its great comfort in gear shifting and its low consumption, even if Mazda’s diesel models are the best-selling ones.
In terms of equipment, the so-called Sportive model selected for the test drive is a special feature, since it has a much larger number of elements from the standard equipment.
Out of the series equipment stands out above all the assistant for lane change (RVM), which thereby eliminates the dead angle, but also the controls for traction and stability, the speed control, the light-sensitive interior mirror, the on-board computer with a large screen, the sensors for parking, an independent air conditioning, rain and light chrome sensors, Bluetooth and AudioFelto.
In addition, this version also includes, as if that were not enough of equipment, the Premium package, which includes the following for an additional 1,500 euros: besides other elements, especially the learnable Bixenon headlights and the sound system BOSE with CD-loader.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly outstanding in terms of the materials used, due to its driving behaviour and the variety of equipment.
In addition, those who do not travel many kilometers a year can also buy the i-Stop version, which is only available with a 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
The only negative about this model is its rather high price, which is between 21,770 euros for the model Luxury and 23,270 euros for the test-drived model Sportive.
However, in return for this high price, the Mazda3 offers us every day the highest driving pleasure.
A premiere with a lot of glamour
L. A. rolls out the red carpet of sensuality for Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of "Nine", the stars, dressed in models that look as elegant as sexy, shone more than ever.(Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as elegant as ever, opted for a dark "Lady" dress.
The Promises of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device with which you can only read your e-mails without a possibility to see certain attachments or be able to surf the Internet.
It enjoyed its five minutes of fame when it chose Time magazine as one of the products of the year.
It is rather unlikely to see it on the street, but the idea itself is of interest to young people.
Unlike the smartphones, Peek costs very little and has a very low flat rate, for example, only half the price of the flat rate of an iPhone.
After seeing the company’s success with it, it has launched two new devices: one that’s just for Twitter, the other with a lifelong free service for data, quite unlike Peek, where you have to pay a six times higher price.
Fonpeek, which was presented yesterday at the event Le Web, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same limits as its American counterpart, but has a surprise ready.
The monthly maintenance price for the phone, about 12 euros a month, includes roaming for all of Europe.
Those who travel around the world with a smartphone already know what it means to have to give up all the data in order to be able to read their emails as soon as you have crossed the country border or if you are desperately looking for a café with WIFI (or a connection with Fon).
The idea of flat rate roaming is incredibly seductive and should have been possible for a long time.
It is true that some phone providers already offer special contracts and prices for stays abroad, but in my experience you already need a doctorate in physics and good glasses to be able to read all the small print.
The European Commission’s repeated criticism of affordable roaming rates across Europe has almost always been ignored.
Outside of your own country, you are always afraid of reading your emails, and rightly so.
That a small device like FonPeek (while it’s always surprising that it has the name Fon, even though it doesn’t have Wi-Fi/Wi-Fi) can offer this type of tariff means that phone providers need to slowly but surely rethink and start considering different ways to use their data network.
Kindle is another good example of this, as its prices include the downloading of books and other queries on the Internet.
Without contract and without hook.
This is an internet-enabled device and you only pay for it once, namely at the time of purchase, and not month by month.
And that’s exactly what I also expect one day from FonPeek, a purchase option with lifelong internet access that the Peek already offers in the US.
Not because I want to buy it.
I read my emails on the phone, thank you.
Instead, I expect this because I think it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The Fetish Color of Michelle
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the American First Lady.
Even when Barack Obama took office as President of the United States, she appeared in a dress and a coat of this color and chose the same color again to accompany him in his second, undoubtedly most important moment in his life: the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama wore very similar models on both occasions: except that it was almost the same color - a shiny green-yellow -, the clothes consisted of three parts - dress, jacket and coat made of the same fabric, and she wore something large-shaped embroidered or a necklace.
It even went so far that it seemed at first sight that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the example of the Princess of Asturias and had decided to wear the same dress on more than one occasion.
However, the two dresses are very different in the fabric from which they are made.
At the inauguration she wore a lace dress and in Oslo a patterned velvet.
The accessories were also different: the first time green shoes with half-high heels and the second time a similar model, but gold colored.
The hairstyle was also different every time: the hair was put up as a hair wreath on this occasion, on the previous she wore the hair open.
75% of working mothers have had problems at work because of their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially among younger women who want to have children.
This is the result of the study "Fertility and careers of women in Spain" carried out by CSIC in collaboration with the Institute for Women.
The survey of 9,737 women between the ages of 15 and 75 leaves no doubt about this: 75% of working women see their career opportunities in the job market limited due to their motherhood.
The study reveals that there are major differences in the decision to start a family and the number of children, depending on whether the women work or not and, if so, what kind of profession they pursue.
Those of them who do not do any other work outside the home, work only half-day or do not have a permanent contract are more likely to become mothers and have more children.
In contrast, women with permanent employment, especially in the public sector, postpone the establishment of a family and maternity and therefore have fewer children.
"The women in the age group between 35 and 49 with a permanent employment have their first child on average only 3.7 years after contracting, a figure that increases to 4.1 years for women with permanent employment who have taken longer to achieve this and who have realized their contracting and the first child much later.
Moreover, the type of work also has a major impact on maternity, albeit less than the calendar in terms of willingness to conceive,” explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that must be taken into account in the age of the women at the time of marriage and the first child.
According to the survey, the age at the time of marriage and the first child is the higher the level of education.
This difference was also found in women of the same age.
For example, women in the group between 35 and 49 years of age, depending on whether they only graduated from primary school or graduated from higher education, became mothers for the first time on average with 25.1 or 32.1 each.
Furthermore, depending on their level of education, there is another difference between women.
While the women with a primary degree marry before their first permanent employment and have their first child, the women with a middle or high school degree do exactly the other way around and first seek a permanent employment and then marry and then have their first child, Delgado notes.
Diane Kruger is worth it.
L’Oréal Paris recently added a new name to its enviable list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
Starting next year, the German actress will be the image of various products of the brand and will also say the well-known advertising saying "Because you are worth it".
The main actress from "Joyeux No<0xC3><0xAB>l", one of the most elegant actresses on an international level, will thus become another famous flagship as before her Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her were the last to join this exclusive club were actresses Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millonaire").
Among the men, the cosmetics company also has only exceptional ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey <0xCC><0x81>s Anatomy") and Matthew Fox (actors of Evangeline in "Lost").
The award ceremony of the British fashion industry
The British have an important word to say in the fashion world.
Their highest representatives – fashion designers and models, both yesterday and today – met at the annual awards ceremony held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
They had all appeared on that occasion.
Ex-model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was voted the best model of the year.
The Poker Game by Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presents in "Poker of Aces" (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) to the thirty X-rays of writers who accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, also in real life).
He does not use a foreseeable and fear-inspiring genre (short biography, life and work), but seeks a propensity to the glowing heart of the Creator.
The journey is exciting and Vicent spares no fear or enlightenment.
Apart from the fact that this book is a delicious reading pleasure, it is also a moving invitation to read and read over and over again.
Here are some excerpts from the book.
On Albert Camus: "Reading his pages, I found that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost sensual urge, just as I have always felt it, without having found words for it: joy as opposed to ominous destiny, morality without guilt and innocence without any God".
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote about what he had in the blood, not in his mind, between fainting and ignorance, with a stunning poetic humor, without any sense, like the knife blade that almost killed him."
Graham Greene: "Our husband was captivated by this woman with a passion that lasted for thirteen years and in whose flesh the emotions of adultery merged with the pleasure of repentance, a spiritual privilege that consisted in getting to heaven by the detour of destruction."
About James Joyce: "The Odysseus" was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. This is one of the 8000 summits in world literature, you have to climb up the north wall, on the wall, where the best climbers try again and again."
About William Faulkner: "He was a weird chew.
He sometimes said of himself that he was the heir to a county estate owner and again other times he said that he was the son of a black and a crocodile.
Both dreams testified to a certain size."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer picked up the insane scream, which was shouted out from a bridge from that personality from Munich, so that his echo sounded into the night of the 20th century in his literary way. He did this on a journey, on which he fled from himself and with a speech full of violence to the worm world.
One day she knelt down and prayed, "My God, I beg you to do everything in your power so that I can finally stop writing like a woman."
On Joseph Conrad: "On his grave are engraved these verses by Spencer: 'the sleep after the effort,/ after the thunderstorm the harbor,/ the rest after the war,/ after a rich life one finds pleasure in death."
About Virginia Wolf: “She always had her depression in her luggage.
The husband accepted it with complete normality when she told him that Edward VII was spying on them between the azaleas or the birds singing in Greek.
No other case is known where the man had so much patience and was in love with a neurologist whose literary talent was much greater than her madness."
About Pío Baroja: "What else did Martín-Santos do than try to infuse Joyce into Baroja?
What, then, was the intention of Benet when he did not bring Baroja to the weapons of Faulkner?
What, then, did Cela do, besides destroying that man’s fame, so that he could put himself on this podium?”
Cowardly aggression
My 70-year-old mother walked through our neighborhood in the village of Fuenlabrada last week, when suddenly a group of young people between 15 and 18 years old ran alongside her and our dog, our dog is a mixed-child that we brought from the shelter and weighs just six kilos, and then out of the blue they missed two footsteps and hurt him severely.
Our indignation cannot be put into words, because it is incomprehensible to us, since the fun should be in a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal, which was of course carried out on the leash.
In addition to the suffocation attack that a woman who walked cozy, when she wanted to correct these people because of the incident, she even feared for her own life, because if such a madman attacks a dog, he may also do the same with a woman, a child, an older master, or probably even with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet neighborhood at five o’clock in the afternoon on an ordinary Tuesday.
The dog has been crying all day long.
Of course, we filed a complaint in a nearby police station, but we still have great doubts about whether that will help at all and in order to prevent any prejudices from the beginning, we just want to clarify that the cowardly criminals were Spaniards.
Our indignation over what happened has prompted us to report this incident.
We cannot understand what must be going on in the minds of these young people, that they find a cheap attack on a helpless animal funny, on an animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We do not know where the good education and respect for the animals and the people have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
In collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), the tyre manufacturer Michelin has launched a campaign to promote the use of helmets, especially among younger motorcyclists, as both companies announced today.
This initiative aims to draw attention to the importance of helmet use, as it is ultimately the only protective element that can prevent head injuries or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which "compasses far more than just designing and manufacturing products that become more and more safe every day", and further reaffirmed that it also contributes with other actions of an educational and informative nature to bring this goal one step closer every day.
This new campaign to promote the use of helmets on motorcycles, which runs under the slogan ‘To be or not to be’, will distribute posters to over 500 motorcycle workshops in a first phase to achieve the best possible distribution.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety is "a constant concern" of the company, and precisely for the reason that, as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles, they are always committed to one of their main goals must be the development of ever safer products.
Sales of small trucks rise again
After almost two years, the car market for vans finally starts to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in Spain in November represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, are the first ever increase after 22 consecutive months of steady decline, according to the figures presented by the manufacturers' association Anfac and the car dealers' association Ganvam.
However, these good figures are currently only to be enjoyed with great caution, since the reference data used for comparison are from November 2008, which was a particularly poor sales year with a decline of 60% with respect to the previous year.
However, it should be noted that, apart from the increase in the last month, the total approvals of these 11 months are still 40% below the sales figures of the previous financial year.
Since January, a total of 95,853 vehicles have been sold, but this figure includes all vehicles that make up the van market: Derivatives of passenger cars, pick-ups, vans, small vans and lighter vans/carriages.
Furthermore, the same thunderstorm clouds in the sky are still the ones that most affect demand, because even if some of the vehicles are bought by private individuals, the bulk of the sales go to small and medium-sized enterprises, which in almost 100% of all cases make purchases with third-party financing.
These restrictions, which are the consequence of the tightening of the banks' money taps, must include other factors, such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the poor economic situation.
With this panorama and unlike the passenger cars, financial support for the purchase of a vehicle of the Plan 2000E has helped little.
However, this plan is not only intended for private individuals, even self-employed and small businesses are entitled to it if they want to buy a van up to 3.5 tons with a CO2 emissions that may not exceed 160 grams per kilometre driven, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday again, Ganvam had reminded us that it was imperative for the state to pay special attention to these small trucks as well as, of course, to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The Association of Automotive Dealers predicts a similar year for 2010 as the previous year, for which it expects a sales loss (in passenger cars and off-road vehicles) of 19%.
Assistance with braking manoeuvres in critical situations is now mandatory
As with the ABS anti-lock braking system and as with the ESP stability control, the auxiliary systems for braking in emergencies must become a mandatory equipment in European cars.
In fact, they are already mandatory for all newly registered passenger cars and light vans, for the rest of the vehicles a waiting period has been set until the end of February 2011.
The measure adopted by the European Union aims to improve the protection of pedestrians, but due to their functioning, these braking systems can also help to prevent many collisions.
The task of the emergency braking assistant is to exert more pressure on the brakes in the event of a critical brake maneuver, which the system detects on the brake pedal based on the brake strength executed by the driver.
However, this system does not exert this pressure until the end.
According to a survey commissioned by the component manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles, one-third of the drivers involved in an accident before the collision did not even get to step on the brake pedal and half of them had not braked at full power.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The brake aid, on the other hand, intervenes with maximum force into the brake system and thereby reduces the braking time and thus also the braking distance that a car travels during the braking process.
According to an EU study, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be prevented each year if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency braking assistant.
There would be even fewer accidents – one in four accidents could be prevented with personal injury – once the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems become popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that (via radar or a camera) detects obstacles and warns the driver, while at the same time exerting a slight pressure on the brakes.
When the driver reacts, the system helps him to increase the pressure on the brake pedal if it becomes necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the collision is already inevitable, the brake assistant will apply maximum pressure to the brakes in order to keep the damage as low as possible.
General Motors postpones plans for Opel until January
While the staff at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been informed by Nick Reilly, the new chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April, probably on the 8th, according to Javier Ortega, the American vehicle manufacturer points out that it takes more time to complete the rescue plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new chairman of GM Europe, wants the affected side to give their approval to every single point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason, it may be that the final document, which will be presented first to the workers and then to the governments of the countries in which there are works, will be postponed until the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, GM is assured that it will make a decision in the coming days regarding the sale of Saab.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the American car manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in contact with some potential new buyers.
One of those buyers could be Geely, who would also like to buy Volvo, but the option of the Dutch manufacturer of the Skyper sports cars, which is backed by the Russian group Converg, is gaining more and more popularity.
If no agreement is reached with any of these buyers, GM could sell some of its assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it has not been sold by then will continue to be maintained.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their newest and very expensive jewel, the engineers used the Boxster S as the basis and managed to make it 80 kilos lighter, which now only weighs 1,275 kilos.
To create such a thing, they first renounced the automatic folding roof 19, which was replaced by a tent canopy roof with manual drive, thus alone you have saved 21 kilos; thanks to the aluminum doors used in this model "disappear" a further 15; by the removal of the air conditioning a further 13; in addition, the fuel tank has been reduced by 64.
Then the CDR-30 audio system was abandoned, and the missing kilo was achieved by replacing the door handles with fabric handles.
Although it is also available with the double clutch gearbox PDK, the test drive was carried out with a vehicle with 6-speed manual gearbox, mainly on the smaller roads of California, on mountain tracks that were really very curved.
With his driving behavior, you can only give him the touch flawlessly.
The reduction of his weight has in no way led to the fact that he would no longer lie so safely on the road.
It is rather the opposite: for a long time we have not driven such a small and light model, but at the same time gives you a feeling of great safety in the curves, even at high speed.
He is a small athlete, able to warm his muscles at a low gear in the required time, until we give him the orders to race, brake, recover and then take everything out of his motor again...
The car does everything we suggest with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to its steering, which is as communicative as it is precise.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
A motor sound for all tastes
The sound of his V6 boxer with 320 hp (10 more than the Boxster S) has been extremely successful and you can even increase it with the 'sport' option as well as by means of a system that can change the engine noise, which was already used for the first time in the Panamera.
The acceleration capability is unimaginably brutal, whether from standing or when accelerating again.
The suspensions are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the roads on which we drove the Boxster Spyder was already quite damaged, but the car mastered the punch holes well.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do on the entire track; and that, although we found ice in the morning at some of these curves and rolling gaps in the morning.
In conclusion, it is an ultra-light car, a car with which you have an indescribable driving pleasure, as there is probably rather rarely and there is much more in it than just a small improvement of the Boxster Ss.
The car will be on the market in February 2010 and will cost 70,831 Euro.
"Bag Girl"
The singer, a bust friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the cosmetic line Coco Cocoon and an occasional starlet at the fashion shows of 'maison', she presents her evil face with the same stiffness as her bags from Chanel.
Much more than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl", she is a "Bag Girl".
The Baskonia gives itself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral, despite the many fancy players in the team of Dusko Ivanovic, celebrated an outstanding 82-91 triumph at his visit to the complicated football field of the Maccabi Electra and thus comes in first place within his group after the great appearance of Mirza Teletovic, who with eight triples was the best of his team.
The team from Vitoria was able to replace the significant failures of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large dose of deployment and teamwork, even if they had to wait until the bitter end for their victory.
The great hits from the perimeter with 16 rated triples contributed significantly to their final victory.
The game began with the leadership of the Blues, who sat at the top of the billboard from the beginning.
Since the first four baskets of the team from Vitoria already came out of the perimeter, it could already be guessed that they had come to the playing field with well-warmed wrists.
It was English and Teletovic who were mainly responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was hardly different, only that the team from <0xC3><0x81>lava opted for an inside game of Barac and for the game of Eliyahu, who was welcomed on his return to the team with whistles and applause, which is his home, to further expand their advantage until the break (34-43).
Teletovic already started to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, even though the "minus six" score of Splitter already suggested that this would not be the Brazilian's best evening.
Nevertheless, despite the clear advantage in the break, the game was far from decided and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Vitorians once again that not everyone wins on their playing field, and thanks to the repeatedly attacking "Hand of Elias" they came back into the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the "yellows" turning the helm (50-49).
Even more disadvantages
Ivanovic's team, injured, but anything but dead, had to prepare a few moves with accuracy to get air again and with one of them suddenly came the pistol of Mirza Teletovic, who with three almost consecutive triples and with the support of English and Ribas ensured that the quarterly distance of the (54-67) host was shown again at the third end.
The Alaveses were exposed in the last quarter and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already announced that they would not allow anyone to take away from them the victory they had earned in the first thirty minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign and tried to give their team strength again by three points off the line (70-77).
Nevertheless, and although splitters were put off due to fouls, Ivanovic’s team did not give up, defended well and although the Israelis were still catching up in the last minute (80-85), the game already had a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time this season.
Injuries prevented Unicaja from being put on the forehead
Unicaja lost loudly in Greece to Olympiacos and had to hand over the lead in Group B of the Euroliga to him, in a game marked by the losses on the part of the players of Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially in the inner game, which made it easier for the Greeks to win.
The Málaga team was not afraid of the atmosphere in the Hall of Peace and Friendship, nor of the opposing team, which is perhaps one of the strongest in Europe and has a lot of money.
The Andalusians were allowed to start dreaming in the first quarter, with an aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, blinding the hosts with 12-18 in the 9th minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of being Unicaja, even though the local team with an inside game between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis managed to show the billboard in the 13th minute 22-20 in their favor, the minute in which it was almost distracted due to an action between the two Americans Beverlley and Williams were distracted.
The Greek team finally started to warm up and his superiority on both halves of the game, while leaving England's Joel Freeland due to an injury and Carlos Jiménez's three self-inflicted mistakes left clear marks on the Unicaja.
Among their players in the inner field and Lithuanian forward Linas Kleizas, with his triples, they increased their advantage in the 19th minute to 44-32.
A catch-up was impossible
The third quarter was marked by many attacks against the Olympiacos team, which proved superior despite its 19 losses and even managed to compensate for the difference of the game played in Málaga with 66-48 in the 27th minute, which in turn caused the lead within the group to fluctuate.
Unicaja tried to overlook the many failures and the exit of the Scotsman Robert Archibald, who was injured during the game.
Despite the many drawbacks for the Unicaja in the 31st minute, thanks to the spring leadership and triples of Cook and the deployment of Lewis, some hope came back to 66-57.
Nevertheless, it was actually impossible because the Olympiacos, as soon as he attacked and showed his superiority with centimeters within the basket area, could not be braked.
Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic managed to raise the basket difference to 81-62 in the 37th minute and Unicaja had to give up and had to give up the lead at Olympiacos.
How much should you earn based on your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can now find out their salary due to their profile thanks to the new application Trovit, the search engine with the most ads of real estate, job offers and cars in Spain.
The "How much should you earn?" tool calculates the salaries of users based on more than 140,000 job offers available at Trovit in Spain. Users have a form on Facebook that allows them to enter their profession, work experience , age and the city in which they work.
Already after a week after the application was available for the first time, the search engine found that the Spanish worker on average feels "badly paid", explains Trovit product manager Albert Ribera in a press release.
The Spaniards are the worst paid, according to the data that Trovit has through its search engines in the UK and France.
A British programmer receives a gross annual salary of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>45,226 and a Frenchman receives <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>31,059, as opposed to the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>24,000 a Spaniard earns.
Accordingly, a truck driver has an annual net salary of 34,247 euros in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 euros in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst-paid work in Spain is that of a waiter at 11,592 euros net annually; followed by the work of a seller at 14,725 euros and that of a worker at 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the internet in the last three months are those of a driver, half-day jobs and social workers.
Brazil calls Zelaya a date to leave
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya’s stay at its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The President who has been removed from office must leave the diplomatic mission no later than 27 January 2010, when his term of office officially expires.
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that before this date he must have left the embassy in which he had found asylum since September 21.
"He is aware that he will have to leave on January 27, as his mandate expires that day and he will have to find a new place to stay."
The broadcaster also quoted the ex-president, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the set date: "My point of view is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the backing of the government of Brazil," Zelaya said on the phone.
After the elections on November 29 (in which Porfirio Lobo emerged as the winner), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, this week he tried to get refuge in Brazil.
However, this failed due to Zelaya’s refusal to recognize the status of an asylum-seeking politician, which the “de facto” government chaired by Roberto Micheletti wanted to impose on him.
Thank you very much!
After the most tempting days since last spring, when asset inflation was the dominant sentiment in the markets, market uncertainty has returned, which is by no means surprising as this is their natural state, in an environment where brokers make decisions about a naturally uncertain future.
The measure used to stabilise the markets was to settle the debt with the direct purchase of assets and indirectly leave liquidity free at interest rates that move at zero, thus enabling banks to buy assets for settlement.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets are virtually over and, without questioning their heterodox policy on liquidity, are starting to sprinkle some sand into the gearbox, as BCE nec already did with its annual auction next week.
That is why investors are doubting the ability of the global economy to sustain economic recovery without these heterodox measures, and we are witnessing a reversal in reducing risk premiums.
The volatility of the stock exchanges and the differences in corporate bonuses are rising again, even though they are still far from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to nationalize private risks and public debt is rising again.
The US, Japan and Germany are the preferred refuge of investors, which in turn leads to an increase in the differences between the countries of the eurozone with respect to Germany.
Spain has barely been affected by this episode of instability so far, but then Standard & Poor's came and threatened with a new downward revision regarding Spain's rating.
On the other hand, a certain amount of uncertainty does not do any harm to silence the defenders of moral risk, who had once again tried to raise awareness among the world economic policy leaders of what they had caused, because they had slowed down the devastating effects that the restriction of loans led to the loss of jobs, when they should have decided a new day of action.
Nonetheless, what happened in Dubai suggests tribal warfare between the Emirs to restore power in the Emirates and development in Greece was predicted earlier.
A government concealing the public debt, elections and a new government pulling the same string.
Prodi made it in Italy after Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for ECOFIN to save Hungary from the non-fulfilment of its foreign payments earlier this year and thus allow a euro member state to no longer meet its obligations.
On the other hand, it is logical that ECOFIN has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to take its citizens into account in the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of state funds.
Yes, we are, as expected, facing an episode of normalization of risk premiums, after some excess amounts, that would now be within the expected.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as the differences in public debt increase at the same rate as European corporate bonuses.
However, should the European differences diminish and the Spanish continue to increase, then this would be a special Spanish risk.
Standard & Poor's's is a farce. While the local early indicators force a majority of the market research institutes to prefer their recovery scenarios and correct upwards their 2011 scenario, including the OCD and the European Commission, which once again do not defy long-term scenarios for the Spanish economy.
Once again, it seems to be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish stocks, although "cautious driving" is in vogue at the moment.
Connected branches
Iberdrola’s chairman, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to appear yesterday before the Parliament’s subcommittee, which these days is debating the strategy for Spain’s energy supply over the next two decades.
After his appearance, followed by the chairman of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave some hints to the press about what he had submitted to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the chairman of Iberdrola, Spain must invest 50 billion euros by 2020 and another 60 billion from that date by 2030, provided that the current nuclear power plants continue to operate.
If this were not the case, the investment needed would not be 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that we should no longer invest in increasing energy production capacity, but in distribution networks and international alliances.
From 2020 onwards, the issue will change and performance should be increased.
His proposal focuses on both gas and coal plants with facilities to capture carbon dioxide and, of course, above all on renewable energies.
In this case, he assumes that 18,000 MW more will be needed, under the prerequisitenaturally by other "support energies".
Galán, who believes that the bill for a sustainable economy just passed by the government is in line with what his company has demanded, did not in any way want to say anything against this law, such as creating incentives for national coal consumption, which would be exactly the opposite of all policy strategies in the fight against climate change.
In his opinion, "in the long term, this direction is clearly being taken, despite some"single" measures, as the chairman of Iberdrola called it.
Whatever the case, Galán believes that decisions on investments, even if they are long-term, should be made already now, as it will take some time and a stable remuneration framework will have to be created to tackle them.
Ferrovial gets the "handling" of Aer Lingus at ten airports
Ferrovial’s subsidiary for services at ground airports, Swissport, is the preferred partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for baggage service at ten European airports where it is represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement, for which no figures have yet been announced, is designed for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Government of Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a protocol of cooperation to create an innovation center for smart infrastructures.
The alliance plans investments of 20 million by 2012, of which 50% will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be the study of energy efficiency on motorways and airports.
Acciona competes with Hochtief and Bouygues for its first highway construction in Australia
Acciona is fighting for the approval of its first highway in Australia, a market in which it is already represented as an energy and water company.
The construction is a tunnel that will cost 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about 1.047 billion euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German Hochtief are its competitors.
A five-kilometre tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona to establish itself in the country as a construction company and highway operator.
The City Council wants the construction to be completed by the end of 2014.
After the administration opted for public-private collaboration (PPP is the English abbreviation) to advance the project according to a business plan drawn up by Ernst & Young, the administration is already in possession of a final list of candidates for construction and toll management.
In anticipation of the offers presented in May, the estimated investment amounts to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1.047 billion euros), with three consortia, mainly European construction companies, competing in the final phase.
The group named Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first company is one of the largest construction companies in Australia, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the best specialists in civil engineering.
The Northern Direct consortium, formed by the British company Laing O’Rourke, the Australian Transfield responsible for infrastructure and the French group Bouygues, will compete against the Acciona team.
The third and final consortium, which is in the narrower choice, is called LBRJV, formed from the capital of the Australian Leighton (subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, which in turn belongs to ACS), the local Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the French company Razel, which specializes in public construction.
The Australian market for infrastructure promises huge construction and privatizations, but has a hurdle to overcome, as you can only get access by buying a local construction company.
A strategy that the mentioned companies Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, have followed, and that the Spanish construction giants have yet to pursue.
Even ACS has only gained access to this market through its 30% stake in Hochtief, the owner of the Leighton mentioned.
Millions of Assets
Acciona focuses on this geographical area of the highest importance for the industry, where it is already well known for its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination industry.
Among other assets, it already has its largest wind farm (192 MW) in Victoria and leads the group of companies commissioned to build and manage Adelaide’s desalination plant with a budget of 700 million.
His intention now is to consolidate in these two areas and use these synergies to gain access to the branches of construction and infrastructure.
The purpose of the subterranean toll route, promoted by the City of Brisbane Infrastructure Office and called Northern Link, is to connect the western highway in Toowong with the bypass road in Kelvin Grove (see map) on a length of 5 kilometres through tunnels. This is the largest measure of straw on Brisbane.
The roadmap issued by the municipality foresees the award for the summer of 2010 and the start of construction work in December next year.
Although this toll route is already to be opened for traffic in the last months of 2014, construction work is expected to continue until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
It has two lanes in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Government of Queensland contributes 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) to the financing.
Brisbane is already a big deal for high depths.
Australia has repeatedly awarded substantial contracts to Hochtief, who signed a 154 million-dollar deal with the government yesterday.
The subsidiary ACS will use its local subsidiary Leighton to improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband network with fiber optic cable.
This improvement will provide fast internet access for 400,000 people and employ the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the King George Tower 27-storey construction project in the Australian city of Brisbane, but construction has not yet begun and Hochtief has received 129 million for it.
Also in the United Kingdom, in Manchester, it competes with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and management of two schools on 25 years.
Initial investments amount to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>75 million.
FCC Receives Order for a Tunnel in Slovenia for $64 Million
FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, has secured the construction of a 2.1-kilometre-long tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia totalling <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>64.5 million.
The company received this contract only a few days after it received the contract for the construction work to extend the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) over 130 million.
In this way, Alpine strengthens its experience in tunnel construction.
The construction work is scheduled for the beginning of 2010 and its implementation will take over 32 months.
Mrs. Rushmore receives Renfe's Advertising Budget
Renfe has attributed the advertising and marketing services for the next two years to the agency Sra. Rushmore for a sum of about three million euros annually, the railway company said.
This contract also includes the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Sra. Rushmore was selected from 16 agencies that presented for this competition tendered by Renfe, 4 of which came in the final round, among them TBWA, which was responsible for advertising for the last three years.
From now on, Sra. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
Sentence of over 63 million for France Télécom for slowing down the competition.
The competition regulator in France has imposed a fine of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>63 million on France Télécom for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean regions belonging to the country.
According to the agency, the phone provider has restricted competition on landline and mobile phones by signing exclusive contracts, pricing plans and loyalty programs for consumers on the edge of regulation.
Along with this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company has accumulated more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>560 million in penalties since 1994 for obstruction of its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday has even been increased, as the competition watchdog authority believes that France Télécom has committed similar violations in the past and has therefore relapsed.
Application trade
On the other hand, the French company’s subsidiary has followed the example of other telephone operators and has opened an application trading site on the Internet to increase revenues from businesses that do not come from the telephone connection.
Basically, this Orange application website is active in France and the United Kingdom.
You have to wait until 2010 for this site to be available in other countries, such as Spain.
The match in the Champions League has earned Madrid and Barça 476.4 million since the start.
Since its inception in 1992, the Champions League has evolved into a source of income for football clubs.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have taken 476.4 million since then, earning them the third and fifth place of the football clubs that earned the most money in the league.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League is not only a source of fame, it is also one of the main sources of revenue for major clubs.
According to UEFA, the league has allocated up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5,362.5 million to the 105 teams (of which 12 are Spanish) that have participated in this event since its establishment in the 1992/1993 season.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The white club ranks third in Europe, which has earned the most money from its participation, and the only one to have won the trophy three times, besides AC Milan.
The current Catalan champion and last winner of the former European Cup in 1992 takes fifth place.
The list leads Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams that also earned the most money from their participation in the previous Champoins League.
And that, even though they lost to Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only in third place of the countries that were able to take money through the Champions, although it has more titles than all the others (five, as opposed to four in Italy, three in England and two in Germany).
Distribution (distribution)
This obvious contradiction is explained by the complicated money allocation procedure used by UEFA.
In this fiscal year, the organization, chaired by Michel Platini, expects revenues of 1,090 million through the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA provides 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs that participated in the qualifying preliminary round (including Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who won a contest got 3.8 million from their mere presence, in addition to the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>550,000 for each game they contested.
There is also a bonus for winning (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>800,000) and a draw (400,000 per team). The clubs who have entered the quarter-finals each receive three million; the four who have entered the quarter-finals, 3.3 million.
The last four receive 4 million each.
The winner earns $9 million, as opposed to the second, which receives $5.2 million.
For example, a football club receives at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million in fixed income.
Barça, on the other hand, earned 2.5 million with his victory at the European Super Cup in August.
However, there are also the variable payments, for which 337.8 million are planned.
This money is allocated proportionally to the value of each individual television market.
The Spanish is among the first and has 4 places allocated.
Last year’s champion receives 40% of the allocated money, 30% of the second, 20% of the third place and 10% for fourth place.
The other part will be distributed depending on the number of games they play at this year’s edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for 29.9% stake in Sos
The Nueva Rumasa Group has leaked details on the offer to buy shares yesterday, with which it intends to acquire a cap between 25 and 29.9% of Sos’ capital.
A percentage that, due to the number of shares, does not force them to make a public tender (OPA).
In concrete terms, Nueva Rumasa offers <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.5025 per share, which is paid out over ten years and at an interest rate of 1% annually due to this shift.
Yesterday, the Sos shares closed at <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.85, which is why Nueva Rumasa rated the company 18% below the market value.
According to Nuevan Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real valuation of Sos.
The offer is linked to the appointment of eight of the 15 consultants.
The Jerez Group gives shareholders a period of 15 days to express their interest in the sale of their shares.
CNMV assured that it had not been informed of this offer, although Ruiz Mateos confirmed that it had contacted the Authority.
In the event of a closing, the deposit would amount to 611.7 million, while the value of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure its management.
Attempting to stay on the verge of possible purchase offers and the court quarrels of his ex-managers, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar announced the appointment of María Luisa Jordá as head of internal accounting.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a high position at the food company.
This is a newly created position, which is directly under the chairman of the group.
This is far from free of polemic, because the company is involved in a judicial battle for the suspicion of detouring more than 230 million Sos to other companies of the Salazar family.
It cannot be ruled out that Sos will move further capital over the next few months.
With regard to the Salazar loan, former advisers Ildefonso Ortega and <0xC3><0x81>ngel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) appeared before the National Assembly yesterday and confirmed that they had approved the postponement of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV approves the public exclusion tender of Paternina submitted by the investment company Mer
The National Stock Exchange Commission (CNMV) approved the public exclusion tender for Federico Paternina submitted by the investment company Mer on 9 October.
The supervisory authority stated that it approved this invitation to tender after it had been demonstrated that the conditions complied with the enforceable laws and thus the content of the submitted explanatory supplement, following the amendments of 2 December, can be considered "sufficient".
CNMV has further announced that this offer is aimed at the acquisition of 550,008 shares of Federico Paternina at the price of 7.65 euros per share, which in turn represents 8.95 % of the share capital, which consists of 6,142,786 euros in shares admitted to the stock exchanges of Madrid and Bilbao.
It has also been announced that 5,592,778 million shares have been invested, which cannot in any way be transferred until the closing of the tender and the price of which has been fixed by Federico Paternina in accordance with the legally enforceable laws.
New Vehicle Assessment Programs
In these days of bad weather and accidents, not only the car workshops deserve
Every day, thousands of vehicles involved in an accident are dragged to the workshops, where an expert must assess the damage caused and the cost of the repair.
No single accident is the same and calculating the cost of the parts and working hours can be a long and complicated task.
The calculation of repair costs of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros by hand, including parts and working hours, can take up to two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest computer tools, it is a matter of minutes
That is why almost 100% of assessors use this type of system.
Accident assessment and repair service providers collect the information they receive from manufacturers to process it afterwards and offer it to their customers in the form of a useful program.
In Spain, Audatex, part of the American group Solera, is the market leader; 80% of all expertise is generated with their products.
The other two companies that compete in the tool market for reviewing and drafting a report are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by the manufacturers is anything but easy.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, Sales Manager of Audatex, it works with 63 manufacturers and importers, each of whom provides the information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed is becoming ever greater, to the point that even more versions, variants and motorizations have come on the market in the last five years than in the entire fifteen years before.
As soon as a new car arrives on the market, the work begins for the companies.
It is a laborious task, because every single one of the thousands of vehicle parts must be cataloged and its price entered.
In addition, each model creates a "intelligent" graphic image on which you can "click" on different parts of the vehicle.
If this is a much-sold model, the work can be completed in a week if the procedure proceeds swiftly.
If it is a less common car, it can take up to three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
Among the more exclusive models, for example, they have information about the Porsche models, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini.
In terms of the fleet of vehicles travelling on the roads, it is over 99%.
For the purpose of carrying out the documentation work and the production of databases, Audatex has eight centers distributed worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, the USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them specializes in specific brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanics) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>90 million annually in the development of these databases.
Every month, they record 2.5 million data and their customers receive the updates every other day.
The elaboration of this enormous flow of information allows companies to use it in different ways and thus offer different products.
The most common use is for repairs and repairs, but depending on the country, there are also tools for managing scrap parts or calculating the fault or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide who informs about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer this offer in Spain, but in the United States.
When reviewing the products Audatex offers, you can easily get an overview of the type of support it provides to industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, the star of which is AudaPlus, a standard solution for assessing accidents for assessors.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles as well as light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the painting prices.
This tool is paid for depending on the purpose of use, i.e. for each expert report.
It will be most expensive for customers who rarely use it, a maximum of ten times a month, namely 5.75 euros per month.
On the other hand, every insurance company that produces thousands of opinions negotiates the price with Audatex.
With other products, such as AudaVIN, it is possible to fully identify a vehicle and the equipment with which it ran from the assembly belt, based solely on the chassis number.
AudaGlass deals with the vehicle windows, and AudaSubastas is an online service open to the specialist market that allows you to offer for vehicles that have been declared to be completely damaged.
Your statistical service is very useful for identifying trends, conducting geodemographic analyses or for obtaining information about the deviations by brand and model.
For example, you can investigate how many models of a particular car brand had to go to the workshop due to breakdowns or how many of them were involved in a serious accident in a certain period of time.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of computer tools.
Among other things, it distributes Gt estimates, which are also intended for reviewers and provide digital images, access to parts or prices and official working hours of the manufacturer in the same way.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damage, breakdowns and maintenance of vehicles.
The GT Guide to Expertise is a reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 reviewers and 53 insurance companies.
Their business volume has increased by 20% annually in the last three years and in 2008 sales amounted to 10.8 million euros.
At the beginning of last year, they started to also go on the international market with the opening of an office in Paris.
Audatex, on the other hand, was founded in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company’s sources, 62% of its business is in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. They work with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of which are in Spain.
Total worldwide sales of the Solera Group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) amount to $557 million, 3.35 more than in 2008.
In this country, the company has revenues of 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than in the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was worth $1 billion on the stock exchange and today its shares are traded at a value of $2.4 billion.
Since 2007, they have been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and are part of the Standard & Poor's benchmark index.
Auction of accident cars on the Internet
Last October, the Solera Autoonline Group purchased a web platform for the sale of accident vehicles and motorcycles.
This purchase meant paying <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>59.5 million for 85% of the company’s capital, which could increase to the remaining 15% next year.
The purpose of this purchase was to offer its customers more services and added value, with the opportunity to gain access to a huge international market.
This assessment and purchase service is exclusively aimed at industry professionals, such as insurance companies, assessors, car rental companies, workshops, scrapyards and car dealers, who must register before their activities.
Founded in Germany in 1996, this platform manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany alone.
Its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
Today, the website has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 reviewers.
3,000 ads are managed every day and 100 new ads are added to the Spanish market every day.
According to Spanish legislation, a vehicle whose chassis number has been deregistered is no longer allowed to drive on the roads, but certain undamaged parts may be used as spare parts.
The cars with historical value, however, can be re-registered, even if they have been cancelled after difficult government procedures.
Workshop cost estimate in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex ensures that the user receives a cost estimate in just four steps: identifying the vehicle, searching the spare part, creating and generating a cost estimate.
The ease of use of these systems is a fundamental condition, especially to convince the older professionals, who are usually more or less opposed to the use of these new computer techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, 666 of which are passenger cars, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, you need a computer with an internet connection to use.
After the model to be repaired has been identified on the basis of the chassis number, a graph of the respective model appears and then the required spare part is selected.
The user can include variables, such as the price for the working hours, surcharges or discounts, and after that he can have the cost estimate printed out and passed on to his customers.
However, AudaTaller is not a tool for assessment like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalog.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop-oriented does not include estimated working hours.
The cost of using this tool is 350 euros per year, an amount that the customer can easily pay.
The company Audatex is currently working to offer these images in three-dimensional format.
This is an innovation that car mechanics have been waiting for for a long time, since you can use it, for example, to select a door and then completely turn the image around to look at the inside.
