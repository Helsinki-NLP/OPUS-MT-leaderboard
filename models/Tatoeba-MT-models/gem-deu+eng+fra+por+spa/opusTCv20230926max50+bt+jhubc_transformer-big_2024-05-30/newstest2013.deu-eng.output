A Republican Strategy to Oppose Obama’s Re-election
Republican leaders justify their policies with the need to fight electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth by affirming that election fraud in the United States is less common than the number of people killed by lightning strikes.
Republicans’ lawyers have reported only 300 electoral fraud cases in the United States in 10 years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for conducting the elections in the individual states.
In this sense, since 2009, the majority of U.S. governments have promulgated new laws that make the procedure for registering or voting difficult.
This phenomenon gained in importance after the November 2010 elections, which saw 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills were introduced in 2011 alone, restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws also shorten the periods for early voting, invalidate the right to register as a voter on election day, and deny citizens the right to vote, for which a court file is available.
Before the 2006 elections, no U.S. state required voters to show a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to make such a claim.
In 2008, the Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the constitutionality of Indiana's law.
The Republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have promoted bills in 34 states that force voters to show a photo ID.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal ID card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, i.e. 21 million eligible voters, do not have a photo ID issued by a government agency in their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such an ID.
However, often more than a hundred dollars have to be paid to get the required ID.
The new restrictions have disproportionately affected young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over the age of 65, and 20% of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 do not have the required photo ID.
This goes even further.
Students who are seen as voters who vote more for Democratic candidates are not allowed to use their photo ID issued by their institution in several states.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more for the Republican side to use the cards issued by these clubs for elections.
Prior to 2004, no state required proof of citizenship for voting.
Arizona was the first state to introduce such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove their U.S. citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting Hispanic voices.
Because it is obvious that two out of three Hispanic voters prefer the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers in eight states in 2011 promoted laws that abolished the registration of voters on election day.
In addition, you have restricted the right of individuals and groups to assist those voters who wish to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, campaigns to register voters in the 2004 general election helped to register about 10 million citizens.
As a result of the measures adopted since 2009, the proportion of new voters registered in 2010 decreased by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers in five other states have passed laws aimed at shortening the time limit for early voting.
For example, in the 2008 Florida general election, 33% of the voters who voted in advance were African-Americans, although they make up only 13% of the state’s voters.
The same goes for the Hispanic population.
The latter accounted for only 11% of the voters, but 24% of the citizens who voted in advance.
In contrast, the whites, which represented 76% of the voters, made up only 46% of the voters who voted in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters have vehemently opposed the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
Several bills were blocked by the vetos of democratic governors.
The U.S. Attorney General has intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will undoubtedly make it difficult to exercise the right to vote.
The democratic critics denounce the party-political nature of the passed laws and see in them a clear goal of influencing the results in the countries decisive for 2012.
A 2011 report by the Brennan Center shows that those states that passed these laws make up 171 of the 270 votes required in the Electoral Board to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these legislative changes to the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Prostate cancer early detection: should the test be done or not?
The PSA test, in fact, sometimes shows flawed results, with false negative or even false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to stronger hesitation of the already undecided men for carrying out early detection tests.
Should the test be done or not?
We have obtained the opinion of two specialists.
In the studies conducted in the US, there were numerous interference factors between the control groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and make clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, concluded that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early detection.
This study also showed that after 12 years of follow-up, the likelihood of developing metastases is 30 to 40% higher if no early detection has been performed.
That is why I recommend the test from the age of 50 or 40 if you have a direct relative who already had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American descent are also at higher risk.
The most important thing is to make the right decision once a cancer has been identified.
There are cancers that are aggressive and others that are indolent.
The patient really needs to understand the extent of the risk of his cancer by showing him the possible options where prostate cancers can remain untreated if he does not affect the quality of life in the long term, and in these cases you are more likely to opt for active monitoring of the disease.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer do not receive treatment because their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to their lives.
They are suggested to be actively monitored and treated as the disease progresses.
The criteria for deciding who should be treated and who should not be treated are determined with increasing accuracy.
Therefore, I still recommend carrying out the test.
But most importantly, talk to your doctor to determine if it should be performed or not.
In collaboration with the International Society of Urology, Movember has developed a tool to assess the pros and cons of PSA testing.

Prevention of the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous remedy to prevent cancer.
Despite progress in research, adopting a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of developing it.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if everyone ate well and exercised adequately.
"If there were no more smokers, this figure would rise to at least 50%," said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Several remain completely unclear.
For the Canadian cancer society, the fight against tobacco addiction remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for several other cancers.
It seriously damages the health of people.
"Today there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," said André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after giving up cigarette, the risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half.
The weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, overweight and obesity also promote the onset of the disease.
They appear to increase the risk of breast, intestine, mast intestine, esophageal, pancreatic and uterine cancers.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against intestine cancer," he adds.
The nutrition
The organization also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
Too much of it increases the risk of developing grim or masto-colonial cancer.
Sausages should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
“The latter can damage the body cells and lead to the development of cancer,” he explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have investigated the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their investigations are currently not conclusive.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, the studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one study found the reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another showed an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not yet been clearly demonstrated.
In addition, Mr Beaulieu stresses the importance of talking to his doctor about his concerns and his family pre-stress.
"Performing an early detection test does not lead to cancer."
The Higgs boson is analyzed
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson caused some stir last summer, and for good reason.
In fact, it is believed that this boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally, it is the last particle whose existence has been predicted by the standard model - our best or "least wrong" explanation of nature and the behavior of matter - but has not yet been empirically observed.
But for physicists, it is not yet completely certain that it is really Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particle, and that it is very similar to the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
Moreover, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented this week at a major physics congress in Kyoto, but there is still no data to be absolutely sure about it.
Let’s still assume that it’s actually Higgs, as there seems to be only a slight risk of being deceived, and let’s look at what it’s about.
There is an inevitable law in this world that prevents two objects from being in the same place at the same time.
It’s not possible to violate this rule – and don’t try too hard as you’re going to hurt yourself.
For even if particle physics is a truly strange world, it turns out that such a law also applies to it: the Pauli principle of exclusion, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time when they are in the same "quantum state", whereby this "state" consists largely of some of its properties.
Based on this, the physicists divide the particles into two categories.
In one corner are the good citizens, who are called Fermione and kindly obey the Pauli principle.
And in the other, the bosons move, an evil gang of anarchists to whom nothing is sacred - certainly not this principle, which means that they can in fact be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons, according to the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley laboratories (which by the way is absolutely amazing) are divided into two groups: the mesons that we will not treat here and the "force particles" through which the great forces of nature spread and with which the Higgs boson would somehow be related.
But it must be emphasized here that these bosons are not all such exotic creatures as one might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle, then only thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon or "particle of light", which is the "messenger" of electromagnetic force.
If a particle accelerates with an electrical charge or changes direction, the electromagnetic field is "disrupted" exactly at this location, much like a pebble that has been thrown into a pond.
This "disturbance" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon and thus one of the bosons "carriers of force".
More stable field
The same goes for the Higgs boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, needs to be "disrupted" in order for this boson to appear.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen must reach very high energies, a little like a frozen pond, whose surface could only be shattered by a very large rock.
That’s why a huge particle accelerator like CERN – the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a circumference of 27 km! – is needed to achieve such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others don’t – for example, a sheet of paper would never hold on to the refrigerator by itself.
And equally, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do have a mass, while the others (as, by the way, the photon) do not have a mass.
For what can all these researches be "good," Mrs Plamondon asks?
For science, they serve to verify the Standard Model (SM), and they also allow physicists to accurately examine any deviations between the observations and the predictions of the SM.
By the way, there are numerous physicists who eagerly hope that such deviations will be found, as the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and stuff some holes in the model.
It must be said that the latter still has major shortcomings, as it does not provide an explanation for gravity (ups!) and dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter in the universe (ups!).
However, such deviations have not yet been found at CERN.
Consequences
The impact of these researches on the general population is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there are none.
By the way, in the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the Bell laboratories did not suspect that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle – who worked in the Bell Labs where the laser was invented in the 1960s, and who developed the first continuous laser (the first ones were pulsed) in 1962 – has already told us that the laser was initially seen more as a “laboratory game.”
Just imagine...
In addition, applications can also result from all the instruments that surround the research.
For example, in 1969, Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor during his work in optics.
Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor now serves all digital cameras worldwide as an "eye" and earned it the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will inevitably change our lives, but it does mean that you really can never know...
Palliative care - the best way to die... <0x7C> Le Devoir
With its committee on “Death in Dignity,” Quebec has recently discussed the delicate question of the end of life.
The debate has to be resumed shortly, although a draft law is being prepared.
However, there is still much to be done in this important area.
Le Devoir has tried to take a closer look at this.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that ate him had left him a period of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I managed seven years," he said half-heartedly, lying in his bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home in Beloeil, where he had arrived the day before.
"However, it's always a shock, you can't be prepared for it," he says.
The disease does its job: an immeasurable weakness prevents him from going to the toilet alone and even eating for himself.
Sitting at the table before a tasty lunch, he resignedly agrees to get help with eating.
Boldly, he even manages to smile and talk to the strangers who are busy around him, bring him his medications, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is that you cure my diarrhea because it is humiliating," he said.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
"In the course of our lives, we learn that a man is peeing standing," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at Victor-Gadbois home.
Returning to childhood is an unacceptable humiliation for certain people.
"It depends on the person's ability to take a step backwards," he notes.
According to several people working in palliative care, major events take place in the midst of these backlashes.
The patients who are admitted to the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home are all suffering from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, the doctors and nurses who take care of them no longer overwhelm them with so-called "healing" care.
For Ms. A., 89 years old, the worst fear is to die “consciously and through suffocation”.
But because of the disease, I really got to know my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I don't have any wishes in life anymore," she says before accepting that you put on a mask to help her breathe.
In the next few days, she expects a last visit from her son, who comes from Italy.
In the Victor-Gadbois home, a group of volunteers offer personal care and assistance with food intake.
Palliative care is used when there are no other options.
To make dying more enjoyable.
In Quebec, a bed for palliative care is available for 11,700 residents.
That is very little if you consider that we will all die one day.
Here life is continued under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors at the home.
Both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
Depending on your wishes, you can give the dying person a mouth care with brandy or Pepsi.
Diabetics no longer need to control their blood sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served Mr. X a beer that died in the course of the night.
This morning his son will drink the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help relatives and patients alike," says nursing director Nathalie Savard.
In the Victor-Gadbois home, there is no day like the other.
In addition to a 93-year-old man who enjoys the last family gathering in the yard and is well supported by his pillows while pushing on in his honor, a young man of 36 years, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two young children, dies tragically after trying everything to survive.
"For six months, three to five beds have always been occupied with cancer patients under the age of 45," says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients admitted to the Victor-Gadbois home come from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care designed to alleviate the suffering of patients when the latter have reached the final stage of their lives, either at home, in a hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois Home and the Society for Home Palliative Care in the Greater Montreal area, specialize more or less exclusively in caring for cancer patients.
It is precisely this great inadequacy in Quebec’s health care that causes several palliative care specialists to look forward to passing a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide with concern.
Since the month of October, a manifesto has been in circulation, signed by prominent palliative care personalities such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, to express their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec’s health care system is not powerful enough to ensure that everyone has the right to high-quality palliative care before accepting to switch to euthanasia.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who was in the emergency room for 14 days with great pain without any action taken to relieve her.
I fear that patients will die only because they do not receive adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients bitterly until the last day despite the worst prognoses.
Hélène Richard’s chances of survival were already minimal when she discontinued difficult chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was going to stop the treatment, she replied that she regretted that I gave up the fight, she told me.
She told me I was in the end!
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die thank the nurses that it has not granted that wish after their pain has been alleviated by a palliative care team.
However, it must be clearly stated that palliative care is not omnipotent in pain treatment.
According to Elsie Monereau, head of palliative care of the Society of Home Palliative Care of the Greater Montreal area, 8% of patients do not respond to pain treatment.
Thus, at the very end of life, doctors often resort to terminal sedation, which results in either sporadically or permanently sleeping the patient until the time of his death.
We can no longer pretend that we do not perceive this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will increasingly have the opportunity to resort to this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain is not alleviated, all say the same phrase, "I want to die."
But that doesn’t necessarily mean, “I want you to put me to sleep,” but “I want my pain to be alleviated.”
The realization of this report was possible due to a journalism scholarship from Canadian health research institutes.
Real estate scandals of great magnitude in Quebec
Road officials, major construction companies, fundraisers of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia tell each day what they know about a great “system” in which construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafiosi are involved.
An "industry" that was very expensive for Quebec's taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's strange how the system has been disintegrating since taking drastic measures," Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec MP and former head of Montreal police, joked.
The scandal was uncovered by him as a result of an in-depth investigation into embezzlements in connection with the roadworks contracts in Quebec, which the then prime minister had only reluctantly approved.
The "Duchesneau Report" established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and bribery of officials.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010," he emphasizes, "the Department of Transport alone would have saved $1 billion in contracts," because some were restraining their instincts in order to keep their share!
The Charbonneau Commission “has already brought down two mayors,” he adds, hoping that it will “show the tactics behind the individuals.”
A permanent anti-corruption unit launched in 2011
The permanent anti-corruption unit, which was launched in 2011, is also making great efforts with its troops at the government’s auditors, investigators and analysts.
In addition, the police of the "Marteau Force", which since 2009 has caused the "Canalisation Cartel" of Montreal to act more restrained in the artificial inflating of the contracts...
In recent weeks, she has been carrying out series of house searches and has raised allegations of fraud and corruption against municipal mandate holders such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, who is the mayor of a suburb.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his office as mayor of Laval, the third largest city in Quebec.
He is suspected of having repeatedly received bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Incidentally, engineers of the Montreal Road Construction Office, as well as entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, were explicitly charged.
The latter attracted attention by explaining to the Commission the operation of the "system" for the award of public contracts.
For several years, he himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal to an intermediary associated with the mafia, who transferred the money to the Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito had his hand in the game everywhere in the 2000s by giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (approximately 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to the then in power liberals.
He also confessed to having organised an illegal fundraising for former Liberal Vice President Nathalie Normandeau.
sewerage contracts, the costs of which have been artificially inflated by him
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked smoothly.
Former civil engineer Gilles Surprenant described this in detail before the Commission: in ten years, he received gifts from the construction company, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribes of $736,000 in return for sewerage contracts, the costs of which he artificially inflated.
Other road construction officials have admitted that they let themselves be lubricated by artificially inflating the bills by 30-40% with false extras.
In addition, an organizer of the mayor’s party, Martin Dumont, has accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately overlooking a shadow budget that filled his coffers with black money.
As a result of these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a serious crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first Montreal MPs to sound the alarm.
As mayor of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, she rebelled against the sale of a community property that was purchased for $5 million and resold for 1.6 million to developers in the booming real estate market.
70% Black Money in Election Campaigns
Of the investigation, which is ultimately carried out, she says that it "draws on a thread that allows to understand the functioning of the system undermined by ants in order to stop the evil and denounce the culprits."
She says the procedure is “painful, but positive.”
We are in the process of cleaning up the wound, but we would need a Montreal-only investigative unit, as well as oversight to prevent a return of the questionable practices.
How to clean.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, notes that "officials have stolen several hundred million dollars", but is above all concerned about the role of the "managers who are above the tactics in the picture" if they were not involved in the fraud!
Starting with a 70% share of black money in funding the Quebec election campaigns, he jokes: "I was told that this was only a weak drop in reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to parties to $100, which he says would not change the situation: "Until campaign spending is strictly limited, black money will be in circulation in politics."
He recommends a complete revision of the system for the award of public contracts and the financing of the parties: "We cannot fall deeper; by going to the bottom of things with courage, we can rebuild the House on a more solid basis with more controls and laws."
If this story damages the international reputation of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh at it to take a look in their own backyard...
PSG is not FC Barcelona.
This season you have taken on a new dimension with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be explained by a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of PSG.
Great players have arrived.
Every day I make progress alongside her.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
These elements encourage me to improve my level of play every day.
And with a game, this is even easier.
In football everything goes very fast.
But I'm not breaking out in enthusiasm.
From my beginnings at the center of the preparatory training of the INF Clairefontaine to my playing time at Saint-Etienne, I have always made gradual progress.
They are thus taking advantage of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The newcomers this summer are accustomed to hosting games at very high levels.
You also know that every training session is crucial.
This leads to a player like me having to offer the forehead and want to do his best.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in terms of my playing position.
He is supported by co-trainers like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the task?
Of course I do.
Ancelotti respects all technicians.
There is currently no comparable person in Ligue 1 and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He looks back on a rich experience and has won many titles with respected clubs.
He was in contact with big players.
I think he will win more titles in Paris.
I had an encouraging conversation with him in January.
I had just recovered from a series of injuries.
The confidence he has placed in me is also an explanation for my accomplishments.
What do you think of the first part of the PSG season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took us the place of the top rider.
But we're hiding in the ambush.
One of our most important goals is the Champions League: we qualified for the quarterfinals in this way.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
From now on, anything is possible.
However, we will have our word against very good European teams.
First of all, we want to be the first of our group in front of Porto, so that we can play the back game of the eighth-finals as a home game.
Can PSG become a major European club in the short term?
He already has the budget for it...
To become a major European club, Paris must win titles and make a name for itself in the long term.
This is not the case today.
Financially, the PSG is giving itself the means to make this project take concrete forms.
Would it be a big failure not to win the title in Ligue 1, as it was last season?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year, we are really keen to win this title.
Last season we were close.
In May we were disappointed because we were strong enough to win.
We finished the season with a very strong performance.
We finished with 79 points.
Usually you should be a champion with 79 points...
But another team, that of Montpellier, has made an even better season.
I think this year is the right one.
Even though the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are struggling for the title, I think we have the stuff to win him.
Do you think the media expect too much from PSG?
Given what has been invested and the players we have, it is normal that much is expected of us.
We accept this completely.
However, if we win 4-0 against Troyes in a home game and you still find something to blame, it is certainly a bit frustrating.
You wonder what people are expecting.
We could never win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona.
We are trying to create a game concept.
A team builds up over time.
We have shown strength in the Champions League.
Consider Manchester City, a club that hasn’t qualified for the quarterfinals for two seasons, and has also made huge expenses!
In terms of the invested sums, you were believed to have a 15-point advantage at the game break!
This would mean that our opponents and the French championship would be ignored.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not good last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in the month of May we will be the smiling winners and tell ourselves that we have finally won them despite all the difficulties.
PSG seems to depend entirely on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
The better to talk about a "Zlatan dependence".
That means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and scores a lot of goals.
That’s why he’s here and he proves he’s the star of Ligue 1.
Wherever he has played, he has shown that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team, we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people who surround him.
What he did is truly extraordinary.
This encourages others to improve their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone else to make progress.
How did you experience the Euro 2012 with the French national team?
Like a disappointment.
It was my heart to participate in this event.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from playing some time.
I have seen things there from which I have emerged strengthened.
Today I manage to make good matches in the national team.
This has been my hope since my baptism with the "Bleus".
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have learned our lesson, and today we must show exemplary behavior.
What do you think of the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The national coach is strict, close to the players and encourages to win.
As was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the European Championships.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the "Bleus" to Brazil.
Is the tie forced on 16 October in Spain (1:1) a kick-off match?
This game gave us confidence.
Everyone has fought for everyone else.
Before this meeting in Spain, I had never experienced a match like this in my career.
With Bitcoin it is possible to pay and sell without a bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between the parties.
Moreover, as so often in these technologies, a political vision is tangible: the belief that the current monetary system, designed by bank monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, the Bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (but convertible to dollars, euros, etc.) and a protocol for secure exchange such as BitTorrent, which allows the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers on the network, about 200,000 transactions have already been recorded.
Several thousand websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.
After Bitcoin’s price peaked at $30 in June 2011, it fell to $2 five months later, before recovering to around $10 today (the prices are listed on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing particularly impressive compared to the world trade of real currencies or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes Bitcoin as “the virtual currency with the greatest success,” “competing with the dollar or the euro,” and “similar to conventional currencies.”
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the “credits” that are used to advance in a video game that can be won or bought (and sometimes exchanged back) by playing games.
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, the trade is controlled and processed by a central authority every time.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are simultaneously custodians of the accounting book, auditors, money issuers, as well as buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Every transaction between two users actually takes place between two email addresses in the form of an email.
With the difference that the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures anonymity.
A number of data related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double encryption system.
In this way, the network can check the authenticity of the transaction.
Using the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the traded Bitcoins are present in the public account accounts account spread throughout the network.
The decisive step is to enter this new transaction into this book.
This is done through a mathematical task that is started on the computers, with the winner, who is a kind of interim central banker, having the privilege of adding that additional line.
It is a fragmentation of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file into a shorter and unique electronic fingerprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before the whole is "hacked".
The goal is to find the number that gives a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes can effortlessly check if it is the right one.
The transaction is thus permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user wants to cheat twice very quickly (less than 10 minutes) with the same money, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other would remain unlinked, as both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the problem will receive 50 Bitcoins.
To prevent inflation, this reward is regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012.
The bitcoins in circulation are thus limited to 21 million, but divisible to one hundred millionth, leaving some room for manoeuvre...
In addition, the difficulty of the task is increased with each improvement in computing power.
The life of the network has already had highs and lows.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin have been attacked and the Bitcoin deposits stolen.
“The vulnerability used does not concern the actual protocol,” assures Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced Paymium, which is a company for real money payments and uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering using this anonymous service.
However, cash also has these shortcomings.
Important actors such as Wikipedia refuse to make donations of this kind.
They are accepted by others like the blogging platform WordPress.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the accounting book and showed that almost 80% of bitcoins are out of circulation.
In November, a "mega final sale" was launched.
“Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,” says Jon Holmquist, who works for the company Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book about this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transactional network.
His Paytunia system is equivalent to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin to validate the transactions, which are cheaper as a result.
In addition, the owner manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented at the dealers, and the latter do not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
All you have to do is provide an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by a phone, says Pierre Noizat, who assures him that he has thousands of users.
There is a general trend of rethinking hierarchical systems in favour of more horizontal systems.
“It will take some time for Bitcoin to prevail, but 2013 could be a turning point,” he predicts.
The ECB’s report also provides for a reassessment of the various risks that are now regarded as high risks in the event of the currency’s success.
We moved out of Afghanistan.
And after that?
French troops have left their sphere of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the U.S. are expected to follow in late 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory and for the Afghan people to decide their future without expecting anything from us.
In particular, we have punished the Afghan farmers by considering them as terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 soldiers killed, as well as the wounded and wounded.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often also of peasants who refuse an armed foreign presence, as in the time of the Soviets.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even if they have been joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes backed by local insurgents, the latter will no longer be there when Western countries become more discreet.
The withdrawal of the French troops from the base in Nijrab, which I observed from a hill planted with almond trees, financed by French loans, was done properly.
The truck and tank convoys flown over by helicopters have reached Kabul without being attacked.
As of the end of 2014, there will be no more influx of Taliban in Kabul.
Since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996, the conditions have changed.
At that time, Kabul was empty and the country was overwhelmed by war due to the struggles of the various rebel groups.
Their takeover was then seen as a kind of liberation and a return to security.
The Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of the peasants overwhelmed by the organization al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved to this day.
Former mujahideen, the Afghan government and current Taliban have a common desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The most important figures of the anti-Soviet war came back to power in 2001.
They have turned into businessmen by confiscating government land to sell it as a building land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, thus benefiting from the massive American subcontracting.
They have brought themselves into disrepute, and most of them were not involved in the fights themselves.
As I’ve heard in the campaigns, people want a government that’s not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, just like those who were able to take advantage of American subsidies: the capital flight is considerable.
The young people are tired of the war and its ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have had contact with the modern world and enjoyed its benefits.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, the state schools are full of girls and boys.
These young people, who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders, will have to be provided with jobs.
All, including the armed parties, are obsessed with mobile phones; television with its Turkish series, which represent a modern world, is seen everywhere.
There is an army now.
Are the authorities under whose command it will be regarded as legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already trying to restore the militias in the province, which will escape the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the country of the mountains with strong local identities, should have benefited from some decentralization on the example of the Western nations, but by abolishing the office of prime minister, which existed since the constitution of 1964, the United States wanted to make it a centralized state with a strong presidential power.
President Karza<0xC3><0xAF> does not want foreign controls, especially on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and long before.
Industries have not been rebuilt, functional dams have not existed and important irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruit and vegetables.
Priority is given to the private initiative.
In a country devastated by 30 years of war, state control of infrastructure would have been necessary.
The rumor has spread that Afghanistan has immense mineral resources.
This reinforces the impression that the Western countries were only on the ground to seize it.
Mining is not possible without energy to process the iron or copper ore on site, or without means of transport for an export over the mountains.
The Chinese have almost left Mes Aynak’s copper mine, let the international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) do their excavations on the huge Buddhist site and remain the province’s main employers.
One day, it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are largely dependent on imports and exports, to restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of the French fighting forces was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls’ and boys’ gymnasiums, French Institute at Universities, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a service "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was discontinued in 2012, has carried out numerous non-profit works and measures for the rehabilitation of agriculture in dozens of mountain villages and has been carried out by a small French non-governmental organization in order to try to reach the "hearts and spirits" and the offensive task of compatibility help.
These works, which required a large number of local workers, have helped to suppress the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase of agricultural land.
What souvenir do we leave behind after military spending of two billion euros?
A much more modest budget will contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very hard in these valleys often located at an altitude of more than 2,000 meters.
The embassy has received dozens of written requests for small agricultural projects from municipalities in the province of Kapisa.
In order for farmers to free themselves from the insurrection led by foreign groups, which, according to their own statements, is their wish, the continuation of less, well-controlled and directly concerned civilian aid would be necessary in their favor.
A constitution with the crushing rod in Egypt
This is a new poker game by President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever in terms of the Constitutional Declaration, which temporarily grants it unlimited powers, it has decided to put everything on a map.
To everyone’s surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would pass its final version the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of state had granted this plenary two additional months to complete its work.
Egypt has been relying on a preliminary, repeatedly amended text for almost two years now, which weakens institutional stability and leads to a legal mess.
This new initiative has only resulted in an even stronger division of the country.
For his opponents, the president persists in his “autocratic delirium” by continuing to “break his word” and “piss the law at its feet”.
On the part of its supporters, it is assured that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and to accelerate the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period of time, forcing the brothers to renounce their plan to explain the text section by section to the Egyptians.
For the president, it is also a way to regain his public and democratic legitimacy as the protest rages across the country.
According to confirmations in an interview with the American weekly Time, Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favour.
Especially since the Egyptian people are given an ultimatum with this recourse to an hasty vote: "Either you vote for my draft or I retain unlimited power of attorney", the latter should supposedly end after the adoption of the Constitution.
Eighty-five mostly Islamist members of this Constituent Assembly passed the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of liberals have not responded to the call.
Shortly before the Declaration of the Constitution in mid-November, they turned their backs because they felt that they were unable to express their views.
Representatives of human rights organizations, religious minorities or civil society have acted alike.
In order to achieve the quorum, 11 persons, deputy members, were added in a hurry yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising that the articles were mostly adopted unanimously.
By the way, the commentators found it entertaining that the only difference of opinion of the day ... was expressed in the time of prayer, as some members of the board felt that the pendulum clock of the Constituent Assembly did not go exactly.
The text, which was adopted last night, consists of 234 articles.
Finally, Article 2, which attracted all attention, remains identical to that of the 1971 Constitution and states that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law".
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is an important demand, had hoped to replace "the principles" with "the rules", which would have made stricter application possible.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is proof of their goodwill and their respect for the other members of Egyptian society.
Hypocrisy is the answer of the liberals, who see this as a mere propaganda attack.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution takes place via other articles.
In particular, they have in mind Article 220, which grants the University of Al-Azhar an advisory function, in particular with regard to the verification of conformity with the laws of Sharia.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, this is worrying, as "people being asked to comment have not been elected and have no democratic legitimacy whatsoever.
You can see here the first signs of a theocracy."
The fears of the liberals are also fueled by the fact that the next rector of this university is likely to be far less moderate than the current rector.
“At the moment, there is no concrete religious commitment.
With this constitution, we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text are not ulemas, but academics who have been partly trained in the French system,” says Alexis Blouet, who writes a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
He admits, however, that "there may be ambiguity with regard to Article 220, since the terms used are borrowed from religious vocabulary.
It refers here in particular to the "Fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence, note].
And in the future, the question could be raised to what extent civil judges are competent to decide on it."
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is heavily criticised for the far-reaching powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argues that these are significantly reduced compared to the former regime.
Another point of controversy: the powers of the army.
In line with the wishes of the military, the review of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a National Defence Council.
Likewise, there will be no ban on civil proceedings in military courts, as the associations for the defence of human rights have demanded.
The latter also share their fears regarding the text, which they consider to be a threat to freedom.
The crime of blasphemy is maintained, and insults are now banned, which could have serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, especially for the press.
Moreover, no article refers to the protection of women, underlines Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In her opinion, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to speak on television last night, demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
The supporters of the head of state will march on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists await sacred sites, the navel of the world and a sea of brine
The Promised Land combines the glory of biblical truths, modern comfort and untouched nature.
AIF gives you the five main reasons for visiting Israel.
Prostrate before the holy places
Visit the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that all who bathe in this river receive God’s blessing.
Galilee is the place where Jesus performed his miracles: the conversion of water into wine at a wedding feast, the walking on the water, the quenching of the sea storm and the fishing.
This is where Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
Most of the temples are located in Jerusalem.
Believers take the Way of the Passion or the Way of the Cross of Jesus Christ (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The path begins at the Roman fortress Antonia, Pretorium, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the old town to the church of the tomb on Mount Golgotha, where the crucifixion site, the anointing stone and the tomb of Jesus are located.
Here, in the Christian view, is the navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of humanity.
The monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem stands at the place where, according to a Christian legend, the tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus grew.
Jerusalem is also home to the most sacred place of the Jews - the Lament Wall, the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
Traditionally, people of different faiths leave notes with wishes, which then come true.
Take a trip uphill
The ruins of the fortress Massada form the remains of the secret hiding place from enemies that Herod the Great had built for his family in A.D. 25.
They lie on a rock face in the mountains at 450 meters above sea level.
Only mountaineers can reach the ruins on their own.
Everyone else brings an aerial cable car to this historic summit.
In the north of the country at 1600 to 2040 meters altitude is the famous ski resort Hermon, which attracts countless tourists during the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain you can get there by shuttle bus.
The ski slopes have a total length of 45 kilometers.
According to an ancient legend, pagan gods lived on the summit.
Visit unique museums
There are almost 300 museums in this country.
Not all of them can be visited on a single trip.
But at least the five most interesting of them should be visited.
Among them is the Israel Museum near the Knesset (Parliament).
There, ancient Qumran manuscripts or scrolls from the Dead Sea found in caves in the Judean Desert are preserved, as well as about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
It exhibits the collection of works by the Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Acre you can visit the museum in Bad Al Basha, which houses several halls of ancient Turkish baths with sculptures of the then visitors and bath attendants.
In Caesarea, you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can admire sculptures by Dali and Rodin.
There are no museum guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free and donations are generally refused.
The fifth museum, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells of one of the most shocking chapters in history.
The most poignant section is the Children’s Monument, built in memory of the 1.5 million children who were destroyed in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
When entering the room, there is total darkness.
Stars sparkle.
And the names of the Jewish children and the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Doing something for health
The three most important recreational areas of Israel are on the shores of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
At each of the three places there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
Surprisingly, the Red Sea is also bathed in the winter months, as the water temperature does not drop below 21 °C and the air warms to 23 °C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and it is bathed all year round.
By the way, this unusual sea at 417 meters below sea level is the deepest sea in the world.
Its turquoise-blue water has a high salt content and therefore carries even non-swimmers easily on the surface.
The surrounding landscape is indescribably beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatments using salt water (natural brine) and curative mud, as well as for the treatment of skin inflammation, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to soothe stressed nerves.
Touching the secrets of antiquity
These secrets lie in the old town of Tel Aviv, the city of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through this city ran the famous sea route that connected Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to tradition, Noah built his ark here, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom he lived a long and happy life in this place.
Tourists like to stroll through the narrow streets named after the zodiac signs.
Legend has it that Fortuna is held by anyone who touches the walls in the alley with their zodiac sign.
In Jaffa you can meet newlywed couples from all over Israel and even other countries at photo appointments.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can stroll through the Roman theatre and conquer the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the most important city of Judea and residence of the Roman governors, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre now offers evening concerts and operas.
Checklist for tourists
If you’re going to Israel, don’t worry about your poor English skills: About 30% of Israelis speak Russian.
The money in the trip should not be taken in euros, but in dollars, which can easily be exchanged in shekels (current exchange rate: 1 dollar to 3.8 shekels).
In the city you usually get ahead by bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a highway and in Haifa the only subway line in the country with six stations connecting the lower city with the upper city.
In fact, it is an underground funicular.
A trip within the city costs 6 shekels regardless of the means of transport, which is enough including transfers for a trip of up to 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is observed in Israel on Saturdays.
From Friday evening until sunset on Saturday, markets and shops are closed, and public transport is at rest.
On Sunday morning, the work week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and restaurants, only kosher food is served, excluding pork, seafood, dandruff-free fish and food that includes both dairy and meat products.
Instead, you have the choice between different dishes of mutton and beef, soups and desserts (prepared with coconut milk), traditional Jewish humus paste, various sauces, fried balls of pureed beans and peas (falafel), as well as fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
For this there are many well-nourished cats who stroll cosily and undisturbed through the streets.
In the evening you can even see them sleeping on the roofs of cars parked.
The cats like busy places and do not say no to treats.
Depending on the brand, a rental car costs from $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
The insurance costs an additional $15 per day.
And bike rental costs 15 shekels per day.
Museum tickets cost an average of 30 shekels.
In numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most of the adventurers and recreational seekers came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the United States and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118,8 thousand Ukrainian tourists came to the Promised Land, an increase of 51% compared to the 2010 comparison period, before the lifting of the visa requirement on February 9, 2011.
"The big and powerful" leads to Moscow: migrants save money for language
While MPs and civil rights activists are discussing the benefits of the law on mandatory language tests for migrants, criminals are already trading with fake certificates.
Every year, 13 million guest workers come to Moscow, Saint Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to support the families left in the home.
On December 1st, a law came into force requiring every migrant worker to take a test that certifies knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this rule only applies to migrants who want to work in the services sector, in the municipal housing sector and in the retail sector.
However, according to the Federal Migration Authority, the tests will become mandatory for all guest workers in the future.
In doing so, you need to take not only language tests, but also tests into Russian history and the basics of legislation.
Language skills must be demonstrated for both obtaining and renewing the work permit.
Exceptions only apply to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
Also exempt from this law are persons who received their training certificates and diplomas before the disintegration of the USSR in 1991.
Meaning, problem and protection of rights
The entirety of the examination bodies will be under the aegis of the Pushkin Institute for the Russian Language, the Russian University of International Friendship, the Moscow State University, the Saint Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Migrants can take the tests in all cities; already more than 160 corresponding centers have already been opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce the tests was supported by the members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Authority.
Civil rights activists, on the other hand, asked the following question several times before the law came into force in the press: What does the whole thing actually bring?
What changes does the requirement to demonstrate language skills bring, both for the Russians and for the guest workers?
Above all, according to spokespersons from the Migration Agency, the aim is to reduce the number of forced labourers.
"Many are now talking about protecting the rights of migrant workers," said Viktor Sebelev, head of the Federal Migration Agency in Tajikistan.
However, your rights must be protected before you leave.
Only an organized recruitment will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Migrants with no occupation, education, language skills and medical examination are faced with problems.
Sebelev is convinced that a future migrant without language skills will inevitably encounter people with malicious intentions who, on the pretext of help, will put him in a dark, narrow barracks, where he will endure with dozens of his like months without food and documents and work 12 to 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our immigrants.
"At home, you will be promised the one, and on arrival you will be cheated, your passports will be taken and you will not receive the promised salary," confirmed the head of the Tajik Migration Agency's main labour migration department, Tolib Schwaripov.
Don't scold me, boss!
Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who want to make money in Russia admit that they not only do not speak the language of the target country, but can hardly express themselves in their own language in writing.
Of course, this is not so much their fault, but rather the evil: few Turkmens, Uzbeks and Tajiks can afford even a reasonable primary education.
Because in their families there is not even money to feed the children, let alone to buy them decent clothes, shoes and school supplies.
As teenagers, these children immediately seize the first opportunity to make money.
"It's difficult without language skills," they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Civil rights activists emphasize the following important aspect of the law.
Only immigrants with legal status are required to take the test.
If you do not have this status, there is no examination and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of the guest workers continue to be illegally in Russia.
"Welcome" or "Access banned for unauthorized persons"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, linguistic difficulties.
In addition, the legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be made quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The staff of the Russian police know that our documents are mostly forged and we are not registered, and then cases of blackmail arise.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," Tajik Umed Hushkadamov told journalists.
"Just don't shy away from the cost of fake papers"
As early as the day the law came into force, it turned out that not only the migrant’s registration documents could be counterfeit.
Some fake certificates attesting to the completion of the language test have already been seized by employees of the Federal Migration Authority.
The fake papers were printed with an ordinary color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not receive this in vain: every migrant who hoped to be able to spare the tests, paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: it costs a worker migrant three thousand rubles.
The fact that the most important immediate task is to protect the system from corruption, so that the certificates cannot be simply purchased, both officials and civil rights officials agree.
For the moment, the authorities can only promise guest workers who fall through the test for the first time that they will be given time for a basic language course.
In addition, newcomers without language skills are offered jobs in areas where there is no need for active communication with people.
Interior Ministry Ignores Illegal Arms Market
Proportion of legal weapons in crime extremely low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior plans to tighten the arms law for private arms owners.
The authorities are responding to the recent events: wounded in shootings at weddings and seven dead in the assassination of Moscow lawyer Dmitry Winogradov.
The police want to ban the carrying of non-lethal weapons in public and raise the age for possession of firearms from 18 to 21.
The proposal has been supported by the chairman of the Duma Committee on Security and Combating Corruption, Irina Yarovaja, and promised that the amendments to the Arms Act will be presented to the Duma shortly.
Not everyone is satisfied with the fact that the Russian authorities want to tackle the problems by "attracting the screws".
An open letter has been published on the Internet, whose authors - representatives of various arms associations - are demanding from the authorities to refrain from "sinless tightening".
The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is very low, said the criminal justice officer, Vasily Lesnikov, the Russian service of the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes involving the use of registered weapons were committed in the course of six months in 2012, while for the same period a total of 1,168 thousand offences were recorded.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that tightening the law for private gun owners will not prevent criminals from making use of the black market.
Currently, according to the authors, you can find every possible weapon in Moscow for little money.
Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry stresses that the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The weapons enter the black market via several channels.
There are five such main channels, says a former Colonel Viktor Baranez, who served in the Ministry of Education and General Staff for ten years.
Screenshot of a website accepting gun orders
The first channel is the army or military, i.e. weapons stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by both the Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," Baranez said.
On the second channel, illegal weapons are stolen by criminals.
Baranez explains that these include weapons stolen from both the police armory and directly from law enforcement personnel.
Other illegally sold weapons come from military weapons warehouses.
In many military camps, there were frequent explosions.
"There is evidence that in some cases it was arson to cover up the lack of weapons," the former military official said.
According to Baranez, arms manufacturers are also making a contribution to the black market.
"Today, there are countless private arms factories that are not able to withstand international competition and therefore discard the weapons under their hands on the black market, for example in Moscow," the expert reports.
Another channel of the black market is smuggling.
Many guns and rifles come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a separate, sometimes artisanal production, as well as a mafia that organizes the smuggling," the former military official explains.
Where did the weapons come from?
Experts calculated the proportion of each of the five channels in the supply of illegal weapons to the black market.
In 2011, a report was prepared by the Center for Problem Analysis and State Administration.
The experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal Service for State Statistics, Criminological Literature and publicly available data on weapons portals.
The majority of illegal weapons, according to the investigators, come from the army and the law enforcement authorities.
Half of all weapons on the black market were brought there by “the guilt of those responsible for their work with weapons,” the report said.
According to the researchers, 17% of weapons come from conflict areas, 14% from theft in the production of weapons, and 5% from illegal excavations.
A sales consultant at an arms store, who does not want to be named, assures that weapons found in illegal excavations have long since been bought by no one, as they are outdated.
According to him, it is more common for merchants to get supplies in an arms warehouse.
A weapon, such as a type TT gun, is purchased from an ensign.
The weapon is displayed and handed over through the fence.
"The dealer brings the gun to the city and sells it there for 900 euros each with two magazines," he says.
“Of course, the police are aware of everything and, therefore, if they cannot comply with the crime detection plan, they periodically carry out check purchases from dealers who offer illegal weapons,” the sales advisor adds.
"Like the luxury store"
Buyers and sellers most often find each other through acquaintances.
I had been looking at websites and blogs when someone noticed me and suggested I come to the station "Begovaya" where a person would wait for me to take me to a certain place where we could then negotiate the price.
The price of the gun I learned only there
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"To get a gun, I need a friend who has contacts," says the sales consultant. "I have such a friend, but I don't trust him."
There are merchants in the markets, but there you have to go and date with a code like "by Ivan Ivanovich, who lets you tell that the daughter has lost a tooth".
I'm even getting to some hitting rings right now about a friend I trust.
He also delivers the rings to me just because he knows I don't whistle him.
Newcomers are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military officer Viktor Baranez tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he wrote an article on the subject.
According to him, the schemes have not changed.
He got a photo album in which "everything possible" was depicted.
"I felt like I was in the luxury store," the military officer recalls.
According to Baranez, the buyer does not get the cat in the bag, but can try everything.
As a potential customer, I don’t just buy, but drive with the seller to the forest, and there we set up a target.
"I can then shoot there, and if I'm convinced that the gun has a good shot, we'll negotiate with each other," the expert describes the procedure.
Shopping from the sofa
Internet search engines show search results for websites and groups in "Vkontakte", where weapons are offered "for various purposes".
No paperwork is required and no personal meetings are required.
"You only need the right amount of money," it says in the advertisement on the website "Buy a fighter gun or rifle."
There, users place their orders and make requests.
Is it sold to minors?
"Of course without a license," user asks "Ivan" (literally quote).
"Buy a TT. Moscow", is the laconic request of "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service recently launched countless fake websites, and buyers who want to purchase weapons go to the service.
People come to feed like hungry fish and then end up in Siberia shoveling coal
Military commentator and former military officer Viktor Baranez
I have heard of the following scheme: The website is usually registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
The controllers accept the orders.
The buyer transfers the money via an ATM.
"As an answer, he receives a photo and a description of the weapon's hiding place," reports the press spokesman of the non-profit organization "Pravo na oryzhie" Dmitry Kislov.
Viktor Baranez emphasizes that in the end, you can also go out empty and get behind bars if you place a request on a website.
The Federal Security Service recently launched countless fake websites, and buyers who want to purchase weapons go to the service.
"People come to feed like hungry fish and then end up in the Siberian labour camp and are allowed to shovel coal," he says.
A makarow for $100
According to experts, the price of illegal firearms ranges from $100 to $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the organization "Pravo na oryzhie" one can buy a type gun Makarov for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait up to one and a half months.
The weapon is issued in military weapons camps by mid-range overseers.
According to the official statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, the number of offences involving illegal weapons across Russia decreased by 7% to 22.9 thousand in the period from January to October 2011, while the number of detected cases of theft and extortion related to weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
In the US, fast food and supermarket workers strike
One in four U.S. teens sit behind the box office of Mc Donald's
In recent days, there have been massive protests across the U.S. against low wages at Walmart stores and restaurants of popular fast food chains such as Mc Donald’s, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy’s, and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can predict whether the protests will continue to swell or if they will soon run out of air again.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several left-wing non-profit organizations.
In addition to raising the modest wages of ordinary Walmart and fast food workers, the organizers of the protests are pursuing the goal of establishing unions.
So far, this sector of the economy has hardly been organised in the trade unions.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, the so-called Black Friday, which saw sales in the United States attracting millions of customers, sometimes leading to handcuffs.
On that day, some Walmart employees, of whom there are 2.2 million worldwide, laid down their work and, along with trade unions and left-wing activists, stalled branches of the chain whose target group are low- and middle-income people.
Walmart sells all products, from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The goods in the Walmart stores are on average between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That’s why many of the low-paid Walmart employees buy only at their own workplace.
The prices and product range made Walmart one of the largest companies in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can often sell the goods so cheaply only because the employees are poorly paid.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, for example missing forklifts or hand scanners.
Participants in the Black Friday protests called for wage increases and expressed their anger at the fact that the contribution to in-house health insurance had risen from $30 to $100 a month.
A typical Walmart employee earning $9.5 an hour could not afford this increase, they said.
Researchers from the California University in Berkeley prove that if the company increased the average wage to $12 an hour, it would cost Walmart $3.2 billion.
That’s about 1.1% more than they are now donating for wages.
If Walmart were to transfer the wage increases entirely to customers, each purchase would cost them only 46 cents more in the future.
For them, that would be an additional expense of just $12.39 per year compared to today.
Proponents of Walmart are pleased to note that there were protests in only nine states and that these caused no losses to the company.
Black Friday lasted in its store from 8 a.m. on Thursday to midnight the next day, and during that period, Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, Walmart cash registers carried out almost 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
The company’s spokesman, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the website of the left-wing Huffington Post that a total of “less than five” Walmart employees stopped working and the protest campaign was merely “another PR trick” by the union that organized the protests.
"Free cash!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their target was not Walmart stores (which are not desirable in this advanced city and are therefore so far inexisting), but McDonald's and other inexpensive restaurants.
McDonald's says the company sells billions of servings, and yet they don't grant you sick days, and you're not being paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, Member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage according to federal and New York legislation is $7.25 an hour.
In fast-food restaurants, the minimum wage is gradually raised, but not too strongly, and on average, their simple New York employees are getting $8.90 an hour.
No one deserves less than her in this expensive city.
How it is possible to live in New York with so little money is incomprehensible to me.
There was a time when nearly a quarter of all American youth were behind the counter at McDonald’s after school, but the youth were still living with their parents.
Hardly anyone saw it as the main source of income or planned to stay there longer.
Now, in interviews with McDonald’s employees, I constantly meet people who complain that they have to live with that salary and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the Wall Street Journal forum whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. in front of the McDonald’s on 40th Street and Madison Avenue on Thursday, demanded that fast-food restaurant cashiers and chefs receive a minimum wage of $15 an hour, more than doubling the current minimum wage.
They continued to call for the formation of trade unions in the fast food industry.
The U.S. law prohibits corporate governance from standing in the way of this goal and admonishing or dismissing union members.
On the other hand, corporate governance does not make it easy for them.
However, the establishment of trade unions in the fast food industry is also difficult for objective reasons.
The main reason is the high staff turnover.
Dissatisfied
There were loud protests that day in front of many other fast food restaurants in Manhattan.
The highlight of the protests was a meeting at noon in front of the McDonald's in Times Square, where some local Democrats spoke, including City Councilman Jumaane Williams, who said, "McDonald's says it sells billions of servings, and yet they don't grant you sick days, and you're not being paid for your honest work!"
The protesters were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, mayoral candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should work together to support the fast-food employees so that they can receive a fair wage and achieve the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!"
According to the New York Times, this was the largest action of its kind in the history of the U.S. fast food industry.
However, only a few hundred people were on the scene, far from all of whom are employed in the fast food industry, in which tens of thousands work in New York.
It is not yet clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilise whole masses.
"The brain has so far been only moderately outsmarted"
The popular topic of augmented reality among fans of modern technologies is usually perceived lately by the lens of a special glasses.
Google first presented a working model at its annual conference in the summer, then in November it was announced that Microsoft had also applied for a corresponding patent.
In conversation with the head of the group for interactive 3D technologies at the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, it becomes clear, however, that the glasses were only a transit station for the company’s scientists.
It attracts the possibility of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands and creating virtual open spaces.
- Please describe briefly what research your group is doing.
- We are concerned with the interaction of man and machine, but want to expand the boundaries of this interaction.
So far, humanity has largely been stuck in the phase of working with pixels on flat screens, which are sometimes touched.
However, we want to look 5-10 years ahead and predict the radical changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are an advance, and no Xbox is sold without Kinect these days, as everyone is interested in motion control.
- What else can we expect in the future?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction to a physical level, a lot is still happening on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the output has not yet been decisive.
We try to change that, working on real three-dimensional representation systems based on various technologies, including projections.
We need to release the computer world into our physical world and make it more tangible.
However, for this to happen, it is necessary that not only the user, but also his environment are recognized.
Then we could add virtual objects to the real world much more easily.
And first and foremost, we should get rid of these shitty virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
It’s popular, but isn’t it overrated?
- It is certainly not the all-purpose solution, as it raises questions about privacy, because you do not always want to inform everyone around you about his actions and intentions.
Actually, any kind of interaction with computers is good, but each in its particular niche.
For example, in the area of controlling objects in public places, we were working on a project where we experimented with short and short gestures instead of exhilarating gestures.
The gestures were not recorded by the object camera, but by a bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but could theoretically be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But overall, the future belongs to mixed types of control, for example gesture and language.
- How's that?
- For example, we'd ask you to hand me this bubble?
They say it and point to it at the same time.
- Usually I just say it.
- Oh, that would be very hard to see.
- Does this mean that you want the user to adapt to what a machine can and cannot afford at a given time?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual approach.
I think that in the near future, we will have to work primarily on the development of new types of sensors that will enable us to capture people’s reactions more accurately.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, as they offer a good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- Based on your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your demands on modern cameras?
Is there a lack of resolution, depth, or something else?
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the main thing is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
From this point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us, as the developers of the algorithms have more work to do.
The resolution must be taken into account not only along the X- and the Y-, but also along the Z-axis.
The speed and the number of frames per second are also important.
Human movements are extremely dynamic and, frankly, the current 30 fps are not enough, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes developed a touch sensor at our Redmond lab with a controllable processing delay between 1 to 100 milliseconds, with today’s commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction of man and machine.
For my work, I needed just such a device, only without touch control and with more images per second.
- Shouldn't the number of cameras be increased?
- Kinect currently works with three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second is a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB camera.
It is not used to calculate object depth.
More cameras could possibly solve the problem...
Or amplify the problem, as more calculations would be needed.
Nice would be a flexible, Kinect-like system where we could play with different camera inclinations to see how that helps us determine a position in three-dimensional terms.
If I remember correctly, unlike Google, Microsoft did not present its glasses to the public.
Don’t you think that when it comes to applying the technology of augmented reality in everyday life, the glasses have the best prospects?
- Of course, it is not pleasant to always hold a smartphone in a raised hand on the go, but I think the best option would be a "changing" augmented reality, where we could switch from the glasses to the smartphone via a cloud,
The glasses are a personal gadget and in this lies their strength (privates only you can see), but at the same time their weakness, because an extended reality with glasses prevents you from working on virtual objects together with others.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is accessible not only to Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also to ordinary mortals.
There is one problem that critics often point out to this idea: there is no tangible reaction!
The hands feel nothing at all!
What answers does your group want to give to this objection?
- In my lectures, I often talk about the fact that augmented reality represents the seventh breakthrough in human-machine interaction.
I think the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of tactile perception.
An interesting method is currently using the second hand as a somewhat unusual projection pad.
She perceives pressure excellently!
But there are also technologies that are actually designed to give the “images in the air” something handy, for example, the interference of some directed ultrasound beams at a certain point where the finger is, creates a feeling that is currently as weak as if someone was blowing over the palms of the hands.
There are also ligaments for the wrist that act on the nerve endings in the fingers, also this is a potential direction.
- Did you try to outsmart the brain?
Make it think it feels what it should feel when it sees something?
- That's a good idea, so we haven't tried it yet.
Here is another task that we will have to struggle with for a long time, namely making a person who is physically in an enclosed space believe that he is instead in an open, virtually infinite space; here we are working on concepts with treadmills (other than in gyms), moving platforms, and large balls.
So far, the brain can only be moderately outwitted, and we still have many busy years ahead of us.
This is precisely what makes the work in the field of virtual reality so attractive for a researcher: on many topics, we are only at the beginning.
Your own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "Petersburg Avantgarde", dedicated to city dwellers who form the avant-garde of art and culture.
On the exquisite list already landed high-ranking representatives of the Petersburg art scene, whose successes go beyond the borders of the city and often find recognition in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia.
Rosbalt’s new hero is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, the red-dressed bear, who you meet at the Russian Museum, at the summer garden, at scene meetings or at vernissages.
Wherever the pictures of Kirill Miller are exhibited, they attract large crowds.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg social-philosophical artists who creates new myths.
Kirill Miller is a luminous figure of the Petersburg avant-garde in the late 80s and early 90s.
He is also a man of the city and by his presence on the street conjures up a smile on his fellow citizens and provides them with a good mood.
Recently, he grabbed a screening organ and became a Petersburg screening organ player, as he finally felt ready for this difficult role in terms of his artistic life, philosophy and image.
- Kirill, why are you always in red and not, for example, in yellow or turquoise in the city?
I chose the color red as a fashion designer that deals with the look and image.
In this world, red is the compromise between artist, image consultant and society.
In society, anything that deviates from the gray norm induces aggression and bad behavior.
But I want to get in touch with people through my provocations.
Each of my past provocations was an invitation to talk.
When did you know you had to be a painter?
- At an exhibition at the Nevsky Cultural Palace, where my work was on display.
I realized that I had to go this way.
Then the time of the old free but not officially recognized painters at the time ended, and new and free painters like me were incomprehensible.
I became friends with the painters of the new generation, that is, with the representatives of the "Gazonevshina"; from this "Pushkinskaya 10" was created, and then it was over.
I’m drawn to theater, fashion, music, everything except literature.
It was important to me to be at the heart of Petersburg's culture, where the best creative artists should gather.
In 1995 I occupied a room in Pushkinskaya 10, and there was a musical-artistic club for the Bohemians, the house of the Petersburg Bohemians, until the renovations.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember how Schnur got there with his project "Ucho Van Goga".
Schnur and his friends sang simple songs for playback, wore tight jerseys and among them was the today trendy composer Igor Wdowin.
When the group started playing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it started his great career, but he learned the basics with us.
Also the gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" have their origins in the art clinic.
Our staff and regular guests went there.
I am a hero of the past century, when culture meant something.
In the year 2000 there was a poll in the press about the award "Personalities of our city".
I won in the category "Artists of the Year" and I was at my peak.
It is not easy to work in new times according to old rules; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today, it’s easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same thing: you can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your work has an unmistakable style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and clearly express the topicality and sharpness of the thoughts.
I will have an exhibition on the subject of "The Russian Museum as Clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be social, but now it hurts and scares me to be like that.
In a clown, it blurs everything and loses its tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have grotesque ideas.
For example, let’s save the world by prescribing that everyone has to dress completely.
Now everyone is paying attention to the clothes and focusing on the outside and not on the inside of man.
But maybe you shouldn't give a man a hand, you should spit him in the face.
The deception disappears by dressing up.
We recently saw you in the role of an urban organist, a city of culture should have such a hero.
Who, if not me?
Can commercial art be beautiful?
- Nowadays commercial art must be cautious, considerate and flattering.
We see the disintegration of cultures.
In the past, people formed large groups: the Bohemians loved one and the simple people loved the other.
Now there are micro-communities, and it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred dollar note that everyone likes.
Now you have to think about who you're going to like.
Now each cult star has about 100 followers.
- To the performances of Stas Mikhailov, however, there are several thousand!
- To him come abandoned women, where the sexual-social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons, 300 people come and not 10 thousand, hence there is less management, money, and everything goes to waste.
I have followers, and the most important thing is not to cheat on them and not to destroy what has been achieved.
In my youth I painted such paintings, which even hang in a row with the works of Falk and Larionov.
I started with pictures that usually only come at the end of my career.
Nowadays, there are often misunderstandings.
It is called spiritual culture and consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture at all, that is something completely different.
I am a person of past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money to be able to paint.
This is the culture I support.
- Kirill, what's missing Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
It is said to be a servant of culture.
But not all of them can deal with culture.
It was different with the real tsars, because the tsars may not understand much about culture, but they understood that proper experts are necessary.
There are good consultants in Moscow at the moment.
In Petersburg, we have some that might be experts, but they are blocked the way, because they need high-ranking experts who evaluate the former correctly and open the way for them.
Now only your own taste counts.
The same is true of the Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and some painters therefore have to look for other museums.
- What do you think, Petersburg?
- Petersburg is not the capital of culture; in Moscow there is much more culture and a corresponding breeding ground.
It is hard for art to grow up on our stones.
We need a cultural breeding ground, because, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not right.
In Europe, there are many curious people who visit exhibitions or concerts.
With us, it is much less.
Art must be modern again, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is funded by grants from the city of Saint Petersburg
Birth in space
Earth in danger.
Global warming or collision with killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with Earth dwellers on board set out in search of a replacement planet.
In order to save humanity, the important question arises how we can reproduce in weightlessness or on the substitute planet?
There are not many choices in my opinion.
In fact, there are only two real planets that we could at least hypothetically inhabit.
"Mars and Venus," says the research associate of the Astronomical Sternberg Institute, Vladimir Surdin.
However, while conditions on Mars are comparatively friendly, the surface of Venus has a temperature of 500 degrees.
Life would only be possible at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus, i.e. in space.
The researchers first addressed the issue of reproduction in space with regard to the flora.
Already half a century ago, experiments with plants were carried out.
The fourth generation of peas bred in orbit did not differ in the slightest from the earthly species.
It was followed by the breeding of insects, more precisely of tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent to space to explore how weightlessness affects the development of embryos.
A normal chick develops.
But then the problem begins.
“The problem is that the chick needs to find hold; it needs to be able to stand on its legs and start moving,” explains Laboratory Director of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems RAN, Vladimir Sychev.
Without a solid surface, the chicks overwhelmed wildly.
Ten hours later, the instincts of the newborns completely dulled.
The chicks did not respond to light and noise.
Four days later, they simply died.
"Twice we let chicks hatch and then stopped it because it is simply impossible to work with them there," notes Vladimir Sychev about the failed experiment with the chicks in space.
The last breeding cage with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, on the biosatellite "Bion" there will be only same-sex species.
There was an experiment with rats that were already fertilized into space.
In principle, nothing special was noted.
"This was just with the biosatellites, but again it was just a single experiment, and the research needs to be continued," remarks Vladimir Sychev.
After the landing, the space rats had offspring.
So far, the problem of reproduction directly in space has not been solved.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are ripped out of their natural habitat simply cannot follow their reproductive drive.
Unlike animals, humans can do this in principle.
The Homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not carried out.
Women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was with Tereshkova.
The most valuable thing that humanity possesses is the female organism.
Our seagull flew away, and no one on Earth could have answered the following question: Does it survive the space flight?
Will she be able to give birth to a child after this flight?
"Finally, no one answered this question," said space veteran Wachtang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, just a year after her space flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrijan Nikolaev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman in space, Svetlana Savizkaya, who was twice in orbit and even did work outside the spacecraft, gave birth to a son.
Nevertheless, there is still a risk.
We have only a very few cosmonauts, who after long flights all went well and got healthy offspring.
"The more, the more dangerous it is, even when flying into orbit," concludes cosmonaut Valeriy Polyakov, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation.
And yet, humanity must look for new pathways in biotechnology, radiation protection and the generation of artificial gravity.
The hydro lab in the cosmonaut preparation center is a mandatory station during flight preparation.
Here, in a floating state, the cosmonauts are gaining routine for work in open space.
Water represents weightlessness.
Even though adults find water pleasant, it is an alien environment; yet infants perceive water as a natural element.
It is as if the little Ichtyanders testify that life on land emerged from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is in the amniotic fluid in the mother's abdomen for about 9 months, and the fact that it can then more easily get used to water.
In principle, this is logical, since from birth to the first swim only 2 weeks pass.
"That's too little time to forget anything," says baby swimming teacher Marina Aksenowa.
While for a newborn child, weightlessness is a much more natural condition, the woman does not live without gravity.
In the state of weightlessness, the abdominal and pelvic muscles recur enormously quickly and thus the ability to push the child out also decreases.
All right, let's bypass that by birth-inducing aids.
For example, the birth could also take place in a special chamber to squeeze the child out.
"But what will happen then?" is the not insignificant question of Valeri Polyakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the earth’s attraction, the organism cannot train the skeleton and muscles.
A newborn child cannot be put into a suit in orbit like an adult for training.
He will simply miss what is of elemental importance to his life.
“This experiment, which we are jointly undertaking, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead us to give birth to a disabled, a completely inappropriate human being,” predicts the head of the Bioethics Commission of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems, Igor Pestow.
So far, the birth of children in space is mere theory.
Eventually, however, it becomes a reality when the Earth-dwellers in their spaceships depart for a distant planet that will be the home of their offspring born in space.
NK<0xC3><0x9A> chief: Black system control fails due to political fault
The Czech Republic has good control bodies and adequate laws in relation to public contracts, but it is lagging behind in its application.
In a conversation for Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz, the vice-president of the Supreme Control Office (Nejvy<0xC5><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1>í kontrolní ú<0xC5><0x99>ad, NK<0xC3><0x9A>), Miloslav Kala, said.
"A law is never perfect, but it has to be applied correctly - and I don't think this is the case with us," Kala commented on the current situation.
A similar result appears to be a joint control by Czech and German auditors.
As a negative practical example, he cites the attitude of Prime Minister Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as to the so-called "black system".
Recently, the prime minister said that the ODS would not harass entrepreneurs with controls - so is the system now banned or allowed?
"A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then the head of government cannot simply come, and the control office, whose duty is to check compliance with the law, hinders its activity," Kala notes.
At the meeting of the Control Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, you discussed a joint Czech-German project in which the laws of both countries regarding public procurement were compared.
What was it specifically about?
This is a parallel test that we started about two years ago.
To put it simply, it is about the European legislature determining how public procurement is to be handled, on which national legislation builds, and finally there is the actual practical application.
We compared all of this with each other, and although the test has not yet been completed, we were able to find extremely interesting differences. Generally speaking, the laws here may even be a little more "strict and perfect", but the actual application is better in Germany in some parameters.
This confirms that it is not enough to establish new and more precise rules over and over again, but also to deal with the actual application of the law.
How can the project help you? What results for you from this project?
It is precisely this joint control that could help us to stop constantly striving to perfect the laws and to lower and austere thresholds if this does not seem to have a particularly positive effect.
Economic efficiency means acquiring a thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and excluding unlawful enrichment or even criminal acts.
But lowering thresholds for orders does not guarantee that we will achieve this goal.
Perhaps it is even the case that in this way we only burden the system with excessive "paperwork," and those who look for gaps in the system will have it much easier to exploit the system than if the thresholds remained higher.
They talk about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech Procurement Act.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar authority here as our NK<0xC3><0x9A>, or does the system work differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the German counterpart to the NK<0xC3><0x9A> is the Federal Court of Accounts, which is similar in structure to ours and also has a college, which is formed only slightly differently.
The competences are also comparable to a certain extent, but Germany is a federal state, i.e. these accounting courts also exist in the individual federal states - in this the German system differs from ours.
The Federal Republic of Germany is only allowed to control federal funds, which corresponds to our state funds.
Public funds, which are managed by the districts and municipalities, are subject to the control of the state accounting courts.
As far as German legislation is concerned, is it easier than ours?
In general, I would be reluctant to compare this without specific information. Nevertheless, in some respects Germany is often referred to as a model, but it is certainly not possible to say that Germany is better in everything.
Is it because the investigators are better?
Certainly not, but as I said, I don’t particularly like comparisons like that.
It should also be noted that those countries that set an example for us are also struggling with problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't have any cooperation with our agency, would they?
As far as Czech legislation is concerned, what was the significance for your authority of the amendment of the Public Procurement Act, do you already feel any impact?
Given that this novella is only in force for a short time, it has not yet had any effect on our tests.
Since our checks take place afterwards, you have to expect a certain delay here.
So far, we are more likely to experience an impact in the preparatory phase of future controls - for example, we have introduced the new control instrument "Identification of risks of uneconomicity" and with it almost 14,000 public contracts are examined and analyzed - here the changes will of course have an impact, as the thresholds change, the conditions for certain types of tenders have been modified, among other things.
Do you see the adoption of this law as rather positive, or is the system burdened with further bureaucracy?
I think this law is definitely a step in the right direction and I hope that this assumption is confirmed.
However, the problem may arise that the rules become "stricter" and can no longer be adhered to.
Already under the previous rules, persons subject to an audit are liable to the institution (for example, in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council) to the extent that any non-compliance with the Procurement Act is equivalent to a violation of budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense to make the law even stricter?
I do not think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system, and not punish those who have committed a form error that does not affect actual decision-making.
Such a system merely puts the bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where's the way out?
First, let us say which path is not effective.
The prime minister recently said that the ODS would not bother the entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called "black system" - what exactly does that mean?
Is the black system banned or allowed?
After all, a law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then the head of government cannot simply come, and the supervisory office, whose duty is to check compliance with the law, can hinder its activity.
He can say, “We change the law and allow the thing,” but he can’t say that we’re pretending to be nothing.
The Procurement Act contains relatively strict rules on the formal execution of certain operations - and this is also true for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, it is also tragic if the bidder with the best offer is excluded due to form defects alone.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be properly applied - and that's what I think we lack.
There are occasional ice sheets on the streets, but they are predominantly dry.
On the streets of the Czech Republic there is some snow and ice smoothing.
Most of the time, however, the roads are easy to navigate, sometimes increased caution is required.
Karlovy Vary
In the district of Karlovy Vary, the roads were easy to navigate this morning, occasionally there was snow and ice smoothing.
The temperatures dropped to -5 to -10 °C, during the day it should get a little warmer.
In the region it is no longer snowing, and in the lower altitudes only a thin snow cover remains.
However, there is about 30 cm of snow on the ridges of the Ore Mountains.
According to the district street guard, there was limited visibility due to fog.
The R6 highway and the traffic routes of the first road class in the region are currently unrestricted.
However, attention is needed, for example, on bridges on which the roadways are sometimes iced and smooth.
All roads of the second and third class are also accessible, including mountain roads.
On these roads, however, iced or extended snow remains remain in sections.
In particular in the higher layers, therefore, increased attention is required.
Districts Pardubice and Hradec Králové
On some roads in eastern Bohemia there is a danger of ice-smoothing, in elevated locations and in the mountains there is sometimes still an extended layer of snow on the roads, the Road and Highway Directorate announces on their websites.
The road championships warn drivers against ice smoothing, which can occur in particular in higher locations in the Pardubice district.
Ice smoothing can be achieved in particular on second and third-class roads in the districts of Lan<0xC5><0xA1>kroun, <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Orlicí, Poli<0xC4><0x8D>ka, Svitavy and Vysoké M<0xC3><0xBD>to.
Roads I/43 and I/34 at Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow lies especially on the roads in the Giant Mountains and in the Orlické Hory Mountains.
An extended layer of snow lies at elevation on the streets of the districts Rychnov nad Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>nou and Trutnov.
In Eastern Bohemia today it is mostly sunny or cheerful, and it remains largely free of precipitation.
The temperatures range between -3 and +1 °C, there is a slight wind.
Pilsen
The roads in the district of Plze<0xC5><0x88> are now easy to navigate, but increased attention is needed locally, and the driving method must be adapted to the weather.
This is frosty in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below freezing.
Since it snowed before and the temperatures subsequently fell, it can become ice-smooth on the roads.
Local fog is also to be expected, but the visibility will improve over the course of the day.
This information comes from the district roadmasters.
The D5 motorway is practically unrestricted, but increased attention is recommended by the road championships between the 80th and the 131st kilometers.
The roads of the first class are mostly dry, but frozen through.
In the south of the districts of Pilsen and Tachov, however, ice smoothing can occur in sections.
The lanes of the second and third class of roads are wet, and therefore the reference to possible icy sections applies here too.
Drivers should be especially careful on the less frequented roads in the Bohemian Forest area.
Olomouc District
Nowadays, drivers who are traveling towards the elevations in the district of Olomouc have to reckon with snow-machine.
After the use of scattered vehicles, Schneematsch remains on the <0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské sedlo pass and on the road in the direction of Videlsk<0xC3><0xBD> k<0xC5><0x99>í<0xC5><0xBE>.
Night snow drift forced the road championships to be used, in the district of <0xC5><0xA0>umperk fell about 3 cm of new snow, according to the road administration.
In the other areas of the district, the roads are usually unrestricted.
"In the district of <0xC5><0xA0>umperk, snow remains in the elevations.
On the <0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské sedlo pass, the drivers have to expect snowshoeing in the direction of Jeseník," said an employee of the road administration <0xC5><0xA0>umperk today to the agency <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
Her colleagues in Jeseník County also had to get out at night, according to their reports, the roads are free and wet to the heights after chemical treatment.
In the district of Olomouc, the roads are unrestricted, but in the district of <0xC5><0xA0>ternberk, the drivers have to drive cautiously in forest sections, because here the roads are still wet.
<0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem District, Liberec District
In northern Bohemia, the road championships report several poorly passable sections of the road.
In addition to several places with snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice in the district of <0xC3><0x9A>stí n.K. is closed, according to the traffic police.
Temperatures also remain below zero at lower altitudes, so snow and ice will remain on the roads, but no problems have been reported from the lowlands, especially southeast of the Bohemian Central Mountains, and the roads are usually dry there.
No traffic disturbances have been reported so far.
Ice levelling is reported in particular from the vicinity of <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>tí.
According to meteorologists, there were ideal conditions for this at night - during the day rain and melting snow, at night cloudless sky and frost.
Bad traffic conditions are reported from the main routes and from the road I/13 on the border of the districts of <0xC3><0x9A>stí n.L. and Liberec.
The road between Telnice and Knínice was blocked due to branches being pushed from the snow load to the road.
<0xC5><0xA0>imon Ornest: We want to gather positive energy at our concerts
What do you think about the end of the world taking place in less than a month?
This is one of those disaster messages that we humans so much like to jump to.
With our band The Tap Tap, we are more likely to make fun of it and say that we are the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to stop or prevent the end of the world.
In December, you will also realize a unique project with three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce the project to our readers?
This is a nationwide benefit event that we have been planning for two years.
For this, we want to use the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, whose end is forecast for December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
The day before, i.e. on 20 December, three concerts will take place simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava from 21:00.
The end of the concerts is supposed to be about the time when on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is in a time zone around 12 hours ahead of us, the Mayan calendar ends.
From whom does this idea come?
Originally from me, then we designed the idea together with our graphic designer Honza Augusta.
Not only do we want to gather enough positive energy to prevent the end of the world, but we also want to think together with the public about the state in which we will once hand this world over to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, t-shirts, bags and keychains against the end of the world, whose purchases through www.e-tap.cz can also support us.
The band The Tap Tap, along with other artists, has also recorded the so-called hymn against the end of the world with the title "Weltuntergang fällt aus".
Already today the anthem is very popular on YouTube. Will it sound at the charity concerts as well?
Of course, and at the end of the day, assuming that everything works out and that the end of the world does not happen...
The anthem will be sung by all performers at the same time at all three concerts.
In addition, the hymns are broadcast together in a live broadcast from Czech television.
The lyrics of the hymn come from Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Hanák, who also plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip, also Xindl X sings with...
How did you come to working with both?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which is related to the fact that we realize many charity events and concerts...
We strive to involve these people intensively in our projects.
It has been shown that most people are interested in working with us and enjoy it.
What is the purpose of the proceeds of concerts against the end of the world?
For the establishment of the barrier-free education centre Studeo, at which we have been working for six years together with the association Tap at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute.
Students of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute are regularly supervised by lecturers who help them with various leisure activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to visit the editors, we would like to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, a separate building is to be built, in which we will then move with this project.
At each concert, several groups and performers perform.
What criteria have you chosen?
We wanted to put together a program that would appeal to all generations, including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Such<0xC3><0xBD> will perform.
You can find out more on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar “great events” also planned for the future?
In May we perform for the first time at the Prague Spring, and also for this concert we are preparing an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to perform at the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we are already in the USA - would also like to combine this with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not exactly small, so far you have already appeared in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
However, The Tap Tap is a group composed of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these trips logistically and organizationally?
It’s not as bad as it seems at first glance.
Five of our members are wheelchair users, i.e. the wheelchairs must be transported in the luggage compartment. In addition, of course, we have to carry many instrument cases and other luggage...
Nevertheless, it has always worked out without any problems so far, <0xC4><0x8C>SA and British Airways were always very well prepared for us, that I have sometimes wondered already.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Through your trips abroad, you have a comparison of what it looks like in the individual countries with accessibility, how to deal with disabled people there, etc.
How have you experienced these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than us, we witnessed in Russia that everything in the East is still in its beginnings.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is absolutely non-disabled, where it is still unusual for someone in a wheelchair to travel alone in the city centre.
It is not even self-evident that you leave a wheelchair user in the elevator, for example.
Fortunately, there are also associations that try to point out the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what way do we need to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are still a lot of things that we hang out in after...
However, it should also be noted that an improvement in the situation also depends on the efforts of those affected.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with severe disabilities to move independently in public spaces, go to the museum, use the toilets, etc.
However, it is not very common that a larger group of disabled people actively participate in social events there, in which we are a little ahead of the West with the band The Tap Tap!
Respect in public and accessibility is one thing, but only when significant athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come from our ranks will things really start to change.
So far, these are only individual cases of particularly strong-willed personalities.
The Tap Tap is very popular right now, but if we go back a few years: what motivated you to start a band in 1998?
At that time I started as a supervisor at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in doing something intensive.
And since I am a musician myself and play the saxophone, among other things, I founded a music company together with a colleague.
Well, and over time, as our moderator, Lá<0xC4><0x8F>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D>, usually says, it gets a little out of control (laughs).
But the band has only become known in recent years, or am I mistaken?
It’s true that working with well-known singers has helped us, and we’ve also started to actively promote ourselves.
We have come to realize that if you do something and you cannot see it externally, your own performance does not exist in a certain sense.
Thanks to the EU funding, we can also afford good editors, high-quality equipment and the like.
Was it your goal to get it so far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt the potential that things could be done differently.
In the show business today, one often copies the other.
This is logical in its own way, since everything new is considered with caution and is only accepted after a long time.
There are few truly unique things, and I dare to say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression that the spectator usually gets is, of course, pity; this is only natural...
But this compassion is absolutely superfluous, because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned beings that we should regret.
They are people who can live and develop a full-fledged life, provided they have the necessary means to do so.
I always say that when people with disabilities succeed, it is not only progress for them, but for society as a whole.
Was it also helpful for this success that you are a strict boss, as you hear from many people?
If you want to do something good, you must not compromise on many things and also have to demand a certain discipline.
However, I think this is perfectly normal.
Some come to us with romantic ideas, and when they find that they have rehearsals twice a week, have to complete preparation phases and spend a lot of time on concert tours, then the enthusiasm for many quickly goes out.
But that’s how it works everywhere, in every band that wants to work seriously and achieve something.
The Tap Tap currently has 20 members.
How many of them were there from the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
Only one: Lá<0xC4><0x8F>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D>.
We're an open group. People come and go. You can't stop that.
Whoever has the will and the desire to participate is always welcome with us.
Takes place the day before the predicted world doom, Thursday 20.12.2012 at 9 pm
Venues are: Incheba-Arena/Prague, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
All three venues will be connected to each other via a live circuit and there will be a joint interpretation of the hymn "World Doom falls out" by the band The Tap Tap.
The aim of the concert is to raise funds for the equipment of a multifunctional disability-friendly educational centre, which will be created under the name STUDEO at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute in Prague.
Admission costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years free of charge, tickets are available in advance at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and space.
Last week, Poland was admitted as the twentieth member of the European Space Agency (ESA) at a Council of Ministers meeting, making it the second member of the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a member of ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland began working closely with ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
Poland’s journey into space, of course, began much earlier.
Even before World War II, Polish cosmos enthusiasts were already involved in space travel, although they did not always come across understanding.
I recall here, for example, the lecture by A. <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld on 6 December 1933 at the Warsaw Observatory, in which the author presented thoughts from his pioneering work "Entrance to Cosmonautics".
However, the ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the listeners cold, and after years <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
In 1934, <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld won the Prix REP-Hirsch, donated by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became an important advocate of astronomy and space travel.
In Polish journals he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski’s world-renowned contribution to the development of space travel was recognized, among other things, by naming one of the craters on the face of the moon after him.
Already in 1925, a railway drone was built in Poland, for which a rocket propulsion was planned.
Unfortunately, the author of the draft and the details of this project remained unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used for launching or braking the draisine.
The information on this comes exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with rocket-powered missiles.
The research was conducted by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
From the documents handed down, it can be seen that the research had progressed to the stage of practical tests.
The research was then, of course, interrupted by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937, the design of a photoelectric hunting rocket by Ing. Rohozi<0xC5><0x84>ski appeared in the specialist press, and the following year the work "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky appeared.
Both projects were concerned with the military use of the rocket drive.
Shortly before the war, all projects for the military use of missile technology were coordinated by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Committee Doradczo-Naukowy).
The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of activity, its work was terminated from the beginning of the war.
Further articles on space travel were published after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Space Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this society was made in 1954 in the November issue of the journal Problemy, in which four extensive articles are devoted to space travel.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal for the creation of a space society.
At the time, there were already the first projects on satellite technology, and it was to be foreseen that the exploration of space would have a future.
Already in its beginnings in 1956, the Polish Space Agency (PTA) sought to join the International Federation of Space, founded in 1951, and in fact the PTA became a regular member as early as the autumn of 1956.
The following year, the first PTA chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became Deputy Chairman of the International Federation for Space.
He held this office until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has been instrumental in the development of the most successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish rocket for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with a maximum flight height of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and weighed not quite 5 kg.
Later, an improved version, the RM-1A, was built, and in 1959, flight tests began in the B<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>dów Desert with the two-stage RM-2 missile.
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another stage of development should already be able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should reach a flight altitude of up to 14.5 km and be used for the observation of high winds.
In 1962, however, further development was discontinued.
The successor of the first RM rockets was the Meteor-1 rocket, developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, its total length was 510 cm and the take-off weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed from this rocket, which differed in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a transport space with a capacity of 0.4 liters, Meteor-1B had a capacity of 0.34 liters and Meteor-1C had a capacity of 0.62 liters.
The maximum flight altitude for all three types was 37 km.
From 1965 to 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Aerospace Institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a take-off weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg to an altitude of approximately 60 km.
After that, the versions Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
Also worth mentioning is Poland’s accession to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, followed two years later by the establishment of a national COSPAR committee.
As part of the Interkosmos program, Poland also participated in space exploration with Soviet satellites, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became second intercosmonaut after the Czech Vladimír Remek.
Repealing the law on non-profit work is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court lifted the law on non-profit work.
This decision provoked a lively discussion in the public.
It is certainly interesting to look at the problem from a broader perspective.
Liberal economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the end, this means that the individual economies are in a permanent conflict with each other.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with unbridled financial speculation.
Due to the large differences in the value of work (wages), there are price tensions.
This term refers to a situation in which the producer seeks to maintain economic competition by importing favourable goods by "underscoring" the competition in order to gain a greater market share and increase its profits.
On a large scale, this means for most companies to relocate their manufacturing or buy cheaply abroad, or to abandon their business, resulting in high unemployment in countries with comparablely high labour costs.
Since private capital bears no social responsibility and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment it causes, government spending necessarily increases.
This situation is aggravated by the fact that the gentlemen entrepreneurs are absolutely reluctant to pay their taxes and thus compensate for the economic and social damages they cause to society as a whole.
This situation is generally known, so that concrete statistics are superfluous at this point.
The ruthless practice of private capital creates a situation in the individual economies in which governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population and thus attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, governments hand over their own population to private capital, regardless of the social consequences.
This is reflected in particular in amendments to existing laws.
The aim of these measures is to force one’s own population to accept the dictates of private capital, especially in the wage area.
This is done on the one hand by economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment, on the other hand by the reduction of workers' rights.
The result is growing poverty and growing disparities between rich and poor.
In Germany, there have been public food delivery points for the poor for several years, which are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.
The number of those affected is already going into the millions.
In the course of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there are regular cases where employees receive such a low wage that the state has to increase their income to the minimum living.
Such a scandal has also been uncovered in the case of aid workers employed in the German Bundestag.
The austerity measures of virtually all EU southern states will undoubtedly result in the same situation where, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of their social level, people are forced to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century), or to give up for a starvation wage on the fringes of society, hoping that at some point private investment capital will flow into the country.
This naturally raises the question of where this capital comes from.
If it comes from another EU country, only poverty migrates from one country to another; or capital stays out completely, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt, or Africa at all, the workers work for a fraction of European wages.
This applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and media up to the point that the state is not allowed to participate in its own economy with capital, and that the planned economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital insists narrowly on its position that the state must not intervene in the economy in a guiding way.
But then one has to wonder if private capital does not influence or even direct politics and thus the entire state in its own selfish sense.
Here is the clear answer: yes.
Proof of this is the existence of a virtually all-powerful and omnipresent lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, mutual favoritism, legislation in which virtually everything is punishable, but nothing is punishable.
In Germany, the situation is such that a State Ministry, due to a lack of finance, commissions private legal companies, closely intertwined with industry, to draft bills.
These bills are then passed in the Bundestag.
All violence then no longer emanates from the people, as the Western constitutions proclaim, but from strong financial groups that prefer their own interests.
Apparently, the liberal democracies are rapidly falling into a situation as described by Appian in his work on the Crisis of the Roman Republic at the time of Caesar and Pompey: "The state has long been in disintegration, and the offices have been occupied by force.
In exchange for bribes, by unlawful use of advantages or with stone and sword.
The corruption grew uncontrollably, and the people went to the polls with already bought votes" ... "All people with character did not apply for offices, so that the state had no consul for eight months as a result of this decline" ... "It was actually started to talk that the only medicine in this difficult situation was a solitary domination, and that a strong man had to be chosen by Pompey, but the man in the Appian thought"...
As it turns out, today’s society, just as in antiquity, is based on the ruthless preference of one’s own advantage, without paying attention to the interests of society as a whole.
Private capital, by its very nature, is incapable of recognizing and enforcing the advantage for society as a whole.
The result, both today and then, is an unprecedented decadence of the elites, who are not in the least striving for deeper reforms.
The cause of the rise of fascism and communism must therefore be sought in the ruthless liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
From the current state of affairs, the demise of these regimes in favour of liberal democracies can be seen as a certain pause in which the next round is already emerging.
Particularly disastrous is the fact that today’s elites are in complete ignorance of the possible loss of hundreds of thousands of lives in the future, the humanitarian and social disasters of which we are already witnesses today, as well as the crimes against humanity as we know them from the older and more recent history.
The repeal of the law on non-profit work is not a solution here, at least not a permanent one.
Under pressure from global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to push the social level of the population down.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The only solution is targeted political-social reforms that increase the state’s capital participation in the economy, increase citizens’ influence on the government, and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: Labor of Chaos.
"...that nothing comes out of violence, or could ever come out of it" sings Sting in the song Fragile, whose main verse in the chorus is: "...that we may not forget how fragile we are" .
“If my sons didn’t want war, there wouldn’t be one,” says the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849.
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there were, as always, countless reactions.
Some support Israel and argue with its right to self-defense, while calling the Palestinians terrorists; others support the Palestinians, arguing with the racism of the Israeli state, with the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs, and calling the State of Israel terrorist.
I do not want to write at this point about who is the culprit and who is the victim in these recurring waves of killing; ultimately, the present residents of Israel, including the self-governing territories, were born into the current political situation and have not experienced the onset of violence itself.
It is my aim to open the readers’ eyes behind the scenes, to whom the 95 years of tension (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small patch of land in the Middle East are especially useful.
My thoughts are partly based on accessible historical facts, others are derived from these and come from my own understanding of who or which group of people significantly influences the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is first and foremost a history of the struggle for power.
In every epoch we can make an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is less obvious is the question of whether it was really always these personalities themselves who autonomously determined their steps, or whether someone stood behind their throne guiding their actions to a predetermined goal.
We must admit that we live in a time when the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of fewer individuals, and that this concentration of money and the power arising from it did not arise within the life span of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families stands out one in particular that could be called the head of the Kraken (I don’t know if anyone is above them, but I don’t rule this out) – the Rothschilds.
Much is not written about them.
Understandably.
The first press agency (Reuters) was bought by the Rothschilds as early as the 90s of the 19th century to prevent the connection of their name to highly criminal acts, in the background of which always stood the consolidation of their power, the increase of their wealth, or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all the central banks of the world, and against the countries in which they are not involved in the central banks, they wage wars or arm themselves against them (before the invasion of Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq there were 5 countries, after the overthrow of Gaddafi there were only four, with Russia meanwhile having placed its central bank under the Russian government).
Whoever tried to oppose this family had to pay with their lives for it.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschild’s Bank of America as a central bank, began issuing his own (pronounced: state) banknotes during the Civil War, and was murdered in a theater in 1865.
J.F. Kennedy began issuing his own banknotes and wanted to abolish the FED – he was murdered in 1963; deputy Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the FED for triggering the 1929 economic crisis.
The global desire for power of the Rothschilds led to the formulation of a plan for the unleashing of three world wars by Albert Pik, a Masonic of the 33rd and thus the highest degree of knowledge.
The first war aimed to eliminate the great monarchist states of Europe, by the second war in particular the colonial rule of Britain was to be broken, and the third war was to reduce the world population to about 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number would eventually provide for their amenities and their luxury and would not consume as many resources as possible), create a universal religion and lead to the overtaking of power (the ecumenism here is absolutely nothing).
The method by which the group of the richest families works with the Rothschilds at the head is to trigger a crisis and subsequently offer a solution (order from chao - order from chaos).
These solutions, however, are wrong and always lead to aggravation of the situation (see the Fed’s founding, so that crises such as those triggered by them in 1907 do not repeat themselves).
After they had succeeded in triggering World War I by assassinating the Habsburg heir Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the Russian tsarist empire by the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended with the sudden, military and economically unfounded surrender of Germany (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of the Russian tsarist empire), after which the Central European great power of Austria-Hungary was dissolved.
In order to make World War II easier to ignite, the bankers had politics create a latent conflict situation by occupying Germany with gigantic war repairs; thereby they created the prerequisite of impoverished masses, so that they had to cheer only a sufficiently strong leader to offer the culprits named and simple solutions.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the founding of the Zionist movement, in which a branch sought to establish a Jewish state, if possible in the historic area of Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The aforementioned Balfour Declaration created the conditions for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; there were first clashes with the resident Arab population.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler broke off the chain that the international bankers had initially held him on, or whether everything went according to plan, is difficult to estimate, in any case, the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and just as the war repairs against Germany prepared the ground for World War II, the proclamation of the State of Israel represents the creation of the focal point for World War III.
If international bankers succeed in unleashing this war, the Jewish people will become victims in the front line, this time along with the Arab or Muslim populations of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of strife and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (just think of how sharply the people divide into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim in the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis, where injustice only triggers injustice in an endless spiral of violence, with at the beginning the greed of individuals and their pursuit of global power?
It is necessary here to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leadership, for the international bankers in Israel as well as among us, the people, only elect their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, the Falcon Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascism-prone, loyal to international bankers politician who is doing everything possible to ignite a war with Iran, which, given the membership of Iran in the Shanghai Oil Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), could quickly come to a global conflict that could only widen Iran's control over the world.
In 1994, David Rockefeller said, “The only thing we need is an all-encompassing crisis, and people will welcome the new world order.”
In their view, the New World Order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves a small group of financial aristocrats.
A world where every newborn is implanted at birth with a chip to subject this being to total control.
"And it causes the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the free and the slaves all to give themselves a mark on their right hand, or on their foreheads, that no one may buy or sell, except he that has the mark, the name of the beast, or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom. He who has understanding, let him consider the number of the beast.
For there is a man's number, and his number is six hundred and sixty-six."
The movie Argo: When it's worst to call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of demonstrating Islamist students occupied the U.S. embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
For their release, they demanded the extradition of the overthrown Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the United States after the revolution, who had been patron of his regime for decades.
For the American government, there was no positive way out of this situation – it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, as this would have massively damaged the trust of its allies in other countries.
At the same time, she was unable to enforce the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a severe blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent failure in the violent attempt to free the hostage only made things worse.
The captured diplomats were finally released after 444 days after negotiations had been mediated by the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages sparked a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiments at home.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter's defeat of Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo by director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story that gave the United States a small partial victory.
Immediately before the occupation of the embassy, six embassy staffers managed to escape.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to bring the refugees out of Iran, assisting them with an extravagant story to cover up their true identity — they traveled with Canadian passports disguised as members of a film staff who allegedly visited the country’s filming locations for a science fiction film.
Combination of genres
The plan developed by the expert on "exfiltration", Tony Mendez, also required Hollywood's cooperation.
So that the camouflage became credible, articles about this film project appeared in trade journals, press conferences were held, and the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of this operation have been kept secret for a long time. The film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one hand, he is a realistic political thriller, but at the same time also a so-called "Caper Movie", i.e. the story of a successful hussard piece such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
As a result, the mood levels in the film vary - on the one hand, the documentary scenes from Tehran (in the title sequence, iconic contemporary photographs are shown, and even in the film version of the same situations, there are no big differences).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, which come ironically and slightly pointedly.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the meeting table, in the corridors, on the phone...
With this film, Ben Affleck has succeeded in a remarkable reboot of his career.
A laughed-out actor has become a respectable director, and even as an actor, he is no longer the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the crime novel No Child’s Play (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the thriller City Without Mercy (2010).
At the same time, it is Affleck’s first film not to be set in the director’s native Boston.
The feel for the atmosphere of the place was one of the features that set this director’s previous films apart from Hollywood’s standard.
However, Affleck also proves this feeling in Argo, where Tehran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that really took place - the input sequence of the storming of the message is very impressive in their clarity, yet still conveys the feeling of confusion and unpredictability that occurs when somewhere the story moves.
Affleck and his team also achieve a similar effect in fictional scenes (the wrong film staff on a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story does not actually offer many exciting scenes in the cinematic sense.
But with the few, he works quite successfully, sometimes imitating reality - which then does not always seem so elegant (the scenes where the impending crisis at Tehran airport is averted by a phone call in America, or even the chase on the runway, seem a bit artificial).
The weakness of Argo is its too wide scattering, which is caused by the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, but their characters deserve more space, and they are by no means alone in the film.
Affleck’s film is losing some traction, a film that can be followed with a certain interest and gouty the design and the retro style, reminiscent of a thriller from the 70s.
However, it is difficult to arouse enthusiasm.
However, it is sufficient as a reminder of a piece of history that is still alive to this day in a certain way, and as proof of how exaggerated are the notions of the all-powerful and all-knowing intelligence services.
Guidelines for inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which launches an annual survey on the most absurd bank fees, has decided this year to host the competition "The most absurd regulation or idea from the EU workshop".
"This idea was brought to our attention by the EU's recent plan to introduce a 40% women's ratio in the management of large European companies," Patrik Nacher, who is responsible for organising this survey, told the newspaper Právo.
Among the nominated absurdities is, for example, the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the unification of insurance rates for men and women.
Until then, women enjoyed an advantage in life insurance because they objectively pose a lower risk for insurance companies.
"Further incredible incursions from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will then take place until the end of February 2013," said Nacher.
Controversial EU regulations include the mandatory addition of bioethanol to fuels, which is therefore harmful to nature, and the ban on reliable mercury thermometers just because they contain a relatively small amount of this hazardous substance, or the directive on the size of chicken cages, which made eggs considerably more expensive this year.
In the past, criticism has also resulted in the factual ban on the use of the term "butter spread" or the ban on the sale of conventional light bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU apparatus often decides under the pressure of this or that lobby from trade and industry, whose demands are usually represented in Brussels by one or more Member States (for example, the Czech Republic is currently trying to enforce the demands of Czech banks even with a veto threat).
Lobby interests were also behind the fact that bananas of the highest trading class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and must not have a "curving anomaly".
The European Commission defended itself with the argument that they merely harmonise the inconsistent national standards that would impede trade.
The norms regarding fruit and vegetables have already been softened by the EU against the resistance of some countries, stating that the previous directives would lead to food waste.
One candidate for victory in this survey may be the EU regulation of last year, which according to balloons, must be provided with the indication when selling, that children under the age of eight may not inflate the balloon without the supervision of an adult.
The EU cited an American study which, according to balloons, is the leading cause of death by suffocation in children.
A similar restriction already applies to children up to 14 years of age when using annual market straws.
Curious ideas are also at home
Relatively absurd is also a directive that affects the European officials themselves - anyone who takes an official function in the EU is not allowed to use the term Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the issue for Greece and must instead say FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com, in cooperation with the Association of Liberal Economists Laissez Faire, not only nominated the above absurdities but also the EU regulation on the volume of food supplies in the territory of a member country.
The EU thus set the maximum volume of food stocks allowed to be in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the fixed volume for mushroom preserves, for which we were threatened with a high fine.
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for not having a sea, or by the idea of providing funding for applications for funding.
These ideas, of course, did not come from Brussels, but from Prague.
“We are disadvantaged by the fact that we don’t have a sea.
We will apply for a refund from the EU," said the then Minister of Agriculture, Jaroslav Palas (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD), in the autumn of 2004.
As an argument, he argued that the cereal harvest was very high and the state camps were overcrowded as a result of the so-called intervention purchases.
Since the Czech Republic has another way to seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros, according to Palas.
The European Commission finally met the Czech Republic so far that it organised a call for tenders for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The Ministry of Regional Development, headed by Minister Pavel N<0xC4><0x9B>mec (US-DEU), offered funding for applications for funding to the municipalities, specifically for funding applications to Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
Although regulations are easily the target of criticism in the member states, some experts believe that the EU’s efforts to regulate and hence to improve the effectiveness and development of the entire European Union are more worthy of appreciation.
A more serious problem, in the opinion of these experts, is rather the EU funding for projects that have nothing in common with deepening European integration, but which have been forced into the budget negotiations of individual Member States.
Emotions in this country also evoke the fact that the Czech Republic, like other Member States in Brussels, has to fight for the right to use specific names of traditional products and does not always win this fight.
After a six-year struggle with Germany and Austria, the Czech Republic was able to defend the name "Olomoucké tvar<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xBE>ky", the native room (Tuzemsk<0xC3><0xBD> rum), whose tradition goes back to the 19th century, but our manufacturers had to rename it "Tuzemák".
The name rum may only be used for products made from sugarcane distillate, not for products made from sugar beet.
In the official list of products registered in the EU, the company of the world-famous cheeses Feta and Gorgonzola, the Lübeck Marzipan or Parma ham now also the Carlsbad Zwieback, carp from Poho<0xC5><0x99>elice and T<0xC5><0x99>ebo<0xC5><0x88>, or the Saazer hops.
With an EU trade mark, the Pardubicer gingerbread or the Ho<0xC5><0x99>icer rolls can brag.
"People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur," Okamura says.
Mr. Senator, how do you come up with the idea of running for president?
It’s not about being a senator or a president.
If everything in our country worked without problems, I wouldn’t run anywhere.
But I can no longer watch as the Republic is being looted for 20 years, as thieves roam freely, as people raise taxes and retirement age.
I had no ambitions to become a politician.
But when I see something that I don’t like, I try to propose a solution to change it.
And since I’m already over 40, and independent and impartial about it, I have no other way to influence things than to run for the office of a senator or president.
You made it to the Senate and then you made your way to the castle.
Don’t you turn your back on your voters?
I told myself all along that I would start the fight for the castle after the result of the Senate elections.
Later, I clarified this and said that I would run for the office of president if I were elected senator.
But my goal is not the function, it is an instrument with which I can realize my visions.
To do this, I need as much influence as possible and a stronger mandate.
The difficulty, however, is not only that we as a people are scolding in the pub and in front of the TV, but we are scolding anyone who wants to change something.
In addition, there are the media, which want to rob one of one’s honor, and which confuse the freedom of the word with the freedom to lie.
For example, it was claimed that I was bribing journalists or that I was an adviser to Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Paroubek.
Let’s talk about your visions.
You have started the fight for the castle with the thesis of the substantive and criminal liability of politicians as well as with retroactive statements of assets over 20 million crowns.
To do this, you have to change laws.
As president, you have no competence in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can bring in legislative proposals.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I worked hard to ensure that the guide remained a free trade, and this could be enforced.
The problem is the petty-minded policy - if someone comes from the right or from the left with a good proposal, it is deliberately rejected, and that only stops the population.
As an independent non-partisan, I have a much greater potential to gain support from all parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that I can take from any party what is best for our country, without any drawer thinking or party dogma.
Do you see yourself as a person in politics rather to the right or to the left?
From the Czech perspective, it seems to me that people see me more on the left.
For me, this right-left thinking is completely irrelevant.
It is important to me that we move forward.
It’s not about whether someone belongs to the left or to the right; I want to connect people.
I always publicly support every good solution approach, even if it comes from the KS<0xC4><0x8C>M or the ODS, and likewise I will turn against bad ideas.
You don't like it when someone calls you a populist.
But do you not confirm this by what you have just said?
When you set up a business plan in a company, you also have an ideal goal and vision.
And you want to approach this.
You can call this populism because of me, but all the proposals I have talked about are already working in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without support in Parliament, you will only have keywords.
In the long run, this will not get you far in politics.
Or do you think that if you only talk to people long enough, you will succeed, for example, in enforcing substantive and criminal liability?
I have no other choice.
Convincing politicians, journalists and the public and trying to bring them to our side in order to enforce these goals.
As president, it would not be a problem for me to call on the chairmen of parliamentary parties live on television to enshrine the substantive and criminal liability of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And those who are addressed may then have to say why they refuse this.
A strong personality that points to misconduct can put pressure on the political scene.
Take only once the direct election of the president, which was a merit of public pressure.
I say quite clearly that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my views and visions.
I have just started politics and I am trying to find the support of the majority for my programme.
I always try to judge things myself; and if it doesn’t work, I’ll be back in the private sector in six years.
That sounds a little bit like Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that I am not achieving anything on my own, so I have talked to several well-known figures about whether they would like to run for the Senate as well.
For example, I spoke with Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, who refused because of work overload.
I also supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who discovered the fraud in the trade in light fuel oil.
I started my candidacy with the assumption that people are deeply dissatisfied, but now I am no longer sure.
Sixty percent of the electorate have not gone to the elections at all, and those who have gone have mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independents.
People have chosen such a Senate composition that changes will be very difficult to enforce.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, e.g. for the direct election of mayors and district governors.
Are you thinking about setting up your own party?
I haven’t thought about it yet, because I don’t have time to check the past of any potential party member, and I don’t have the money at all for it.
I don’t even have money for the presidential campaign; on my transparent account it’s only CZK 20,000.
You don't have any money?
You are talking about property statements, what would yours look like?
My personal assets are estimated at around CZK 60 million.
In Prague, I have a plot worth 25 million, an apartment worth about 10 million, another apartment worth 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million, and a <0xC5><0xA0>kodu Superb worth about one million.
By the way, the Aston Martin was a child's dream - James Bond always liked how he drove in the car, was gallant to women and at the same time fought against evil.
You drive an Aston Martin, have a fortune of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?
You say you want to change the republic, but your own money you don’t want to invest in it.
That's not exactly convincing.
I don't have $15 million for the campaign.
Should I be in debt?
I have already invested 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don’t have any sponsors shows that my program probably doesn’t arouse too much interest.
And I am not obliged to contest the campaign from my own resources.
The cost of the campaign is basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But I could not live on the senator’s salary alone; so I could not, for example, finance my son’s English school, which costs 30,000 a month.
If I only wanted to make money, I wouldn't run for anything.
So do you continue to work as an entrepreneur in order to have your livelihood?
Didn't you say that you're going to drive back these activities?
But that’s not related to the level of salary.
As promised, I partially drove back my activities.
For example, my deputy will be managing director of the travel agency in the spring.
People want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I also have to live on something.
What monthly income were you used to as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that continues to be the case.
As President, however, I would completely cease my undertakings.
The full discussion can be found in the Saturday issue of Právo.
The MVRDV architects prove that the true adventures are not only in the mind - using the example of Spijkenisse and the recently built Buchberg - 2 photos
"I find the building funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there's something interesting to see again," says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby on the roadside.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a nearby large company, says: "Yes, it's nice, the house."
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
All have internet, iPad and e-books.
No one goes to any of these old-style libraries today, right?
Spijkenisse, a sleep town that hardly needs to be visited at the gates of Rotterdam, is a strange record holder.
The 80,000-inhabitant community has the lowest education rate in the Netherlands.
In order to counter this stupidity, a few years ago, it was decided to contribute to general education and to recreate the seven fictitious bridges depicted on the euro banknotes as beautifully brushed reinforced concrete miniatures.
The success of the education campaign was limited.
And so the city fathers realized that there was only one way to become masters of statistics: a library had to be made!
Winy Maas from the Rotterdam architectural firm MVRDV, master of bold bar charts and producer of funny, even often cynical buildings, took the matter with the usual serenity and appeared at the competition hearing in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
And while the jury was still staring around and shrugging his shoulders, the insolent Maas piled up his exquisite gifts of the size of a pyramid and ended his actionist-backed speech with the words: "Dear city community!"
So that's him, my proposal for the Buchberg of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30-million-euro mountain is scattered.
It is part of a revitalization project, which also includes underground parking, supermarket, post office and a few adjacent residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Buchberg was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Thus, the faceless small town retort, which hitherto had nothing more to offer than a post-modern pedestrian zone and an astonishingly ugly town hall, behind whose white facades one would be inclined to suspect a dairy factory to make a piece of contemporary architecture richer.
Above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in the history of its existence.
The Long Way to the Book
The first impression: book eldorado under cheese bell.
Although there is a lift that runs through the middle of the mountain massif, the true pleasures of space and reading open up as you walk up the topography.
The all-glassed interior is bright and clear, the burnt clinker floor and the elegant street lamps speak unmistakably the language of a public city square.
The urban ambience is perfect.
You are already looking for park bench, dog and soccer playing boys and girls.
And everywhere books, books, books.
"Normally, the bookshelves stand along the facade, and in the middle is a large, dark room that is usually uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We turned the classic room configuration upside down and pushed the reading area from the inside out.
The interior of the Buchberg is cleverly used: in the middle are offices, internet library, chess club, environmental center and house technology center.
A special delight are the black bookshelves, which are sometimes wall cladding, sometimes bristles, sometimes ladder railings.
Optics, haptics and smells are foreign.
Even hardworking architects and civil engineers shake their heads over the unknown building material.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials here," explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spijkenisse, at the request of the standard.
And so we came across a suitable waste product from agriculture in a Frisian farm one day.
For many years, in the Netherlands, a millimeter-thin plastic fleece has been used as a root support in greenhouses and fields.
This is cheap and time efficient.
The thin textile lasts one or two seasons, after which it is ripe for blocking waste.
For the library, the fleece - for the first time in these quantities - was pressed to four centimeters thick plates.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) turns into a dark, homogeneous, strain-resistant material that smells like new cars and sports shoes.
After 105 steps you have reached the summit.
At the end of the almost 500 meter long hike, you will be rewarded in the Literaturcafé not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and potted ficus trees.
They provide an atmosphere, but above all they provide the right humidity in the literary mountains.
Donations for the New Soul
"You wouldn't believe it, but despite the many glass surfaces, this house is a flagship project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
Heated and cooled with geothermal heat.
Although the Buchberg is under a glass turmoil, even on sunny days the sun shines only briefly inside.
The wide wood glue ties, which are transverse to the glass facade, serve as shade and intercept much of the sunlight.
The room climate is very pleasant.
The rest is done by fully automatic roller shutters.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptic from the IT industry, already dared to enter the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was there too.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who even describes the Boekenberg as the "longest overdue soul".
The reason: For the opening a few weeks ago, each resident was invited to donate a book from his personal inventory.
For the time being, the optical gaps in the library – currently 70,000 pieces – are to be filled.
The concept has emerged.
The shelves are filled up to the top.
“Nothing is worse than a half-empty library,” says architect Winy Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it's just for decoration.
In this way, MVRDV has succeeded in the royal discipline, which is called in the specialist jargon identity foundation.
Spijkenisse has written literary history.
As young and unskilled as she may be.
This is finally a starting point for identity.
Szabo: "Germans have to play a bigger role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the inclusion of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, expert on U.S.-European relations, Berlin is balancing this on a narrow diplomatic level.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany had first signalled that it would vote against the request for Palestinian observer status at the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained.
Why? Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, Germany has to be cautious because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don’t think it supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel.
During the Libyan uprising in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to setting up a no-fly zone.
This was eventually enforced by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on important international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because it is shifting its foreign policy from a policy managed by the US, so to speak, to a German foreign policy.
To make matters worse, Europeans do not have a coherent and unified policy.
Thus, the Germans find themselves between the fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they were still tackling their role, but they are on the way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy like that of France or Britain.
What does a “normal” foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
It shows a willingness to take up positions in national interests that are independent of those of the United States or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany’s economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of the other great powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the attitude in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
On the one hand, Germany has large sales markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf states.
Therefore, it must be careful not to hit the heads of the public, but also the elites, in the Arab countries.
That definitely matters.
But I wouldn’t want to put too much weight on that either, it’s not a completely one-sided relationship.
But it definitely plays an important role in German considerations.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the United States by abstaining in important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe that there is a great understanding of the German position in Europe and even in the United States.
That is why I do not believe that this was such a dramatic break as in the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany will even show some respect for it.
Because it signals that it is taken seriously as an international player and its interests must be taken into account.
There are different opinions in Europe about the Palestinian initiative.
The U.S., on the other hand, has clearly voted in favour of a veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the United States and many European nations?
Due to American domestic policy, these differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama administration secretly has quite a bit of understanding for the European position.
But, of course, because of the political situation here, the government cannot publicly represent this position.
I believe that the actual disagreements are not as great as they always seem.
If you look at the relations between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, then Obama is not so keenly enthusiastic about Netanyahu’s policies.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the US, on the one hand, and the position of the main partners in the EU, on the other?
That’s what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would, of course, be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and unified European policy, which is not currently the case.
So they can’t be part of a broader line and instead have to push things forward from their own position.
This is what they are doing with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will play a leading role in pushing Europe to a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, even because of its relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive issue.
But I think the Germans are aware that they need to play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself in the role as an important international player - does Germany want to take on a leading role at all?
Or is Germany still struggling to take the lead?
Germany is not yet accustomed to it, this is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a larger role.
When we look at the euro crisis, for example, every time Germany assumes a greater role, a variety of anti-German feelings become free.
This does not make it easy for the Germans.
That’s actually the old problem: you don’t want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It has to be receptive to a variety of neighbors and opinions and that’s not easy.
Now the influence of the US in European politics is steadily decreasing, but the EU is not filling this vacuum at the moment, who else will remain there?
The Germans will simply have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, it displeases them and makes them even more unpopular - c'est la vie!

China's 'brand protection': when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-renowned brand, Polo Ralph Lauren also.
What is Armani Polo?
Behind it is an officially registered name in China, which has nothing to do with the originating companies.
Yet it enjoys protection as long as the actual namesake does not complain.
Even then, it is not clear if they are right.
“It’s becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China,” says Thomas Pattloch, attorney at law firm Taylor Wessing, who specializes in proprietary rights violations in the Far East.
Every week a new case lands on my desk.
A few additional letters are enough for the imitators to be able to register their trademarks.
So Gucci simply becomes Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you have Prada knees registered.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, such as the sports goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with registrations of the Trademark Office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company protected the trademark Zegna DF Puma, an art name that was also used by the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The fact that the Chinese are world champions in copying and in infringement of intellectual property is well known.
In the big cities there are multi-storey department stores that sell almost exclusively counterfeits.
But Pattloch’s cases are different: on behalf of his clients, he is taking steps to ensure that Chinese companies are officially granted the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai", a passenger brand.
The word is based on "Bang Dakuan".
This means women who fish for rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any culpability.
"This is business damaging, you have to fight it," Pattloch demands.
"The brand is diluted, the sole position disappears, the image damage is enormous."
The financial failures and process costs of the affected industries go to the millions, especially for expensive showcase products.
According to the market research company CLSA, China is the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing, with a volume of 15 billion euros per year.
However, deletions of dubious entries in the trademark register are difficult to achieve and go into the money.
The procedure can take up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch reports of cases in which the court dismissed lawsuits because after the long period of time the contested name had become "market faithfulness".
If the plaintiff is unlucky, he will even have to pay the plagiarist money because he violated his brand in China, Pattloch says.
Sometimes the law of the jungle rules here.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that recently acquired the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
The Chinese are therefore still allowed to use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes star.
Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue-and-white logo reminiscent of BMW; the dispute was settled, Geely had to change it.
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, who made the famous crocodile look the other way.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any culpability.
The CTMO trademark office in Beijing admits that there were bottlenecks in 2010 due to insufficient personnel and space equipment.
Last year, however, they returned to normality from the “emergency situation in the workflow.”
As a result, the number of unprocessed opposition proceedings fell by 22 percent.
Almost 57,000 such cases have been completed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 appeals are still pending in the office.
Combating it costs a lot
As is often the case in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that China is leading the list of new applications worldwide for the tenth time in a row, the agency said.
This also applies to the inventory of all valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan in fees were collected.
In simple terms, each registration costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
It costs a lot to tackle it, as the case of the German family-owned company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting a Chinese plagiarist.
Although the Germans were able to achieve that its illegal manufacture of imitated motor vehicle parts was excavated.
However, the imitator continued to secure the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
One has failed to do so, because family names could not be protected in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, Chairman of the Management Board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The trade mark office CTMO therefore rejected the Munich opposition.
In the next two instances, Freudenberg was right, but the opponent continues to fight.
You have to watch out hellishly
Now the case is before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a good conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The procedure is extremely expensive and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs could hardly be quantified, the company’s archives even had to review one hundred years old files in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the other side a "high six-digit euro amount" for settlement in vain.
"This shows how much this is worth to us," says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Far East are even threatening to shrink back to Europe.
That is, if imitators secure unprotected brands there.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
The Group has long since abandoned this business area, yet it was able to reverse the registration.
"You have to be very careful," says Wentzler.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very cautious when dealing with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights, but rather foreigners should "register anything that is somehow worthy of protection in China," as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registering.
In fact, if Freudenberg suffered in the last act of his brand drama, then you would probably have to pay the other side licensing fees for your own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we will be pushed out of the market in the segment in question.
World AIDS Day: Stroking, singing, helping
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir is rehearsing - and in Swaziland, AIDS orphans are happy about it.
The history of a connection that spans far more than 8733 kilometers.
First, there is the stomping: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, women's pumps and men's slippers look for the beat on the parquet floor, find it quickly.
One-two-three-four.
Only then do the voices of the singers slowly swell - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - oppress, seduce and persecute themselves.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost pulls it out of his fabric shoes when he brings them together with his smoothly wild gestures.
It is Monday evening, in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the choir Imbongi is rehearsing a new song.
Fifty singers, aged between 23 and 69, have come from the human geneticist to the Hausmann.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, each choral voice has a different text and this also in a very foreign language: Zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
There are about 34 million HIV-infected people worldwide, according to UNAIDS, the United Nations Programme to Fight AIDS.
23.5 million people live in South Africa.
There are 245000 AIDS orphans in Swaziland.
More than 40 percent of the population is now HIV positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni, the association Voices for Africa found sponsors in Germany.
Seventy of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can take on a sponsorship.
She guarantees the child tuition fees, school uniform and a warm meal daily in the Gogo Center.
In Zulu, Imbongi means storyteller or praiser.
The Bantu language can speak fluently in this room, but no one can sing.
For almost ten years, the choir has practiced songs in this foreign soft language and occasionally brings them back to where they originally came from: in the South of Africa.
Because 8,733 kilometers of airline from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the vocal power of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected.
About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple clay and straw huts, most of which are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents because they have succumbed to the HI virus.
In Esitjeni, what all of Swaziland is sick of is small: the highest HIV infection rate, the lowest life expectancy worldwide, according to UNICEF.
Circumcisions of the male foreskin, which have been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, are hardly accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of people in Swaziland carry the virus of immunodeficiency, dying in their mid-thirties is not uncommon.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered the village, but above all, the Imbongis saw many children on the streets, who lacked not only parental care, but simply everything: food, clothing, education.
Without a college degree, you have no chance in a poor country.
Initially, it was the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school for a few euros a year and to provide him with a warm meal a day.
However, a year later, the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa", which has since taken almost professional care of the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
Common viral STIs are HIV, human papillomavirus, genital herpes, or hepatitis.
Felt lice and scabies belong to the parasitic STI.
Who are the main affected groups?
Syphilis and trippers occur mainly in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute estimates that at least four out of five cases of syphilis reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia infections, trichomonads, candidiasis (fungus), trippers, and human pappiloma viruses are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The prevalence of HIV among heterosexual adults in this country is comparatively low - yet: Around 20 percent of new HIV infections are caused by this group.
Chlamydia infections occur significantly more frequently among adolescents than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In addition, human pappiloma viruses are common in adolescents in this country.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to notification.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has more than doubled from 1,697 diseases in 2001 to 3,698 diseases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has declined since 2007.
In 2011, there were around 2700 cases.
That’s about a tenth less than the year before.
What are the symptoms of a sexually transmitted disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, urination discomfort, discharge, lower abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts.
Often, however, they do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore go unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not offer 100% protection.
Because in part, pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be passed on through lubricating infections and close body contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examinations, especially with frequently changing sex partners.
Early diagnosis can cure most STIs and avoid late consequences.
Through sponsorships, donations and not least the gagen, which the choir sings throughout Germany, a lot comes together.
"In total, we have already sent around 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, the president of the association.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a confident and assertive woman, manages the funds from Germany.
She also takes care that the orphans stay well, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The Gogos, as the old women are called in Zulu, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them have taken in up to 14 orphans, give them a roof over their heads, and make sure that the children in their uniforms arrive on time for school lessons every day.
Anyone who has no one comes to the shelter of Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid the same amount by the association as the two chefs who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, Voices for Africa has set up a sewing school, built two chicken coops and, together with the American health organization PSI, organised an HIV test for many people in the village.
This is not a matter of course, because as obvious as the disease is throughout the country, you prefer to silence it dead.
A King with 14 wives
“AIDS is an absolute taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it has to do with sexuality.”
In fact, it is strange in a country where the king officially holds 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, it is due to this state-sanctioned way of life that the HI virus has spread so quickly in recent decades.
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus across the country.
While free condoms would be available at every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are hardly used.
The culture is another - flesh to flesh."
In order to promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels together through the South of Africa every two or three years, singing songs full of melancholy, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-confidence that many still know from apartheid times at the southern tip of the black continent.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language - so much recognition not only brings mood and joy, but has already shed a few tears on some grim border soldiers.
The trip always leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their godchildren.
Although the small village can hardly be found on maps, it is more than known in the valley of the Ezulweni River.
“Go to Esitjeni, there is the light,” people say.
And if you return to Heidelberg on the 8733-kilometre airline, to the stamping singers in the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Straße, you can see it shining there.
NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The probe Messenger has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice sheet may be up to 20 meters thick.
NASA has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the sun, there is also frozen water, according to three studies published on Thursday in the specialist magazine "Science".
The probe Messenger has found evidence that there is an ice sheet in the permanently shaded region of the planet.
This should be at least 30 centimeters and possibly even up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets or possibly asteroids that hit Mercury.
No one is associating the discovery of ice with the existence of life on the planet, said messenger probe chief scientist Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help clarify how water and other building blocks of life have reached other areas of the solar system.
Unnoticed by Earth’s citizens, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix are exploring the depths of space.
From time to time, they send pictures to Earth: small peekholes in infinite expanses.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a "planet" according to the new definition of the International Astronomical Union of 2006.
This snippet of an infrared image of the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of uncounted generations of stars: the oldest stars are visible as blue dots, and the pink "newborns" in the room are more difficult to identify.
This star-forming region — unromantically called W5 by scientists — has been discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This dazzling glow of a dying star has been recorded by NASA’s Spitzer telescope.
The donut-shaped ring is made of material that the star ejected during the dying process.
In the giant Trifid Nebula, 5400 light-years from Earth, new stars are formed from gas and dust.
NASA's Spitzer telescope shot this photo of the galactic birth room.
The Pleiades star cluster, also known as the Seven Sisters, can be seen with the naked eye at night.
With the telescope, however, the colors are more prominent.
Like a red age, the Helix nebula looks at the viewer in this infrared photo.
It is located 700 light-years away in the constellation of Aquarius.
Its resemblance to an earthly continent earned this nebula the title North America.
A combination of normal and infrared photo ensures the spectacular color scheme.
This baby star could only be captured in its full beauty by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.

One of the largest and sharpest images of the Hubble telescope: The Whirlpool Galaxy
Depending on the colour, images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image, published by the European Southern Observatory, shows the trifid nebula in the constellation of Sagittarius, several thousand light-years away.
The name Trifid derives from the Latin word trifidus (three-part, three-split), because dark dust stripes triangulate the glowing heart of the Star Birthplace.
In the constellation of Serpent Bearers, astronomers have photographed the forerunners of a cosmic carambolage: 400 million light-years away from Earth, the cores of two merging galaxies race towards each other and will inevitably collide with each other.
This star birth was recorded by the Hubble Telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
If you don’t have technical abbreviations, you can call it the Southern Fire Wheel by its nickname.
The image from the Hubble Space Telescope shows a detail of the Iris Nebula in the constellation of Kepheus.
The nebula, 1400 light-years away, consists of dust pellets that are ten to a hundred times smaller than ordinary house dust.
This image was assembled from optical and X-ray images taken by various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, captured the Hubble Space Telescope for NASA.
The larger spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
This nebula contains the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The Star Cradle always produces new youngsters.
Also these star clouds, coupled with the Rosette Nebula, are constantly producing new baby stars - 5000 light-years away from Earth.
In this brightly shining galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust, but only gas.
Researchers suspect that it originated shortly after the Big Bang, when hydrogen was found predominantly in the Universe.
Our Insights into Space: The Most Important Telescopes
The telescope is said to have been invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608 – even before Galileo Galilei used it for star observation a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have become ever larger – and the insights they provide have become ever deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
The Large Binocular Telescope is located in Arizona, USA.
It allows views into space via two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge - the mirror alone comes to 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented – to save costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of about eleven meters.
Disadvantage of the favorable construction: The telescope is fixed in its angle of height - and therefore limited in its mobility.
The Hobby Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at an elevation angle.
Its special feature: the high light collecting power.
Despite its comparatively small mirror diameter, it is similar to the world’s largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, researchers are listening to the space for extraterrestrial signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI), any computer owner can help by providing computing power.
View of the Observatory of the European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope - which honours its name.
With a total of four mirrors, the telescope can also illuminate the middle infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at ESO’s Chilean Observatory.
Its main mirror should cover a total of 42 meters - and be composed of almost 1000 mirror elements.
However, images can be expected at the earliest in 2018.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They offer two mirrors with an average of ten meters each.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which, alongside them, still looks up to the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
Also on the Mauna Kea a new giant telescope is to be created - with a mirror average of thirty meters.
Here it is to marvel at an illustration.
However, the most important impressions from space are provided by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, it has been providing images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets – mainly those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1,235 planet candidates had been identified since the start of the mission.
The final preparations for launch on the Kepler Space Telescope are documented in the image.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched on board an Ariane5 rocket as early as 2018.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the telescope’s tasks is to search for light from the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists believe that ice also exists at the south pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data for this, as the messengers are much closer to the North Pole around the planet.
Radar measurements have been indicating that there is ice on Mercury for decades.
The messenger probe launched in 2004 – the first to orbit Mercury – has now given scientists certainty.
Drinking butter every day - and turning 168 years old

There is even a museum of longevity.
A search for traces in the country where 97-year-olds are still comparatively young.
The drive through the Talysh Mountains is wild-romantic.
The minibus rumbles across the winding road, past densely wooded hills, rippling rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, you might think you are in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here lives the Caucasian ethnic group of Talysh, of which not much is known, except that it speaks perfectly Persian as well as Azeri and is very durable.
The terminus is Lerik.
The small town boasts overly elaborate architecture from Soviet times, which does not want to fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, too difficult is the journey from Azerbaijan’s capital Baku.
For the 323 kilometers it takes eight hours, because the road is only one lane.
The fabulous wealth that the country owes to its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived here in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the stuff for tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May with the Eurovision Song Festival - and next year we have a festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, arguably the only one in the world.
Here is documented the vita of about eight dozen talys from the area, which is older than 100. Fatulayeva points to a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136 a child was born
But the controversial star of the museum is the sheep shepherd <0xC5><0x9E>irali Müslümov, who is said to have turned 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And in view of the oldest documented man, who turned 122 years old, Müslümov’s age seems extremely doubtful.
"He was born here in the region in 1805, he died in 1973," explains Fatulayeva.
The man was married three times and had 23 children, and at the age of 136, he was said to have had a daughter.
So did <0xC5><0x9E>irali Müslümov make up for a few decades at his age?
But Rembrandt Scholz, age researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of the elderly in Central Asia.
"Strikingly many elderly people also live in some areas of China, in Japan, or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "even in Sardinia, extremely many very old men live."
Due to the lack of documentation, however, no scientific evidence about the age was to be kept, especially since personal status registers were missing.
Melted butter every day
The fact is, however, that the people of the region around Lerik strikingly often reach a biblical age.
There are currently 20 people older than 100 years.
So why are there so many high-aged people living here in the South?
The Azerbaijani guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talysh.
Museum director Fatulayeva, on the other hand, believes that it is due to nutrition.
But the fact that the high-calorie diet of the talys is supposed to be so healthy, which love meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of which drink a glass of melted butter every day, does not seem exactly plausible from a nutritional point of view.
Rubaba Mirzayeva lives in Cengemiran, a tiny settlement not far from the town of Lerik, where the people are still young.
At the age of 97, she is still comparatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a butter barrel that untiringly rolls her back and forth.
Eight people live under one roof here, including one of Mirzayeva’s sons and a daughter, both of whom have long been grandparents.
Two young children also jump around.
In the kitchen, guests can prepare tea, which is served in the typical belly-shaped Armadu glasses.
Mirzayeva’s white teeth stand perfectly in line, under her headscarf she hides long, dark-blonde braids that her son proudly reveals to us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so they never left me and kept their color.
"I've never used shampoo either," says Mirzayeva.
Monthly pension is enough for life
She always ate only what came from her own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
All my life I haven’t bought food at a supermarket.
Then she talks about her husband who was in the army.
The worst was in the post-World War II period.
But everything got better when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyew took over the helm.
The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult driven by the father figure of the nation, who ruled his country like a dictator, hardly knows borders in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, when his son Ilham took over the helm.
After all, there is no need among Azerbaijan’s elderly.
230 manat (approximately the same sum in euros), Mirzayeva receives a monthly pension, for local conditions an amount of which one can live well.
And perhaps Mirzayeva’s long gray son is right: “The elderly enjoy respect in our culture.”
They live in the middle of the big family, are loved, cared for and happy.
If that's not a reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word “human rights” is missing from the Constitution.
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rival rallies in Cairo reveal the deep division of the country.
The future constitution based on Sharia law is highly controversial.
The Egyptian president did not spare with pathos.
We have to make the transition.
"And that he succeeds is my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the whole people, but above all to the Christian Copts, the liberals, enlightened Muslims and seculars.
Because they all, so far hopelessly disunited in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a God-state on the Nile by the graces of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Morsi apologized, saying he had temporarily curtailed the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded his powers “to save the revolution.”
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a PhD from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save, the Egyptians are aware of, the world is not quite aware of.
Should the judiciary be dismissed?
In fact, the 234 articles whipped through by the Islamist-dominated 100-member Constituent Assembly in a nightly, 15-hour parforce ride are partly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the draft also states that the case law is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
But what does "principles" mean?
This was and is an interpretation matter and it is to be feared that the Islamists will use the spongy wording and the associated legal scope for a stricter interpretation of Sharia law.
This suggests at least one newly added article: In all matters relating to Sharia, the Al-Ashar University, the country’s most important Islamic institution with great radiance in the entire Sunni Islam, must be consulted.
This is not necessary, but it may mean that the clergy oversees the legislation, which in fact would result in the disempowerment of the judiciary.
Much in the draft is a matter of interpretation
Also problematic: The civilian military jurisdiction should continue to be maintained.
These courts were used during Mubarak’s rule to suppress oppositionists.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were held in military detention.
The state should also, it says in the draft, "protect the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "promote its morality and values."
This is so blurred in legal terms that with the help of this article, state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature.
In plain language, this means nothing but censorship.
Incidentally, no article expressly states the equality of men and women.
For this, another prohibits insulting or slandering the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what is an insult and how it should be punished remains unclear.
Similarly, the phrase “insulting people” seems to be prohibited.
Is a caricature of the president enough or a joke at the expense of a lawyer?
The matter of interpretation, as so much in the draft, which Mursi is present for signature and will, according to his words, be presented "very soon" to the Egyptians for a referendum.
"The revolution has returned"
The opposition has been forming for weeks against the supremacy of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands gathered in unusual harmony on Friday evening in Cairo’s Tahrir Square, vowing to bring down the Charter before it can enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, third-placed presidential candidate.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, said the draft constitution belonged “to the garbage mountain of history.”
Via Twitter, he accused Mursi's supporters of wanting to lead a "coup against democracy".
"If he calls the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," opposition leader Jasser Said said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been atoned for," the Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Chaled Ali as saying.
And several judges announced that they would not want to oversee the referendum, which would invalidate it.
"The Qur'an is our Constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, for its part, blew to counter-demonstration, but not on Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other side of the Nile in front of the Cairo University.
Many veiled women and Salafists attended, shouting, “The people are demanding the application of God’s law.”
They demanded from Mursi: “Cleanse the land!” and asserted: “The Qur’an is our constitution.”
A struggle for sovereignty over the emblematic Tahrir Square, where everything began, would probably have sparked civil war-like conditions.
Obviously, Mursi’s supporters did not want to risk that.
The Muslim Brotherhood stated that both the opponents of the draft constitution and the supporters had spoken out loud and clear.
Now is the time to let the people at the ballot box decide which direction the country should go.
A majority in favour of the Islamist draft is considered safe.
"The word human rights does not even exist"
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious about this forced constitutional process, which should have been going through February and involving all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or on trial under Mubarak.
Not because he would share their worldview, but because human rights are indivisible for him.
For this he was beaten, convicted, imprisoned.
"And now the word human rights is not even in the new constitution," he laments in a conversation with the "Welt am Sonntag".
Mursi's extension of power to all three powers in the state caused the lawyer to resign.
These measures are flagrant violations of democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the president is de facto dismantling it," Saeda lamented.
But without civil society organizations, a democracy cannot work.
Saeda feels left alone, also by the international community, which looks at the ideological directional struggle on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could take revenge.
A protester on the Tahrir warns, "You are bearing a monster that you can no longer control."
Rakfisk from Norway: Is this the most smelly fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living – not only in Europe, but all over the world.
Could the country’s secret to success have anything to do with the local appetite for rather nasty fish?
Take a selection of overripe cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of dirty, damp sportswear.
And leave her there for a week.
About that, you have to imagine the nose-deafening smell of Rakfisk, one of Norway’s great delicacies.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow here, spectacular landscapes - and that stubborn smell in the air that just doesn't want to disappear.
Rakfisk is a trout sprinkled with salt, which - depending on how smelly you like your fish - is fermented in water for up to a year.
When the darkness comes over the country in Norway and the weather gets colder, Norwegians flock to a festival here in Fagernes, dedicated to this, well, really very captivating specialty.
"You eat it raw and then rinse it down with a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works in the local fire department, but also hosts the festival as a so-called "Rakfisk-General".
People around us eat small fish cubes and consume large amounts of alcohol.
"Many people like the Aquavit more than the Rakfisk," says Havard.
The spirits can suppress the smell.
I'll have some snacks.
If you avoid bringing the Rakfisk close to your nose, it's not bad - like sushi, which has a pretty long bus ride behind it.
Rakfisk is the product of a completely different, much poorer Norwegian era, when there were no cooling facilities and fish was soaked in airtight salt water barrels in autumn.
In the deepest winter, it was then removed after long fermentation and - undoubtedly with the help of alcohol subdued senses - consumed.
Just a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians in search of work were forced to leave their country and emigrated mainly to the United States.
Today, the population is growing rapidly – more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a thriving labour market, high wages and comprehensive healthcare.
Even from Sweden, the old rival, who was far richer than Norway not too long ago, immigrants are flocking.
Rakfisk is regarded as something important – an essential, albeit highly smelling, part of Norwegian history.
It is one of the most expensive dishes you can buy here.
But actually, everything here is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs proudly 10 euros.
Norway doesn’t make it to the world press often, and most people don’t seem to bother with that.
Anders Breivik, the racist right-wing extremist who shot 77 men, women and children last year, is still hated here.
Instead, we only refer to the "incident of July 22".
Norwegians find it difficult to accept that someone in their peace-loving country is capable of such brutal murders.
The main reason for Norway’s wealth has been the growth of one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world since the early 1970s.
"But oil isn't the only reason we're doing so well," says Anna, our waitress, who distributes round trays of ripe rakfisk and embodies the Nordic ideal with her long blonde hair and stinging blue eyes.
We are, as they say, a wise people.
Her English is just like that of most people here.
We're not very pretentious, we don't like bragging.
Norway has handled its oil wealth very carefully – a large part of the industry’s revenue is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When, in the years leading up to the Great Depression, everyone was thrown around with money they didn’t even have, Norway kept its wallet tightly closed.
"As long as we can ski in winter and go hiking in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And, of course, eat rakfisk," she adds with carefree laughter.
I stand in the snow and stand for another dish - I've had enough of Rakfisk.
Such a moose burger is definitely something different. The juicy meat mouths me.
But in the evening the stinky fish is on the menu again.
The hotel where I stay is one of several venues that organize a Rakfisk dinner where guests can vote for the best – or perhaps the most challenging – fish.
There is a live TV circuit to a fly-clad showmaster surrounded by plates of Rakfisk.
It is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score do you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"Here are our points, Havard".
You clap and laugh.
A man falls from his chair, possibly overwhelmed by the aquavit.
But maybe it's the harsh fog of the whole fish.
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto faces tough start
As Mexico’s future president, Enrique Pena Nieto, prepares to take office, Will Grant of the BBC analyzes the challenges ahead and the mixed feelings of his people.
Currently, traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad.
Even on better days, this is an ever-clogged city, but on Monday, a steel ring was erected that shuts off several important traffic routes to the capital and creates chaos on the roads.
The goal, however, was not to disrupt commuters on their way to work, but to prevent protesters from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico’s new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential tie and take over the nation’s leadership.
He faces a complex task.
Under the outgoing government of Felipe Calderon, Mexico has proven itself economically well, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has already cost 60,000 lives in the last six years.
"My government is strongly committed to reducing violence," Peña Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy to help us achieve this goal.
Before joining the U.S. president, Peña Nieto served as governor of his home state of Mexico.
In this densely populated, vast part of the country that surrounds the capital, opinions about the new head of state are divided.
A direct man
In the remote small town of Valle del Bravo, for example, one likes to remember him.
Residents of the resort attribute it to the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure.
To reach the city, one can drive on one of the highways that Pena Nieto had built and which represents a great improvement over the brittle, bumpy roads that once existed here.
Plaques bearing his name also hang outside a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We expect real and sustained changes from him," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as a congressman for the Peña Nieto's party, the PRI.
In particular, as regards security and the economy, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country so desperately needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, the party has high expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejects the opposition’s accusations that the new president is lacking in substance.
He is a very direct man, very committed and has big plans for the country.
He is an excellent statesman, but above all, he is also someone who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, not many people share this view of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The place is hidden under highway crossings and in many ways represents a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are of decisive urban nature.
Earlier this year, the military was engaged to fight the drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
The bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left alone in a patch of wasteland near a large landfill in the past two years.
During the reign of Governor Pena Nieto, over 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico - a statistic that even surpasses that of the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is notorious for its violence and the murders of innocent women.
Critics of Pena Nietos believe that he has at least not addressed the problem of female murders during his term in office.
In the worst case, however, his government closed its eyes to the problem.
In a concrete building, typical of the declining neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles with the tears when she shows me photos of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes she was murdered by her partner.
"When I arrived at her home, it seemed as if her body had been washed," Buendia recalls.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the body rigidity had already started.
As her mother tells her story, a picture of Mariana looks down on us from the wall, next to a cross bearing a single word: justice.
But this, the family, has been denied to her until now.
The authorities have treated me as if I were a chatterer, a troublemaker, a nörgler.
They want you to just accept their judgment and keep your mouth shut.
“But that’s not possible if there were so many form errors and omissions,” she says.
When President Peña Nieto receives the Presidential bind on Saturday, he also assumes a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been victims of violent crimes over the past six years, and the new president has promised to take special care of this problem during his term.
"I hope as president he is as he was as governor," said the PRI Congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But that is what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fear most.
Prosecutor claims Bradley Manning did not complain about abuse
Prosecutor Dismisses Bradley Manning’s Accusations of Being Abused in Prison
The hearing deals with Manning's time at the Military Prison in Quantico, Virginia
The defense seeks a rejection of the indictment due to too harsh detention conditions
U.S. Army soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents
The prosecutor's office tried on Friday to establish that Army pistolman Bradley Manning - accused of the largest disclosure of confidential information in U.S. history - missed several occasions to complain about the abuse he allegedly suffered in military detention.
During a cross-examination of Manning during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Maj. Ashden Fein explained that records of weekly visits made by prison officials during Manning's nine-month imprisonment in Quantico, Virginia, showed no complaints about his treatment.
A day before the cross-examination, which was held as a result of a request from the defense to reject the indictment - Manning had already been adequately punished by the harsh imprisonment - Manning had testified that he had considered suicide in prison.
The U.S. Army intelligence analyst, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his time in Iraq.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as the source of the information.
In the Friday hearing, Fein and Manning reviewed the forms that officials had filled out after their meetings with Manning during his detention at the Quantico Military Prison, where he had been incarcerated from July 2010 to April 2011 under increased detention conditions.
The officers asked Manning questions and wrote down his answers.
When Fein asked him about the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he had judged the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the establishment as a whole as "very professional".
The forms, Fein said, contained no complaints about mistreatment, although officials had directly questioned Manning about his treatment.
Manning replied that he had expressed his concerns orally and that the officials had discussed them with him and indicated that they would deal with them, but they had not been recorded.
“They wrote (after discussing the concerns) ‘No problems’, and that didn’t necessarily mean I didn’t say anything at all,” Manning said.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met with a committee in January 2011 to investigate the suicidal thoughts he mentioned on a form a few months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during this meeting was to downgrade his observation status to “prevent injury.”
The military said it had assigned him this restrictive status – which is one stage below suicide risk – to his and the protection of others.
“I wanted to convince employees that I was doing well and get rid of observational status for the prevention of injuries (...) in order to achieve a higher quality of life in my view,” Manning said.
Manning said on Thursday he was arrested and transferred to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the prison of the Quantico naval base in Virginia in July 2010.
He said he had considered suicide in Kuwait and had once become unconscious due to the heat.
Not being able to know what was happening to him or the outside world has been burdensome.
"My world shrunk at Camp Arafjon, on this cage together," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in that cage.
When he was transferred to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell — at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours — and without company.
They only allowed him a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothes and his glasses.
Manning said he was trying to keep moving because by day it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down.
He always had to sleep with light that entered his cell from the outside.
When he turned around at night and the guards could no longer see his face, they woke him up so he would turn back.
In January 2011, Manning's lawyer formally appealed against Manning's treatment.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to the Fort Leavenworth Military Prison in Kansas.
On Friday, Judge Manning also questioned an allegation he had made in his testimony on Thursday - so he had to sleep naked one night in his cell in Quantico and stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners at a morning count.
Manning had testified that he had never had the opportunity to cover himself with his blanket during this count.
During the interview on Friday, Manning said he had concluded from an order from his guard that he should drop the blanket with which he could have covered himself, but he admitted that no one had asked him to do so.
On Thursday, Manning had testified that he was forced to sleep naked the previous night and had previously tried to show an official that he posed no danger to himself.
Manning had told the official that he could have used the waistband of his underpants or flip-flops to hurt himself, but he did not.
That night, Manning said, his underpants, flip-flops and glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account his detention experiences and drastically reduce his level of detention if he is convicted in his trial before the military court, which is scheduled for early next year.
The defense has indicated that Manning will plead guilty to minor offences, while other charges deemed too extreme are to be challenged.
The continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend, and the prosecution is expected to justify the conditions of detention.
The Pentagon remains in its position that Manning has been detained in accordance with the provisions that apply to all prisoners detained under the highest security guards in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include fomenting the enemy, unlawful publication of intelligence information on the Internet, transmission of national defense information, and theft of public property or documents.
If he is found guilty in all charges, he faces life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people are forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame the immigrants – they remind them of hard times, he says
Navarrette believes Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and had arrived at the passport control when confusion spread within me.
Signs pointed to two queues: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), another for "Extranjeros" ("Foreigners").
I stood there for a few seconds, unsure where to go.
I grew up in Central California and have been called “Mexicains” all my life.
An ethnic abbreviation - just like my friends in Boston call themselves "Irene" or my friends in New York call themselves "Italians".
Later, I decided to go for "Mexican-American."
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather’s home there was no need for shortcuts or hyphens.
I was just American.
I speak Spanish, at least good enough to maintain myself in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I don’t have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I won’t get rid of my American accent either.
So I took my American passport and put myself in line for Extranjeros.
I was thinking about that moment this week when future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda were all those issues that were expected when the heads of these two countries met: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one reason why Mexicans are equally likely to stay in Mexico today instead of emigrating to the United States.
He wants to unite with the United States and Canada and create a North American trade bloc modelled on the European Union.
And Pena Nieto vowed to continue the war of Mexico against the drug cartels, even if he did not mention any details on this.
Mexico’s relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never waste a single thought on the fact that the United States invaded Mexico in 1848, forcing the country’s leadership to leave more than half of its territory to them.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries and not in minutes, memories of this event are not to be overlooked.
So, as soon as a U.S. government official makes the slightest criticism of Mexico, one hears complaints – in the Mexican press and among the country’s elites – about how Americans are harassing the sovereignty of their neighboring country.
And Montezuma's children are on the war path.
And yet, Mexico’s biggest challenge in reality lies in its relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Want to talk about resentment?
There's more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities, and others for whom it does not.
The only reason so many people of Mexican origin live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at one point in our family tree, a person—perhaps a parent or grandparent—was given no chance in Mexico and emigrated north.
And in most cases, this person corresponded to a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our loyalty applies to them.
Not Mexico.
And while we may now be living the American Dream, attending good schools and getting good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American Dream we are living – not the Mexican Dream.
Our identity may sometimes be blurred, but as far as our loyalty is concerned, it is not.
This clearly applies to the United States.
Moreover, we are aware that many members of the Mexican leadership do not like us.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look down on us because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In their opinion, our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families had not failed in Mexico, they would not have gone.
And then we wouldn’t see ourselves trapped behind the silk curtain – with a pleasant life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally immigrated to the United States as a child, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are – and Mexican Americans take this offense to them.
While she is a U.S. citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans I know have the feeling that neither belong to one country nor to the other.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
One enjoys the best of both worlds, but is not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico, we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States, we are seen as Mexicans.
As I was supposed to learn during my journey, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of the educational bourgeoisie want to re-establish their connections to the diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as provisional “ambassadors” for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues how great a visit to this country is and pressure the political leadership to intensify their ties to Mexico.
Oh, well.
That's not gonna happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And given the unfair distribution of income, unbridled corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure if this is really a great country.
I'm afraid you'll have to go through that alone, amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico a century and a half ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans have a grudge at how their family members were treated not so long ago.
- Hmmm.
Maybe we're more Mexican than I thought.
Old Battles, New Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected foundation for peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to suffocate such hope in the germination.
In the midst of the usual accusations, countless buildings have been demolished, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis killed – and for the first time, rockets from Gaza have hit near the Israeli metropolis of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even though Israelis and Palestinians seem trapped in their historical conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want it or not - Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this turmoil.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to believe that the deadly stalemate could finally come to an end.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, optimism seems anything but appropriate given the current situation.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on 21 November continues, this week’s fighting has strengthened the hard-boiled on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has been controlling the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim to have pushed back the Israelis, despite the fact that its group itself suffered heavy losses.
Although several Hamas leaders are killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip are grafted into one of the most desolate and densely populated corners of the planet, Israel has not yet succeeded in destroying Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And the Hamas leaders could conclude that they have time on their side.
Just as Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas has been able to draw powerful and rich friends to its side.
Turkey, a resurgent regional power once considered Israel’s closest Muslim ally, has taken sides for Hamas – just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Hailing Hamas supporters believe that an Islamist crescent is forming around Israel – from Lebanon in the north, where Hezbollah militants have power, to Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamist rank could stand in front of the overthrow of Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And in particular, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt – by far the most populous and most important Arab country – on the southern flank of Israel has changed the balance of the region sustainably.
Hosni Mubarak, the lay despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time left for Hamas.
In contrast, the Brotherhood is conspiring with Hamas and its leaders are more dependent on popular views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove to be an actor that cannot be pushed out even by Israel and the United States.
The Israeli hardliner, on the other hand, draws the opposite conclusion.
From a military point of view, Hamas is no longer a threat.
The Israeli missile defense system, “Iron Dome,” has proved itself and many of the Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
At least for a while, Israel will be able to sleep more quietly.
From a diplomatic point of view, the United States is firmly holding on to its position, and many European countries have blamed Hamas for the latest escalations of violence.
Israel has been doing well in recent years, especially under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide bombings – not least thanks to the blockades that run into the West Bank and thus into the main part of a possible Palestinian state. These protect the Jewish settlements, which have been declared ever more illegal.
Netanyahu’s Likud party has allied itself with an even more militant group in the run-up to the January 22 elections under Avigdor Lieberman.
Why do these treacherous Palestinians cuddle and leave their own state to them?
If they were actually in control of the West Bank, wouldn’t they be firing rockets just like their counterparts in the Gaza Strip?
No, it is better to keep them at bay behind the wall and punish them if they dare to raise their heads.
Perhaps the hardliners will be able to prevail, but the Arab Spring could make a mark on them.
Even if the Islamists, who are now in power in Egypt and other countries, have little left for Israel, they will initially focus on the difficulties in their own country.
Israel’s defense budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments in restoring their economy.
The fact that pragmatic President Morsi teamed up with Barack Obama to reach a ceasefire could be a promising sign – and perhaps symbolize the beginning of a new era.
Israelis should also think long-term.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking timid steps toward democratization, Palestinians continue to be deprived of their right to self-determination — a powder barrel that will undoubtedly one day explode in the Israeli-occupied territories, just as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The oppression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population, this situation will only worsen.
Bloody missions to repel Hamas in the Gaza Strip will increasingly demand their diplomatic tribute over the years.
Both sides need a push from the outside
The correct answer is that of the more reasonable representatives of both sides, most of the rest of the world and this newspaper: two states where Israel cedes territories for security purposes.
The hope – small for the near future – is that the ceasefire will give outsiders more influence to enforce this solution.
Egypt, together with Turkey and Qatar, must now stop arms deliveries to the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever to convince Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, complemented by territory exchange and a common Jerusalem.
Foreign Arab nations should also push Hamas and Fatah to reach an agreement.
This would do more for the creation of a Palestinian state than with the forthcoming application for UN observer status.
Obama, too, must play his part in pushing Israel into negotiations.
During his first term, he missed the idea of his own peace plan.
Far away in the White House, he seems to be just as reluctant to participate.
But this is a deplorable, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has a major interest in a stable Middle East.
This includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian laws for uniform cigarette packaging enter into force
Health warnings and diseased body parts on neutral green packs that are the same for all tobacco brands
The world’s first laws for uniform cigarette and tobacco packaging have come into force in Australia, replacing brand logos and colors with neutral, olive-green lids, which are also printed with drastic images showing sick body parts and cigarette smoke-affected infants and children.
Aside from the different health warnings and pictures, the only difference between the packages in the brand names, which are printed in identical, small font, is from next Saturday.
This means that Australia is introducing the world’s most stringent regulations for tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government wants to stop young people from smoking by removing the glamorous image of tobacco use.
Studies have shown that people who haven’t started smoking at the age of 26 are 99% unlikely to start smoking.
"You can already see in young children that they understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to promote with their brand image," said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will only have a minor impact on the profits of multinational corporations, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the laws.
According to the law, black market trade would be favored, leading to cheaper and more accessible cigarettes.
"The laws will lead to serious, unintended consequences," said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer much larger quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others, on the other hand, say that the laws have boosted their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, notes that demand for cigarette cases and silicone lids to cover the unbearable packaging has risen tremendously since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco challenged the law in the Australian Supreme Court two months ago.
Zico has sold up to 6,000 units to wholesalers and is waiting for new stocks.
This is a good business for us.
According to experts, the hook in the popularity of social media lies with the exact population group to which the plan is aimed.
A number of Australian laws have banned tobacco companies from TV advertising, banned them from acting as sports sponsors, and forced most merchants to stop selling cigarettes in stores. Now tobacco advertising has switched to the internet.
The Australian government has banned internet advertising by local companies and sites, but has no influence on international sites.
“Anyone who markets tobacco and only has a small area left to promote their products doesn’t get around the internet,” says Becky Freeman, a health care researcher at the University of Sydney.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook, Freeman has noted an increase in reviews of brands written by “normal people.”
One has to ask oneself: Is this just a private person who likes Marlboro cigarettes so much that she even records a video for it - or does a marketing agency have to do with it?
British American Tobacco Australia says that instead of marketing, the industry is focusing on dealing with the new laws.
It has even gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules – those countries complain to the World Trade Organization about unfair trade restrictions, although none of the countries are doing greater trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected for mid-2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has held talks with other countries that are considering similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to prescribe photographic warnings in 2001.
In the meantime, these have been expanded to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Harder laws are being considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers are defiant.
The pictures don't affect me.
I'm just ignoring them.
"You just take a tilt and put the box away," says Victor El Hage when buying a cigarette box, on which a photo with a mouth tumor is printed.
Honestly, there's only one reason I'd quit, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, operator of the “King of the Pack” tobacco trade in downtown Sydney, says the unified packaging has made it difficult to fill up its shelves.
"I used to take an hour to sort a delivery, now I need four," Yu says.
"The government should have just banned cigarettes completely - then we'd have said okay, that's it, we're closing down," he adds visibly angry.
In a constantly electrified world, it’s nice to be bored sometimes.
This Thanksgiving I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport when our plane crashed due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane.
So I had enough time to think a few things too boring.
I don't want to lie.
Waiting half a day at the airport for a flight is quite annoying – even when books, magazines, and iPhones (and of course, tax-free shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and child development experts cite boredom as something positive.
When it comes to them, it’s okay for us – and our children – to be bored occasionally.
This forces the brain to lose itself in interesting thoughts, which may promote creativity.
And because most of us are almost constantly staring at one screen or another these days, the benefits of boredom no longer benefit us.
So should we welcome boredom with open arms?
Yeah, yeah.
And no.
I will come back to that once again.
Like many people, I have always assumed that boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon that has evolved with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of “Boredom: A Lively History” (Yale University Press, 2011) does not see it that way.
“In fact, boredom has a very long history,” he says.
The walls of Pompeii decorate a Latin graffiti about boredom that dates back to the first century.
And then there is the question of how we actually define boredom.
According to John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom has been defined and discussed in many ways.
After a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea in front of a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the conclusion that boredom can be defined as the experience of "wanting to carry out a satisfactory activity, but not being able to do so".
Boredom differs from apathy in that the person is not busy, but wants to be.
With apathy, however, there is no urge to do anything.
The key experience of boredom, he says, is a “disruption of the attention process, coupled with a bad mood and the feeling that time is passing slowly.”
Boredom can sound like depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes, although these two conditions may be related, bored individuals see the problem in their environment or the world, while depressed individuals see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we are bored, even if we just have difficulty concentrating.
In their study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention" - in English for example: "The Idle Mind: The Definition of Boredom Under the Aspect of Attention", which appeared in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science" in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues point to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to an article in front of a band on which a person read an article.
Some groups heard a loud TV program from the neighboring room that had nothing to do with the content; others heard it at low volume, so it was barely perceptible, while the third group did not hear these sounds at all.
The people who heard the barely audible television said they felt more bored than the other two groups - they had trouble concentrating, couldn't find a reason for this, and attributed their difficulties to boredom.
Trying to focus on a difficult or strenuous task can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, if you are pursuing a monotonous activity - "like the search for faulty products on a factory conveyor belt, music can distract and help you not feel bored".
In fact, he says, we now know that tapping around and scribbling, often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can even fight these by keeping people more physically alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to hop around learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still," said Professor Fenske.
We all get bored at some point - my late flight, a roaring loudspeaker, a particularly tiresome movie.
But some people get bored more easily than others.
To measure these differences, researchers developed a "scale of boredom" in the 1980s.
On the scale, statements such as "Many things I have to do repeat and are monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything."
Using such scales, researchers have found that boys are more likely to get bored than girls, according to Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida — especially as regards the need for more and a greater variety of external stimuli.
But in general, teens are a rather relaxed bunch.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teens and their parents with a pager seven to eight times a day.
He found that 32% of adolescents were bored at school and doing their homework, while 23% said they were bored when they were not at school.
But only 3% of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he does not know whether the percentages of boredom have increased or decreased.
However, he is sure that “youth will be perceived as particularly boring”, mainly because children and teenagers have little influence on their daily routine.
So back to my original question: Is boredom healthy?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases, it leads to people taking extreme physical risks and falling into gambling or drugs to alleviate them - that's what studies have shown.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors are investigating the relationship between boredom and creativity. This is the opinion of Professor Vodanovich, who has been researching the subject for more than two decades.
“With boredom, the brain wants to tell you to do something else,” said Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn’t always know what to do best.
When you are bored and you use that energy to play guitar and cook, you become happy.
But while television can create happiness in the short term, it will disappear in the long term.
If you give your bored child an iPad, you can stop them from getting bored, but they haven’t learned how to keep themselves entertained or to control themselves, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: “self-control transfers from one situation to another.”
The child not only learns to talk, but also gains more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should celebrate boredom.
Nor should we view them too critically.
Instead, our goal should be to feel at ease even away from constant activity and technology spills.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds like we need to be bored more often, but boredom is the tormenting, incessant desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that people are really just looking for a way to unwind and relax.
“In an environment where we’re constantly overstimulated, it’s hard to get busy once the noise has stopped.”
In Colorado, there is no clear guideline for the new marijuana law
19-year-old community college student and footballer Anthony Orozco stands trial in southeast Colorado for a crime that will soon be legal in that state: possession of a few marijuana chunks and a pipe he used to smoke them.
According to Orozco, he and some friends were driving in Lamar near the Kansas border on a September day when they were stopped.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Orozco was summoned for possession of drugs and drug utensils — cavalier offenses each with a $100 penalty — and received a court appointment.
"We're being treated like criminals," Orozco said.
But is he also one?
In the uncertain weeks following the state’s decision to legalize small amounts of marijuana for self-use, the response to hundreds of minor drug offenses depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of lawsuits that revolve around marijuana are already being dropped here and in the state of Washington, which approved similar measures.
Police authorities will no longer prosecute adults over the age of 21 for small possessions, which will be allowed by law as soon as the new laws enter into force in the next few weeks.
But prosecutors in Colorado’s more conservative districts have announced to pursue existing marijuana offences and are still citing people in court.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the Western Mountains, are voting to prevent new, state-licensed marijuana stores from opening in their communities.
“This situation is evolving so fast that I don’t know what’s going to happen next,” said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, east of Denver.
And regulators in the state of Washington are also scratching their heads.
They are waiting for guidance on setting up a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - and have a deadline by December 1, 2013 in mind.
In Washington, it is believed that Colorado is ahead of most states when it comes to regulating marijuana, where the drug was first legalized for medical purposes and then for self-consumption.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so the state is well-suited for orientation," said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Spirits Regulatory Authority.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than serve in the sense of a rough guide.
“We don’t have a real precedent that we can follow,” he adds.
The Washington law, called I-502, will enter into force on December 6, also forming the end point of a gray zone in which the state licensing system does not yet exist, but ownership is legalized.
And unpleasant practical issues need to be clarified at this time – such as how to agree on the state’s requirement of “appropriate access” to licensed marijuana with the ban on cannabis stores within a 300-metre radius around schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities.
"Nowhere will it be harder to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially the Seattle metropolitan area," said Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently formed research group.
On November 21, Chief Oates sent an email to his Aurora employees stating that the prosecutor would no longer prosecute minor marijuana offenses against people over the age of 21, and that the police would not seek criminal charges for those offenses "from now on."
Chief Oates added that the police will continue to enforce urban regulations regulating medical marijuana growers and continue to prosecute drug dealers.
In Weld County in northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck holds a stricter view.
After the vote, he stated that his agency would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to encourage consumers to withdraw.
Currently, 119 people have to answer for possession of about 50 grams or less of marijuana in court, although many have also been charged with other offences.
"Our agency has a duty to prosecute violations that were criminal at the time of the crime," Buck said in a statement.
The reactions are even ambiguous in places such as rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the county’s largest city, no longer target adults for possession of smaller amounts.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to drop all pending property proceedings.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time enforcing the law until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of Colorado voters supported the measure, it was clear from the start that it would not be easy to reconcile personal consumption of marijuana with the complexities of government and legal system.
And the contradictory reactions throughout the state fostered a profound dissension among local officials with regard to the great green experiment.
District prosecutors are a “cultural barrier,” says Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents defendants in court for marijuana offences and acts as a local spokesperson for the National Organization for Marijuana Law Reform.
"They have spent so much of their lives prosecuting people for still not being able to accept legalization," he said.
As the first states to treat smaller amounts of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington are being traded as national sample cases for the legalization of drugs.
While advocates and state officials are preparing for an era of legal sale, they are also nervously awaiting instructions from the federal government, which wants to continue to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana as a criminal offence at the federal level.
Advocates of the legalization movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will give in.
Despite several eye-catching arrests of consumers and sellers of medical marijuana, the federal government has largely allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Kevin A. Sabet, former drug policy adviser to the Obama administration, believes that while criminal officers are unlikely to enter doors to seize smaller amounts of drugs, they are likely to resist to tolerate legal, state-regulated marijuana stores under the new legislation.
Several cities in Colorado are not even waiting for the federal authorities to act.
Even before the election day, some local municipalities approved moratoriums on new marijuana stores, although they could only open in about a year.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the west, passed a six-month ban, which is likely to be passed next week.
“We don’t want to get into a position where we’re licensing someone and then face a big problem at the federal level,” said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are based on what the community has chosen and not on what the state has chosen.
Many questions are still open.
Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied from Oxford because I'm Tory
Not only today’s university students are being attacked for their views
It has always been my biggest dream to get a place at the University of Oxford.
Both my father and my older brother had attended the university that I once thought was the greatest temple of knowledge in the world, for a modern Greek symposium that promoted the great pillars of civilization – free thinking and tolerance.
But within two weeks of my arrival at Worscester College in the late 1980s – where I had planned to study history – I had packed my bags again and brought about the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed in tears.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard said I left because I had a problem with fellow students having sex in the next room.
Author A.N. Wilson mischievously explained that I had left the university because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
The truth was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran, because I suffered from systematic bullying and threats.
Not because of my rather unusual name, or because I came from a private school.
I had been harassed for only one reason - one reason that seemed all the more narrow-minded and cruel in this supposed cradle of enlightenment: my late father Woodrow Wyatt had been an important adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why am I mentioning this right now?
Well, according to recent reports, a new generation of moderate-right students suffer similar persecution.
The organised and growing hatred of Tory students in Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them last week called for the same level of equality protection that benefits gays, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of Corpus Christi College's Junior Common Room (JCR) say they are "often actively isolated, personally attacked and declared undesirable" due to their political views.
They demand a place on the equality committee of their college to ensure that their opinions can be expressed freely.
Their situation was exacerbated by a recent BBC Two documentary about political students, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", which portrayed Tories as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
Among other things, it showed graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the conservative student association of the University of Oxford, who drove in a Rolls-Royce and wore a silver suit and silver-studded walking stick.
At other universities, conservative students say they are considered “the scapegoats for introducing higher tuition.”
20-year-old Luke Black, vice president of the conservative student union at the University of Nottingham, said in a Sunday newspaper: "There is a growing leftist tendency in universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even getting to know each other."
Samuel Roberts, 21, a history student in Corpus Christi who initiated the request for greater protection, believes such a climate is “unpleasant.” 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, president-elect of Oxford’s conservative student association, says she has observed a growing rejection of moderate-right students among JCR members.
"This poses a threat to intellectual discourse and to the well-being of members," she says.
During my first weeks in Oxford, I belonged to such a minority.
As an incredibly shy 18-year-old, I arrived in September 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
Last year, the university voted not to award an honorary degree to Margaret Thatcher – a former student – due to cuts in higher education.
The atmosphere would have terrified even Stalinists.
In the first days of the first semester week, when new students get to know each other and the tutors, I got a taste of the future events.
I found that the tutors not only tolerated the mockery of Tory students, but even took part with joy.
Political issues such as the miners’ strike, privatization and the government’s rejection of sanctions against South Africa’s apartheid regime found their way into the wood-paneled rooms of the tutorial.
On my first of these events, I was supposed to translate French texts from the 18th century into English, but I had not been prepared for what was to come.
"Miss Wyatt," said tutor Harry Pitt (meanwhile deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I stumbled.
Pitt was a little man with a face like cake dough, and quite hateful.
"Do Thatcher supporters refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked me.
The other students laughed.
In my eyes, tears abounded.
"I suggest you take a few French lessons in your free time -- so if you're not too busy with your social activities," Pitt murmured.
I returned to my room with my head hanging.
That evening, I was sitting alone in college at dinner, when someone slightly taped me on the shoulder.
It was a second-year English student named James who introduced himself as a member of the Conservative Student Association.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
Unfortunately, it is what it is.
Anyone suspected of being Tory will be harassed.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's going to be worse for you.
Most Tory first semesters pretend to be Labour supporters.
In a local pub, I later tried to disguise myself.
I insisted that I did not agree with Mrs. Thatcher on all points.
This trick should prove unsuccessful.
A beginner in philosophy, politics and economics who ironically had attended Eton College, a conservative college, said to me, “You are the daughter of a fascist pig.”
You're dirty.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverse and dirty.
"How do Tories have sex?" one asked me.
They beat each other, right?
I felt what homosexuals must have felt before the more liberal legislation of the United States.
Would I ever manage to live a normal life at Oxford University?
Would I be able to meet like-minded people only after dark?
Should I turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years that lay before me stretched out before my spiritual eye into a purgatory of denial and isolation.
The only tutor to openly identify himself as Tory was Norman Stone, a professor of contemporary history who had his seat in my college.
He was hated not only for being a conservative, but also for advising Thatcher on foreign policy and writing speeches for them.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place, found it provincial and petty and rejected it for his Marxist-determinist perspective on history.
In 1997 he took up a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I started commuting between Oxford and my parents’ house and found refuge with more open-minded friends and family members in the city.
I told my father that I hated Oxford and why I did it.
He seemed to be unbelieving.
During his time in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said tiny.
They would never do such a thing, not in my city of dreaming tower peaks.
Even my communist friends always showed flawless manners.
His wet eyes were clouded.
Give the whole thing a chance.
I'm sure they're just teasing you.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance weakened.
One of my male friends, also Tory supporters, had yielded to the pressure and renounced his beliefs.
During a tutorial the following week, during which another history teacher had seriously claimed that I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Although I was secretly drowning in shame, I admitted that my parents had undergone a "brainwashing" and called them "old idiots."
The relief lasted only a short time.
It was my father who punched the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At that time, he wrote two columns per week in the Murdoch press.
My door was locked.
I hid in my room, and after five minutes my bunnies gave up.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
You are welcome to call me a weeping slutty cock.
But no 18-year-old should ever have to suffer such intimidation and malice in an educational institution.
And more tragically, it was Oxford—a university that not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but hiding behind an undeserved call for equality and freedom of thought to this day.
"Valentino prefers elegance to celebrity"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - Master of Couture", which opened this week in London, ABC speaks to Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian fashion maker.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
This was acknowledged by the designer at the opening of "Valentino - Master of Couture", a grandiose retrospective for which more than 130 Haute Couture dresses created by his "Maison" in the last 50 years have been assembled.
"I love this palace," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but who could not have been written without his distinguished clientele.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the stubborn and distant world of nobility.
In the first hall of this exhibition, which will be on view until March 3, there will be a variety of private letters and photographs with the signature of the finest aristocracy, starting with Princess Salimah Aga Khan, Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita of England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social rise from the humble fashion maker in the city of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of international jet set.
Being in love with the nobility does not have to be a disadvantage.
“At least they don’t kick their hens off on your gorgeous carpet like some beautiful celebrities from pop music do,” says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s the two lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We were all delighted when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, close friends with forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of celebrity.
And yet he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress by Valentino
Even the Argentine model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charisma of the fashion maker.
Many years ago we went to his house for dinner after a fashion show at Piazza di Spagna in Rome.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
At every detail of his apartment, the decoration, the food and the music, one recognized and felt his influence.
"All invited people felt important and loved," recalls the "Top Model" who began her career at the 1995 week of Haute Couture in Paris.
“He never gets out of fashion because his designs are works of art,” she concludes.
Fashion show of origin
The life of Garavani is not a story of obsession, but rather of mutual love.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House has been transformed into a glorious and 60-metre-long catwalk, which suggests a roller exchange: the user takes the place of the model and walks along the catwalk to admire a dreamy "audience" wearing Monica's masterpieces of Valentino, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy picked out for her wedding to Aristoteles On
In this audience of fashion dolls shine names such as that of Sibilla de Luxemburgo, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofia of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the Fashion Maker, 2006
Many of these clients say the first Valentino is like the first love, "unforgettable".
I can still remember perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, a vest type "Gillette" and a jacket from the autumn/winter collection 1971-1972.
“It was a gift from him,” says Naty Abascal, one of the designer’s muses.
"I prefer him to everyone else because of his great love for women and because he highlights our beauty," added the ex-Duchess of Feria.
I like the colors he uses very much; they have a lot of light and underline the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg, the leader of fashion, cannot forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
When I was a teenager living in Italy, I dreamed of finally having the age and the opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses...
At the end of the 90s, it finally came to pass.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a feast in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with a flying skirt and a draped top with a cleavage that honors his name.
"It was a dream come true," says Rodrigo d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino doesn't depend on fashion, his obsession is timeless," explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D’Arenberg preserves her fashion designer’s evening dresses “with absolute care,” “because a dress is not only a dress, but also the memories associated with it.”
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition at Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller’s wedding dress for her wedding to Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (as the fashion designer called his seamstresses) were necessary to make this ivory silk dress with pearls, twelve different embroidery and a four-and-a-half meter long tail.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the professional press, this dress was a milestone in the haute couture of the late 20th century, "the return to the customers of the supreme society."
Nubbed with the elite's "savoir-être" for years, Valentino is now her best specimen.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest award in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any of the husbands of his clients.
"I have always noticed his refinement, his tranquility, his well-kept and perfect appearance," D'Arenberg admits.
I saw him last time a month ago at a gala dinner at the Museum de Orsay.
He sat at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
"He was immaculate; time leaves no trace on him".
And this is what a princess says...
The most difficult profession in the world: the human working animals of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and their health when they carry 70 kilos of sulphur across the steep, rocky roads.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others literally work in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their lives by extracting sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, he has to climb down to the bottom of his crater every day, where the sulphur-containing gas emanating from the earth solidifies in contact with the air.
After breaking out large sulphur stones, which can weigh up to 70 kilos in total, he transports them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders over the sloping paths of stone.
While it is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to an altitude of 2,386 meters, the exhausted carriers need more than 40 minutes to climb at the turtle pace, keeping the balance and taking their steps carefully so that they do not slip and crash.
They know that every step can cost their lives, as happened to a French tourist who crashed on the steep slopes of Kawah Ijen years ago.
The Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 cents for every kilo of sulphur they mine.
Arriving at the top, they pave the way between the tourists they photograph like circus monkeys and walk with the tiresomely heavy baskets three kilometers to the scale that a mining company has set up a little further down at an altitude of 1850 meters
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, which has been exploiting the volcanic deposits since 1960 and (never to say better) its workers, for whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 eurocents) for each kilo of sulfur.
This then sells them for 10,000 rupees (83 eurocents) each to the petrochemical industry, because this mineral is widely used in everyday life and is used for making matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for bleaching sugar.
"Since we usually carry 70 kg, we get about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each route," explains Anto, who normally does three routes a day.
For each race it takes three hours, after which it is completely done, but at the end of the day it has 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) combined.
What looks like a miserable wage for such an utterly inhuman effort, however, is three times what he would earn from fieldwork.
"The daily wage of miners here, where the coffee harvest pays 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day and the average monthly income is two million rupees (167 euros), is very high," explains the carrier, who previously worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a nearby village, for a reason as important in Indonesia as the sulphur: "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought her to Java to convert her to Islam".
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated because of the poisonous gases.
The 27-year-old Anto has been risking his life at Kawah Ijen for three years, whose sulphur has already left his first mark on him, even though he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated because of the toxic gases from the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay for achieving his dream.
"I will work here for two more years because I want to open a store or learn Spanish or French," he promises in a more than just acceptable English.
This sympathetic and intelligent but life-punished young man might work as a tourist guide, waiter, or at the reception of a hotel, but instead he does the work of a carrier.
He shares a dirty wooden hut with other carriers and gets up every morning at two o’clock, because the sulfur also flows out at night, where its characteristic yellow color shines bluish in the dark.
Challenging the shadows, he climbs into the crater in the light of a small headlamp on his helmet, which he bought from his own money.
About 400 carriers load baskets of sulfur on their shoulders at the bottom of the crater.
Despite its large profits, the mining company has not mechanized sulphur mining to save costs, and does not provide any equipment to carriers who work on their own account and are paid by weight.
You will also not receive a share of the 30,000 rupees (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.5) supplement per camera, which the guardians of this nature park, together with the entrance fee of 15,000 rupees (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.2), charge from the tourists who come to photograph the volcano and the human carrier.
"This work is for animals and not for humans," protests Madrusin, a stubborn 42-year-old wearer who has been working at Kawah Ijen for three decades since leaving school.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assures that he will continue "as long as he can" because he needs the money to raise his three children aged between 10 and 18.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life.
Even when the sulfur burns the throat and itches the eyes, when the wind suddenly turns and the miners are clamped into the thick columns that rise out of the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains about serious diseases ... of course, except for the usual breathing problems, osteoarthritis, pain in the knees and blisters on the shoulders.
With the basket on his back, Unainik is only able to carry 50 kg at the age of 53.
Every day, he and his companions break 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which are transported by three trucks over a goat path between the bushes to the camp in Tamansari at 18 kilometers distance.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life," Unainik explains, opening his mouth wide, missing some teeth.
Of his five children, the eldest at the age of 30 also works as a sulphur carrier.
Time passes, but poverty persists generation after generation in one of the toughest professions in the world: that of those who work as human asses on the Kawah Ijen.
Singapore Needs Babies to Save the Economy
The Singaporeans blame the lack of children on the career, stress and cost of real estate and parenting.
“The population of Singapore needs to grow.”
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: let us fulfill our civic duty and create life!
It seems unbelievable that the verses are part of an advertising for mint candy, but nonetheless - or precisely because of that - they became a viral video on YouTube at the beginning of this year in Singapore.
The phrases are part of a rapper's song, the local sayings such as "sliding a "bao" (lab) into the oven to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising company BBH, which shot the video, maintains the hope that the commercial will reach in a funny way to draw attention to the problem.
Their creative director Douglas Hamilton says he wanted to use the power of music to get people to fulfill their “national duty.”
This is something just for the internet, so we had to make it funny and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
When it comes to reproducing, we are the worst in the world, so we realized that it was a topic that we had to take care of.
We knew that the government had tried a lot, such as marketing perfume with pheromones or organizing speed dating evenings (fast flirting).
It is possible that many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily lead to success.
So we thought, why not make something as creative as possible to tackle this problem, such as composing a rap?
1.2 Children
Anyone who does not take this issue lightly is the Government of Singapore.
Every year, she spends $1,300 on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for married couples and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But everything has had little success so far.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, known for the conservatism of its rulers and its strict social controls.
According to its national population authority, the birth rate is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time that this rate was above 2 – which is also known as the replacement rate – was in 1976.
So why don’t Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policy at the National Population Authority, says this is due to "better education" and "greater career opportunities."
“This has allowed people to have much more options in terms of life goals and priorities besides marrying and forming a family,” she explains.
These changes in social conditions have contributed to the increase in the number of singles and to the delay in marriage and births, the result of which is a reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at a drastic increase in immigration to counteract the decline in population led to resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where the scarcely concealed xenophobia against many new immigrants flourishes, especially against the Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and not integrating.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the ruling party in Singapore reached its worst election result since independence last year.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem with higher contributions and levies for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the falling birth rate has the known impact on a nation’s economic growth, tax revenues, health costs, and immigration policies, the example of Singapore also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to ensure that not so many small homes are built.
It also has an impact on the housing market.
The City Development Authority has begun to control the number of small apartments known as "shoe boxes" that may be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show a great sales success.
However, there is concern that they can promote the single lifestyle, and that they will discourage construction companies from building large homes for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, director general of real estate company EL Developers, says that his “shoe boxes” can be sold much faster than larger housing units.
They are so popular, and the units are sold out by days and even weeks faster than the larger housing units.
This means that they are much better for our cash flow.
However, he admits that the new norms provide clearer orientations to developers who were previously obstructed by building too many small housing units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
Even if these new rules could pave the way for an increase in the national birth rate, the conversations with Singaporeans working in the financial district show that they will not have a great impact.
"People are very stressed, housing and education are expensive, which is why it is postponed by many," says a young manager.
The kids can have others.
"It's important for me to have my own money and time," says another man, about twenty years old.
Men and women cite their careers, the stress and the cost of ownership and education as reasons why they cannot have children.
That’s why the Singaporeans have the last word when it comes to having children – there’s so much the government can do.
The offline Private offline is online private
Privacy policy
According to the dictionary, it is the property private or "that area of private life where one is entitled to protection from any kind of interference".
What is private for someone under the age of 16?
How is this definition applied to his everyday life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he faces if he announces on the internet situations he wouldn’t share in real life?
El Periódico interviewed five young people between the ages of 10 and 15 who are frequently on the web.
In four of the cases, they linked the term to “something very personal” on a personal level and “to the password and the user” when they applied it to the social networks.
“I wouldn’t reveal my deepest secrets in a post,” says 10-year-old Jorge when trying to explain the meaning of “private” in websites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail, and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"These are very confidential secrets, my mother is allowed to know them, but not the whole world," he confirms.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures of games.
I also spend my time with acquaintances.
“I wouldn’t share a photo that isn’t of me or of someone who makes the fool,” he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to post obscene photos, of naked people, of crimes, or to write offensive or violent comments.
Jorge assures to know 35 friends he has on FB and nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Including the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I signed up on Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if anyone answers me, I'm just uploading them," he adds.
"The social networks are entertaining, I can quickly talk to relatives in the distance or with friends," he says.
Asked, he answers that he would never accept an invitation from an unknown.
Even if someone recommended a stranger to him, he would ignore it.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask, he admits not knowing 20 of the people he added to his friends list.
"That doesn't scare me because we have something in common, like music," he says.
According to the boy, no one gave him any hints or asked him for his address or phone number.
"If someone harasses me or demands it from me, I will simply remove him from my user account," he admits.
José contacted Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is not unknown experiences that are known today as cyberbullying.
A friend’s friend was blackmailed on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was," he assured me.
According to José, the victim did not close the user account.
“He just made it private.”
After that, he explains a number of steps to securely configure a user account.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yeah, I'd do that if he's unsympathetic to me or I want to wipe him out.
“But I know this is cyberbullying,” he explains.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, teacher of English with a university degree in education and learning, believes that in order to orient the children and young people, it must be understood that it is the purpose of social networks to inform.
"The Internet was created as a medium for searching for information, but with the advent of these sites, the rules of the game have changed," she says.
Porras explains that the academic Marc Prensky, holder of a master's degree in pedagogy at Yale University and author of the work "Digital Natives and Immigrants" shaped these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The Digital Natives are the children and young people who have grown up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who are supposed to teach them, while we are still learning ourselves," he says.
He explains that this is a complex issue “because we require them to have a defined criterion of what can be disseminated, published or said, and this at an age where maturity is not sufficient.”
“They should also be selective when it’s most important to them to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,” he adds.
According to the professional, the most effective way to teach children and adolescents what privacy is is to ask them questions that make them think.
“Talking them not to do it doesn’t work,” he says.
Porras then mentions a few possibilities: there are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger, so why do you do it on the internet?
Or: Would you like to be posted a photo of you, like the one you posted from a friend?
Do you know what others are publishing about you?
Have you asked the other people for permission before when you labeled photos of celebrations?
And one more question: Does everyone need to know what you are doing at every moment?
Another point is to give them understanding that they need to trade online as they do offline.
They are the same rules.
"Anyone outside the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must apply to social networks," he explains.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, elementary school teacher and educational advisor, commented that it is essential that parents carefully read the guidelines of social networks.
When they understand all the sections, they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the importance of opening one user account on the Internet.
"For example, the age, or what you are allowed to share or publish," he explains.
According to Guardia, children need to be reminded of the lesson "You shall not speak to strangers".
Closing of the Unasur Summit without publication of the Lima Declaration
The 6th Summit of Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) ended today in Peru without the publication of the Lima Declaration, which was previously announced and theoretically to be signed by the seven governments present.
Efe repeatedly tried to gain access to the signed document at the VI Ordinary Session of the Heads of State and Government of Unasur. Sources in the Chancellery initially announced that they would hand it over after the clausur, but then stated that it would be published at some point on the Peruvian government’s website.
When asked about the text, they stated that the content was presented to the press by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, in brief statements.
The access of journalists to information about the summit was limited at all times.
During the day, only the picture of the presidential meeting without sound was transmitted in the press room with the message "private session, limited audio".
The few information circulating among the journalists was received from the press spokesmen of some of the Unasur governments present at the meeting, but not from the Peruvian press spokesman.
The only document circulated during the day was the list of participating presidents, which caused discomfort among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media outlets demanding more information.
After that, the Peruvian presidential office sent an e-mail to the media with the “declaration” of the summit, but it was the Humala Declaration and not the official document to conclude the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third Summit of South America-Arab States (ASPA), and again on this occasion, despite the press' insistent request, the so-called Declaration of Lima, which had been previously announced, was not published either.
On the official website of the ASPA, you can be sure that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities stressed the existence of information systems for journalists, but they severely restricted access to information.
The summit also ended with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment of the Court of The Hague that settles a border conflict between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would accept the decision of the ICC, which begins on Monday in The Hague, in the process that Lima initiated against Santiago to hear the pleadings of both sides.
"We will follow and execute the judgment on the differences we are presently bringing before this International Court of Justice," Humala said, along with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has been, is and will continue to be a country that adheres to international law, seeks peaceful solutions to disputes, makes agreements and submits to international courts," Piñera added, greeting Humala with a handshake in front of the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents that they would submit to the ICC came after Colombia, following a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which it considered a serious mistake, filed a lawsuit against the Bogotá Agreement, in which it agreed to submit to the judgments of this International Court of Justice.
At the summit were the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, which has been excluded from Unasur since 2011 after the removal of its President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
Host President Ollanta Humala opened the talks in the morning and concluded the summit meeting shortly after lunch in Lima.
The head of state read the final document, stating that 16 decisions were taken and the lines of action for 31 projects between South American countries were set for a total investment amount of $17 billion.
Regarding the decisions taken, he said Unasur's countries will "take significant steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, for which we are expanding the decisions on residency rights."
He said that measures would be pushed forward to “enhance cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and organised, transnational crime, as well as measures to improve access to medicines and the Internet at low prices in all areas of South America and to act together and efficiently in the event of natural disasters.”
With the crisis in Europe, "economic consolidation (in Latin America) must not take on triumphant features, but should serve to expand our output and show our peoples a better future," Humala added.
"We have decided to give priority to a series of 31 emblematic projects aimed at improving spatial connections in South America and especially in rural and border areas... thus unifying our countries and opening up new economic forms," the Peruvian president said in a read-out statement.
Among these projects were five Peruvian, which were located on the transverse axis of its territory from the coast to Brazil, and two of which were intended to provide a better connection with Ecuador, although he did not give any further details.
The final document also referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the election process in this country serves for its resumption into the Union of South American nations," from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to continue to be an integrated region for prosperity and peace and with good neighbourly relations was another aspect highlighted at the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before starting his participation in the regional meeting that he expected a meeting on Saturday in Mexico with his counterpart from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, to treat the maritime conflict with respect after a judgment of the ICC questioned by Bogotá.
"I may meet with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow," Santos said.
"We will review all these paths - they are not exclusive, and the agreement with Nicaragua also makes talks with Nicaragua necessary," he stressed.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we will treat this matter as civilized and respectful as possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they intend to be present at the inauguration of the new president of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
As part of the summit, the defence ministers of the bloc also met in advance to adopt the action plan for 2013, in which dialogue and consensus on the defence of the region should be strengthened.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, although the latter country is currently excluded.
Peru holds the presidency for the time of the regional bloc.
"South America needs to learn from the integration of its citizens," says Rafael Correa
The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal where “South America can actually learn something from Europe.”
Correa, who attended the 6th summit of the presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) held in Lima, told state television in Peru that the Europeans "murdered in World War II and in other clashes" and "today are practically a fatherland."
In this sense, he defended the project of creating a South American citizenship that promotes the member states of Unasur.
"The free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries must be achieved, as is already the case in the Andean community; however, there are still reactionary sectors that aspire to a return to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador also advocated the redesign of the Organization of American States (OEA) with the goal of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who signed the San José Convention on Human Rights.
Those who teach never commit to anything, and in return, we South Americans always sign everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is based in Washington and funded by the United States," he said, referring to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he did not regret this decision because it did not betray his principles, but had complied with his "deep democratic values and views on human rights."
He added that there had been “reasonable assumptions at the time that Assange would be extradited to a third country and his proceedings would not be met.”
He also criticized the Swedish judiciary, which demanded that he be questioned on his territory for an alleged sexual offence, while "the Swedish jurisdiction allowed this by means of a video conference that could have been conducted via the Ecuadorian embassy in London."
Correa stated that there was a risk that Assange’s health and mental condition would be impaired.
“Since he’s in our embassy, I haven’t spoken to him, but the ambassador has informed me that he has a slight problem with his lungs, but not a serious one,” Ecuador’s head of state said.
However, there is a risk that he would suffer physical and psychological damage because he was trapped in a narrow space and could not perform physical exercises outdoors.
"This would affect the health of every person," he added.
Correa stated that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London was to grant him a free letter to travel to Ecuador, and that this was in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe. He underlined that there had been talks with London to find a solution for the imprisoned founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not deal with human rights, we do not use this word in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
“The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe because Assange’s lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, is leading a series of proceedings at different European instances,” he said.
And "if Britain grants this leave tomorrow, I think it's done."
And if Sweden questioned Mr. Assange at Ecuador’s embassy in London or via Skype, as Swedish law permits and in other cases, the problem is solved.
Correa took the opportunity to confirm himself as a defender of freedom of the press, saying that what he does not tolerate are "the mediocrity, the evil intent and the lie that invalidate freedom of expression."
“The biggest enemies of freedom of the press are not the evil and perverse politicians, but bad journalists who seek and blackmail for profit,” he said.
In this sense, he congratulated Ecuador no longer being ruled by such journalists "nor by the bankers or hegemonic and petty-bourgeois countries," and anticipated that in a re-election, he will "approach the revolution in order to continue the path in this right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in Unasur at least until his next elections, arguing that the organism "must remain harsh and must not tolerate opportunism and no legally disguised coup d'état" because "the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay has been destroyed."
The President of Ecuador also considers the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the ruling of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which favoured the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime borders between the two countries, "absolutely justified."
At present, this judgment is not being implemented.
It is a problem between a South and a Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
They need to be treated comprehensively so that you can overcome them and look forward.
Similarly, he relied on a good conclusion of the disputes over the maritime borders between Peru and Chile before the same court, saying that "it is right for Latin America to call international bodies if both countries commit to accept the verdict, even if it is very harsh."
Regarding the possibility of him running for the next presidential election in Ecuador to achieve his third consecutive mandate, he stated that he sees this possibility "with a lot of optimism and joy, although sometimes it is also very difficult."
Correa assured that if he lost the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life.
I personally have never been interested in power, but under as unjust circumstances as in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement believed that it was I who guaranteed this probable victory, so I have to take this responsibility," he said.
If I were to win, it would be my last term as president, after which I would withdraw from public life.
This also applies if we lose.
"That's decided," he said.
Correa also referred to the treatment of the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I have just spoken with the Vice-President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, who told me that he had traveled there for a planned routine treatment and that he was expected to be able to return to Cuba after the election campaign.
"It does not in any case mean a relapse in President Chávez's health," he said.
The Ecuadorian Head of State participated today in Lima at the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which ended with a call for greater regional integration to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
Cause of death due to AIDS is now a late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed to be HIV-positive.
"It was like a bomb hitting," he says about the moment he was diagnosed, which the doctor "tried to mitigate without noticeable success."
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to learn about it; and this with such commitment that he was just celebrating his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he came after several fights in 1994.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was hard to imagine in the early 1990s when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigmas.
At the time, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye “because it led to a dead end.”
AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome even with quality of life.
However, many people still come to the clinic who are unaware of their disease and in whom the virus has already done harm and exhausted their immune system, and are the victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, i.e. after the first reported cases, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient who starts treatment on time, and the survival of the general population are exactly the same," explained the head of the HIV unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, saying that this information was viewed scientifically in April of this year.
Andrade Villanueva, a specialist in infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, commented that since 2008, the scientists concluded that AIDS was not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and quality of life depended on the degree of impairment of the immune system of the people at the start of treatment, and that those who are not CD-dependent at 500 years had a higher chance of CD-dependent at 50 years.
Simply put, the above statements mean that anyone who is diagnosed with HIV-positive at the age of 25 can, in this sense, "become 75 years old without problems as long as he is under control," this expert explained.
In order to correctly classify this progress, it must be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is on average 76 years.
Even though mortality has decreased significantly in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has decreased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (annual report of ONUSIDA), it is still true that 60 percent of the patients recorded in the national database have died since the appearance of AIDS.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011 and as of May this year, there are already 187 deaths; however, it is assured that since 2005 there has been universal access to antiretroviral drugs.
So why do people still die from it?
In my opinion, the problem is not access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and so is in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years, we have not had any medical care problems, the problem is that people are in a well-advanced state because they do not know their state of infection, i.e. in very late stages of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: "Nine out of ten patients come to us if they already have a concomitant infection. In order to influence global mortality, early diagnosis is needed, which is why all people who need it must be offered massive detection tests."
The experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) even agree with this proposal, and also the patients like Fabrizio, who had had his test done at a private lab, and this for the only reason that it had made a friend of him who, despite his young age, was already in the AIDS-community.
Everything is different when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they'll die, and don't want to hear anything.
"If I have to die, I'd rather burst three times," they say in my case.
The change was to improve, I eat well, do sports and take the medication.
Today, his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, just like everyone else.
"I work, do a lot, have an active but responsible sex life, I pay attention to my health and that of the other person," records Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO to animate with his testimony those who are scared today in the context of the global AIDS day.
They should take the test if they belong to the risk group. The sooner they know if they are HIV-positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live responsibly like all people.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There are big holes between the health programs and the ordinary citizen, explains Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has taken care of the cause of HIV.
The most important thing is prevention.
In the designated places, "the distribution of condoms was actually increased; formerly they were handed over individually, now they are giving us packages of a hundred pieces, which is already good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom," he said.
Among those at risk for new infections are young people.
"Why do you need them?" is a widespread mockery question from social workers, orientation staff in schools, employees in pharmacies and in the health system who do not want to expose young people, the correspondent assured.
He suggested reorienting this inefficient distribution; the condoms should be located not only behind the counter, but in outlets in public toilets of facilities that are often visited by young people.
Promiscuity should not be encouraged.
They should not be paid the beer and motel, as Governor Emilio González replied to the question of whether conservatives would be distributed under his administration.
"Sexuality doesn't look like that; it's best to bring the condoms closer to those who already engage in sexual activity," he said.
Key data of Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state ranks 4th in terms of new and cumulative AIDS cases, and 13th in terms of HIV.
92% of cases of infection occur via sexual intercourse, 6% via blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV because there are 4 or 5 people for each registered case who do not know it.
After the United States Court of Appeal has confirmed a ruling that does not recognize the restructuring of the liabilities of the Vitro Group, which has been achieved through a trade bankruptcy in Mexico, an ominous precedent is created for any national company with branches in the neighboring country that has payment problems.
So one could say that the procedures for the survival of companies that allow Mexican laws are not valid in the land of stars and stripes contrary to international agreements.
In practice, the recognition of the verdict by Judge Harlin Hale on June 15 at the Bancarrotas Court for the Northern District of Texas results in Mexican companies being left helplessly exposed to the seizure of their property across the Bravo River.
However, the decision opens the door to the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico to appeal to the United States Supreme Court for three inconsistencies.
While the judge of the case points out that creditors must be subject to U.S. bankruptcy law, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, based in New Orleans, first says that the main case is the commercial bankruptcy dealt with in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in insolvency proceedings of companies with a cross-border profile is unknown.
In fact, for this purpose, the United Nations Model Law for the Unification of International Commercial Law was created, using the American Law Institute as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment determines that without the votes of the companies, after recognition of the liabilities in the bankruptcy mass held by Vitro’s branches with their parent company, the necessary majority would not have been reached for the restructuring of the liabilities.
However, this possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case in which this scheme has been approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities among companies of the group have been confirmed by the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles.
It is also true that, after deduction of the votes of the branches, the creditors of Vitro, the creditors who sued Vitro in the United States courts, i.e. the vulture funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, had not obtained a majority.
The vote would have been 45% against 37%.
This is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, there is vitriol blame for its difficult situation from 2008 onwards in the context of the great economic crisis in the United States that gave the country blows.
For this reason, the González Sada family filed a complaint before the same Court of Appeal so that the vote would take place in the plenary, i.e. of all the judges, because only three of them voted.
If this is not granted, the Cerciorare appeal is filed, which demands the review of the proceedings by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States.
The most serious thing about this case is that the court left aside a document sent by the government of Mexico under the figura amicus curiae (friend of the court), describing the procedure carried out by Vitro under the Commercial Insolvency Act, and pointing out that it had strictly complied with the United States Agreements signed by both countries in order to comply with Chapter 15 of the United States Act.
It also points out that the country has been subject to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the established rules for cases of cross-border insolvency that guarantee the equality of debtors and creditors.
Two-band carambole: a hit for Vitro and for the country.
General balance sheet
After several months of non-compliance with the charges brought by the Mexican air traffic unions against the former owner Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, accused of fraudulent administration, the Asociación Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores has finally made progress.
The petition led by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has now filed a criminal case against the National Banking and Securities Commission, accused of obstruction of justice.
Subsequently, the supervisory authority systematically refused to inform the central administration of the Republic of a transaction carried out by the entrepreneur in order to withdraw 198 million pesos from the fiduciary account F/589 of Bank IXE under the name Mexicana de Aviación.
These funds were used to purchase shares of the Administradora Profesional de Hoteles (professional hotel management).
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Dragon Mart is Surrounded
At a weekend meeting at a forum of the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of civil society decided to create a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we are talking about a huge sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country beyond the wall, supplemented by a living area for the employees of 150 companies.
In advance, the Canacintra (the national chamber of manufacturing industry) has managed to unite the governors in the southeast to oppose the monumental establishment, which partly destroyed protected areas and represents the mother of all threats to industry.
ACTA is dead
Because the government has not complied with a Senate request to explain under what conditions and circumstances the Mexican ambassador in Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement known as ACTA, the matter has already been filed according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property.
As you know, these measures were taken even though the Senate had disregarded the possibility because it viewed them as a violation of freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex long term
In the pursuit of paying long-term liabilities without affecting short-term liabilities, the construction company Homex is launching stock exchange certificates over 500 million pesos.
The issue is the first of four equal issues that promise an interest payment every 28 days.
Establishment of Competitive
Formed from the companies NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet, leading information technology companies, a group of companies was founded under the name Competitive, whose objective is the service market of software clusters in Central and South America.
The corresponding investment amounts to over $1.5 billion.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
Basketball world brawler Héctor "Hetin" Reyes has been involved in basketball for more than 60 years and has travelled the world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a large spiritual collection of the country's history of basketball as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before being bound to the wheelchair by a stroke in 2008, Rexes was part of this sport for 6 years, be it as a lower-class player, player of the first national league, proxy and leader in the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or president of the Basketball Association.
"All my life I have put on many hats in basketball, even several at the same time, when I was president of the BSN, chief executive of the national team and president of the association in the 1990s," Reyes recalled during a visit to Primera Hora at his home in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
Basketball was my life.
Reyes does not exaggerate with this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with photos and memories of his long career and testify to them.
Bayamón in the Heart
The most emotional memories are those that remind him of his time at the Vaqueros from the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when he celebrated his 15th anniversary as co-CEO or CEO of the club.
"These were my best years that I enjoyed the most because I was allowed to be part of eight championships of the Vaqueros since 1967, be it as managing director, co-director or coach.
There were many fulfilling years, including the five consecutive championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to a championship in 1981, the year of Jerome Mincy’s debut at BSN.
From then on, "Cuco" took over Ortiz, who was a very good administrator," Reyes says.
I remember Gene Bartow, who worked as a coach here and was employed at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), saying to me, "I have a very strong and 2 m tall player.
Do you want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended the free throw specialist Raymond Gausse, who allowed himself to be naturalized and was one of our best throwers.
I remember how he said that if Mincy had made a championship possible for Bayamon, Gausse would have made another one.
The championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse was awarded to him, but already from a distance, because he was already at the top of the association in 1988.
At that time, he preferred to enjoy his executions and those of Mincy in the national team.
I remember the first time we won against the United States at the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, in which we took fourth place, which should have been bronze, if it had not been for this Canadian referee who allowed us to repeat the last turn for the second time, Reyes said.
Was this group of the 1990 World Cup the best national team you've ever seen?
She is one of the best, as well as those who won the 2004 Olympics against the Dream Team.
But my favorite is the team of the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba, where we won gold and offered the team of the USA a fight, as they did when they won bronze against us at the World Cup.
The team included not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be there in 1990 due to a knee injury.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of personalities, but with which we won a gold medal and which gave us great joy, was that of the 1995 pre-Olympic tournament in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a substitute for the suspended players due to the events at the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against any prediction.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
This was undoubtedly Piculín Ortiz.
His numbers at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated as much at this level as Piculín.
And this without considering his career in the various leagues in which he has played.
Who was the best coach in Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult question.
We had a number of good coaches like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I like the work of Leo Arill.
What do you think is the best thing you've achieved in the association?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN at the beginning of the 1990s up to 17 teams in a season.
What else do you have to do?
There are things I would have introduced, such as the regionalization of the lower categories.
For example, the boys in Ponce only play in their area and only meet teams from other corners of the island in the national playoffs.
Today, the children make unnecessarily many trips and games.
At least I see the result of the prescribed training and courses for coaches, table officials and referees.
I'm proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I like to listen to music, watch videos of music of my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to a basketball game.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always at my side.
Larry Hagman has died.
Larry Hagman was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth, Texas, and became famous worldwide with his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the television series "Dallas", where he played an unscrupulous, insidious and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday afternoon due to cancer complications according to a family press release to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role he liked the most," the family said.
Larry’s family and close friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving celebrations.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original and follow-up series, was with Hagman when he died in Dallas hospital, her publicist Jeffrey Lane said.
He gave joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived life to the fullest," Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992, and he admitted that he had been drinking a lot for years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was detected in his liver, and he underwent a transplant.
In the years before "Dallas", Hagman became known on television as a nice guy in 1965-1970 with NBC's sitcom "Enchanting Jeannie".
There he played astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is turned upside down when he meets an attractive "Djinn" (played by Barbara Eden) who will live at his home.
He also starred in two comedies that were broadcast for a short time, such as "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His film work included critically acclaimed roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of enchantingly disgusting J.R. that made Hagman a superstar.
The dramatic series on the Ewing clan and other characters around it was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The commercial saying "Who shot J.R.?", which was supposed to create expectation for an episode full of emotions where the character of Hagmann was almost killed, led to international speculation, and millions of dollars were wagered in betting houses.
The series reached a spectator record at that time.
When the answer became known in one chapter in November 1990, it was seen by an average of 41 million viewers who turned "Dallas" into the second most-watched entertainment program since the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was Kristin, the sister-in-law of J.R. (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who had shot.
J.R. had conceived her and threatened to portray her as a prostitute if she did not leave the city, but others also had reasons to want to see him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of Ewing as a corrupt, insatiable man with a charismatic smile: a treacherous businessman and unfaithful husband who aspired to have his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), admitted.
"I know what should be on J.R.'s tombstone," Hagman said in 1988.
It should be said, "Here rests the honorable citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only business he didn’t win.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as an "enormous personality on and off the screen."
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of devotees in the world and remains in our hearts for those of us who were lucky enough to know and love it.
Ten episodes of the new issue of "Dallas" were broadcast with great success on TNT television a few months ago.
The recording of five chapters for the second season was completed, and a sixth chapter was just being shot, the broadcaster informed.
There was no immediate explanation from Warner or TNT about how the loss of Hagmann would be dealt with in the series.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who played classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she got Larry during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the theater stages in New York in the early 1950s, after which he served in the air forces in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met the young designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't write anything that I believed could harm someone or affect them in any way," he told the Associated Press at the time.
After the liver transplant, he campaigned for liver donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to help anxious patients.
"I advise them, give them courage, I meet with them when their operations are imminent and afterwards," he explained in 1996.
I want to give them some comfort, such as "don't worry, it's a little uncomfortable the first time, but you'll be fine".
He also fought against smoking and participated in several campaigns.
Beginning of the course studying the "end of the world"
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
Each semester, when the religious professor decided to hold a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible fishing hook: the end of the Mayan calendar’s “long backcounting” on December 21, which many people believed meant the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what to expect in the next two months: the destructive hurricane Sandy, which some have called “Deudarmaggedon,” as well as a growing conflict involving Israel, the place Christian theorists believe the apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester ever," Charmé told students at the University of Rutgers-Camden, New Jersey, this week.
If someone were to analyze what happened in the world today, as if we were thirty days away, this would be a really good period.
And he reminds us that the bad is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he’s not the only professor to offer courses on the “end of the world” this semester, which should actually be the last in history.
In Temple, Professor Barry Vacker gives the course “Media, Culture and the End of the World.”
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
"We're analyzing why these ideas spread over time," he said, as well as the way hypothetical scenarios are offered that lead to a particular human behavior.
For example, if nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, a war could break out.
This month, students analyzed films with apocalyptic content and examined how they compare to real life.
"I have tried to inform students about what is possible, likely, credible, and impossible," said Vacker.
On the University of Pennsylvania’s main campus, Professor of Latin American History Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an associate professor of art history and anthropology, have formed a team to offer a course simply called “The End of the World.”
“We’re not picking up 2012 so we always have the option of being able to hold the course again in case the world doesn’t end,” Mr. Restall said.
Despite the "impending demise", students need to study, create projects, and participate in final exams.
In Penn State, the final exam will be conducted on the eve of the apocalypse, which is why students have no choice but to “continue to work until night, where the world is supposed to end,” Restall said.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours, there were no more seats," Restall said of his course for high-average students, which filled with 35 students.
Weeks before the start of the semester, we received emails from students asking if there were still places available.
Students, for their part, assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
“It’s fascinating to see what people are doing to comfort themselves,” said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student at Rutgers-Camden for Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sect or religious mentality is actually only a matter of comfort or its lack.
The 25-year-old student Will Wekesa of Psychology and Nursing explains that he has seen all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of a class where this is taught," he said.
I'm enjoying it.
But none of the students surveyed—and less so a professor—declared to believe in the last date of December 21.
"Our first project dealt with the prophecies of the Mayas, and in a certain way we discredit them," said Julie Zeglen, a student last year in Temple, aged 21, and from West Chester.
The Mayas never predicted the end of the world; it’s just a key point in the calendar, said Restall.
However, he notes that there is an apocalyptic fear in Western society that goes back several centuries as people reacted to changes in their environment with the prediction of the end of the world.
The internet has increased this speculation.
“People don’t think so elsewhere,” he says.
This is mainly the case in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who teaches in the Philippines this year, responds quickly to the question whether he would know a course on the "end of the world" there.
"The Philippines are not participating at the end of the world," he wrote as an indication of an exception from a higher instance.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that over the years many days have been spoken of the last court, saying that if nothing happens on December 21, "people immediately think of a new date" or philosophize that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the end of the world would come.
Students and professors take this date lightly.
Several said they want to go to celebrations about “the end of the world.”
“Maybe I’ll call a few friends so we can laugh together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communication student.
