She has taken on too much work.
She's stubborn.
Give Tom a hand.
You wouldn't like Tom.
Does Tom know how you feel about him?
Tom wondered if what Mary said was true.
We never get along.
It is unclear if the letter ever came out or not.
We haven't done anything.
You dropped your pen.
You're gonna be in bed all day, aren't you?
Tom can't do that.
Tom crawled under barbed wire.
I didn't even know her name.
Are you really going to do that?

I don't even want you here.
I like to go to new places and see new things.
I have to sit down.
Aren't we friends?

What was your plan, really?
Tom seems bored.
He's not angry.
There is no doubt about who will be elected.
He got hurt.
Maybe I should find a new job or an interesting hobby to keep myself motivated.
It's weird.
Have you read The Lord of the Rings trilogy?
I'm a man now.
Greek is not an easy language.
Thank you for taking care of my dog.
She advocated equality.
What are you looking at?

This book belongs to the school library.
None of it was real.
There must be a pattern.

Tom fooled me.
Tom is helping.
One morning he saw a cute girl.
This tree is not even close to being the tallest in the sock.
Let me take a look.
Tom wants our help.
Time's up, I need you to submit your papers.
My father is healthy.
We can save many lives.
If you don't have money, you can do without it.
I'm afraid to go home.
Just say it.

Put the cake on the table.
I know you're mad.
Do you need anything?
I want a pair of gloves.
That's exactly what I needed.
I am from Brazil.
I'm already late.
Even my mom knows about it.
He should have done it already.
Room service, please.
Who were you talking to?
The boy grabbed the cat's tail.
How do you know that?
I got a lot of mosquito bites.
I'm unemployed.
This medicine will cure your cold.
Does this remind you of someone?
I'd like to talk to Tom between four eyes.
He will fall into temptation.
The TV does not work.
I can explain that.
She behaves like a child.
What does it look like?
Mary thinks she has superpowers.
I know all this.
Everyone needs to know.
After stopping, the train accelerated quickly.
What did that mean?
Who do you want to talk to?
No one has asked you to agree, but can you at least accept that there are people who have different opinions than you?
Tom dropped the book.
I'm the best.
English is hard, isn’t it?
I can go to school in 10 minutes.
Are you done now?
She couldn’t imagine seeing him again.
Even during working hours, I secretly give in to my internet addiction.
I never thought it would be so difficult to create an iPad app.
You weren't away for long.
Both Magdalena and Ania are from Poland.
I can't get down to town.
At least it wasn't boring.
Can you freeze it?
Tom blinked with the high beam.
Are you threatening me?
Tom is worried.
I used to like coming here.
This is not a fish.
Tom and Mary may not have done what everyone says they did.
There's no one here named like that.
It's time to go.
All three men smiled.
Come on, sit down.
That's gotta be enough.
Tom made his parents happy.
Tom needs me.
My chainsaw is broken.
You think she's pretty, don't you?
He lived a simple life.
This is gonna take years.
I misspelled the word.
I don't like this book.
An octopus has ten arms.
She didn't come until two.
I am.
That was very good.
Come and talk to me.
He took care of the baby.
Leave me alone!
I had never seen such a peaceful view.
Tom is fast.

Unfortunately, Tom made his way.
What is the difference between American and British English?
I'll read the book.
I made the wedding cake.
Use a scalpel, not an axe.
Could you write down the link to that site?
She attached a photo.
The walls of the old house were not straight.
Where is she?
It feels really good.
Why do you like it?
What would you say if you were in this situation?
Give me three weeks.
The driver turned the steering wheel to the right.
I'm in the attic.
He said he didn’t eat meat.

We have to find it.
What's missing?
I can do it myself!
Don't worry. Don't worry.
She paid 7% interest on the loan.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to fire you.
Can I think about it?
When did you see Tom?
That's not important!
Strange things happened on her birthday.
Does anyone here speak Russian?
I drove the car.
I have some great news.
Are we safe yet?
We tried to contact the other ship.
You're gonna die soon.
This one's not good.
I think you're right.
Monday starts on Sunday.
It's really not worth the effort.
"How old are you?" "I'm sixteen."
I have a bladder of steel.
Have you heard from Tom?
We visited historically interesting places.
We're gonna eat steak tonight.
Tickets are only valid for two days, including the day they were purchased.
